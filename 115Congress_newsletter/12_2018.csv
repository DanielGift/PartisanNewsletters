12/31/18 19:59,Notes from the Ninth: December in Photos,"￼ 


Hoosiers,

As 2018 comes to a close, I want to thank each and every one of you. It is my honor and privilege to represent you and all of Indiana's 9th District. As we head into a new Congress, hearing your thoughts and feedback, whether it's over the phone, in person, or via email, is essential to fighting for our future together. 

To stay updated on the work I'm doing in Indiana on your behalf and to share your priorities for the 116th Congress, be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. I look forward to connecting with you.

Happy New Year from my family to yours!

Be of good cheer,
￼


 Hearing from Hoosiers
 
￼
Southern Indiana Red Cross. At the beginning of December, we celebrated the opening of Southern Indiana American Red Cross's new location in Jeffersonville. Their new location will increase accessibility and efficiency of their programs, including disaster training, CPR/first aid classes, and pet therapy program (pictured here!)

￼
Thanking those who served. We have so much to celebrate during the holiday season, including our local veterans and all they have given this country. We had a great event in Harrison County, spending time with veterans, Floyd Central ROTC, Harrison VSO, and the Harrison County Veterans Association to hear stories of service.

￼
Pvt. Harry Wolfe. At 98 years old, Pvt. Harry Wolfe fills his retirement home and all those around him with laughter, cheer, and a contagious positive energy. Just last month, Pvt. Wolfe of Franklin was presented with the Legion of Honor, France's highest tribute, for his participation in the liberation of France during World War II. I was honored to spend a few minutes with him and hear his stories of service that he shares with true patriotism and joy. Thank you, Pvt. Wolfe.

 Honoring Sgt. Bertram
 
￼
Every morning, our heroes in law enforcement wake up and kiss their loved ones goodbye knowing there is always a chance they may not return. This month in Charlestown, one of those heroes, Sgt. Ben Bertram of the Charlestown Police Department, did not return home. It is with deep sorrow that our community mourns this loss. We thank you Sgt. Bertram. Rest Easy. 

 Legislation: Farm Bill, Tax Cuts, Government Funding
Farm Bill

Agriculture is an important part of our state's history - and our future. Throughout Indiana's Ninth Congressional District, farmers, whether their specialty is corn, soybeans, hogs, sheep, or dairy, have consistently highlighted how important it is that Congress passes a strong Farm Bill. 

Hoosier farmers have made it clear that passing a Farm Bill will help us stabilize and sustain a strong agriculture economy and support workforce development for future farmers, so we can support Hoosier farms for generations to come. On December 20, President Trump signed our 2018 Farm Bill legislation into law. 

Permanent Tax Cuts

This month, the House passed additional tax legislation that includes important tax credit extensions which small businesses across the country rely on, disaster relief tax credits, and updates to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to ensure it is working for the American taxpayer, not the other way around. 

Government Funding

On Thursday, December 20, I voted YES on the government funding bill which included $5 billion for the border wall. Bottom line: Hoosiers have consistently demanded a secure southern border to keep our neighborhoods, and our nation, safe. Now that the House has come to an agreement, I hope the Senate will pass our bill and send it to the President's desk for signature, ensuring stability and a fully-funded American government. 

While the federal government is currently partially shutdown, my office is still here to help you. Please call my office if you need help with casework or would like to share comments or concerns. 

 2018: A Year in Review

I want to serve Hoosiers in any way I can, whether that's helping you work with a federal agency, meeting with you to hear your thoughts and concerns, talking to you on the phone to answer your questions on legislation, or sponsoring legislation that will help Hoosier families and businesses. Check out a few numbers from 2018:

Kansas Common Sense  December 31, 2018
Hello,
 
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
Robba and I hope that you were able to spend quality time with loved ones during these holiday celebrations. The New Year brings us many new opportunities, and I’m looking forward to serving Kansans in 2019. We wish you a happy New Year! 
2018: By the Numbers Here is a quick look – by the numbers – of some of my and my office’s work in 2018. Throughout the year, I had the opportunity to listen to and hear from thousands of Kansans across the state, and I took your thoughts, advice and insight back to Washington each week. Thank you all for being so engaged this year. 
In addition, one of the most important things my office can do for Kansans is help you with casework and with maneuvering federal agencies. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to my office if we can be of any assistance regarding Social Security, Medicare or veterans’ affairs, or if you have other concerns regarding federal issues. We are always here to help in both our Kansas and Washington, D.C. offices.  
 ￼ 
Ensuring Kansas Students Have the Opportunity to be Our Nation’s Future Astronauts I penned an op-ed to the Wichita Eagle this week on the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 8 Mission, which sent humans around the moon for the very first time. 
Following NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and NASA Astronaut Don Pettit’s visit to Wichita in early this month, I reiterated my commitment to helping make certain NASA continues to inspire our future innovators and has the tools it needs to recruit and retain top talent. Through my role as an appropriator, I will continue prioritizing and providing resources for forward-thinking and sensible programs to help young people in Kansas connect with NASA. 
I am doing all that I can in Congress to help today’s students prepare for the jobs of tomorrow – jobs that may just land on Mars. Click here to read my op-ed in the Wichita Eagle. 
Highlights from My 13th Kansas Conservation Tour In November, I hosted stakeholders from across the state in Southeast Kansas to discuss land and water conservation practices, and to hear firsthand from conservationists and producers on their own methods. This year marked the 13th Kansas Conservation Tour I’ve hosted, and these Conservation Tours always help inform the work I’m doing in Washington, D.C. Our Kansas farmers and ranchers care deeply about leaving their land better off than they found it. See highlights from the day and hear more about the work being done by Kansans:
 ￼ 
Visiting Cloud County On Wednesday, I was in Cloud County for a community visit in Miltonvale and to tour the Blosson Municipal Airport in Concordia. In Miltonvale, I visited with local residents, business owners and community leaders during stops at the Post Office, First National Bank, Kountry Kafe, City Hall and Twin Valley Telephone. Thanks to the many Miltonvale residents who took time to visit with me on Wednesday.
 ￼ 
Following my time in Miltonvale, I was in Concordia to tour Blosser Municipal Airport with local elected officials and community leaders. During my tour, I learned of their pending grant application with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The airport is in need of infrastructure improvements that would include a wider and longer runway to accommodate for larger aircrafts. As a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations that allocates and oversees FAA funding, I take seriously the requests of Kansans to receive back a portion of their federal tax dollars. The airport in Concordia serves local businesses and has the potential to provide emergent healthcare transportation and facilitate local economic growth. I’ll continue to work with the community and the FAA to make certain this airport serves the needs of the community and region. Thank you to those who joined in the conversation, to Judge Tom Tuggle who helped organize my visit, and to State Senator Elaine Bowers for attending.
￼ 
Listening to Constituents in Phillipsburg On Friday, I was in Phillipsburg at the Huck Boyd Community Center to visit with local residents. During our conversation, we discussed issues important to folks from across Phillips County, including the government shutdown and the effect it is having on local residents, the VA MISSION Act and veterans’ healthcare, issues surrounding ethanol, the recently-signed Farm Bill, the new USMCA trade agreement, local Head Start funding, funding opportunities for rural areas through various federal agencies, recent Congressional action to curb the opioid epidemic, Amtrak and the Southwest Chief and measures I supported in the Farm Bill that will provide rural Kansas and the ag community better resources to support mental healthcare. I also fielded a number of questions and provided an outlook on the new Congress and priorities that I’m looking forward to pursuing in the New Year. 
Thank you to the many residents, community leaders, business owners and elected officials for the productive conversation. 
 ￼ 
Visiting with Local Residents in Minneapolis On Friday, I was also in Minneapolis to visit with area residents and business owners. During my stop in Minneapolis, I was at Ottawa County Health Center, Bennington State Bank, Farm Bureau Financial Services, the Davidson Agency, the local Chamber of Commerce, American Family Insurance, Minneapolis City Hall and Ottawa County Government offices, including the County Treasurer, the Register of Deeds and the County Clerk. Thank you to the many community members who made time to visit with me on Friday. Opportunities like these will help guide my work in the upcoming Congress.
Attending Riley County Police Department Swearing-In Ceremony On Monday morning, I attended the swearing in of the new director of the Riley County Police Department, Dennis Butler. Dennis comes to Riley County  from Ottawa, Kan. where he served as the Chief of Police. He also serves on my U.S. Service Academy Board, where he helps guide my decisions on nominations to our U.S. Service Academies. I am grateful for Dennis' continued service to our state and law enforcement agencies. I look forwarding to seeing his impact on communities.
 ￼ 
Honored to Serve You in Washington It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

Very truly yours, Jerry

Issues


Dear Lindsey, 
Happy New Year! Before the holidays, Congress sent several landmark pieces of legislation to the President’s desk. One of those is the Senate companion to my bill, the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act. It will strengthen America’s global leadership in preventing, mitigating, and responding to genocide and human rights atrocities on a global scale. Earlier this year, I spoke on the House Floor about the importance of this legislation.  
￼ 
Wagner: Genocide is Preventable 
Additionally, we overhauled our criminal justice system with the First Step Act. Our incarcerated population has ballooned in the last several years, and this mass incarceration fractures families and communities, undermines our economic growth, and costs taxpayers billions of dollars. Throughout the past year, I have met with many constituents and faith groups calling for reform to our criminal justice system, and I am proud to bring this victory back home. This law will help non-violent inmates rejoin their communities through evidence-based recidivism reduction programs, and will keep our neighborhoods safe while extending a second chance to those who earn it. 
I was also the lead cosponsor of two bills to support human trafficking victims, the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act and the SOAR to Health and Wellness Act. As the lead Republican sponsor of the SOAR Act, I worked closely with Congressman Steve Cohen to better tailor services to the needs of trafficking victims and put survivors on the road to recovery. I also worked hand in hand with healthcare providers across St. Louis region who are leading the effort to assist trafficking victims in local clinics and hospitals. For the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act, I worked with Congressman Chris Smith to protect victims, prosecute traffickers, and prevent crime. I am delighted that Congress supported the most vulnerable in our community by passing both pieces of legislation. 
For more, visit my website: Wagner, Colleagues Praise Final Passage Of SOAR Act 
Unfortunately, Democrats are playing games with our safety, shutting down the government over border security, which they previously supported. House Republicans, along with President Trump, are committed to keeping America safe while never putting politics ahead of national security. As we work to resolve the government shutdown and secure our border, I will continue fighting to make our community safer and stronger. It is a privilege to serve you in Congress, and I look forward to working hard for Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District. Happy New Year! 

Sincerely,
￼  Ann Wagner Member of Congress

ADVANCING INIATIVES 
Funding the Government 
	•	Both chambers of Congress have approved, and the President has signed, five of the 12 appropriations bills for Fiscal Year 2019, which together account for approximately 75 percent of the federal budget. This year we worked hard to return to regular order in the appropriations process, voting bills out of committee and the Senate with strong bipartisan support. The Appropriations Committee did its work, which is why I’m particularly disappointed we could not reach an agreement on the bills not yet enacted before funding for many federal government programs ran out at midnight on December 21, bringing us into a partial government shutdown. Shutting down the government, even partially, is no way to govern. It is disruptive, harmful, wasteful, and impacts hundreds of thousands of federal employees and contractors and all who rely on our federal programs. I remain committed to working with my colleagues on a solution to end this partial shutdown and fund the government.
	•	Click here for details on the effects of the government shutdown and frequently asked questions.
Bolstering Safety, Security, and Infrastructure 
	•	I recently introduced legislation to increase America’s presence in the Arctic through two bills: the Arctic Policy Act (APA) and the Shipping and Environmental Arctic Leadership Act (SEAL Act). The APA takes steps to increase local and indigenous voices in federal science and policy in the Arctic. As shipping and maritime traffic in the Arctic is expected to grow, the SEAL Act establishes a corporation that will collect voluntary maritime shipping fees from vessels utilizing the region, which will fund resources and infrastructure necessary to ensure the safety, security, and management of the region.
	•	The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018, legislation to support the maintenance and repair of U.S. Coast Guard infrastructure, and improve safety among recreational boaters, was recently signed into law. Notably, this bill provides Alaskan fishermen permanent exemption of vessel discharge permitting requirements for commercial fishing vessels.
	•	A $23.1 million U.S. Department of Transportation BUILD grant was awarded to the village of Emmonak to construct a permanent dock and barge/landing craft ramp. I, alongside the Alaska Congressional Delegation, have pushed for this project because it addresses a growing demand for durable port infrastructure, including barge landing and road infrastructure in the region.
	•	Both the Senate and House passed legislation to overhaul how Congress handles sexual harassment claims. If we as members of Congress are going to change the culture of harassment nationwide, we must lead by example. I am proud of the progress we made to strengthen our own procedures to improve transparency, hold perpetrators accountable, and ensure everyone has a safe and protected workplace.
	•	The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA) was put into place to address the disproportionately high number of Native children who were ‘adopted out’ from their families. Alaska Native children that are raised with the support of their family and community in connection to their culture and heritage inevitably become stronger citizens, adults, and parents. The Senate passed a resolution I cosponsored to commemorate the 40th anniversary year for ICWA, legislation that is as vital today as it was on the day it was enacted by Congress.
Supporting Health Initiatives
	•	Legislation I introduced with Senator Baldwin of Wisconsin, the Improving Access to Maternity Care Act, was just signed into law. Our bill helps ensure women have better access to timely, quality maternity care by identifying provider shortage areas in rural and underserved communities. Improving access to maternity care will increase overall safety, reduce rates of pregnancy-related deaths, and lower healthcare costs, long-term.
	•	Recently U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas Judge Reed O’Connor ruled in favor of Texas and its partner states, deeming the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. The Texas v. Azar ruling has no immediate impact, and I am confident higher courts will review the decision. Regardless, we must preserve certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as Medicaid expansion and protections for people with pre-existing conditions that prevent insurers from arbitrarily denying coverage. I introduced legislation in August with Senate colleagues that would make certain no one loses coverage based on health status. I am committed to ensuring that all Alaskans have access to affordable, quality healthcare.
	•	In response to learning that the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) would not be including firefighters in the first-ever national per-and polyfluoralkyl substances (PFAS) study, Senator Shaheen of New Hampshire and I led a bipartisan group of Senators in a letter to the CDC and ATSDR, requesting that the agencies take additional steps to ensure that the health effects of occupational exposure to PFAS, particularly in firefighters, are sufficiently studied.
Honoring History, Culture, and the Arts
	•	I have long been an advocate for libraries and museums. I am proud the Museum and Library Services Act, legislation I introduced alongside Senator Reed, passed the Senate and House, sending it to the President to be signed into law. Our bill will help to strengthen the already amazing, diverse libraries and museums across Alaska and help them serve the changing needs of their communities in ever-more innovative ways.
	•	The Senate recently passed my resolution recognizing the heritage, culture, and contributions of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian women in the United States and how they helped shape our country. I commend my Senate colleagues for supporting this legislation to honor the influence of Indigenous women as civil rights activists, warriors, community leaders, and so much more.
	•	The Senate passed bipartisan legislation I introduced with Senators Coons and Harris to award Congressional Gold Medals, one of the highest civilian honors given by Congress, to “Hidden Figures” Dorothy Vaughan, Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dr. Christine Darden. The bill serves to commend these women, who overcame significant hurdles to attain their educational and professional goals, for their contributions to NASA’s success during the Space Race and highlight their broader impact on society; paving the way for women in STEM careers.
Fighting Burdensome Regulations 
	•	The EPA recently announced a proposed rule to revisit the burdensome Waters of the United States (WOTUS) regulation imposed by the previous administration in 2015. This new proposal will protect water quality while providing clarity on the scope of regulation and restoring balance to the state and federal relationship. This is a big deal for Alaska that should help end years of concern, frustration, and uncertainty over a costly regulation that would have halted construction projects and other economic opportunities.

Dear Friends, 
As the 115th Congress comes to an end, I thought you’d like to receive an update on some of my legislative accomplishments over the last two years, and also take a few minutes to share my priorities for the new Congress with you.  
Caltrain  
For over eight years I’ve worked to ensure that the electrification of Caltrain receives the federal funding it needs to modernize an outdated system. Caltrain is the spine of our region’s transportation system and is essential to so many. Working with the Obama and Trump Administrations, we successfully secured $847 million in federal grant funding for this Caltrain project.
The funding represents the ‘last piece’ necessary for Caltrain’s $2 billion electrification project, which by 2040 will improve daily air quality on the corridor by over 97 percent, reduce annual greenhouse gases by over 176,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent, and take 619,000 daily vehicle miles off the region’s roadways. The old diesel trains will be replaced by new cars made in America which will be faster, quieter, cleaner, and carry 110,000 more passengers daily. Caltrain is already operating well over seated capacity on rush-hour trips and this much-needed upgrade will provide relief to thousands of daily commuters on the train and the highway. 
Cotoni-Coast Dairies Land 
Following a decades-long effort to preserve one of California’s crown jewels, President Obama designated the Cotoni-Coast Dairies lands in Santa Cruz County as a National Monument in January 2017. I introduced legislation in 2015 to designate the 5,800-acre Cotoni-Coast Dairies property as a National Monument and called on the President to use his authority under the Antiquities Act to designate the land.
The President’s designation permanently protects the Cotoni-Coast Dairies lands which are located eight miles north of the City of Santa Cruz on the scenic Pacific Coast Highway. This would not have been possible without the dedicated work of environmental leaders and conservationists, thousands of local citizens, local elected officials, conservation advocates, and tribal leaders who worked very hard to secure this designation. Now these lands will remain a part of California’s coastal crown forever, allowing future generations to learn from its history and enjoy its beauty.
Agreement to Preserve and Upgrade Buena Vista Mobile Home Park 
In 2012, owners of the Buena Vista Mobile Home Park in Palo Alto gave notice to nearly 400 residents that they intended to close the park and sell the land to a developer, leaving them without a home. In June, 2016, Santa Clara County Supervisor Joe Simitian, the City of Palo Alto and the Housing Authority of the County of Santa Clara (HACSC) announced an innovative new proposal to allow the HACSC to purchase and rehabilitate the Buena Vista Mobile Home Park using $29 million in funding provided by the County and the City. Because the appraisal of Buena Vista was expected to exceed the $29 million commitment of the County and the City, I worked to secure an additional $26 million in federal funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to help pay the cost of purchasing Buena Vista and rehabilitate the park. Following our successful efforts, the HACSC and the Buena Vista Mobile Home Park reached an agreement in May 2017 to purchase Buena Vista for $40.4 million, allowing its 400 low-income residents to remain in their homes. The agreement followed months of negotiations and an extensive process by HACSC to obtain a fair market value appraisal and secure a park operator. None of this would have been possible without the superb leadership of Supervisor Joe Simitian and the work of the Housing Authority. A wonderful outcome!
Passage in the House of the Energy Efficient Government Technology Act 
In the beginning of the 115th Congress, the House unanimously passed my bipartisan legislation with Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) to increase the efficiency of federal data centers. The Energy Efficient Government Technology Act directs the Executive branch to harness information and communications technologies to improve energy efficiency and reduce energy use within the federal government. 
As the nation’s largest energy user, landowner, and employer, the federal government should lead by example to improve the energy efficiency of its technology equipment and data centers. This legislation will reduce the federal government’s energy use, save taxpayer dollars, and set the standard for the private sector. While I’m disappointed the Senate never held a vote on my bill, I will reintroduce it in the 116th Congress and I’ll do everything I can to see that this commonsense, bipartisan legislation becomes law.  
Passage of Dig Once and the RESPONSE Act in RAY BAUM’s Act 
This year the President signed into law the RAY BAUM’S Act, which reauthorizes the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). I’m especially proud to have two bills I wrote and have championed for many years included in this legislation: ‘Dig Once’ and the RESPONSE Act. Both bills are commonsense and won’t cost a dime. 
My Dig Once policy requires the Department of Transportation to establish new requirements for states using federal dollars to build new plastic pipes in the ground while roads are being built. This practice will eliminate the need to dig up recently-paved roads to expand broadband infrastructure, significantly reducing the cost of increasing Internet access to underserved communities across the country. It’s so commonsense I’ve always wondered why this policy wasn’t put into place years ago! 
The RESPONSE Act provides first responders with the precise location of a 9-1-1 caller, whether they’re on the 20th floor of a hotel or the 30th story of an office building. Every second counts during emergencies, and location technology is essential for first responders across the country to get to those in danger as quickly as possible to save lives.
Passage of the Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early (PREEMIE) Reauthorization Act  
This month the House passed my legislation to reduce infant deaths related to premature births, defined as a birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy, and it has now been sent to the President for his signature. This bipartisan, bicameral bill reauthorizes legislation I originally shepherded into law in 2006.
The bill specifically expands research, education and intervention activities aimed at preventing premature births. Every year in the U.S., ten percent of babies are born prematurely, placing them and their mothers at an increased risk of complicated health problems. Since this legislation became law in 2006, the PREEMIE Act has helped researchers and doctors identify the causes of premature births and work to prevent them. The number of preterm births decreased from 2007 to 2014, but they’ve begun to rise again. I look forward to the President signing this into law to ensure that every child has a healthy start to life. 
Passage of the Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability Act 
On November 27, 2018, bipartisan legislation sponsored by myself and Congressman Chris Smith (R-NJ) was signed into law by the President. H.R. 390, the Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability Act, requires the U.S. government to direct humanitarian aid to entities assisting displaced religious and ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria targeted for genocide by ISIS. The legislation also includes important provisions that will help the international community document the crimes against humanity that have been committed by ISIS, hold the perpetrators accountable, and help ensure that we learn from the horrors we’ve witnessed over the last six years so that another genocide can be prevented.
Constituent Outreach 
Town Hall Meetings  
In order to remain in close touch with my constituents during the weeks and months of the year, I held 14 Tele-Town Hall Meetings throughout our District, and five in-person Town Hall Meetings. Both give constituents the opportunity to ask me questions and voice their concerns. Thousands of constituents have called into our Tele-Town Hall Meetings and attended our  in-person Town Hall Meetings. I’m always inspired by my constituents’ deep sense of patriotism and I'm confident that together we can keep our country the beacon of hope and freedom it has always been. 
Mail 
In the 115th Congress, my office received over 115,000 letters, phone calls and faxes from constituents about issues they care about most. I appreciate the time constituents take to write to me, and I want you to know that I personally read and respond to every letter my constituents send to me. I’ve never put out ‘group letters’ or ‘canned mail’ and I don’t plan to. I value what my constituents say to me, and I always need your thoughts and benefit from your ideas.
---- 
As 2018 comes to a close, I’m looking forward to 2019 and a new Congress. We have much work to do to reform our ethics laws and campaign financing; ensure every president and presidential candidate releases their tax returns to the public; strengthen the Affordable Care Act; address gun violence; improve our nation’s infrastructure; fix our broken immigration system; and repeal the limit on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction created by the new tax law. 
May the New Year be filled with every blessing for you, your family, and our country. It’s an honor to represent you and I pledge to continue advancing bipartisan policies that will strengthen our democracy and invest in our people, our economy and our values. 
Warmest regards,

Friends,

As we prepare to ring in the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on 2018 and highlight some of the wins we were able to secure for District 6 and South Louisiana. In 2018, we worked hard to advance Louisiana's priorities and made progress on many of the issues most important to home -- things like the widening of I-12, I-10 and reconfiguring the Washington Street exit, changing federal law to fix Duplication of Benefits and getting full funding for Comite, West Shore and other critical flood protection projects to better protect our homes, families and businesses. 

There is much work to do in 2019 and beyond, and we will maintain our focus everyday to deliver the effective representation in Congress that you deserve. If there are any thoughts you'd like to share with me of if I can be of any assistance, please contact our office. 

I wish you and your family a Happy New Year.

Take Care,
￼
Garret Graves
Member of Congress
 
Continued Frustrations with Duplication of Benefits
￼ 

Our Duplication of Benefits fix has been SIGNED INTO LAW by the president. But federal bureaucrats are still trying to hold up your funds instead of doing their jobs. We're not going to let them get away with that and will keep fighting until checks are cut. Check out a video here for a full update on where things stand regarding Duplication of Benefits.  
Flood Protection: Coming Soon
￼ 
Some say we can't afford to invest in flood protection projects, but I think we can't afford NOT to. Earlier this year we announced that the Comite River Diversion Canal is FINALLY happening... In addition to Comite, we commemorated another big victory for South Louisiana: full funding for the West Shore Levee Project. 
With funding secured, this project - which has been ‘studied’ for decades - is now on a fast-track to completion, which means the hurricane and flood protection that residents in the River Parishes have long been promised and deserve will soon be a reality. We fought hard to deliver this win, and it is a huge accomplishment that we should all be proud of.  Let's start turning dirt! To read more click here.
Fighting for Our Coast
￼ 
Most people just don’t understand the scale, urgency or national significance of Louisiana’s coastal crisis, which is why we take every opportunity to explain it. Louisiana has lost more than 2,000 square miles of our coast... Why doesn't the national government let us take our revenues that we generate off our coast to use to rebuilding our coast? 

Earlier this fall we advanced legislation out of the House Committee on Natural Resources that would increase the share of offshore energy revenues for Gulf Coast states. Our bill would provide a substantial increase in funding for our  coastal restoration and flood protection projects.

To summarize, our bill amends the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act 2006 (GOMESA) to bring Gulf offshore energy revenue sharing in line with levels that onshore energy producing states enjoy – something we've been working on for a long time. 
 
Louisiana is battling the largest historical, ongoing and prospective loss of coastal wetlands we’ve ever seen, and it’s a national crisis. Diverting Louisiana’s energy revenues away from efforts to improve the resiliency of the people, communities and ecosystems responsible for generating the resources in the first place is a fundamentally flawed approach to addressing the maintenance backlog in national parks. Our bill ensures that these increased revenues will be committed to projects that restore the coast, protect our coastal communities from hurricanes and other disaster and, ultimately, reduce our nation’s outrageous disaster response costs.
Army Corps Reform Headed to White House
￼ 
In 2018, we passed landmark legislation to reform the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers -- a change that is long overdue.
On our current trajectory, the Corps will finish its $100 billion of backlogged, federally authorized projects approximately never. We have to stop pushing paper and start turning dirt. Fundamental changes are needed, and this bill begins moving us in that direction. The bill is about delivering proactive solutions so that communities actually benefit from projects instead of having to endure decades of studies and inaction. 
The America's Infrastructure Act of 2018 focuses on four major themes:
- Cutting the red-tape and bureaucracy associated with Corps of Engineers' projects - Preventing redundancies and excessive costs - Providing greater project roles to state and local governments - Changing the Corps of Engineers focus from process and procedure to project completion
Good news: our bill became law in October.  Click here to read more. 
Transportation Funds = Secured
￼ 
An ongoing priority of ours is securing much needed transportation funds to improve the flow of traffic across our state. A few months ago, we helped secure $80,699,190 in new federal funding that will help move some important traffic projects forward statewide.  The $80 million in federal funds is in addition to the extra $500 million we secured for Louisiana through the federal FAST Act, which has also provided $100 million more in federal transportation grant funds that have funded the Terrace/Washington street exit reconfiguration and I-10 lane addition (Highland Road to Prairieville/Dutchtown exit). Additional federal financing will lead to I-10 improvements between the Lobdell/LA415 exit and the I-10/I-12 split.  
￼ 
Tax Reform
It's been almost a year since we passed historic tax reform, and millions of people are seeing the benefits of these federal tax cuts: businesses in Louisiana and across the country are giving bonuses, pay raises, and making new investments that continue to spur economic growth.

Tax reform has had great impact on Louisiana, and as we go into 2019 we are aiming to see even more jobs created, and much needed pay raises for hardworking Louisianans. The national economy booming and the lowest unemployment numbers is forty years, and the great things that we are just getting started. 
Looking Ahead: We Need Immigration Reform
￼ 
The number of foreign-born people residing in the United States is at the highest level in U.S. history. According to the estimates by the Department of Homeland Security about 10.8 million foreign-born noncitizens are illegal aliens. This is the population of Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana combined. More than 300,000 people a year illegally cross our borders. Some want to live the American dream. Some merely want to commit crime in America. Just last year federal agents seized nearly 900,000 pounds of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana at the border. But let's be clear, the first act of illegal immigration is to break US law, and the presence of millions of unauthorized residents is evidence of inadequacies in the legal immigration system as well as failures of immigration control policies and practices.

There is no question our immigration system is broken and needs to be fixed, but it must begin with securing our border and enforcing our immigration laws. We're pushing to address the illegal immigration problem by (1) aggressively enforcing the laws already on the books, (2) strengthening our borders - including a wall - and (3) reforming the legal immigration process.

Border security will continue to be a priority of ours in 2019.  
Connecting with You in 2018: By the Numbers
￼ 
In 2018, we had a record breaking number of individual, small group and large group opportunities to connect with the people we represent. We helped nearly 2,000 people resolve their issues with the VA, Medicare, Social Security and other federal agencies, interacted with more than 330 thousand of you through our Facebook Live sessions, hosted dozens of Grubs with Garret and held personal, small and large-group meetings all across South Louisiana. It is a privilege to represent you in the U.S. House, and us talking and engaging is key to our ability to go to DC to fight for you. So please, continue to engage with us in 2019! 
United States Service Academy Appointments
￼ 

Every year it is my honor to nominate several high school seniors for appointments at one of the United States Military Academies.  We recently heard that one of our nominees received an appointment to the Air Force Academy. Check out the video to hear him share the news with his parents!
Be sure to follow us on social media as we announce other appointments when they are made.

Dear Friend,

2018 was a year to remember. So much happened. Through tragedy and triumph, our communities supported each other and showed others the true meaning of neighborly love. Representing you is a GREAT privilege, and I am humbled every day by the trust you place in me.

Highlighted below are 10 moments that stood out to me as I reflected on the year. Thank YOU, Texas 14.


￼
One of the first things we accomplished this year was securing more disaster relief funds for areas hardest hit by Harvey and the other natural disasters that struck our nation in 2018. With this additional almost $90 billion, we are able to rebuild smarter, stronger, and better than before, as well as focus on mitigation efforts.

In November and December, the Texas General Land Office opened the applications for Texans to apply for the Homeowner Assistance Program. If you owned your home that was damaged or destroyed by Harvey, and it was your primary place of residence, you are potentially eligible for the Homeowner Assistance Program. Applications are being considered on a first-come, first-serve basis. Federal money is allocated through the Texas General Land Office for distribution.

The application for Jefferson County residents may be found at recovery.texas.gov/individuals/programs/homeowner-assistance/south-east/index.html

The application for Galveston and Brazoria County residents may be found at recovery.texas.gov/individuals/programs/homeowner-assistance/gulf-coast/index.html

You may fill out the application and mail it to the Homeowner Assistance Program office or schedule an appointment to drop it off.

From Brooke Langston who won our annual Congressional Art Competition, to the Brazoswood Goddard Rocket Team who won the rocket building and launching contest, to the Danbury High School students who volunteered at the VFW lunches, to the Texas City students who visited me in DC to talk about important policy matters, to the Alvin FFA students who stopped in to talk policy, to the many talented students, athletes, musicians, artists, and more – I am constantly impressed by YOU. You are our future, and I am sure great things are in store.



￼
This May, I had the pleasure of leading some of my fellow Science, Space, and Technology Committee members on a Congressional Delegation to Argonne and Fermi National Labs in Illinois. These labs are doing innovative work in basic science and early-stage research performed daily by some of the best scientists and researchers in the world. From materials science research to quantum computing to creating a better, smarter way to absorb oil, and more, the work occurring in our national labs is life changing. The Science Committee works closely with the Department of Energy to observe research and manage funding of, among other institutions, our national labs.



￼
It is a day I will never forget. Sitting in a meeting in DC, I received a phone call no one ever wants to receive – there had been a school shooting. Our world turned upside down in an instant, but what remained the same was the love displayed by the Santa Fe community.

These are salt of the earth folk, and they went above and beyond to provide love and support to those who lost loved ones and were there as the unspeakable event occurred. The way Santa Fe rallied together and hosted event after event to raise money, feed their neighbor, and pray for Cynthia Tisdale, Ann Perkins, Sabika Sheikh, Angelique Ramirez, Chris Stone, Shana Fisher, Kimberly Vaughan, Jared Black, Christian Riley Garcia, and Kyle McLeod is truly remarkable.



￼
Hosting telephone townhalls is a great way to meet y’all where you are. In the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, it’s a great gift to be able to communicate with you through these town halls. We reached thousands of y’all and took about a dozen questions. Thank YOU for being actively involved in our discussions and engaged in your communities.

2018 was a BIG year for transportation and infrastructure in our district. Along with rebuilding after Harvey, our local ports and businesses received much needed help, as well. The Port of Port Arthur and the Sabine Neches Waterway both received grant money to rebuild a dock and deepen the channel, respectively. And Port Freeport received continued operation and maintenance funding. 

Gulf Copper received a grant to build a new dry dock. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced funding to further study coastal barrier protection. And this year’s America’s Water Infrastructure Act (commonly referred to as WRDA, Water Resources and Development Act) included some terrific wins for Texas 14.

Along the Texas Gulf Coast, WRDA works by authorizing the construction of levees in our counties, and it recognizes the need for channel improvements to Galveston Harbor, important to both the Galveston and Texas City Ports. An appropriate navigable depth is essential to the transportation of goods domestically and internationally.

Our district will see the direct, positive effects of WRDA 2018 authorizations and projects. We know water infrastructure well with our five ports, miles of navigable inland waterways, and awareness of flood protection and prevention.



￼
It was a great honor to see Sam Davis (pictured above) and Stan Kalla off as they made their way to DC as part of an Honor Flight. Thank YOU for your service.

Our brave servicemen and women, our veterans, and their families have sacrificed so much for us and have done immeasurable good to protect our freedoms and secure our liberties.

Through the National Defense Authorization Act and the Department of Defense funding measures, we boost troop pay, rebuild military infrastructure, and improve equipment and training. All these efforts and more protect our brave troops at home and abroad, ensuring the United States maintains the world’s strongest, finest military.

The Department of Veterans Affairs was fully funded with the passage of our early appropriations bills, and the VA Mission Act provides important reforms to the VA by expanding healthcare access for our veterans and ensuring bureaucracy and red tape do not prevent veterans from receiving the care they deserve.



￼
The Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act of 2017, introduced by Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID) and myself, was signed into law this September! Access to fast neutrons affords us an opportunity to explore the crucial development of next generation reactor designs, materials, and nuclear fuels. The Versatile Neutron Source authorized in our bill gives our scientists and national labs the tools do just that. We can’t afford to lose the ability to discover innovative nuclear technology here at home. America should lead the global marketplace.



￼
Over 145 Texas 14 families visited DC this past year! We are more than happy to greet y’all, give you a tour of the Capitol building, and help coordinate other tour visits during your stay in our nation’s Capitol.

If you’re planning on coming to DC in the New Year, please make sure to come by the office and say “Howdy.” For years now, I’ve had a plaque in front of the door stating that the office belongs to YOU, the people of Texas 14. Come by and see your place. I would love to meet you, and we would love to give you a tour of your nation’s Capitol.

For more information about how to coordinate tours for your visit to DC, please visit our web page: weber.house.gov/forms/tourrequest/



￼
I would be remiss not to mention coastal barrier protection. Please be assured: This is one of my top priorities. The initial proposal has been released, and there is work to be done. Y’all brought some GREAT questions and concerns to the table at the fourth public comment meeting. The Tentatively Selected Plan was intended to be a conversation starter, and boy was it ever.

Thank YOU for being engaged with local news and for voicing your opinions. It is vitally important that all who are impacted weigh in on this important issue and that the Army Corps be made well aware of all of our concerns. We’ve sent a letter requesting for the public comment period to be extended 45 days to allow ample time for commentary after the holiday season is over.

Only through thoughtful, robust, productive conversations will we get the best system to protect our children, our families, our lives, and our homes. I cannot stress how important your opinion is as we aim toward a workable plan to protect our way of life. Stay tuned, you can bet we’ll be following this issue closely and getting y’all the information you need.


GOD bless you and your families.

GOD bless TEXAS.

GOD bless America.

Happy New Year!


Sincerely,
￼
Randy K. Weber

Dear Friends, 
 Happy New Year! What a year 2018 has been! With 2019 quickly approaching, I wanted to take a moment to share some of important moments from the past year. 
 Let's jump right into it! 
  
Fifth Annual Hunger and Homelessness Summit 
In January, I hosted my 5th Annual Hunger and Homelessness Summit in Rothschild. It was an incredible conference thanks to all of our guests, including Wisconsin First Lady Tonette Walker, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness Nan Roman, HUD Secretary Ben Carson, and, of course, the hundreds of attendees who brought their enthusiasm and ideas.   We left the summit with countless ideas on addressing rural poverty in our community. 
Check out this short video on Facebook from last year's event by clicking HERE or on the photo below. 
Be sure to keep an eye out for our 2019 Hunger and Homelessness Summit. 
￼    
Our Economy Continued To Benefit From Tax Reform In 2018 
While historic tax reform was passed near the end of 2017, the benefits have continued to roll in for Wisconsinites throughout this year.  A typical Wisconsin family will receive more than $2,500 in tax relief from tax reform. That's money families can use towards buying a new car, saving for college, or plan a vacation.   Click HERE for a quick video that shows some of our ""Wins"" from tax reform from just a few months after tax reform was signed into law...and it's continued to help Wisconsin families since! 
￼ 
 Obama And Trump Agree: Let's Delist The Gray Wolf 
While I'm proud to have fought for Wisconsin to manage its wolf population, I'm equally disappointed in Senate Democrats (many of whom said they support delisting the gray wolf) for not lifting a finger to get this important legislation across the finish line. 
Even President Obama's administration and President Trump's administration agrees on this one!  I plan to re-introduce this bill in 2019 because our farmers deserve the ability to protect their livestock. 
Click HERE or the image below to view some footage of wolves from a concerned Hayward resident. 
￼ 
Spring 2019 Isn't Far Off! Great Opportunity For College Students Or Recent Grads     
Attention college students or recent grads: my Washington DC office is now accepting applications for Spring internships. It's a great way to serve your community and get involved in the political process.   For more information on the internship, click HERE or the photo below. Also be sure to share these opportunities with any interested students!
￼   
Stay Connected On Social Media In The Upcoming Year        Snapchat is a fun way to stay connected with what’s going on in Wisconsin and Washington (and of course, find me on Facebook and Twitter- @RepSeanDuffy). Find my snapchat profile either by searching @RepSeanDuffy or use the Snapcode below!  
￼   
 
Until 2019!   God bless,

End of Old Congress, Beginning of New Year 
￼ 
As 2018 comes to a close, so does the 115th Congress. It is an honor to represent the diverse interests of the Fourth Congressional District, and I am especially proud of the accomplishments we achieved that will improve the quality of life in Central Washington.
One year after Congress passed historic tax relief for American taxpayers, we are seeing results in the form of higher paychecks, improved employee benefits, and growing small businesses. We are making it easier for Americans to save for their futures and encouraging innovation. I have heard stories from people across the Fourth District who are using their tax cuts and extra take-home pay to reinvest in our local communities. With the lowest unemployment rate in decades and hundreds of thousands of jobs being created each month, our country has a bright economic future.
One of the biggest economic drivers in our state is agriculture. As a farmer, I know first-hand the difficulties farmers and ranchers face in Central Washington, from scarce water resources and labor shortages to international trade and crop insurance. While there is still a lot of work left to be done, I have worked diligently with my colleagues and the Trump Administration to address each of these issues. I am pleased that Congress delivered on one of the most important pieces of agricultural legislation: the Farm Bill. The Farm Bill is only reauthorized every five years, but I am proud to have demonstrated its importance to Washington’s unique agriculture industry by hosting U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway on tours around Central Washington to hear from our farmers. This bill will give farmers and ranchers the certainty they deserve and provide a safety net for the men and women in Washington state and across the country who produce the food that feeds America and the world.
Ensuring food security is one of the most important steps we can take to protect our communities, but Congress also took steps to alleviate the grief and pain caused by the growing opioid epidemic. I voted to support over 50 pieces of legislation that aim to prevent addiction and overdose, increase treatment options and alternative pain-management therapies, and give law enforcement agencies better tools to keep these dangerous drugs off the streets and out of our country. I was deeply moved to hear the personal stories from constituents affected by the opioid crisis at a symposium in Moses Lake, and I will continue to work on your behalf to stop these drugs from ravaging our communities.
While these pieces of legislation will do great things for Americans across the country, my proudest accomplishment is ensuring that our local voices are heard and that local heroes are honored. This year, my staff and I responded to over 13,000 phone calls, letters, and e-mails and assisted almost 400 constituents who were having trouble with a federal agency. When I learned that Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman of Richland was tragically killed in a military plane crash, I worked with his family to rename a Post Office in his honor. Working on the Appropriations Committee, I included language to ensure adequate funding for the Hanford cleanup and agricultural research and to prevent the privatization of the Bonneville Power Administration. 
As we enter the 116th Congress and the New Year, the work is far from over. I look forward to making more progress on Central Washington’s priorities. 
Sincerely, ￼  Dan Newhouse Member of Congress

18 Highlights from 2018
Dear friend,   I hope you had a wonderful holiday season with loved ones. While the current government shutdown does not demonstrate it, there were many successes - several bipartisan - in 2018. I disagree with the government shutdown because no one wins. I believe border security is very important and should have been handled months ago, which is why I urged a vote on a bill that provided immediate border funding for the wall and included a permanent solution for DACA recipients. Democrats and Republicans are going to need to work together to fix our broken immigration system. I hope our new Democratic leadership in the House will work quickly to find a compromise with the Senate and White House to reopen the government.   As 2018 comes to a close, I wanted to share a few highlights from the year. Although it may seem that Republicans and Democrats don't work together, much of what we accomplished this year was done on a bipartisan basis.   The 115th Congress was one of the most productive congresses in history and nearly 80% of all the bills passed were bipartisan. As we move into the 116th Congress next week, I hope the Democratic leadership will continue working across the aisle to deliver results to the American people.   2018 by the numbers -Nearly 7,000 letters sent -645 cases helping constituents get answers from the federal government -Over 3,000 meetings held  -391 tours arranged for constituents -34 open office hour sessions  Here are 18 of the top moments from 2018:    1. Fighting the Opioid Epidemic  
 
￼
Davis and USDA Assistant to the Secretary for Rural Development Anne Hazlett host an opioid roundtable with local elected officials, law enforcement, and other stakeholders. 
The opioid crisis is wreaking havoc on communities in my district and across the country and Congress took action. Earlier this year, President Trump signed comprehensive legislation to combat the epidemic from all angles.   This is the most significant congressional effort against a single drug crisis in history.  H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act will help in our efforts to advance treatment and recovery initiatives, improve prevention, protect our communities, and fight illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl.   I’ve held numerous roundtables in the district asking first responders, law enforcement, and health care experts what they need from the federal government to help address this issue locally and this package contains many provisions that will address those issues.  Some of the highlights include:  -Expand access to treatment and recovery services, including establishing comprehensive opioid recovery centers -Improve data to identify and help at-risk patients and families -Give law enforcement tools to get dangerous drugs out of our communities -Improve access to federal resources for local communities -Crack down on foreign shipments of illicit drugs  There is still much work to be done, but this legislation will go a long way in fighting against this epidemic.   2. Bigger paychecks, benefits, & job growth thanks to  tax reform 
 
The new tax code meant bigger paychecks, job growth, and more benefits for Americans. And this year was the last time you'll ever have to file on the old, complicated tax code. Next year, you'll get to file on a simpler tax code that allows you to keep more of your hard-earned paycheck.   In the 13th District, a family of four making the median income of $78,509 will see a tax cut of $1,691 and a median income household making $49,758 for a single filer will see a tax cut of $1,224. Here is how tax reform directly benefits middle-income Americans:   - Lower rates ensure individuals at every income level will see a tax cut.  - Doubles the standard deduction to $12,000/$24,000, which 75% of people in the 13th District currently take. - Doubles the Child Tax Credit to $2,000 with up to $1,400 refundable. - Retains popular deductions like mortgage interest (capped at $750,000 for new homes), state and local taxes (SALT) (capped at $10,000), medical expenses (expands to 10%), and charitable deductions.  Since the bill has been signed, more than 4 million workers have seen higher wages, bonuses, paid sick and family leave, and other investments. For a list of companies who have announced benefits to employees because of tax reform, click here.    3. The Logan S. Palmer Post Office in Harristown & a   stronger military 
 
￼
Davis with Petty Officer Logan Palmer's parents, Sid and Theresa Palmer. 
Legislation honoring the life and service of Petty Officer Logan Palmer was signed into law. It designates the post office in Harristown, Illinois, as the “Logan S. Palmer Post Office."" Petty Officer Logan Palmer, of Harristown, Illinois, was among the sailors killed when the USS John S McCain collided with a tanker off the coast of Singapore last August.  Logan's parents, Sid and Theresa, joined me in DC to introduce this bill six months ago and I’m so glad we were able to get this bill honoring their son signed into law this year.  This building will serve as a grave reminder of risks our servicemembers take on each day.   Department of Defense policy had previously been that transportation to Dover Air Force Base would only be arranged and covered by the government if the servicemember died in a combat operation. Families of servicemembers who died in non-combat operations could have their costs covered, but only if a waiver was obtained first.   I worked with the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to get this policy changed after the family of Petty Officer Logan Palmer, who was killed in the USS John S. McCain accident in Singapore, received outside funding to attend his arrival at Dover. The Department of Defense (DoD) announced it has changed its policy to automatically arrange and cover the travel costs for families of servicemembers killed in non-combat operations to meet the casket at Dover Air Force Base.  This Congress ended the nearly decade-long cuts to our military which led to increased accidents, like the one that cost Logan Palmer his life. By ending these cuts, we've started to rebuild our military and provided our troops with the largest pay increase in seven years.    4. Helping rural communities when  disaster strikes 
 
￼
Davis speaks on the House floor in support of his FEMA reform legislation. 
My legislation to reform the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding formula was signed into law. This change is long overdue and it is one I have fought tirelessly for since my first term in Congress. It requires FEMA to consider the localized impact of a disaster. This will help level the playing field for rural communities in largely populated states like Illinois. People in the 13th District pay into the Disaster Relief Fund and deserve help when needed just as it's been provided to communities in other states over the years.  The Disaster Declaration Improvement Act, requires FEMA to place greater consideration on the severe localized impact of damage following a disaster. In the past, FEMA has placed more focus a standard formula based on population and less on the amount of damage done to a community and its size.  Click here to watch my remarks on the bill.    5. Promoting civility and bipartisanship
 
￼
Davis and Panetta talk to high school students about bipartisanship and civility in politics. 
Bipartisanship and civility in politics are what make our government great. We can have differences in policy and ideas, but we can put our disagreements aside and come up with a good solution that moves us forward. Rep. Jimmy Panetta and I come from different states and different political parties, but we are friends and work together to do our jobs. I am glad he was able to visit three high schools in my district and help show our next generation there is more bipartisanship in Washington than people might think. 
 
￼
Davis, Mullin, Kennedy, and Blunt Rochester participate in bipartisan panel at Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the U.S. Senate. 
I joined U.S. Reps. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.), Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), and Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.) on a panel at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the U.S. Senate about fostering civic dialogue, civility in politics, and opportunities for finding common ground in the 116th Congress. The panel was moderated by Paul Kane, Senior Congressional Correspondent and Columnist for The Washington Post.  This was part of a two-day program hosted by the Congressional Study Group on American Democracy and Civics through the U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress. Kennedy and I serve as co-chairs of the group created to strengthen our democratic process by showcasing bipartisanship, civility, and emphasizing the importance of civic knowledge.  Click here to watch the full event.  6. Largest increase for medical research in more than   a decade 
 
Earlier this year, I voted for the largest increase in funding for the National Institute of Health for critical medical research and development, including fighting cancer, in more than a decade.  The Childhood Cancer STAR Act, which focuses on improving efforts to identify and track the incidences of pediatric cancer, was signed into law earlier this year. It will also work to improve the quality of life for children with cancer, expand opportunities for pediatric cancer research, and ensure there is pediatric cancer expertise on the National Cancer Advisory Board.  My wife is a 19-year colon cancer survivor and in Congress, I am promoting policies that encourage early detection through screening and tests, along with supporting critical research, so that one day no families will have to go through what my family, and so many other families, have gone through.    7. Springfield Rail Improvements Project and   Preserving Springfield Race Riot Artifacts 
 
￼
The Springfield Rail Improvements project is incredibly important to Springfield and I was excited to bring Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Administrator Ronald Batory to meet with local stakeholders and show him firsthand it’s value to our local economy. This project will improve pedestrian safety in downtown Springfield as well as improve passenger rail service throughout central Illinois. The support this project has received so far is enormous and I want to make sure the federal government is doing its part to ensure this project is completed and we have reliable passenger trains running through Illinois. I’ve always believed that once it’s completed, Springfield will be a great example of where high-speed rail can work and I will continue to fight for federal support for this project.   
 
￼
Davis and Librarian of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden, view the Springfield Race Riot artifacts. 
I have been working with the Illinois NAACP, the Central Illinois African American Museum, and the Library of Congress to preserve artifacts from the 1908 Springfield race riots unearthed during construction of the Carpenter Street segment of the Rail Improvement Project. Additionally, I hosted the Librarian of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden, in Springfield to view the artifacts.  Recently, the National Park Service (NPS) has agreed to conduct a preliminary survey of the site of the 1908 Springfield Race Riots. The survey is necessary to begin the process of getting a national designation by the park service. This is something I will work diligently towards in 2019.   8. Investing in infrastructure 
 
￼
This Congress passed one of the largest investments in transportation and infrastructure in years. This funding allows localities to fix roads and bridges and invest in their communities.  This includes investments in our smaller, public transit systems, which means investing in jobs and economic growth, while also ensuring access to safe and affordable transportation for riders. I joined U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood, Acting Administrator of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) K. Jane Williams and General Manager of Connect Transit Isaac Thorne today to recognize grant funding awarded to Connect Transit by the FTA. I was proud to have the Acting Administrator in central Illinois to see firsthand the difference the bus grant will make in the community. As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I will continue to be an advocate for our smaller transit systems that are critical to the communities they serve.   9. Building a stronger workforce 
 
￼
I was honored to host Ivanka Trump, Advisor to the President, at Lewis and Clark Community College (LCCC) in August. We toured the college's welding facility and held a workforce development roundtable with manufacturers, labor, and LCCC students.   We saw the advancement in technical training and heard from people who are proof that you don't have to have a four-year degree to succeed in this country. It was great to have Ivanka Trump, who continues to be a leader on workforce training and child care issues in the White House, visit the 13th District. As we heard from the panel, this is about growing the middle class and creating jobs that allow people to succeed. In Washington, we passed an overhaul of our career and technical education programs to ensure they are providing training for jobs that are actually open within a community. I continue to work with the administration to expand apprenticeship opportunities and reduce college debt.   10. Granite City is back to work 
 
￼
I attended President Trump’s visit to Granite City with hundreds of steelworkers, who are now back to work. In 2015, Granite City Works laid off nearly 2,000 workers, but has since brought back many of these jobs citing market demand and efforts to stop illegal trade practices.  You can hear stories from people across my district and throughout the country who have been put back to work because of policies in Washington that are helping this economy grow. Since coming to Congress, I have been working to get stronger trade enforcement so American companies, like Granite City Works, can fight back against China who for years have violated our trade laws in order to decimate our manufacturing industry.   11. Preserving Route 66 
 
￼
Route 66 is a symbol of American independence and prosperity, a critical part of our economy, and it's important to preserve it for future generations. In April of last year, I went on an extended tour of Illinois’ stretch of the highway with my colleague Rep. Darin LaHood and many state and local leaders. I had the opportunity to see the economic impact the Mother Road brings to Illinois, supporting many jobs and key economic activity in small towns, helping generate important revenue to support our communities.  My legislation to create a 19-member Commission to honor the 100th anniversary of Route 66 in 2026 and to develop a plan to ensure the first-all-paved U.S. highway connecting the Midwest to California will be preserved for many years to come, passed the House unanimously.   Although this bill was not taken up in the Senate this year, I will continue to work to ensure Route 66 is ready for its 100th anniversary and for years to come.   12. Supporting our country's veterans  
 
￼
Davis greets a veteran on the Land of Lincoln Honor Flight in Springfield. 
Our veterans sacrificed for our country and we must be there for them in their time of need. The VA MISSION Act, which is landmark legislation to reform the VA, was signed into law on June 6, 2018. It strengthens and improves the VA healthcare system for approximately 9 million veterans by consolidating multiple existing community care programs into one cohesive program. Community care programs are authorized when the VA cannot fulfill the services the veteran needs and among other circumstances.  Additionally, it establishes process to review VA's assets and to recommend actions to modernize and realign medical infrastructure to ensure veterans have access to quality care and expands the Department of Veterans Affairs' Post-9/11 Caregiver program so that caregivers from all eras can take advantage of the benefits it provides to those who care for those who served. The legislation also funds the VA Choice Program until the new program is implemented so that veteran care is not disrupted.   I honored David Freyling on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. David, who passed away earlier this year served our country in the U.S. Army and most recently served his fellow veterans as the Chairman of the Veterans Assistance Commission of Macon County for 13 years. He always went above and beyond for veterans and I strive to follow his example each day in Congress. Click here to watch my remarks.    13. Fighting Human Trafficking  
 
￼
Democrats and Republicans came together and took additional steps to stop human trafficking. Bad internet actors have helped facilitate this horrendous crime with little retribution. Dozens of bills to fight human trafficking have been signed into law, including the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, which gives states and victims the power to sue websites that support and facilitate human trafficking. As a result, online advertising for commercial sex trafficking has gone down by 60-80%.  The No Human Trafficking on Our Roads Act, and the Combating Human Trafficking in Commercial Vehicles Act have helped cracked down on the transportation human traffickers use and helped law enforcement better combat it.   14. Securing our schools 
 
￼
Davis meets with school administrators about school safety.  
Helping our teachers and administrators make their schools safer is a priority. Not only is school safety about making the buildings more secure, but we also have to be able to identify potential issues and take steps to prevent violence before it happens. What schools need vary by district and Congress took action by authorizing the Secure Our Schools grant program to give schools the resources which can be used based on the needs of their school.  15. Championing organic agriculture 
 
￼
This year, I invited Jayson Werth to be my guest to President Trump's first State of the Union address to highlight the importance of agriculture. Jayson, who was a former professional baseball player who played for the Washington Nationals, owns an organic farm in Macoupin County, IL and has become an advocate for the industry and farmers.   Consumer demand for organic products continues to increase and this years farm bill makes positive changes to support organic products by placing higher scrutiny on organic imports, helping farmers who seek organic certification, and increasing funding for organic research.  16. No one should feel unsafe at work 

The House and Senate unanimously approved bipartisan legislation to reform sexual harassment rules within the Legislative Branch. The House led on strengthening protections against sexual harassment in the workplace and I’m glad both chambers were able to work together to get this done before the start of the new Congress. The compromise bill increases transparency, provides greater reporting requirements, and for the first time ever, ensures taxpayers are not footing the bill for any misconduct by members of Congress. Whether you work in government, in the media, in Hollywood, or elsewhere, no one should have to worry about sexual harassment when they come to work. I believe members of Congress should lead our nation by example and this legislation is a huge step in that direction.
  17. Passing a Farm Bill   
 
￼
Last week, President Trump signed the farm bill into law. The farm bill is one of the single most important pieces of legislation to ensure farmers in the 13th District can continue their family business, support a major component of our state’s economy, and help feed the world. I’ve been honored to serve on the House Agriculture Committee since I came to Congress and I’m proud to say I’ve been able to deliver two long-term farm bills, one in 2014 and now 2018, to provide certainty and help farmers in my district succeed.  Getting a farm bill across the finish line this year for our farmers was always my goal. This bill maintains programs critical for Central Illinois farmers, strengthens agricultural research, and improves protections for organic products.    18. Historic criminal justice reform  

For years, lawmakers, including myself, have advocated for reforming our criminal justice system and it’s finally a reality. The First Step Act fixes some of the biggest injustices within the system that have led to increased recidivism rates and left a bigger bill for taxpayers. We would not have gotten this bill across the finish line without leadership from within the White House, Democrat and Republican members of Congress, and a variety of outside groups coming together to unite around re-focusing the system on rehabilitation and giving millions a second chance. It’s a great example of what our government can accomplish when we set politics aside and commit to governing.  The First Step Act provides individualized assessments to federal offenders in order to tailor programming that best meets their needs, and offers programs to inmates that include: vocational training, education support, substance abuse treatment, mental health care, anger-management courses, faith-based initiatives, and other resources proven to lower the chance of recidivism.   Additionally, it contains sentencing reform provisions, including reducing the enhanced penalties for certain non-violent repeat drug offenders and eliminates the three-strike mandatory life provision, but it is not retroactive. Also, certain nonviolent offenders will be able to petition courts for a review of their sentence, which can be reduced only after the judge reviews all circumstances, including public safety, criminal history, and the nature of the offense.

News from Congresswoman Shea-Porter
￼
NEWS FROM THE FIRST DISTRICT
Dear Friends, 
Happy New Year! I hope you and your family and friends enjoyed the holidays, and I wish you all peace and good health in 2019. Since I decided to retire this year, I have received many kind notes, and I thank you all for that and for the great privilege of serving you in Congress for eight years. Every day in this job, I was reminded in so many ways that Americans are good people who work hard, care about issues, and deserve to be heard. That has kept me optimistic and hopeful throughout my time in Congress. 
The 115th Congress has adjourned. In the last few days of the session, we passed a bipartisan Farm Bill. The Farm Bill supports our farmers and rural communities, and it rejects attempts to strip nutrition benefits from people who need them. 
We are, of course, in a partial government shutdown because the president rejected a carefully developed compromise to keep the government funded, which had passed the Senate unanimously. This senseless shutdown is hurting federal employees and halting critical work that protects all Americans, but President Trump said he was proud to shut down the government. I hope he changes his mind and decides to support any one of the bipartisan paths forward to end this shutdown.
Secretary Mattis’s departure this month is extremely concerning. His resignation letter makes it clear that the president does not believe that we must stand with our allies and be clear-eyed in countering our enemies and competitors on the world stage. I worry that the President will make more dangerous decisions in the future because Secretary Mattis will not be in the administration.
Opposing seismic testing in the Atlantic 
The Trump Administration announced that it would allow drilling in the Atlantic Ocean last year. The administration continued down this path last week, issuing five Incidental Harassment Authorizations (IHAs) for Atlantic seismic airgun blasting permits.
I sent a letter with 93 other Members of Congress from both parties to Interior Secretary Zinke and Commerce Secretary Ross, urging them not to approve seismic testing in the Atlantic Ocean. Seismic testing is an immediate risk to communities up and down the Atlantic. According to the Washington Post, “In addition to harming sea life, acoustic tests — in which acoustic waves are sent through water 10 to 12 seconds apart to image the sea floor — can disrupt thriving commercial fisheries.” 
In our letter, we wrote that, “Opening the Atlantic to seismic testing and drilling jeopardizes our coastal businesses, fishing communities, tourism, and our national security. It harms our coastal economies in the near term and opens the door to even greater risks from offshore oil and gas production down the road. Given the significant environmental and economic risks, we strongly oppose the issuance of IHA permits for companies seeking to conduct seismic testing in the Atlantic.”
Passing a bipartisan Farm Bill 
I am pleased that the House and Senate have agreed to a bipartisan farm bill that includes critical New Hampshire priorities. For over a year, House Republicans have held up this bill because they have wanted to reduce nutrition support for millions of Americans who rely on these benefits to feed their families. Most people who receive nutrition benefits are children, seniors, and people with disabilities. I am pleased that these harmful provisions were not included in the final bill. The Farm Bill reauthorizes the Northern Border Regional Commission, which generates important economic activity in our state and which grows our workforce. Furthermore, this bill supports our farmers and makes critical investments that will benefit our rural communities, such as expanded access to broadband.
Breaking ground at the new Somersworth VA outpatient clinic  
I joined Senator Hassan, Manchester VA Director Al Montoya, and other civic leaders to officially break ground on the new VA outpatient clinic in Somersworth. We promised and we owe our veterans high quality health care, and this new, much larger facility will help the VA better serve Seacoast veterans. I am so pleased that many veterans will be able to receive additional services closer to home soon, and I look forward to seeing the VA continue to expand services and improve care in New Hampshire. 
￼ 
Announcing new funding to repair Market Street Wharf in Portsmouth 
The congressional delegation has announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation will award $7.5 million to the Pease Development Authority, Division of Ports and Harbors (PDA-DPH) for the Main Wharf Rehabilitation and Modification Project. Our economy depends on the maritime infrastructure along the Piscataqua River. This funding will allow PDA-DPH to rehabilitate approximately 17,500 square feet of the Main Wharf at the Market Street Marine Terminal. 
Bringing this facility back up to full capacity can’t happen soon enough, and I applaud the approval of this federal funding. Without these repairs, large parts of the wharf will have to be closed. Funding for infrastructure projects needs to be a federal priority, and I hope to see a bipartisan infrastructure package move forward that creates jobs and addresses critical infrastructure needs.  
Addressing the SVAC 
I enjoyed speaking at the monthly State Veterans Advisory Committee meeting. Thank you to the SVAC for all you do to help New Hampshire veterans! The Granite State is grateful for your dedication to those who served and their families. 
￼ 
Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans 
Blue Water Navy Vietnam veterans have earned and deserve benefits for health conditions developed as a result of Agent Orange exposure. I am beyond disappointed that H.R. 299, which passed the House 382-0, was blocked by a few Republican Senators. This legislation would restore VA benefits for these veterans, who lost them in 2002 when the VA unilaterally re-wrote the rules on who was covered by the Agent Orange Act of 1991. Congress has been trying to fix this problem for many years, and we got very close this time. Failure to enact this bill is a grave injustice and a betrayal to those who served. I hope the next Congress will act swiftly to enact this bill. 
Best Wishes, ￼  Carol Shea-Porter Member of Congress ￼￼

Report: Repair backlog leaves subs pierside 
Fosters // Hadley Barndollar 
KITTERY, Maine — A new report issued by the Government Accountability Office depicts hugely consequential maintenance delays for the nuclear submarine fleet, and more than $1.5 billion spent over the last 10 years to support submarines sitting idle with no operational capabilities. 
“Congress and the Navy are working hard to address maintenance delays by investing significant resources into upgrading public shipyards, including nearly $150 million for the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard,” Shea-Porter said. “The shipyard is working at full capacity and meeting its goals, and I do not expect that any maintenance availabilities will be transferred from Portsmouth. It’s clear from this report that our public shipyards are needed now than ever...”

Dear Friends,

As we look forward to 2019, it's important to reflect on what we've accomplished together this year. This newsletter highlights some of our successes throughout the second session of the 115th Congress, as we continued to work together to build ""One Meck."" I'm grateful for the opportunity to represent you, and I will continue to fight for you and your family throughout 2019. Take a look to see the year in review.

Please join us on January 24th for my annual State of the District Town Hall. 

I look forward to seeing you there. 

Best,
￼
Congresswoman Alma S. Adams, Ph.D.

￼ 

￼

On January 25th, I held my annual State of the District Address at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where I had the opportunity to speak directly to my constituents about my agenda for our district. I continued to emphasize ""One Meck,"" because Mecklenburg County is stronger when we are united.

￼

On January 20th, Americans across the country participated in the 2nd Annual Women’s March to protest the gross misogyny of the Trump Administration. I was proud that over five thousand people in Charlotte joined in this effort by marching through the streets to send a direct message to the President that women will not be silenced. Your voices are heard loud and clear: we will keep marching until women earn equal wages, have equal access to comprehensive healthcare, and do not have to fear sexual violence and harassment.

￼

On March 20th, the Bipartisan Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Caucus, which I founded and serve as the Caucus Co-Chair, and the Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics (STEAM) Caucus hosted the first HBCU STEAM Day of Action on Capitol Hill. This unique event brought HBCU presidents and administrators from forty schools and industry leaders to Capitol Hill to meet with key members of Congress and senior staff from both parties and in both chambers. The meetings allowed the coalition to advocate for bipartisan priorities impacting HBCUs and increased efforts to diversify our workforce. These priorities included increased resources for 1890 land-grant universities through the Farm Bill, reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, STEAM initiatives, and appropriations.

￼

I hosted the Third Annual Women's Symposium and Resource Fair on March 29th. This year's theme was ""Women Who Lead: Encourage, Inspire, Empower."" 

Thank you to our panelists, host and everyone who attended or watched the live-stream. This year's event demonstrated why we often find strength in the stories of others. I hope you came away from the event with tools to realize your dreams. If you'd like to re-watch the program or see what you missed click here.

￼

It was a pleasure meeting with Mecklenburg County Commissioners George Dunlap, Trevor Fuller, Dumont Clarke, County Manager Dena Diorio and the Deputy County Manager Derrick Ramos in my D.C. office on March 6th. We discussed issues important to the more than 830,000 citizens of the 12th Congressional District of North Carolina.

￼

This March, I was honored to receive the North Carolina Association of Educators (NCAE) President's  award at the annual NCAE  State Convention. During my opening remarks, I reaffirmed my commitment to quality education and public schools. As your champion in Congress, I won’t stop fighting for public education.

￼

One of the most important aspects of my job is listening to my constituents. In April, I hosted a listening session on affordable housing so I could hear, firsthand, from constituents and local organizations concerned with the affordable housing crisis in the district. During the meeting, members of our community gathered to share how this crisis impacts Mecklenburg County and to brainstorm solutions. I remain committed to bringing attention to this issue, and will continue to work on behalf of those impacted.

￼

I’m thankful for our first responders everyday -- but it’s not every day that I have chance to thank them personally alongside an NBA star! On April 7th, Kemba Walker, star point guard of the Charlotte Hornets, and I participated in Coca-Cola’s “Message in a Bottle” initiative. This program collects messages of thanks from community members to deliver to those who serve them. To those who keep us safe -- thank you for all you do!

￼

On April 10th, I met with officials from the NC Electric Cooperatives to talk about what policies would expand utilities to rural communities in North Carolina. As a member of Congress, I am determined to find funding for valuable initiatives such as electric cooperatives, clean energy in rural communities, and lowering utility costs for low-income households. I'm grateful to hear what these experts had to say.

￼

One of my favorite things about being a Congresswoman is hosting the annual 12th District Congressional Art Competition. After all, I was an Art Professor for over 40 years. Each Spring, I invite submissions from all high school students in Mecklenburg County to submit their work and have it judged by a professional panel. The first place winner’s work is featured in the halls of U.S. Capitol along with winners from House districts across the country. In addition, the second place winners work is displayed in my D.C. office, while the third place winners work is displayed in my District Office for one year.  Congratulations to this year’s award recipients:   1. ""Peony"" by Beryl Shoemaker (Senior, William Hough High School)  2. ""Sky Scraper"" by Kevin Garcia (Senior, Olympic High School)  3. ""My Neighbor"" Dave by Vuk Petrovic (Junior, Northwest School of the Arts)


￼

Each year, I nominate high school students from our district for an appointment to a military service academy. This May, I met with six of the twelve students who received appointment offers and full scholarships to attend one of our nation's prestigious military institutions of higher learning. 
￼

On May 22nd, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos testified before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. I had the opportunity to question Secretary DeVos about consumer protections for students that attend for-proft college, the HBCU Capital Financing Program, andprotections for student loan borrowers.Click here to watch.
￼

Students from Charlotte's Trinity Episcopal Middle School joined me in D.C. on May 16th to discuss the ways that children can serve as educational advocates. As a former educator and a member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, I recognize that education offers opportunities to achieve economic prosperity and social mobility. I will continue to use my position to advocate for a strong education system. 
￼

Many people in our community are unemployed or underemployed, even though there are plenty of employers eager to hire. On May 3rd, I hosted the Bridging the Gap Career Fair, which provided an opportunity for those seeking employment to connect with over 40 employers who have jobs to fill. 
￼

I met with Charlotte's Mayor Vi Lyles and members of the Charlotte City Council during their May visit to Washington D.C. 
￼

On June 4th, I was joined by Mayor Woody Washam to announce the launch of the 12th District’s Cornelius Satellite Office hours. We’re pleased to expand office hours across the district in order to serve our constituents. 
￼

On July 17th, I stood with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and fellow Democratic women in Congress, to stop the confirmation of United States Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh due to major concerns about his potential impact on women’s rights and other vital rights and liberties.  
￼

Also on July 17th, the Small Business Subcommittee on Investigations, Oversight, and Regulations and the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations met for a hearing titled, “Achieving Government-Wide Verification of Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.” During this hearing, we heard from experts and leaders on how to expand opportunities for disabled veterans to be successful small business owners. 
￼

In July, I met with the interim Chief Executive Officer of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Fern Fernandez, to discuss how to expand small business and labor opportunities for Hispanic business owners and workers.
￼

On July 19th, I hosted “HBCUs: The Key to Diversifying Tech” with the National Urban League, the Bipartisan HBCU Caucus, and the Congressional Black Caucus. This roundtable brought together leaders from the HBCU community, tech sector, and Congress to discuss how government and industry can work together to build a more diverse and inclusive workforce. During the roundtable, we evaluated best practices in creating a diverse pipeline through partnerships between businesses and HBCUs.     
￼

On July 24th, I had the opportunity to give a guest lecture at the Davidson College Washington Program. I shared my story of political activism and what it means to live the “American Dream” with this brilliant class of Davidson students.  
￼

At the end of the summer, I hosted my Merge Mobility Community Conversation. This was a community discussion on the factors that contribute to economic mobility and how they impact the residents of the 12th District. 
￼
On October 17th, I hosted a Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Panel and Resource Fair. I spoke to attendees about the importance of mental health and ending the stigma that goes along with seeking mental health assistance. 
￼
On November 28th, I met with Governor Cooper and other members of the North Carolina delegation to discuss continued efforts to secure greater funding for Hurricane Florence Recovery. 
￼
On December 3rd, I received the SCORE 2018 House Small Business Champion Award for legislation my colleagues and I passed in the House this year. 
￼

One of my greatest achievements of 2018 was the passing of the 2018 Farm Bill. This legislation will help combat hunger in Mecklenburg County, provide greater resources to HBCUs, and support our local food system - from our farmers markets to our farmers.

￼
To end this wonderful year, I hosted my annual Day of Service at Loaves and Fishes Food Pantry on December 14th. During the day of service, we packed boxes of food to send to food pantries and fight hunger in the 12th District.
￼ 
Hurricane Corner 
During the week of September 9th, our district and state prepared for Hurricane Florence's impact. My staff and I closely monitored the storm throughout the week as it traveled toward our coast, made landfall and impacted our district the weekend of September 14th. During the week I participated in calls with FEMA calls as they briefed all NC leaders on the impact of the storm and their recovery efforts. We worked hard to make sure our constituents were informed and safe. 
￼

Top Photo:  Between monitoring the storms and daily updates to constituents, I visited emergency shelters in our district. I visited North and East Mecklenburg High School and talked with some of the families and individuals who came to Charlotte to escape the brunt of Hurricane Florence. 

Bottom Photo: High school music instructors visited the shelters to provide a bit of musical relief.

Legislative Update 
Introduced Bills
H.R. 6698, The Maternal CARE Act: This bill would support States in their efforts to reduce persistent, racial health disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity by utilizing evidence-based quality improvement programs. To do so, the Maternal CARE Act would create two new grant programs focused on maternal mortality and morbidity with an emphasis on reducing existing racial health disparities.
Learn More
H.R. 6876, the Strengthening Minority-Serving Institutions Act of 2018: This bill would permanently reauthorize mandatory funding for minority-serving institutions under Title III of the Higher Education Act. It would also increase the line-items by $20-30 million. In Fiscal Year 2019, this funding is scheduled to expire, removing $485 million from the budgets of HBCUs, in particular.
Learn More 
H.R. 7066, Army Security Agency Monument Act: This bill would direct the Department of the Army to place a monument honoring the United States Army Security Agency in Arlington National Cemetery. The Agency, which existed between 1945 and 1976, operated as the Army’s signals intelligence branch which monitored and interpreted the military communications of the Soviet Union, China, and their allies.  H.R. 7136, LIVE Well Act: This bill would include eating disorders prevention within the nutrition education and obesity prevention grant program and the local wellness program. The Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program supports nutrition education for SNAP beneficiaries, while the Local Wellness Program helps school districts promote student health within their respective school lunch programs. 
Key Letters 
Letter to Congressional Leadership Opposing Federal Pay Raise Freeze by POTUS: This letter, sent September 7th, expressed opposition to President Trump’s decision to rescind modest statutory pay increases and locality pay increases for federal government employees. Pay increases were included and passed in the Senate-approved Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Bill for FY19.
Letter to OIG regarding ICE subpoenas of voting records in NC: This letter, sent September 7th, expressed concerns about the scope of recent Department of Justice, DOJ, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) subpoenas used for voting records and private information in the Eastern District of North Carolina and requested an investigation to examine the circumstances thereof. Subpoenas requested over 15 million sensitive documents concerning North Carolina voters and appeared to target voters of color. After the letter, the DOJ extended the deadline after North Carolina board of elections’ unanimous objections but requested that election officials send the records by January 2019.
Letter to Appropriators asking for additional deferment money for the HBCU Capital Finance Program: This letter, sent September 5th, asked for the House and Senate Appropriations Committees to provide an additional $10 million in deferment funding for the HBCU Capital Finance Program.  In the Fiscal Year 2018 Omnibus, Rep. Adams and Rep. Ted Budd were able to secure $10 million for 8 schools to defer payments on their HBCU Capital Finance Loan. On September 27th, Congress passed the Labor-HHS-Ed Appropriations bill which included the ask for an additional $10 million, which will assist 7 more schools in deferring loan payments.
Letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at the CBC meeting this week on reforming the Community Reinvestment Act: This letter, sent September 7th, was in continuation of a discussion from the July 12, 2018 House Financial Services Committee Hearing. The letter addressed the persistence of discrimination in lending practices against minorities in spite of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. The letter concluded with three follow up questions regarding the Office of the Comptroller of Currency’s plans to revisit policies and narrow the impact occurrences of discrimination have on a bank’s CRA rating. 
Letter to Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Trump asking for an apology for Christine Blasey Ford Comments: This letter was led by Rep. Adams and sent on September 27th to highlight the disrespectful comments made by Senator McConnell and President Trump regarding Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation against now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. It was written from the perspective of victims of domestic and sexual assault, as all signatories to the letter were.
Letter to Sec. Pompeo expressing concern for the total cut of US funding to the UN Relief and Works Agency: This letter, sent on September 28, was written to urge the administration to reverse its decisions to cut funding to the United Nations Relief Works Agency to reprogram aid away from the West Bank and Gaza. Steps to cut funding would threaten stability in the West Bank/ Gaza regions and undercut the ability of the U.S. to facilitate negotiations. 
Letter to Secretary of State Pompeo opposing the State Department’s decision to strip reproductive rights from its human rights report: This letter, sent on October 1, was written to express opposition to the omission of reproductive rights in the State Department’s Human Rights Practices reports. Congress relies on these reports when considering appropriations for requests of foreign assistance and to inform legislation. The private sector also relies on these reports to inform resource allocations. After this letter, Ranking Member Nita Lowey, Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Rep. Katherine Clark, Ranking Member Eliot Engel, Rep. Barbara Lee, and Rep. Lois Frankel introduced the Reproductive Rights are Human Rights Act. 
Letter to President Trump opposing the EPA proposal to weaken methane leak inspection measure from oil and gas operations: This letter, sent on October 3, expressed concerns with the impact of weakening methane emission controls by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Weakening federal regulations would compromise air quality and adversely affect health. 
Letter to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) Administrator Verma requesting improvement to how the Prior Authorization works under Medicare Advantage: This letter, sent on October 9, expressed concerns with the barriers imposed by prior authorization requirements on patients. Prior authorization is a requirement that physicians obtain approval from health care providers before prescribing a specific medication or performing an operation. 
Letter to HHS Secretary Azar urging resumption of collective bargaining with HHS employees’ union: This letter, sent on October 21, addressed concerns with HHS’ hasty and rushed collective bargaining with employees and its impact on the Department’s ability to serve citizens. In July, the Department carried out two days of negotiations with employee unions before declaring an impasse. After this letter, employees picketed the Department and the Federal Services Impasses Panel subsequently coordinated an additional 30-day period in which the Department could carry out additional bargaining.
Letter to Secretary Pompeo about the Brazilian election and reinforcing the need for protection of basic human rights and democratic values: This letter, sent on October 26, expressed concerns regarding Brazilian presidential candidate Bolsonaro and the threat his election would pose to human rights and democracy.  Bolsonaro’s campaign was marked by political violence and his support for military governance. After this letter, Bolsonaro was elected on October 28, 2018. 
Letter to Chairman Pai regarding expanding the availability of 1.4 GHz spectrum band for wireless medical telemetry service (WMTS), including remote healthcare monitoring devices: This letter, sent on October 18, asked that Chairman Pai act quickly when expanding access to 1.4 GHz band for WMTS. This expansion will allow more hospitals and patients in rural areas to use remote healthcare devices.   Amicus Brief opposing the President’s illegal national monuments rollbacks last year: This brief, sent on November 19, was submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to challenge the Trump Administration’s decision to diminish the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments. The brief argued that under the Antiquities Act, Congress has only permitted the President to designate monuments, not to abolish or reduce them. After this letter, several Native American tribes and government entities also entered into litigation against the Administration. 
Letter to Secretary DeVos raising concerns about the new Title IX guidance: This letter, sent on November 29, was written expressing concerns about DeVos’ new Title IX rule which would diminish essential protections for victims of sexual harassment and assault in K-12 and collegiate education. The deadline to submit public comments on the guidance papers will stay open until January 2019. Advocacy groups, universities, and individuals are flocking to leave their comments of opposition. 
Letter to Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi supporting Agriculture Disaster funding for Hurricane Florence and Michael: This letter, sent on November 28, was written to request disaster assistance appropriations for agriculture producers. Disaster Assistance helps many vulnerable farmers avoid bankruptcy and continue food production. 
Letter to Senate Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer on Thomas Farr Nomination: This letter, sent on November 27, was written by Rep. Adams and joined by her colleagues in the North Carolina congressional delegation to express disapproval of Thomas Farr, the nominee for the U.S. Eastern District Court of North Carolina. Thomas Farr has supported several initiatives which threaten the civil rights of American people, and especially those of African Americans. After this letter, Farr’s nomination was defeated by the U.S. Senate and will expire on January 2nd.
Letter to DHS requesting an investigation into the Trump Administration’s decision to terminate TPS: This letter, sent on November 29, was written to investigate the abrupt termination of TPS status in several Central American countries. TPS is a humanitarian program which grants temporary protection to nationals of countries that have been destabilized by war or catastrophe. As crises have persisted throughout El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, Trump’s decision to curtail TPS protection threatens the safety and health of hundreds of thousands of individuals and families.  
Letter to Express Opposition to the Trump Administration’s Issuance of Permits for Surveys to Assess Offshore Drilling: This letter, sent on December 6 to the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior, expresses concern regarding the Trump Administration’s recent decision to issue five Incidental Harassment Authorization permits for companies planning to conduct seismic geological and geophysical surveys along the Atlantic coast – a major step toward offshore oil and gas drilling. Studies have shown that offshore drilling activities have led to the disruption of a wide range of marine habitats that support economies along the coast.
Congressional Black Caucus Letter to Express Opposition to Proposed Change to Public Charge Determinations: This letter, sent on December 10, expressed concern regarding the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) proposed rule that would make it more difficult for immigrants of color to be admitted into the United States. Public Charge determinations are made based on a variety of factors that assess an immigrant’s likelihood to be dependent on public benefits, however, the interpretation of what constitutes a benefit was left for courts to decide. DHS’s proposed rule creates a list of programs for the first time and would force previously excluded populations such as refugees to undergo the analysis.

Dear friends,
This is my final e-newsletter as a member of Congress. I’ve enjoyed communicating with you and thousands of other subscribers and appreciate your kind attention and thoughtful feedback.  Let me begin by thanking you, from the bottom of my heart, for giving me the opportunity to represent you in Congress for the past eight years. When I first ran for Congress in 2010, very few people knew who I was and even fewer people gave me a chance to win.  But you listened to me in the same way I listened to you.  You stood by me in the same way I stood by you. You sent me to Washington to fight for you; to stand strong for conservative values; to help preserve this wonderful country.  I have worked every day to be worthy of your trust, and I am grateful for the trust you have repeatedly placed in me.  
￼
 I leave Congress more humbled than anything else. Over 800,000 people live in Idaho’s First Congressional District. And we are a very opinionated group of people (which is great). Tapping into your advice and counsel was a constant priority of mine, because I knew I couldn’t do it alone. That’s why I hosted scores of town halls over the past eight years, covering all 19 counties and towns from Meridian to Weiser, Cottonwood to Lewiston and Coeur d’Alene to Bonners Ferry. In these eight years, I received over 500,000 contacts from Idahoans who called, wrote, emailed, or faxed my office about issues ranging from the border wall to gun control, from wildfires to the President’s tweets. You cared enough about our country to contact me directly, and because of that, you made me a better congressman.  My favorite part of the job was being able to help Idahoans directly when you had a problem with a federal agency. Every day, Idahoans contacted my office seeking help with agencies such as the IRS, the VA, the SSA, and the BLM. When dealing with these agencies, I instructed my staff to be persistent, yet professional, and to “never take the first ‘no’ for an answer.” It’s one of the main reasons Newsmax named me one of the “25 hardest working members of Congress.”  Since 2011, my office has handled over 1,000 constituent service cases per year, with more than half of those cases involving veterans. We recovered over $10 million in benefits, including retroactive pay, reimbursement for medical expenses, new benefit awards, disability claims, pensions and more.  One of my proudest accomplishments originated in a casework request. In 2013, Navy Capt. Edward Hill and his wife Heidi contacted my office because of an issue they were having with the VA. Their daughter, Shauna, tragically died at age 16 in a car accident. The Hills tried to transfer their veterans’ education benefits to their surviving daughter, but they were told it was impossible. I sought an administrative fix, but soon discovered the law prohibited a transfer. So I set out to change the law.  In February 2017, I introduced the Shauna Hill Post 9/11 Education Benefits Transferability Act, which would permit the reassignment of benefits for veterans’ families. Six month later, President Trump signed my bill into law as part of a larger veterans’ education bill.
￼
 (Capt. Edward Hill, who served 28 years in the Navy, lives in Eagle with his wife, Heidi)
I also am proud of having passed legislation to help ranchers graze their livestock on federal lands and a bill providing for a gun range in Idaho County. I have been a strong voice for modernizing our immigration laws, tough but fair reforms to our criminal justice system (which passed Congress this month), and slowing the dangerous rise in our federal debt.  Looking ahead, I plan on remaining involved in the political process and fighting for Idaho values – it just won’t be from Congress.  I feel that eight years was the right amount of time for me in the House.  Some members, in my opinion, stay too long, blocking the way for new members who can confront issues with a new approach.  I don’t believe in career politicians, but I do believe our country is stronger when every citizen is involved in the political process.  An engaged citizenry is critical to our country’s future.  We know that in Idaho, and I hope it stays that way.  To conclude, we are blessed to live in the greatest country on Earth and the greatest country in history. Growing up as the son of a single mom from Puerto Rico, I would never have imagined I would have the opportunity to serve in Congress.  Thank you for making that dream possible. Thank you for your support and friendship, and I look forward to strengthening that friendship in the days and years to come. 
￼
 May God bless you, and may God continue to bless America.  Happy New Year!
Thank you,
￼

12/31/18 13:52,The DeSaulnier Digest: Looking Back on 2018 🗓,"
 
￼
￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ 

Dear Lindsey: 
As 2018 comes to a close, we wanted to take a moment to look back on all that we have accomplished for Contra Costa County and our country, and find out what you'd like to hear from me about in the coming year.  Among our many accomplishments in 2018, we have:
	•	Added an additional 40 acres of recreational space to the John Muir National Historic Site in Martinez;
	•	Renamed the Nevin Avenue Post Office after a distinguished member of the Richmond community-Harold D. McCraw Sr. after we helped save it from closure;
	•	Created a blueprint for action to put America's workforce on a pathway to success;
	•	Passed a law to decrease fraudulent opioid prescriptions and prevent doctor shopping;
	•	Increased national investment in transportation projects and enacted policies to make our aviation system safer;
	•	Fought back against efforts to erode environmental protections;
	•	Defeated the building of a immigrant detention center at the former Concord Naval Weapons Station; and 
	•	Honored local Korean War Veterans for their service during the Forgotten War. 
A snapshot of our work is included below. 
￼ 
Additionally, next year we will continue the tradition of hosting issue-specific town halls. Please take a few moments to share your thoughts.  
￼ 
As always, I am proud to represent such an engaged and informed community. Many of these accomplishments would not have been possible without your input, and I look forward to continuing to work on your behalf for the next two years--this time in the Majority! 
Sincerely, ￼ Mark DeSaulnier Member of Congress

Thanks for the opportunity to serve you in Congress
Dear Friend:
It has been a great honor for me to serve the constituents of the 6th Congressional District for the last ten years.  As you may well recall, when I was first elected in 2008, the sixth was redrawn following the 2012 redistricting process. The district that I represented, starting in January of 2013, was dramatically different by its diversity.  This newly redrawn district covered all of Aurora. This meant the district now included large Hispanic, African, and Asian immigrant communities. I worked hard to understand these communities, particularly their challenges, their values, and their religious faiths. Reaching out to them not only made me a better Congressman, as I gained an understanding of the issues that were important to them, but it made me a better, more understanding, and compassionate human being.  Having a combined 21 years in the military between the U.S. Army, the Marine Corps, and their reserve components, I was honored to serve on both the House Armed Services Committee and on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. On Armed Services, I worked hard to make sure that we had the best led, best equipped, and best trained military in the world. On Veterans Affairs, I worked to see that our nation met its obligations to the men and women who have worn the uniform and who have made extraordinary sacrifices in defense of our freedom.  Few Americans have the privilege of serving in Congress, and to think that the son of a career enlisted soldier who grew up in Aurora and dropped out of high school to join the U.S. Army, would be one of them, speaks to all that is possible in this country through hard work and determination.  Again, thanks for the opportunity to serve you in Congress.
Sincerely, 
￼

Looking Toward the New Year and New Congress
With the New Year and new Congress on the horizon, it is my hope that 2019 will usher in a sense of urgency and renewed commitment to civility. 
Still today, too many hardworking Ohioans and middle-class families are struggling to make ends meet and want Congress to do something about it. They want better wages, better jobs, and a better future. 
They want affordable, high-quality healthcare, education, and childcare. They want to be able to pay their bills, afford a mortgage, save a few extra dollars at the end of the month, and equal opportunity at the American Dream. Finally, and equally as important, they want a government that is accountable to the people. 
In that spirit, I will work in Congress with Democrats and Republicans to deliver real progress on these issues and the many economic, social, and global challenges facing our country.
Unfortunately, civility and bipartisanship are sorely missing right now. It is time we move beyond the divisive and hurtful rhetoric poisoning our political landscape and realize we are ALL Americans first and foremost. Violence cannot be the answer. That is why I will continue to fight in D.C. and Central Ohio to be a bridge builder and spearhead efforts in Congress to ratchet down the rhetoric. 
I look forward to talking, listening and working with you in the weeks and months ahead to make these goals a reality.
Best wishes in the New Year! 
Sincerely,

Friends,  As I reflect on the last 12 months, I'm reminded that 2018 was filled with many productive events and meetings, countless conversations and discussions with new friends and old, and plenty of wonderful memories. I'm truly blessed to work for you and represent Northwest Georgia in Washington!   Here are some of the highlights from the last year: 
￼
It was fun visiting the Boys & Girls Club in Paulding County in January.


￼
I enjoyed meeting a group of bright young students from Berry Middle School after their Capitol tour in February.


￼
In March, it was great to host the Rome Floyd Chamber in my D.C. office during their annual trip to Washington.


￼
My office hosted a Local Government Services Day in Paulding County in April. The high caliber and deep commitment of our local leadership in Northwest Georgia is truly impressive.


￼
In April, I also held a reception at the Murray Arts Council for the winners of the annual 14th District Congressional Art Competition. These young artists are extremely gifted.


￼
I was honored to speak at the Chatsworth-Murray County Chamber of Commerce Annual Luncheon in May.


￼
In June, I held a send-off dinner in Calhoun to honor the students from the 14th Congressional District who were appointed this year to attend a U.S. military academy. Each of these students demonstrated through an extremely rigorous process that they have the leadership skills, integrity and drive to earn success in our nation’s academies.


￼
In July, the House passed my bill to fund our nation's financial infrastructure - such as the Treasury Department and Securities and Exchange Commission - as well as create the Fund for America's Kids and Grandkids, which functions like a savings account for future generations.  


￼
I appreciate the team at Metro Boiler Tube Company, Inc. in Ringgold for inviting me out to the plant in August. These hard-working men and women keep Northwest Georgia thriving!


￼
I was also grateful to join Governor Nathan Deal, Georgia Ports Authority and community officials at the ribbon cutting for the Appalachian Regional Port in Crandall in August. This investment between government and the private sector will pay major dividends in the form of jobs and economic development in Northwest Georgia for years to come.


￼
In September, I spoke at the Boost Your Business event in Dalton, which was hosted by Facebook and the Greater Dalton Chamber of Commerce. As we transition to a more digitally-based economy, we must ensure small businesses aren’t left behind.


￼
I hosted my fifth annual Youth Leadership Summit in October. More than 500 high school students from across Northwest Georgia attended!


￼
In November, I was honored to host a breakfast for Northwest Georgia veterans at the Filling Station in Dalton on Veterans Day. America remains the land of the free because of these brave men and women.


￼
This month, it was great to meet with Mick Mulvaney who was recently appointed as President Trump's chief of staff. 

Thank you for giving me the honor to represent you in Congress. I'm wishing you and your family a happy and healthy New Year! 
 Freedom First,
￼
Congressman Tom Graves

12/31/18 10:13,Notes From The Capital: December 2018,"￼

 Hello,  On the last day of 2018, I'm thinking about the past year, and all that's happened.  People tend to use two phrases to describe what this year has been like for me: ""whirlwind"" and ""hit the ground running.""  The whirlwind was showing up in Washington almost exactly a year ago to meet with my new colleagues and staff, have dinner with Al and Franni, and, amazingly, find a place to live in an hour and a half. The whirlwind was the hundreds of meetings with Minnesotans—there were times when I fit 17 different meetings into one day. The whirlwind was going to dozens and dozens of committee hearings, helping pass the strong, bipartisan Farm Bill and bipartisan legislation to address the opioid epidemic into law, and hosting my first Minnesota Congressional Hotdish Competition. I only wish I could have slowed the whirlwind down and remember every single minute.  Sometimes when people say, ""you really hit the ground running,"" I remember the time when I was a Senate intern in Washington, and I literally fell down the Capitol steps in my hurry, papers flying, grateful that I was wearing pants that day. That's what it has felt like sometimes as a new Senator. There was the time I went off to find lunch and ended up in a corner of the basement in the Russell office building, completely confused about where I was. Or the time one of my colleagues from a southern state, as we were riding up in the ""Senators Only"" elevator, smiled at me and said, ""you must be a big Packers fan!"" I smiled back and said, ""well, I'm actually partial to the Vikings!"" He looked befuddled—another case of mistaken identity.  I'm most proud of the thousands of constituent questions we answered and problems we helped solve. And if hitting the ground running means that I ran my heart out to accomplish good things for Minnesota, even in a year when most people said nothing could get done in Washington, then yes, I did hit the ground running.  I wish you all a joyful New Year. I've been gathering my strength and purpose for the year ahead, and hope you have too. We are all going to need it!  —Tina

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 12.31.18
Monday, December 31, 2018 –                                 
1619 and Today
The year 1619 does not loom as large in American memory as some others from our colonial experience. When thinking of those early times of English settlement in North America, 1607, the year Jamestown was founded, and 1620, when the Pilgrims landed in what is now Massachusetts, are more likely to come to mind. 
Yet the events of 1619 had a profound impact. They are worth remembering as we enter 2019 and mark the passage of 400 years.
One of them was a great stain: the beginning of slavery in English North America, with the first record of enslaved Africans arriving in Jamestown. While slavery ended with the Thirteenth Amendment passed by a Republican Congress in 1865 and subsequently ratified by the states, its effects still linger.
Another event marked a major shift in the culture of Jamestown: the first large-scale recruitment of women to the colony. While some women had arrived earlier, the settlement retained the overall character of the soldiers and adventurers who had first established it. The Virginia Company’s recruitment of about 90 women introduced families into the social fabric of the colony and gave it longer-term prospects.
A third event was one of our Commonwealth’s signal contributions to the American story.
In a church in Jamestown on July 30, the Governor, four councilors, and 22 burgesses representing the colony’s jurisdictions gathered. They reviewed the laws imposed by the Virginia Company and its charter, regulated commerce and settler conduct, and heard grievances from the colonists.
That first session lasted less than a week, adjourning on August 4 due to the summer heat, but it was the beginning of what is today the House of Delegates, the oldest elected legislative body to have continuously met in the world.
I say “continuously met” as, although the Parliament of the United Kingdom has older roots than our House of Delegates (the rules of that first Assembly were modeled on English parliamentary procedure), during the rule of Oliver Cromwell in the 1650s Parliament was dissolved and substituted with the appointed “Barebones Parliament” and the “Protectorate Parliaments.”
Other legislative bodies had appointed members, but from the start, the House of Delegates was elected by at least a portion of its constituents. In the case of the first session, the male freeholders and tenants of the jurisdictions chose the burgesses.
Even if you take out continuously-serving and elected, Virginia’s House of Delegates, which was subsequently confirmed in a charter by King James I a couple of years later, is without dispute the oldest legislative body in the New World.
The establishment of representative government in Virginia charted a path for what would become the thirteen British colonies. It was followed by the Mayflower Compact of 1620, in which the Pilgrims organized themselves as a self-governing body. Colonies that followed set up their own institutions for representative government. Instead of the mother country, the colonists exercised control over their own affairs to a large extent.
Because Virginia had a lot of practice with representative government, our Commonwealth was ready to lead when the colonies sought independence. Virginia’s governing documents and laws, including the Declaration of Rights and the Statute for Religious Freedom, would shape foundations of the new republic such as the Bill of Rights.
Among the Founders who served in the House of Burgesses or, as it became known after declaring independence from Britain, the House of Delegates were George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Patrick Henry, George Mason, and James Monroe.
As we begin the new year, think about what was happening in Virginia 400 years ago. That span of time may be hard to fathom, but what happened that year still shapes us.
Slavery’s introduction reminds us that human beings are capable of great cruelty to each other. The birth of representative government in the New World was a great accomplishment of humanity. It started the process toward our current republic based on democratic principles. The legislative process ultimately abolished slavery through the Thirteenth Amendment and guaranteed the right to vote for women through the Nineteenth Amendment, showing that our nation is always capable of improving.
The events of 1619 resonate down to our own time.
While 2019 is not as likely to have the historical significance of 1619, I hope it will be a happy and prosperous year for us all.

12/31/18 10:04,2018 In Review,"￼ 
  

Looking Back on 2018
Following a record-setting year is never easy, but 2018 has brought just as many wins as 2017. Congress passed several landmark bills that were signed into law, our economy grew mightily and Wisconsin's unemployment rate hit an all-time low.
 
Here are some of my highlights from the past year:
                                 
January

One of the first things I did to start off the 2018 Congress was take to the floor of the House to speak in support of the sanctity of human life and rights of the unborn. We have a moral and civic duty to protect those who are voiceless and defenseless, namely our unborn children.

￼


Shortly after, the House passed H.R. 4712, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.This bill 1) Requires health care practitioners to do all they can to preserve the life of the child as they would other babies born prematurely and requires the practitioner to ensure that the child is immediately transferred and admitted to the hospital, 2) Establishes strong criminal penalties for anyone who intentionally kills, or attempts to kill, a child born alive and 3) Allows the woman upon whom the abortion was performed or attempted to obtain appropriate relief through civil action. Read more about the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act by clicking here.

I also met several great pro-life Wisconsinites at the March for Life in Washington, D.C. It is always so heartening to see the outpouring of support for the pro-life movement, especially from the younger generation.

￼

At the end of the month, Congress passed a bipartisan bill to fund the military. This bill included a well-deserved  pay raise for troops as well as much-needed updates to our missile defense systems. Read more here.

February

There were plenty of Wisconsinites at the Winter Olympics!

I was honored to participate in the nation's first Rural Prosperity Roundtable in Ripon. This national initiative, led by USDA Assistant to the Secretary for Rural Development, Anne Hazlett, intends to draw attention to the unique challenges facing rural America, and focus on solutions that work for everyone. Thanks to Ripon College for hosting!

￼

Unfortunately, February was the last month office dog Todd was with us before his big move to California.

￼


We lost Reverend Billy Graham. A good man who who helped many people find hope through Christ.

￼
 

March

I voted for the STOP School Violence Act, which passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support. This bill invests in early intervention and prevention programs in our local schools, so that our communities and police officers can be partners in preventing violent events from happening. This means that students, teachers and law enforcement receive the tools and training they need to better identify the warning signs of a violent individual and how to react when they see something that is not right. 

￼


I introduced two bills that will give children, parents, teachers, faculty and law enforcement the resources they need to make sure their campus' are safe and secure. The Student and Teacher Safety Act allows schools more flexibility with existing federal funds to make physical safety improvements to campus facilities, support local education programs aimed at improving school safety and security and assist in coordination between schools and local law enforcement to identify threats. To read more, please click here. The Make Schools Safe Again Act prohibits the Secretary of Education or the Attorney General from authorizing agreements between schools and law enforcement agencies to encourage the non-reporting of criminal activity of students, a precedent set forth by the Obama administration. To read more, please click here.
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke traveled to Horicon, WI to announce more than $1.1 billion in annual national funding for state wildlife agencies. While visiting the Horicon Marsh State Wildlife Area, Secretary Zinke presented a ceremonial check to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for nearly $35 million. I thanked Secretary Zinke for being a leader on sportsmen’s conservation efforts and am honored that he chose Horicon to make this announcement. This investment in our natural resources ensures that Wisconsinites will be able to enjoy everything our beautiful state has to offer for generations to come. For more information, please click here. 
￼
I had been fighting to bring ""Right to Try"" legislation to the House floor for quite some time. ""Right to Try"" allows terminally ill patients who have exhausted all other treatment options the opportunity to try medications that have passed basic Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety protocols, but have not received final approval for public use. The law does not require any individual to participate in the program, but instead give those with no other options one last chance. After several conversations with my friend, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-OR), the House passed ""Right to Try"" legislation with bipartisan support! This bill, originally introduced by Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI), is a big win for American health care. To me, voting for this bill was easy. It was important to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry that opposed this bill and make sure that those with terminal illnesses have the access to these treatments that could save lives and potentially reveal cures to major diseases.
P.S. As we closed out March, Wisconsin's unemployment rate hit a record low of 2.9 percent!
April
In early April, we were greeted with the news that Speaker Ryan would retire from Congress at the end of the year. I first met Paul at GOP events in Wisconsin and could not be more impressed with his enthusiasm, sincerity and knowledge. As Speaker, possibly his greatest achievement was ushering in the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act -  which was quick to bring middle-class families benefits. This productive step forward has not been done in about 30 years! For more on my thoughts about Paul, read my op-ed.

￼
                                 Speaker Ryan with Congressman Grothman and his family

Due to the nature of this job, members of Congress often receive information on actions that will be taken up by Congress before the general public does. It was brought to my attention that some members, both Republicans and Democrats, decide to use this information for personal financial gain. In the private sector, this is called insider trading and it is strictly illegal. That is why I introduced The Member Financial Transparency Act, which requires members of Congress to file reports to either the House or Senate Ethics Committee on transactions in stocks, bonds, commodities futures and other forms of securities no later than seven days after the transactions are completed. The bill also modifies the deadline period for the House Clerk and Senate Secretary to make these reports public no later than 10 days after receipt. I believe that members of Congress on both sides of the aisle should stop providing themselves with special rules and play by the same ones as everyone else in the stock market.

April 17- This was the last time you'll ever have to worry about the old, outdated tax code! The next time you file your taxes, it will be under the modern rules of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was written with middle class families in mind.
May
There are two air quality monitors in Sheboygan County. The Kohler-Andrae monitor is upwind from the key sources of ozone in the County and therefore detects ozone from major sources to the south, such as Chicago, Indiana, Michigan and other counties. The Haven monitor is downwind from the key ozone sources and therefore detects the actual ozone levels in Sheboygan County. The problem for the county is that Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chooses to rely on the Kohler-Andrae monitor. This results in the County failing to maintain acceptable ozone standards, in the process triggering devastating regulations. In other words, Sheboygan County is currently being penalized for Chicago's pollution. That is why I held a field briefing with the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in Sheboygan County in order to bring more awareness to this error in judgement by the EPA. Read more here.  
￼

Also in May, I was joined by local health officials, community leaders and concerned citizens for a roundtable in Oshkosh to discuss the opioid abuse epidemic in our country and what we can to help fight it.

￼
After my roundtable discussion, I introduced a bill that will help fight the epidemic of opioid abuse in America. The Responsible Opioid Prescription Act limits distribution of opioids at the source by aligning Medicaid’s prescribing guidelines with the recommendations of the Center for Disease Control. When a patient receives more medication than is needed, two things can happen. First, they may take the medication until the bottle is empty because they were told to by a doctor, at which point they may develop a dependency. Second, when opioids get left in a medicine cabinet, an adolescent, relative or visitor can access them or distribute them for recreational use. For more information, please click here.
We had a big health care win when Senator Ron Johnson's bipartisan “Right to Try” bill was signed into law by President Trump. ""Right to Try"" allows terminally ill patients who have exhausted all other treatment options the opportunity to try medications that have passed basic Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety protocols, but have not received final approval for public use. The law does not require any individual to participate in the program, but instead gives those with no other options one last chance. 
￼
 June  According to the National Institute of Health, fentanyl-related deaths have been rising at an alarming rate, jumping from about 2,500 in 2013 to over 20,000 in 2016. That is why I introduced a bill that amends the Controlled Substances Act to decrease the amount of fentanyl that carries a minimum five-year sentence from ten grams to two grams. The laws already on the books aren’t discouraging people from dealing and taking massive quantities of fentanyl. It’s time to try something new. I believe this bill will benefit communities and families in Wisconsin by keeping both criminals and fentanyl off the streets. To read more about the dangerous drug fentanyl, please click here.
June's theme in Congress was to do make a big push to fight the opioid crisis by passing several bills to combat the problem. I am proud to say that of the three bills I have introduced to address this problem, one passed the House in June, the Improving the Federal Response to Families Impacted by Substance Use Disorder Act. This bill creates a federal inter-agency task force to coordinate with local communities on best practices and new ways to combat the growing opioid abuse epidemic. This bill passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support by a vote of 409-8. To watch me speak about my bill on the House floor, please click here. 
￼

In light of comments made by a California Member of Congress, and general incivility on both sides of the aisle, I joined a bipartisan group of nearly 150 Congressmen in a commitment to civility.

￼

Congratulations to Hailey Donahue of Fond du Lac! She was the Sixth District's winner of the Congressional Art Competition. This talented artist’s work is still displayed in the Capitol.

￼

By the way, June is a great time to visit Washington and take a tour of the Capitol. Here are some of the families that stopped by my office!

￼
July
I strongly believe in upholding the Constitution and promoting the ideas that have made America great. The job of the Supreme Court is to interpret the law. The Court is not meant to be filled with activists and ideologues, but with men and women who understand the law and know when the government has overstepped its bounds.That is why I was pleased that President Trump nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, replacing the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. During his career, Kavanaugh has staunchly defended the Constitution, making sure overzealous laws and regulations do not infringe on our freedoms.

Lakeshore Technical College (LTC) is a top-notch technical school located in the heart of the sixth district, Cleveland, WI. I was thrilled that they were able to make the trip to Washington, D.C. for the House Committee on Education and the Workforce's ""Innovation Forum and Showcase"" to discuss career and technical education and the positive career outlook that follows for the students. LTC set up a live, interactive booth in the Rayburn House Office Building to showcase their work in robotics. In the afternoon, Dr. Carlsen gave live testimony before Congress on the benefits of a technical education and career in the skilled labor market. To watch my discussion with Dr. Carlsen, please click here.
￼

While on the topic of skilled labor, as you may know, there is a nationwide shortage. This includes pipe-fitters, welders and manufacturing workers. Wisconsin's sixth district is home to more manufacturing jobs than any other in the country, so while Wisconsin is enjoying record-low unemployment, we can still do better. That is why it was so important that the House and Senate passed H.R. 2353, a bill to reauthorize and modernize our CTE programs, with overwhelming bipartisan support. This bill removes burdensome government red tape from CTE programs and makes it easier for students to learn the skills they need to acquire a good, well-paying job in the skilled workforce. For a short summary of the bill, please click here.
August  Shortly after it passed the House and Senate, President Trump signed H.R. 2353 into law! 
￼

Secretary Zinke made another trip to Wisconsin this month. Our first stop was in Sheboygan, where we had lunch with local leaders and volunteers from wildlife conservation groups. We were able to survey Lake Michigan and show Secretary Zinke how much cleaner it is than 20 years ago. Our next stop was in Theinsville, the town I grew up in (go Highlanders!). We visited the Theinsville Dam and Fishway, where we discussed the Asian Carp problem. Asian Carp is an invasive species that is quickly destroying the natural ecosystem in the Great Lakes.

This summer, the unemployment rate among young Americans fell to the lowest level we've seen in over half a century! This year, Americans between the ages of 16-24 have experienced access to more opportunities now than they have in several years. As companies and organizations nationwide experience the positive impact brought about by policies such as Tax Reform, more young individuals are being hired and gaining valuable workforce experience. The job market is booming and I urge our nation's young professionals to take advantage of the opportunities presented through widespread economic growth.

￼
September
I, along with several of my colleagues, introduced a bipartisan resolution stressing the importance of recognizing the Hmong New Year Celebration. The Hmong people represent a significant population in multiple states across the country, most prominently Wisconsin, California and Minnesota. The 6th District is home to three of Wisconsin’s largest Hmong communities in Sheboygan, Manitowoc and Oshkosh. The Hmong people have come to play an important role in the 6th District and Wisconsin’s communities, operating small businesses, rising as community leaders, and pursuing the American Dream. This resolution is not only necessary because of the representation it gives to important Hmong traditions and cultural celebrations, but also due to the significance of the Hmong population as a whole in the Wisconsin's 6th district. I appreciate the positive impact the Hmong people have on the district, the state and nationwide. 
￼
I joined the USO to help assemble care packages for military spouses. The sacrifice that military personnel and their loved ones make every day is deeply appreciated. 
￼
I was honored to be recognized as a Hero of Main Street by the National Retail Federation for my continued support of policies that help local businesses and retailers! 
￼
My D.C. office teamed up with the Stars and Stripes Honor Flight organization and the Dream Foundation to welcome Vietnam veteran and WI resident, Lou Dehnert, to Washington to pay his respects at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Lou is terminally ill and previously had not visited Washington, D.C. He has always wanted to see the memorial to give one last goodbye to his friends with whom he served courageously. Lou served in Motor Pool Operations in the 528th unit from 1969-72. My Legislative Director, Ryan Croft, a veteran himself, was in attendance to present Lou with his Vietnam Commemoration Pin. His courage, bravery and devotion to his country will never be forgotten.  
￼
October  As you may know, one of the biggest fights I have taken up in Washington has been on behalf of individuals with disabilities and their right to find meaningful, dignified work. That is why it was a pleasure to host Assistant Secretary of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services, Johnny Collett, to the sixth district to tour work centers specialized in providing employment opportunities and rehabilitation services to those with disabilities. I have long advocated for increasing efforts to help those with special needs find employment and workplace opportunities. The Assistant Secretary and I visited three different work centers, Brooke Industries, RCS Empowers, and Lakeside Packaging Plus. These organizations offer a wide variety of services to those with special needs and their families so that they have the opportunity to lead lives of fulfillment. To read more about my visit with Assistant Secretary Collett and the organizations, click here.

November
As the 115th Congress comes to a close, I want to take a moment to reflect on the actions taken and progress made throughout this session. The 115th Congress made huge strides for the well-being of our citizens and nation as a whole.  
￼

The House of Representatives passed H.R. 6784, the Manage Our Wolves Act. I cosponsored and voted for this bill because it is important to the sixth district and the state of Wisconsin. Since 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has actively worked to remove the gray wolf from the endangered species list based on the overwhelming scientific evidence that the species has recovered drastically in recent years. Wisconsin and other states have shown that they have the ability to manage wolf populations at the state level and keep them at a healthy, sustainable degree. There is no reason for farmers livestock to be at risk and for residents to lose their beloved dogs and cats when Wisconsin can maintain a healthy wolf population at the state level. Voting to remove wolves from the Endangered Species List and put control back into the hands of the states gives farmers and residents the peace of mind that they deserve.
Remember in August when Secretary Zinke came to Wisconsin and we discussed the Asian Carp problem? Well, Representative Mark Pocan (D-Madison) and I teamed up to introduce a bipartisan bill that will help keep Wisconsin's waterways healthy by restricting the access of invasive species of fish. The bill, H.R. 7170, amends the Federal Power Act to ensure that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to consider the threats posed to Wisconsin's waterways by invasive species of fish prior to authorizing the construction of a new fishway. Wisconsin experiences this problem firsthand with Asian Carp, a well known invasive species that can grow up to three feet in length. Recently, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ordered the installation of a fishway at the Prarie du Sac dam, a site where Asian Carp populations have been spotted. Installing a fishway in this location would allow the Asian Carp to migrate upstream to the Wisconsin River, Lake Wisconsin and eventually the Great Lakes. This would wreak havoc on native species and threaten the Great Lakes $7 billion fishing industry. Federal decision makers need to consider all possible consequences before ordering the installation of new fishways. I am proud to promote legislation that brings awareness to this issue and helps protect Wisconsin's native fish species and waterways. For more information, please click here.  President Trump, along with Prime Minister Trudeau and President Pena Nieto, officially signed the United States-Mexica-Canada Agreement (USMCA) at the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The trade agreement now makes its way to the U.S. International Trade Commission to assess the economic impact of the deal and to Congress for approval, which will likely be determined  in the new session beginning in January. The trade deal is good news for dairy farmers in Wisconsin who have struggled significantly over recent months. The deal will allow the US to export the equivalent of 3.6% of Canada's dairy market, up from the existing level of about 1%. Additionally, Canada eliminated its Class 6 and 7 pricing systems which allowed low priced dairy ingredients to undersell United States dairy sales in Canada.   December  We said farewell to former President George H.W. Bush. President Bush was an outstanding man and an honorable President. He will be remembered for being a war hero, a patriot, a family man, and someone who stood up for the values and ideals of our beautiful nation. 41 was a pioneer of U.S. foreign policy, helping us shape and improve many of our relationships abroad. He helped bring an end to the Cold War and led us to victory in the Gulf War. He was bold, compassionate, and always put his country first. My deepest condolences and prayers go out to the Bush family for their loss. 
￼
Congress passed and President Trump quickly signed the Farm Bill into law. The 2018 farm bill supports farmers, protects crop insurance and conservation programs, invests in efforts to expand foreign markets and prioritizes agricultural research and rural development. This bill is critical to providing all stakeholders, including farmers, ranchers and consumers, as well as the sectors and industries that rely on them, with a consistent playing field over the next five years. Not only does it provide farmers with stability and support, but it also addresses the needs of the modern farming industry. One of the changes made to dairy policy in the new Farm Bill requires the USDA to establish regionally located dairy innovation centers to assist dairy farmers with diversifying their products to appeal to the modern market. Additionally, the new Farm Bill legalized and provided crop insurance for industrial hemp, a commodity that I have been fighting for, and will boost Wisconsin's agricultural outputs. Overall, the Farm Bill addresses many of the contemporary concerns of the agriculture industry and provides stability to farmers across the country.   It's been a productive 2018, and I thank you all for your support. It's truly an honor to serve you in Congress. As we enter the 116th Congress, I hope that my Democrat friends will reach across the aisle as Republicans have done over the past two years to pass a record number of bills through the House. Additionally, in the new Congress I have changed offices. If you visited Washington, D.C. at some point over the last two years, you may remember that I was in room 1217 Longworth. My staff and I have relocated to room 1427 in the Longworth building. Please don't hesitate to contact my staff for a White House or Capitol tour.  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

￼
 Sincerely, 
￼
 Glenn Grothman Member of Congress

12/31/18 9:30,An update from Congressman Chris Collins,"￼ 
My Friend,
Here is a quick update on what I have been working on during a busy few weeks in Washington D.C. and Western New York.

￼ 

Collins Bill Renaming Post Office In Honor Of Staff Sergeant Alexandria Gleason-Morrow Becomes Law
￼ 
President Donald Trump signed into law my legislation to re-name the U.S. post office in Dansville, NY after Staff Sergeant Alexandria Gleason-Morrow who was killed in the line of duty March 22, 2017, while serving in Jordan. SSgt Gleason-Morrow enlisted in the United States Air Force after graduating from Dansville Senior High School. She was assigned to the 366th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, and was deployed to Jordan during Operation Inherent Resolve. Renaming the postal facility in Dansville after SSgt Gleason-Morrow stands as a lasting tribute to her bravery, heroism, and sacrifice for our country.

Collins Announces $777,943 In Federal Transit Administration Grant Funding For Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority 
Recently I was able to help the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA) secure $777,943 in federal funding through the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) Transit-Oriented Development Pilot Planning Program. The FTA's program is designed to support the comprehensive planning associated with new fixed guideway and core capacity improvement projects. The NFTA will use this federal grant to zone for mix-used development along the Amherst-Buffalo Corridor Light Rail Extension Project, which is a proposed extension of the area's light rail system. The planning effort also includes steps to establish a Transit-Oriented Development Fund, and implement value capture mechanisms.

President Trump Signs 2018 Farm Bill
I applaud President Donald Trump for signing H.R 2, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (The Farm Bill) into law. This legislation will strengthen and grow Western New York dairy economy that has faced challenges in recent years. Dairy farmers will receive better coverage through the Margin Protection Program (MPP) and will be able to participate in livestock and dairy protection programs through the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) Program.

President Trump Signs United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
I applaud President Donald Trump for signing a new United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA). The USMCA made significant changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and has put the United States on more equal footing with the other nations. Thanks to President Trump and the USMCA, Western New York dairy farmers will now be able to compete fairly in Canada, and American farmers will be protected burdensome tariffs and regulations.

News from Representative Lee Zeldin
￼
Dear Lindsey, 
￼
￼
￼
As 2018 comes to a close, December has been another busy month fighting for the priorities important to Long Islanders and delivering results for New York's First Congressional District.  
￼
Rep. Zeldin hosts a holiday luncheon for local 
law enforcement in his Patchogue office to 
thank them for their service.
At the beginning of December, I penned an op-ed discussing how we must always strive to do better for our veterans. From Northport on Long Island to the VA in Washington, D.C., we must do better for our nation’s veterans. Failure is not an option, and just as our veterans have never stopped fighting for us, we must never stop fighting for them and the benefits and services they have more than earned. Read the full op-ed here.   
I hosted a holiday luncheon in my Patchogue office for local law enforcement to thank them for their service to our communities, especially during the holiday season. It is thanks to their sacrifice and the sacrifice of their families that we have the opportunity to spend the holidays with our loved ones. 
￼
Rep. Zeldin is joined by the EPA, Natl Fish & 
Wildlife Found. and state and local officials to 
announce $2.57 million in grants for the LI Sound.  
The EPA, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and local officials joined me in announcing 36 grants totaling $2.57 million awarded to local governments and community groups to improve the health and vitality of the Long Island Sound. As Co-Chairman of the Long Island Sound Caucus, I understand that the Long Island Sound is a regional and national treasure, as well as a critical economic, recreational and environmental resource.The $2.57 million investment in these 36 programs around the Long Island Sound Watershed will allow us to continue to improve the health and vitality of the Sound. These community projects will make a real difference in continuing our progress towards cleaning up Long Island Sound. The partnerships funded by these grants show our commitment to the health of the Sound and to ensuring that our children and grandchildren can enjoy it for generations to come. Learn more here.  
￼
Rep. Zeldin speaks on the House floor ahead of 
passage of his proposal to protect access to 
critical equipment for individuals with disabilities. 
Watch here. 
I secured House passage of my legislative proposal to protect access to critical equipment for individuals with disabilities, such as complex rehabilitative wheelchairs. In November of 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a rule stating that accessories used on complex rehabilitative wheelchairs would no longer be a part of the fixed fee schedule and would be subject to competitive bidding pricing, decreasing access to customized wheelchairs and accessories relied on by adults and children with disabilities. My language included in this legislation will ensure that they have reliable and consistent access to the equipment they need. Learn more here.  
￼
Rep. Zeldin urges his colleagues to fully fund the 
9/11 Victim Compensation Fund. Watch here.
Following the Special Master of the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund Rupa Bhattacharyya stating that current funding “may be insufficient to compensate all claims,” I urged Congress to permanently fund the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund and prioritize legislation to do so at the beginning of the next Congress. Read my remarks here.  
I demanded the swift reopening of the homeless shelter at Northport VA Medical Center. Building 11 has provided a critical service for our local veterans who have fallen into homelessness, providing shelter on the same campus where they have access to the medical assistance and psychological care which treat, what all too often are, the factors that have driven them into homelessness in the first place. While Northport has assured us that all veterans utilizing Building 11 have been provided shelter, they also must ensure that these veterans are able to get to the medical center to receive the care they need. Learn more here.  
￼
Rep. Zeldin speaks at America's VetDogs 
""Welcome Home Sully Event."" Watch here. 
Following the passing of President George H.W. Bush, I joined America's VetDogs in welcoming home Sully H.W. Bush to Smithtown. Just as they did with Sully and President George H.W. Bush, America’s VetDogs provides veterans and first-responders with service and guide animals to assist them in their daily tasks at no cost to the veterans and first-responders. 
I, along with my colleagues Reps. Peter King (R, NY-2), Elise Stefanik (R, NY-21) and Tom Reed (R, NY-23), requested that the Department of Justice investigate the New York State Justice Center for the Protection of People with Special Needs’ failure to protect individuals with disabilities and Medicaid recipients who have died under state care, including nine who died while in state care in Suffolk County since 2013. Individuals with disabilities deserve full and equal protection under the law. However, in the State of New York, abuses have been ignored and swept under the rug due to the lack of action taken by the New York State Justice Center for the Protection of People with Special Needs. It is critical that there is a thorough investigation to finally secure justice for individuals with disabilities who have died in state care as a result of criminal misconduct. Learn more here.  
￼
Rep. Zeldin calls on the Senate to pass the Blue
Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act before the end
of this Congress. 
I called on the Senate to pass the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act by the end of this Congress. These brave service members have put their lives on the line for our great nation, and they have earned nothing less than the highest quality care. Furthermore, this legislation includes my proposal to expand veterans’ opportunity for homeownership, by eliminating the loan limit the VA can guarantee, which is critical in districts like NY-1 where the median home price is higher. Learn more here.  
This year was my fourth straight year spending Christmas in the Middle East with U.S. troops deployed over the holiday season. Spending Christmas away from their families isn’t easy, and for many of our servicemen and women this isn’t the first holiday season away from home. It is an honor to be able to personally thank them for their service, let them know how much they are appreciated and how many Americans are thinking of them, praying for them and immensely grateful for their service. Learn more here.

12/30/18 22:33,Gosar's 2018 Recap ,"￼
  
Before the New Year, I want to reflect back on the many events of 2018. Besides the inflamed rhetoric, violence from ANTIFA and other leftists, the economy is booming, foreign countries now respect the United States, we are winning the trade wars, and there is a new and robust optimism in the country. I am proud to have been part of the historic tax code revision that directly led to the greatest economy in our lifetimes. I commend President Trump for his vision and tenacity and I look forward to working with him to make our nation stronger, safer, and more prosperous.  

￼
In 2018, I introduced a total of 20 pieces of legislation -- of those bills four of them passed the House. Included in the list of victories is the Cottonwood Land Exchange, which passed the House and would give the Verde Valley more recreational opportunities long sought by the residents. The La Paz County Land Conveyance Act passed the House and conveys federal land to the county to help it overcome its severe shortage of private land. Another bill I introduced -- the Black Mountain Range and Bullhead City Land Exchange -- would help the City of Bullhead City get much needed land along the Colorado River in its control and allow the local economy there to expand and grow. 
 
￼
 
 
As many of us out west understand, the federal government is not a great steward of the millions of acres it controls. According to the Congressional Research Service in 2017, 79 percent of the acreage burned in the West was on federal land, whereas only 16 percent of acreage burned in the East was on federal land. I am going to continue to push for land exchanges that give the citizens of the Fourth District of Arizona more control of the community they live in. 
 

￼

￼
I’m always happy to see faces from Arizona’s Fourth Congressional District in Washington, DC. This year, my team was able to share the history of our nation’s capital to over 1,000 groups from Arizona on staff led tours of the capitol. In addition, we flew more than 180 flags over the capitol for individuals. I’m dedicated to ensuring the voices of Arizona Fourth Congressional District are represented in Washington. This year, my team responded to over 69,652 letters, phone calls and emails. Please keep writing and calling my office, your thoughts and input on the problems that face our country and state are always encouraging. 
￼

￼
￼
America's brave men and women in uniform are arguably our nation's greatest assets. Our veterans deserve the finest medical care our country can provide. I am committed to working on behalf of all of the veterans so that they receive the benefits and care they earned. This year, I helped with various grants to assist veterans, including money to the Jerry Ambrose Veterans Council of Mohave County in Kingman, to help improve their facility for veterans care.

Standing Up For ICE Agents
This summer, House Democrats called for the abolishment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). To understand how radical of an idea this is we must first remember ICE was created to protect our nation after our country was attacked on 9/11. Since then, it has successfully arrested illegal aliens who were charged and convicted of crimes including sexual assault, kidnapping, and homicide. In 2018 ICE, removed 256,086 illegal aliens, reflecting an increase of 13 percent compared to 2017. The majority of removals (57 percent) were convicted criminals. Additionally, 5,914 of the removed illegal aliens were classified as either known or suspected gang members or terrorists, which is a nine percent increase compared to 2017. I fully support ICE agents and the agency’s mission to keep Americans safe. Those who would seek to “abolish” ICE jeopardize our safety and security. ICE has no greater supporter than me. Read my op-ed HERE

Saying “No” to Amnesty 
This year, I fought endlessly to secure our border and close the dangerous loopholes in our immigration laws. Earlier this year, the House voted on the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act, better known as the 'compromise' bill. While the bill did have language for securing our border, it ultimately granted amnesty and therefore, I could not vote in favor of it. We cannot compromise our country's future by creating a special path for those not willing to wait in line. Under the bill, it was estimated that millions of illegal aliens would become eligible for legal status. Not only does this incentivize more illegal immigration, but it also fails to acknowledge our past mistakes. We must learn from our past in order to stop ourselves from committing the same mistakes. 

Working To Secure Our Border
I joined U.S. Representatives Ken Buck (CO- 04) and Andy Biggs (AZ-05) to meet with former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. During the meeting, we discussed ways to partner with the attorney general on strengthening immigration enforcement by eliminating current loopholes, reducing false claims for asylum, reducing false claims for refugee status, and withholding funds for cities that refuse to enforce federal law or cooperate with federal law enforcement. 

I assure you the fight is not over, and I will continue to fight for funding of the border wall and the security of the United States. The only pathway to achieving the American dream is by abiding by the laws of our sovereign nation. No amnesty.  One of the primary functions of a Member of Congress is to provide funds for the defense of the nation, and I find it reprehensible we have not done so on our southern border. I will continue to stand strong and fight to secure our borders and uphold the rule of law.

I have continued to fight to shine a light on the egregious levels of misconduct and mishandling of sensitive information in the on-going investigations into the Hillary Clinton and the Presidential campaign. As a member of the House Oversight Committee, I have worked tirelessly to expose the facts and bring the American people to the table. A major part of this fight has been exposing the misconduct of Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein. He has repeatedly engaged in an obstruction of justice and obstruction of Congress. The delays, obfuscation and intransigence demonstrate a disregard for his sworn duties to the Constitution and the American people. In order to restore the power to the people, I called for the impeachment of Rosenstein. I will continue to fight to shine a light on the facts and ensure power is restored to the American people. 
 
￼
 
￼
Once again I find myself infuriated about out-of-control, wasteful spending and a lack of leadership in Washington D.C. The American people gave Congress a clear mandate to reduce spending and shrink the size of the federal government.  This spring, the House was forced to vote on a massive omnibus that failed to deliver on any of the promises to the American people. This is not how our founders intended our budget process to be. The American people must have a voice at the table. Congress must have the courage to fix our broken budget process and return to regular order. I will continue to keep my promise to Arizona’s Fourth Congressional district and vote against more wasteful federal spending. 

￼
￼
I plan on doing the same thing in the 116th Congress as I have done since I was first elected to the House, fight for the people of Arizona’s Fourth Congressional district. Again, I encourage you to write, email or call my office and share your thoughts. Like I always say, trust is a series of promises kept. I will continue to earn your trust by delivering on my promise to guard against attacks on the Constitution and ensure every American can exercise their rights.


Sincerely,
￼
Congressman Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S

Dear Friends,
Each year during the holidays, we reflect with gratitude on this year’s blessings and with anticipation we look forward to the upcoming year. But in this season of hope and thanksgiving, too many are denied that promise as they wrestle with challenges that strip them of opportunity and compound despair.  If you’ve joined me here in the past, you know that I’ve highlighted organizations that help Arkansans shift back to community as they exit jails and prisons. What I have come to understand is that the tolls unrehabilitated offenders take on communities, neighborhoods, and families are too high. This month, I wanted to highlight an organization that helps people access resources to enable them to be successful in their families, communities, and careers.  The Good Grid started in 2016 as a partnership between Protech Solutions, Inc. and Arkansas Community Correction, as an effort to tackle the underlying causes of recidivism: chronic unemployment, homelessness, poverty, and poor mental health exacerbated by a lack of access to unified community services.   One of the most common laments I’ve heard with my Community Empowerment Initiative (CEI), is that while there are many good people and organizations ready to help those reentering society, those most in need are still slipping through the cracks. Everyone should have access to the services he or she needs to survive and thrive. Unfortunately, people are often unaware of all the services available to them and may feel intimidated by dense resource directories which may or may not be up-to-date.

Similarly, service providers don’t always know what services other providers offer, aren’t always able to connect with their target demographic, or may be checking the same out-of-date directories, rendering them limited in their ability to direct clients.   The Good Grid works to address this gap by:   - Connecting beneficiaries (those looking for help) to providers that address their issues; - Helping service providers serve more effectively by connecting them to a community of dedicated supporters; - And channeling volunteers to causes that are meaningful to them in a mission to keep community service providers strong and healthy enough to support their clients.   The Good Grid was designed as a one-stop shop for delivering services to returning citizens, with the belief that every person has a part to play in the lives of those in need, and in an effort to systematically address and reduce recidivism in the State of Arkansas. Its mission is to invest in social change by connecting volunteers and service providers with those in need.  In the last year, the Good Grid has expanded its scope to include other vulnerable populations and work closely with organizations such as the Arkansas Homeless Coalition (AHC) and the Central Arkansas Team Care for the Homeless (CATCH) to focus on people experiencing homelessness; Goodwill Industries of Arkansas to reach both their clients who have criminal records and those who do not, but who are in need of employment; and the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation’s Boys and Men of Color Opportunity Success Team (BMOST).   It is so important that when we are going about the business of life, whether that be teaching, legislating, parenting, volunteering, healing, or governing, we remember who is impacted and who is left behind.   By working with these individuals and organizations and interacting with the people they are helping, I have come to better understand that the costs to society of not acting on this issue are not limited to what taxpayers get: higher recidivism rates, higher prison budgets, more beds to build, more dangerous streets, and fewer badly needed workers in the labor force.   That is why I was pleased to support the Formerly Incarcerated Reenter Society Transformed Safely Transitioning Every Person (First Step) Act. We passed it in the House by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 358-36, it passed in the Senate by a vote of 87-12, and was signed into law by the President on December 21, 2018.  This crucial piece of legislation builds off successes in states like Georgia, Texas, and Alabama, and applies them to the federal prison system, working to reduce recidivism and promote rehabilitation by encouraging inmates to participate in educational and vocational training, and by improving conditions in federal prisons.  There’s been quite a lot of criticism heaped on this bill from those saying that the bill goes too far, and also those saying it doesn’t go far enough. Too often I’ve seen good people who, when faced with the harsh reality of a difficult problem, turn to cynicism.   People who, in the face of compromise, when perfect ideals can’t be attained, shrug and ask, “so why do anything?” To those saying the bill goes too far, I ask, if people are going to be released eventually, why not ensure they can become productive members of society and are not forced to return to a life of crime? And to those saying the bill does not go far enough, this was never meant to be a comprehensive fix. This piece of legislation is truly a first step.   Our Nation’s federal system of incarceration makes up less than 15 percent of the U.S. prison population, and just over 3 percent of the nearly 7 million people overseen by the U.S. justice system.   The First Step Act, while innovative and important, would only affect the offenders under federal control. However, I believe that the much-needed reforms implemented in this legislation can serve as a model to incentivize action while illuminating and guiding states on a path forward.  
Sincerely,
￼ 
Representative French Hill

ABOUT BRADLEY | HOW CAN I HELP | CONTACT BRADLEY | WANT TO RECEIVE MY UPDATES?
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
I hope everyone is enjoying the holiday season and is taking advantage of the Christmas season to spend time with their loved ones. Through the hustle and bustle of the holidays, I also hope you have taken time to reflect on then reason for then season. 
As we go through the final hours of 2018, I wanted to take a moment to look back on the past year and the many positive developments for Alabama and our country. 
￼ 
I kicked things off in January by celebrating my 100th Town Hall Meeting in Grove Hill. I always enjoy meeting the folks in our area and hearing about the issues that matter most to them. This year, I hosted 25 town hall meetings throughout Southwest Alabama.
We made real strides in 2018 when it comes to our national defense, including passing much needed funding for Alabama’s many defense priorities. I was proud to vote in favor of a funding bill that allows for the construction of three Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) and one Expeditionary Fast Transport (EPF), which are built by Austal USA in Mobile. This funding helps us move toward a 355-ship Navy.
This marked the first time in ten years that we were able to fully fund our military on time, and in a bipartisan way. We funded critical Alabama defense priorities like the Austal shipyard; additional UH-60M Black Hawk, Lakota, and Apache helicopters, which are critical to the Army aviation mission at Fort Rucker in the Wiregrass; $22.4 million went to the Stryker Upgrade program, which supports the work at the Anniston Army Depot; and we increased funding to address cyber threats to our missile defense systems, which is critical to Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville.
￼ 
This year, we were able to celebrate great developments for our local fishermen and coastal communities. In April, a 47-day Red Snapper season for recreational fishermen was announced. And just this December, NOAA Fisheries published a new rule to increase the annual catch limits and annual catch targets for the Red Snapper fishery in the Gulf of Mexico. These latest numbers further drive us forward in the fight for greater state control over the Red Snapper fishery.
Thanks to bipartisan reforms to our career and technical education programs, we are better able to give students tangible skills that help them succeed in real-world careers. In July, the House passed the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, which made reforms to the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act to ensure more Americans enter the workforce with the skills they need.
In 2018, we made real progress on infrastructure. We passed critical legislation to support our nation’s water infrastructure, including the Port of Mobile. We are also closer than ever before to building the I-10 Bridge. 
￼ 
And lastly, we were able to reach a bipartisan agreement on the 2018 Farm Bill to benefit our farmers and foresters in Alabama. The Farm Bill will allow for improved crop protections and loan options for farmers, incentivize rural development, support animal disease prevention and management, and will continue our nation’s commitment to agriculture and farmers. I am especially pleased to see the substantial resources provided to improve rural broadband access to communities. 
The many victories we were able to secure for the American people cannot be condensed into this brief article, but rest assured that this year, Alabama and the America are better off for the accomplishments made by the 115th Congress.  
From all of my staff, my family, and myself, we wish you a Happy New Year!
Government Shutdown Update 
A portion of the federal government remains shutdown as Democrats continue to oppose additionally funding for border security and a border wall. It is a shame that some are so committed to open borders that they have shut down parts of the federal government. This shouldn't be complicated. Since when has securing the border and knowing who is entering our country become such a radical idea. 
We saw the importance of strong border security just this past week when a legal immigrant police officer was killed by an illegal immigrant who had broken the law multiple times but was allowed to stay in the country due to sanctuary city policies. This heartbreaking story shows why it is so important we secure our border and bring an end to illegal immigration. The safety of the American people depends on it. 
As the funding lapse continues, I also wanted to provide some information for members of the Coast Guard impacted by the shutdown. While the Pentagon and most military programs are already funded, the Coast Guard has not yet been funded. It has been announced that military members of the Coast Guard that served on active duty in the month of December and those reserve military members that drilled prior to the lapse in funding will be paid on December 31. Click here for more information on how the government shutdown is impacting the Coast Guard. 
If you are a federal employee impacted by the shutdown, click here for information for the Office of Personal Management (OPM). 
It is my hope that Democrats will stop blocking this critical border security funding and allow the government to resume full operations. Until that time, I believe it is critical we hold the line, stand with President Trump, and fight for strong border security. As I have always said, border security is national security. 
Photos of the Year 
Here are a few of my favorite photos from the past year: 
￼ 
Town hall meetings are always a highlight of my year, and I loved holding a town hall meeting in the old Monroe County Courthouse back in August. 
￼ 
Thanks to passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, many employees in Southwest Alabama received bonus checks, pay raises, and increased benefits. Here I am in Stockton handing out bonus checks to employees at Overseas Hardwood. 
￼ 
This year, we celebrated the grand opening of the new Gulf State Park Lodge and Conference Center in Gulf Shores. This new facility will help increase tourism to our Alabama beaches even more! 
￼ 
I always love spending time with our servicemen and women who have devoted so much of their time to serving our country. Here I am with a group of Alabama servicemen and women during a trip overseas. 
￼ 
The holidays are an opportunity to spend time with your family and loved ones. From the Byrne family to your family, we hope you have a wonderful 2019! 
What's Ahead 
I hope everyone has a safe and exciting New Year's Eve, but I encourage everyone to pay attention to traffic laws and do not drink and drive. There are many options available to those who are celebrating the New Year's, and I encourage you to take advantage of those. 
I, along with other Members of Congress, remain on call to return to Washington as soon as a deal is reached to fund the government and increase border security. The 115th Congress is scheduled to end at noon on January 3, at which point Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives. 
In the meantime, if you have questions or need assistance from my office, you can click here to send me an email or you can call my office at 251-690-2811. All my offices will reopen on Wednesday, January 2nd following the New Year's holiday. You can also follow me on Facebook and Twitter for real-time updates on issues under debate in Congress. 
I hope you and your family have a blessed and happy start to 2019! 
Happy New Year!

Friends,
 
Can you believe we’re already through another year? It seems like just yesterday I placed my hand on the Bible and was sworn in as your representative with my wife Renee and our son Lane by my side. Now, we’ve reached the end of my third term serving as your Congressman. 
 
￼
I was proud to be sworn into office as your Congressman with my wife Renee and our son Lane by my side.
 
What an honor it has been.
 
Before we start the 116th Congress, I’d like to take time to reflect on the last two years. The House of Representatives was the most productive it has been in at least a generation. We have passed more than 1,100 bills, and the majority of them with broad bipartisan support. And yet, nearly 750 of those bills remain stuck in the Senate. This includes the reasonable funding bill we passed on Thursday, December 20 to keep the government open and secure our border. I remain disappointed the Senate has failed to act and has led us to another Schumer shutdown.
 
It is imperative that Democrats put politics aside and work with Republicans to get things done. I’ve made working across the aisle a top priority. In fact, a local paper applauded the bipartisan law I wrote with G. K. Butterfield, a Democrat from Wilson, saying “…there are thoughtful, hardworking lawmakers on both sides of the aisle working mightily to fix what’s broken.”
 
￼
I was proud to accept the EMS Legislator of the Year Award.
 
By the same token, I promised I will always work hard to advance policies that strengthen our economy and bring more jobs to the 8th District. I also promised I would be as accessible as possible and strive to represent you and our community’s priorities. 
 
On both of those counts, we were successful.
 
We ended 2017 by getting the most comprehensive tax reform in over 30 years signed into law. We saw the results this year in more jobs, higher wages and more money in your pocket. Because we doubled the standard deduction and lowered tax rates, 90% of Americans saw bigger paychecks. Our new opportunity zones will help boost rural areas. And we reformed our career and technical education system.
 
￼
I hosted a discussion on tax reform in Cumberland County. 
 
Under President Donald Trump’s leadership, we have taken steps to rebuild our military, given our troops a well-deserved pay raise and bolstered border security. I introduced legislation to ensure special operators who are serving in combat receive the same tax relief as other service members, and my legislation to increase funding for our Special Forces and to ensure soldier pay adequately reflects modern warfare demands was signed into law. I also worked to provide the highest funding level in history for the VA.
 
￼
Hosting a VA Committee field hearing in our district.
 
Through it all, I have remained steadfast in my commitment to solving issues important to our community. I hosted several roundtables, discussions and community events in our district on issues like human trafficking, tax reform and jobs, veteran health care, the opioid crisis, and GenX– to name a few. I helped secure federal funds to rebuild after Hurricane Florence, and we passed bills to address inefficiency and significantly reform the VA, expand and improve the GI Bill, and combat human trafficking.
 
￼
Surveying Hurricane Florence damage. 
 
I continued to work hard to address the opioid crisis. In October at the White House for a landmark bill signing, President Trump thanked me for my leadership in these efforts. President Trump signed H.R. 6, a comprehensive package of bipartisan legislation which included three of my bipartisan bills that focus on the safe and responsible packaging and disposal of unused opioids, including one that is hailed as one of “the most important opioid bills.” 
 
￼
At the White House for the opioid bill signing.
 
This was the most significant effort against a single drug crisis in congressional history. 
 
￼
I enjoyed meeting with students when they visited DC. 
 
By far, one of the most important parts of my job being your representative is taking care of your needs. As our district changed this Congress to include Moore, Hoke and Cumberland Counties, I opened offices in downtown Fayetteville and at Sandhills Community College to increase my accessibility. 
 
￼
Presenting service medals to WWII veterans.
 
This Congress we’ve helped hundreds of folks with problems with federal agencies like Social Security and the VA. When we found out the VA mistakenly declared a local veteran dead and took away his disability claim, we stepped in and fixed the problem. We’ve helped veterans get service medals that were long overdue, fire stations get grants for more firefighters and equipment, and helped secure grants to fight the opioid epidemic.
 
￼
Presenting a grant to the Aberdeen Fire Department. 
 
And, just as important, we have celebrated All American Week and Fort Bragg, and we have shown our gratitude and cared for our service members, our veterans, and their families. 
 
￼
Meeting with military families at Fort Bragg. 
 
Last but not least, we passed my concealed carry reciprocity legislation – something that has been described as the “biggest guns rights boost since the ratification of the Second Amendment.” My bill will ensure law-abiding citizens can protect their families across state lines. While I’m disappointed the Senate failed to act on this important legislation, I will continue to fight to get it signed into law.
 
￼
I was humbled to speak among a powerful group of patriots and conservative champions of our 2A rights at NRA's annual meeting.
 
Rest assured, as we begin the new Congress, I will continue to work to find bipartisan solutions for good-paying jobs, a strengthened economy, and common sense government.  
 
 
Until next week,
￼
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)

Friends,
I hope you all had a great week enjoying the holiday season with your family and friends. Sadly, as you may know, many Americans across the country have been thrust into uncertainty this holiday season due to the partial government shutdown as Congress works to come to an agreement on how to fund the remaining 25% of the government. This is the unfortunate result of the choice some of those in Congress made to put politics ahead of their constituents.
Rest assured, I continue to work across the aisle to finalize an agreement that is fair for all Americans, secures our borders and gets this much needed funding out the door and to the communities that depend on it. It is my hope that we will soon agree to a commonsense deal that will set a bipartisan tone for the upcoming 116th Congress. 
115th Congress - 2nd Session: In Review 
Despite this past week's disappointing gridlock, my colleagues and I have accomplished some real, bipartisan work throughout 2018 that directly benefits Northeast Ohio. Below are just some of the results of these important victories: 
Preserving and Protecting the Great Lakes
Like many of you who were born and raised in Northeast Ohio, I cherish my memories fishing and swimming in Lake Erie. But the Great Lakes don't just offer recreational benefits to Ohio residents; they make up the largest system of surface freshwater on Earth, generating more than 1.5 million jobs and $60 billion in wages annually. 
In Congress, I have made it a top priority of mine to protect the Great Lakes so our future generations can reap the same benefits. I am a proud champion of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI). This program provides vital funding to federal agencies and local communities to restore the Great Lakes ecosystem and economic health of the Great Lakes region. 
I am pleased to share that this year I successfully secured another full $300 million for the GLRI in the House Interior Appropriations Bill. I will continue to fight for this funding until Congress comes to a final agreement, ensuring Ohio can protect and preserve the Great Lakes. Rest assured, I will continue my work to protect Ohio's valuable resources in the 116th Congress.  
Combatting the Opioid Epidemic
As Buckeyes, we know all too well that too many lives have been cut short because of the opioid epidemic. There isn't a community across our country that hasn't been touched by this crisis. Whether it's a friend who is struggling with addiction or a loved one who has lost their battle against it, most of us know someone who has been affected by the scourge of opioids.
As Ohio is one of the states hardest hit by the opioid crisis, I have worked tirelessly to ensure we address this epidemic like the national emergency it is. While I have personally sponsored legislation to expand treatment initiatives and urged both Congress and the Administration to declare this epidemic as a national emergency, the U.S. House of Representatives also passed over 70 bills to combat the opioid epidemic this past year. These bills, which were included in H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, represent the most significant congressional action against a domestic drug crisis in American history. 
This bipartisan legislation advances treatment and recovery initiatives, directly authorizes resources for much needed educational prevention programs and protects communities by equipping law enforcement and first responders with tools they need to combat this crisis. I'm pleased to report that President Trump signed this important package into law on October 24, 2018.
While this was a good step in tackling this terrible epidemic, rest assured I will continue to work across the aisle in the 116th Congress to ensure our nation maintains the resources necessary to help Americans across the country battle addiction and address the opioid crisis.  
Fighting for Affordable and Accessible Healthcare
In addition to the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, there were several bipartisan health care wins in the 115th Congress that I was proud to vote in favor of, including the longest reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program, the most comprehensive childhood cancer research legislation ever taken up by Congress and legislation to bring down the cost or prescription drugs. 
I also continued to pursue legislation that repeals the federal government-controlled healthcare system and replaces it with a patient centered system that offers real reforms and makes health care more accessible and affordable to all Ohio families. That includes those with preexisting conditions. 
I have always believed that no American should ever be penalized or rejected from health insurance coverage because of a preexisting condition. That's why I introduced a bill, the Continuing Coverage for Preexisting Conditions Act (H.R. 6496), which would ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions are able to access the quality health care that they need. Specifically, my legislation ensures that those with preexisting conditions are protected even if other aspects of Obamacare are found to be unconstitutional or illegal in any other way. While my bill was unfortunately not brought to the House floor for a vote this year, I look forward to continuing to fight for Ohioans with preexisting conditions next Congress. 
Jumpstarting Our Economy
With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act last year, consumer confidence has hit an all-time high and unemployment is at its lowest in decades. In total, more than 4 million Americans at over 700 companies have seen their paychecks increase, received a bonus or had their retirement benefits expanded. In fact, more than half of small businesses across the country have plans to expand, boost hiring or increase their employee benefits. 
Some may refer to these benefits as mere ""crumbs,"" but for many hardworking families it has meant real money in their pockets, helping a single parent put another meal on the table or save up to buy new clothes for their child's upcoming school year, giving a newly married couple the ability to save up to become first time homeowners or providing a recent college graduate with the opportunity to start their own business. This is the kind of economic progress Americans have been waiting for and I look forward to continuing my work in the 116th Congress to ensure Ohioans can keep more of their hard earned dollars and achieve the American dream. 
116th Congress: Looking Ahead
As I prepare to ring in the new year, I am reminded that Congress has much to continue to work on and accomplish in 2019. When looking ahead at the 116th Congress, I understand the apprehensions of the American people. In the midst of a partial government shutdown, Congress seems more divided than ever. However, I can assure you that there are many representatives, like myself, who are committed to bridging the divide and working across the aisle to address the issues facing our country. 
I pride myself on being a bipartisan, commonsense legislator for the people of Northeast Ohio. That's why almost every piece of legislation I have introduced in the 115th Congress had a Democrat original cosponsor, and I look forward to continuing that practice next year. I always say that it's time for everyone to take off our red or blue jerseys and put on our red, white and blue jerseys. You can be sure that I'll be wearing that red, white and blue jersey into the new year and into the new Congress. 
Happy New Year and God bless. 
Dave

Dear Friend,

I hope you had a wonderful Christmas this week, and were able to visit with your friends and loved ones as we all celebrated the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. As the father of five and grandfather of fourteen, Christmas fills our household with so much joy. I pray that God blesses you and your family with a safe and Happy New Year.

￼
My staff in Washington, D.C. is ready to serve you.

As the new year approaches, House Republicans will start the new session of Congress as the minority. I have not forgotten that I was sent to Washington to promote and secure the personal and economic security of our citizens. To do that, we must pursue policies to ensure the integrity of our borders, and we must build the wall! I will not stop fighting for the good people of Texas.

I hope everyone has a blessed start to the new year, and it is an honor to represent the great men and women of the 36th Congressional District of Texas.

Thank you and God bless,
￼
Rep. Brian Babin

My Legislative Priorities for 2019  
Dear Friend:  
2018 is drawing to a close, and 2019 promises a fresh start for us in Congress. As Democrats transition into leadership roles, there are issues we must tackle on behalf of the American people.  
I believe that the Conservative-controlled Congress over the past two years abdicated its duty when it comes to Executive oversight, and we must correct that immediately upon taking control of the House.   
Looking ahead, I wanted to share with you some of my top priorities for the new year:  
1)   Oversight: When it comes to foreign policy, I have time and time again disagreed with the policies of this President and his Adminsitration, especially as it pertains to diplomacy. But some of his more curious moments may not be by accident. For instance, what did the President and Vladimir Putin discuss in Helsinki? Why has it been kept secret, and why do we still not know? What type of business dealings did the President have abroad prior to his election, and how has it affected his decision making? These are critical questions that have been left unanswered, and I plan to get to the bottom of it. Congress is a co-equal branch of government, not a rubberstamp for the Executive. 
2)   Health Care: The Majority worked hard to repeal the Affordable Care Act and strip Americans of critical protections. I believe it should be strengthened. We need to make health care more affordable and ensure every American has access to the care they need. That’s why I have long supported, and continue to support, opening up a Medicare for All program.
3)   Fighting Climate Change: The President's own Adminsitration has said climate change is a huge problem that must be dealt with immediately. America should be the global leader in creating a new, green economy that produces renewable fuels and well-paying jobs. But we can’t do that without the right leadership in Washington. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which I sit on, and the Foreign Affairs Committee have legislative jurisdiction over this critical issue. When Democrats take over, we will be able to tackle climate change and set us on the right path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is a huge undertaking, but if we don’t act now, we’ll have deprived our children of massive economic opportunities and doomed them to life on an increasingly inhospitable planet. 
4)    Gun Control: The Majority in the 115thCongress will be noted more for what it didn’t do than what it accomplished. Nowhere is that more evident than on the issue of gun control. We have a serious epidemic of gun violence in this country. There is a mass shooting, on average, every single day in America, and nothing has been done to fix the ongoing crisis. We need universal background checks, a reinstitution of the assault weapons ban, and to fund critical research on gun violence through the CDC. We also need to pass my legislation that would ban the sale of armor piercing bullets that pose a particular threat to law enforcement. Weapons of war don’t belong in our society; deer don’t wear Kevlar.
5)   Repealing the GOP Tax Law: I believe last year’s tax law was one of the worst bills I have ever seen come to the floor of the House. I also believe the bill disproportionately hurt New Yorkers, who lost critical State and Local Tax (SALT) deductions. We need to repeal this bill and work on a tax code that’s beneficial to working Americans, not corporate interests. 
6)   Defend Our Immigrant Communities: We are a country of immigrants, but the current Administration's policies--from separating families at the border to lowering the cap on refugee admissions--have, I believe, worked to disenfranchise our immigrant communities. That isn’t the America I know. We need to help those in need and stop the attacks on people who come seeking a better future for their families. Legislatively, we must also finally pass a permanent extension of DACA to protect our DREAMers and reunite families.  
7) Protect Voting Rights: I feel voting rights are under attack in this country. We should be making it easier for people to vote, not harder. As such, when Congress reconvenes I plan to reintroduce H.J. Res 28, (originally introduced in January, 2017) calling for a comprehensive voting rights Constitutional Amendment. It includes repealing the Electoral College, establishing Election Day as a national holiday, outlawing gerrymandering, and restoring voting rights, among other reforms.
 
There are many other issues we need to address—protecting Social Security and Medicare, restoring net neutrality, and tackling the student loan crisis just to name a few. But no matter where we start, I am committed to working with my fellow House Members to ensure this new Congress reflects the values of my constituents here in New York’s 16th Congressional District.
Sincerely, ￼ Eliot L. Engel MEMBER OF CONGRESS

A look back at 2018
 

Over the last two years, Republicans have moved our country forward by eliminating burdensome regulations, reforming our tax code, and as a result, fueling economic growth. I have worked alongside my colleagues to put more money back into the pockets of hard working Americans! We have also taken strong measures to better the care of our veterans, strengthen our military and put an end to illegal immigration. We are restoring American confidence by returning our country back to its core values and putting American citizens first. Below is a look at the hard work and achievements of 2018.  
Border Security & Immigration   This year we saw members of the migrant caravan rush our border and assault our Border Patrol agents. We all watched in despair as officials announced that Mollie Tibbetts a 20-year-old young woman from Iowa, was murdered by an illegal immigrant. Still, Democrats continue to put the lives of people who have entered this country illegally before our own citizens at the cost of American lives. It’s time to build the wall and secure our borders.
This Congress I supported $5 billion in funding for the border wall. Additionally, I have supported legislation that eliminates the visa lottery, revises our annual immigration levels, mandates e-verify, ends catch and release, and closes the loopholes hurting our immigration system.  I opposed H.R. 6136, a bill that granted amnesty to illegal immigrants.
I also introduced the Border Bonds for America Act of 2018, which allows American citizens the opportunity to purchase revenue bonds to help finance the construction of a southern border wall.  During World War II, 85 million Americans purchased $185 billion in war bonds and financially supported our troops while they were defending our country. This legislation would allow for the patriots of today’s era to help support American security in the same way as previous generations.
Border security is national security, and the safety of the American people must come first. Then and only then, can we begin to focus on comprehensive immigration reform. My priorities remain; building the wall, surging the National Guard to the border, ending chain migration, and shutting down sanctuary cities. 
Supporting our Military
As a member of Congress my top priority is to provide for the common defense of our nation. That means ensuring the safety of all Americans against enemies both foreign and domestic. This starts with investing in our military and making sure our men and women in uniform have the tools and resources they need to do their job.  There are over 20,000 military and DoD personnel right here in south Mississippi that depend on our support for their mission.
The National Defense Authorization Act for the 2019 fiscal year was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump in August.  This is the earliest passed NDAA in 41 years and will invest in a much stronger military. It included the largest pay raise for troops in nine years. Additionally, it expanded the size and strength of our troops by increasing the number of uniformed personnel for the Army, Navy, Navy Reserves, Air Force Reserves and the Air National Guard.  It also increases funding for training operations while working to repair vital military equipment. Our men and women in uniform are the best in the world at what they do,  and we owe it to them to ensure they have the tools and resources they need to get the job done.
As Co-Chair of the National Guard and Reserve Component Caucus this year, I was proud to introduce The Reserve Component Benefits Parity Act of 2018 to help bridge the gap of equal benefits for members of our military's reserve components. This bill will ensure that all service members, regardless of deployment authority, are given the same benefits for their service. That legislation laid the groundwork to provide fairness to certain mobilized National Guard and Reserve Component service members, by extending their eligibility for pre-mobilization and transitional health care, eligibility for post-9/11 educational assistance, and access to rehabilitation for veterans with service-connected disabilities.
Within the last year, the ""Forever G.I. Bill"" and the FY2018 NDAA were signed into law, and included portions from our legislation, the Reserve Component Benefits Parity Act.
I am looking forward to working with my colleagues in the House to ensure that we get this legislation signed into law. Our Reservists and Guardsmen deserve better. I came to Washington to support our military's mission before, during, and after their service.
Veterans
I am fully committed to ensuring our veterans  receive the care they need and have earned. For far too long our veterans have suffered under the bureaucracy of the VA.  Some have literally died while waiting in line for care, and no one was held accountable.
As a Marine veteran of the Persian Gulf War and a member of the Mississippi National Guard, I do not take lightly my responsibility to ensure our veterans receive the best service and appreciation. During the 115th Congress, we have passed significant legislation that works to improve the care of our veterans.
In September, I supported the Department of Veterans Affairs funding bill that specifically benefits Mississippi's veterans by funding rural health initiatives and allocating $64.3 million for the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport. That legislation also funded the VA MISSION Act which implements major reforms and improvements to the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Below are several other pro-veteran bills that I have co-sponsored this congress, 3 of which have been signed by the President.
H.R. 3218: Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 signed into law H.R. 2519: The American Legion 100th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act signed into law H.R. 873: Global War on Terrorism War Memorial Act signed into law H.R. 299: Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2017 H.R. 512: WINGMAN Act H.R. 2327: PAWS Act of 2017 H.R. 846: Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act 

Jobs/Economy
Last year, Republicans in Congress worked with President Trump to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that implemented pro-growth and pro-family tax cuts for Mississippi families.
Since we've reformed our tax code we've seen millions of Americans receive bonuses, companies investing back in the United States, small businesses expanding, and unemployment decreasing. Since late 2017, the number of jobs in Mississippi has increased by the thousands and we've achieved our lowest unemployment rate in history!
As a result of this success, House Republicans passed a bill to lock-in the recently passed tax cuts, Tax Reform 2.0. This bill is estimated to create millions of jobs, boost wages, and increase GDP for the long haul by locking in the individual and small business tax cuts that were included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Two years ago, House Republicans revealed our Better Way agenda. A promise to the American people that we will enact policies that meet America's biggest problems with bold solutions.  Passing tax reform was a great victory for hard working American people. Since Republicans have taken control of the House, Senate, and the White House, we've seen our economy boom, our wages rise, and American confidence soar. While there is still much work to be done, I believe we are all better off now.
Do you agree? Tell me now how you’re better off now and what I can do to best serve you in 2019.
Legislative Victories
As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I am charged with the responsibility of allocating every dollar of discretionary spending for the federal government. In addition to my work on the Appropriations committee, I introduced and supported a number of bills this year that will positively impact south Mississippi.   I joined several of my House and Senate colleagues in introducing the Commercial Engagement through Ocean Technology Act (CENOTE) which advances and expands the use of unmanned maritime systems. This bill establishes the framework for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and provides a guide map for public and private defense and non-defense industries to come together, and grow the usage of unmanned maritime systems. This bill was passed by Congress and signed into law by the President.
This year, President Trump also signed my bill the Gulf Islands National Seashore Land Exchange Act into law. This was a constituent-driven proposal that would make permanent a 30-year easement that has provided an access road and driveway for The Mark Seymour Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 5699, which is located within the National Park Service’s (NPS) Gulf Islands National Seashore in Ocean Springs. In exchange for the easement, the VFW will transfer a portion of its acreage to the park, which includes valuable wetlands. The National Seashore is a staple of the Mississippi Gulf Coast that holds historic sites, wildlife sanctuaries, and natural beaches. 
Mississippi has a long history of harvesting and consuming seafood and is currently the nation’s sixth largest producer of seafood. As the representative of the former seafood capital of the world, I believe we have the opportunity to move our ranking up by expanding our aquaculture industry. That’s why this year, I introduced the Advancing the Quality of Understanding of American Aquaculture Act, also known as the AQUAA Act, to increase the United States’ involvement and production of healthy, sustainable, and affordable seafood. This bill helps develop an industry that will create jobs, support our coastal communities, and put us on the right track to reducing our seafood trade deficit in a safe and sustainable way.
Constituent Services/Community involvement
My team and I work every day to better the daily lives of south Mississippians in many ways. Creating, reforming and voting on legislation in DC is simply one of the ways we are working to accomplish this. My office also serves constituents through casework and help with federal agencies.   This year my office has been able to help 2,799 individuals through casework, and of that number 1,592 of those were veterans cases. If you or someone you know is ever in need of assistance with a federal agency, please don’t hesitate to reach out to my office. We are here to serve you.
Spending time developing our south Mississippi students into the leaders they aspire to be is another priority of mine as your Congressman. Every year, I host several events for our youth that provide immeasurable opportunities for them to learn and grow as individuals.
This year I hosted the 7th Annual Palazzo Youth Leadership Summit.  This event consists of high school juniors and seniors spending the day getting to hear from some of Mississippi’s most successful people. This year students heard from Dr. Kelly Lucas, Director of the Thad Cochran Marine Aquaculture Center, Asya Branch, Miss Mississippi 2018, and Dr. Christopher Frigo, Owner of Frigo Orthodontics. Over 360 students participated in this year's summit.  
￼
This year approximately 65 students from across south Mississippi attended my annual Academy Day. This is an informational event for those who are considering applying for one of our Service Academies. They were able to hear from and speak with leaders from the academies and as well as from south Mississippians who currently attend or have graduated from an academy. 
￼

In October, I  had the pleasure of attending the 40th Annual Salute to the Military. The annual event honoring our Armed Forces has become a staple and tradition on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  This year it was a privilege to welcome the Vice Commandant of the United States Coast Guard, Admiral Charles Ray as the keynote speaker. I was also honored to have Purple Heart recipient Ken Duncan and his grandson join me for the evening as my special guest. 
￼
This year, my office hosted a VA Claims Clinic and Information Day, which allowed south Mississippi veterans immediate access to Jackson VA Regional Office representatives and over 32 veteran resource vendors. Upholding the promises we’ve made to our veterans is something I take very serious. They have made great sacrifices to protect and defend this nation and we must ensure they are getting the care they need and deserve.  We are scheduled to host another VA Claims Clinic February 21st & 22nd of next year at the Pascagoula Elks Lodge #1120. If you are interested in attending click this link to sign up for updates and receive the opportunity to schedule a meeting with a caseworker during the event. 
￼

I had the opportunity to experience a top-notch training operation with the Special Boat Team 22 at Stennis. The SBT-22 opened in 2010 and is the only command in the Department of Defense designated to conduct special operations in riverine environments.

￼
It was my pleasure to welcome NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine to Stennis Space Center for the RS-25 rocket engine test this week. We watched the 5th series of the test for the RS-25 that supports NASA's Space Launch System Program. With the Trump Administration's renewed focus on space exploration, Stennis plays a vital role in the future of our country's space capabilities.
￼
I was happy to join the groundbreaking ceremony for construction of a new main gate at Keesler Air Force Base. The new gate will enhance the base and provide new added security that will better protect our military assets.
￼

As a former CFO for a small public housing authority, and a member of the Congressional Public Housing Caucus, I thoroughly enjoyed my tour of the Laurel Public Housing Authority. 

￼

I joined several military officials in recognizing the 1108th Aviation Group for their outstanding performance and for serving our country so well. From September 2011 to August 2012 they displayed their expertise and extraordinary skills, contributing to the success of multiple highly visible military operations.

￼
Thank you for putting your trust in me to serve as your representative in Congress.  I look forward to continuing my hard work in the new year. 
In your service, 
￼

Steven M. Palazzo

December 30, 2018
Dear Friend, 
I hope that each of you were able to spend a joyous Christmas with those you hold most dear.  As is typical during Christmas season, last week was very quiet on the legislative front.  I was fortunate to spend extra time with my wife, sons and parents.  However, I did partake in many behind the scenes discussions in an attempt to broker an agreement to fully reopen the government.  The position of the Administration and my party is unified.  We absolutely must secure sufficient funding for border security to prevent the flow of illegal drugs, human trafficking and terrorism into our country.  Our national security is at stake, and we cannot compromise on that paramount priority.  This is a priority that both parties have historically supported.  It is a shame that it has been politicized and used as leverage to score cheap political points.   
The urgency of this priority was highlighted by last week’s tragic death of a California law enforcement officer, New Police Cpl. Ronil Singh, who was brutally murdered by someone who illegally gained entry into our country.  While any loss of life, especially of someone working to protect his community, is devastating, the fact that his killer would not have been in our country if we had stronger border security measures in place is reprehensible.  Additionally, as noted by law enforcement, this case emphasizes the need to address irresponsible sanctuary city policies that exist in certain places around the country.  I will continue to fight for the security of all Americans until we have the appropriate level of funding and systems in place which are necessary.     
I would like to wish you a safe New Year’s celebration this week.  May 2019 bring each of you many blessings, good health and prosperity. 
￼ 
Due to the holiday closure and my work on budget negotiations, this week’s newsletter is abbreviated.  I have provided a few clips of news articles below from last week which highlight some of my recent efforts on your behalf.

FEDERAL FUNDING UPDATE

Unfortunately, Senate Democrats are continuing to put party politics ahead of our national security, disaster assistance and federal workers and are still preventing passage of federal funding legislation. 

Last week I told you I was proud to support legislation to keep the federal government running and support President Trump's border wall. 

As I mentioned, I have been to the Southwest border and I have seen the threats we face firsthand. There are illegal drugs, human trafficking, gang members and terrorists coming across our border and the legislation passed by the House included funding necessary to secure the border. 
The legislation also included critical disaster assistance for our own agricultural community in the First District and for agriculture across our state. For months I have been working to secure assistance for Georgia's blueberry growers to help in their recovery from devastating winter weather. This bill authorizes and directs the United States Department of Agriculture to provide disaster assistance to these farmers. Blueberries are a billion dollar industry in Georgia and the commodity is the backbone of some of our communities. These growers and communities need and deserve this support.   We sent this important legislation to the Senate more than a week ago, but they have yet to act causing the continuation of a partial shutdown of 25% of the federal government. As a reminder, in the Senate, this legislation requires 60 votes to pass so there needs to be bipartisan cooperation. Senate Democrats have not been willing to come to the table.   Enough is enough. It is absolutely unacceptable that Senate Democrats continue to block support for our national security, America's farmers and others who need this disaster assistance and hardworking federal employees.

REFLECTING ON 2018

In case you missed it, I recently reflected on a productive year in the Savannah Morning News. Click here to read more. I look forward to seeing you in 2019. 

Happy New Year!

Rep. Buddy Carter column: Reflecting on 2018
Savannah Morning News

With the new year approaching, I am preparing to step into my third term as your representative of Georgia’s 1st Congressional District. I’m thankful you have given me the honor and privilege to serve another term. Before we enter 2019, I want to take a moment to reflect on a strong 2018.

Over the past year, I again had the incredible opportunity to travel across the 1st District to meet with residents at local meetings, community events, schools, military installations and more. I not only enjoy this time with our neighbors across the 1st District, it’s also an important time for me to hear about the issues important to you so I can bring them 1st hand back to Washington.

I also had the opportunity to visit countless small businesses to hear from our job creators directly about how tax reform is positively impacting their business. Across the 1st District throughout the year, I heard great news about businesses growing, hiring more employees, purchasing new equipment and investing in their communities. 1st District families also got to keep more of their hard-earned money this year thanks to our new tax law.

This year I had the honor of joining President Trump as he signed my proposal to end “gag clause” provisions. Before this legislation became law, many times pharmacists were contractually prohibited from telling patients when there was a less expensive, out-of-pocket option rather than using their insurance for prescriptions. As the only pharmacist in Congress I experienced this gag clause 1st hand and it’s why I made this an important part of my ongoing mission to lower prescription drug prices. Now, pharmacists are able to ensure patients are receiving the best possible prices on medications.

With my background in pharmacy and as a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I also worked this year to combat the opioid crisis. I am proud that legislation I wrote this year was signed into law as part of our ongoing efforts to end this epidemic.

My bills that are now law give pharmacists the tools they need to help fight fraud and abuse, explore the use of abuse deterrent formulas as opposed to pills that can be crushed or misused in other ways and help to promote the treatment of opioid addiction through telemedicine. In part due to this crisis, life expectancy in the United States has dropped for the second time in three years. We must end this once and for all.

Also this year, we were able to make great improvements in our infrastructure here in the 1st District and across the nation. Working together with Georgia Senators Johnny Isakson and David Perdue, we were able to secure the critical funding necessary to keep the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project on track. With this commitment, we are one step closer to realizing the full economic impact expanding our harbor will have on the nation and the world. We will continue fighting for this federal support to keep the project moving forward and on time until it becomes a reality.

As the proud representative of every branch of the military, I had the privilege of visiting our troops and installations throughout the year to not only hear what needs to be done and how I can help, but to also say thank you.

Our service members sacrifice so much to defend our freedoms. One of my top priorities this year, and every year, is to provide the resources necessary to strengthen the 1st District’s military presence. I am also very glad that we were able to provide military members with an extremely well deserved pay raise – the largest raise in 9 years.

While 2018 was an extremely productive year, I look forward to serving you for another two years. Together I believe we will accomplish great things.

I am committed to continuing the hard work on these priorities as we enter a new Congress next year. I am prepared to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue to deliver results.

I am always mindful that while my voting card may have my picture on it, it belongs to the residents of the 1st District of Georgia. I look forward to seeing you in the new year.

TRAFALGAR ROAD FIRE UPDATE
I toured the Trafalgar Road Fire site with Governor Asa Hutchinson and representatives from EnSafe, the environmental engineering company that is charged with evaluating the situation and remediation efforts. This was my second visit to the site, and I can confirm that local, state, and federal officials continue to work together to ensure the safety and security of residents. 
Following the visit, I joined Governor Hutchinson and members of the community for a press conference. He announced that the situation will be declared an emergency in the coming days. This will help cut through bureaucratic red tape and move remediation efforts forward. Additionally, the state will provide funds to extinguish the fire and eliminate hazards. 
The Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will continue to monitor the air quality as an action plan is developed. This is about the quality of life and safety of our Bella Vista community. My office will remain involved in safety efforts and keep the public updated on the situation. Additional resources for residents can be found here.

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
The government shutdown continues, and it seems unlikely that a deal will be reached anytime soon. House Republicans voted to keep the government open and fund the wall, but the Democrats in the Senate have refused to act. 
Senate Democrats are determined to block the funding bill and refuse to support securing our border. This is peculiar, given that Democrats previously supported border security. This isn’t just rhetoric – in a 2009 speech, Senator Chuck Schumer said that “any immigration solution must recognize that we must do as much as we can to gain operational control of our borders as soon as possible.” 
He continued: “Between 2005 and 2009, a vast amount of progress has been made on our borders and ports of entry. This progress includes…construction of 630 miles of border fence that create a significant barrier to illegal immigration on our southern land border.” 
Securing our border is a national security issue. Senator Schumer previously recognized that. It’s time for Democrats to come to the table and end this shutdown. I want an open government, not open borders. 
Watch my recent Fox News interview with David Asman where I discussed border funding and the partial government shutdown here.

Congressman Smith's E-news: December 29, 2018   ￼  
Looking Back at 2018
2018 has been a productive year. The economic benefits of tax reform are on display throughout the country with businesses expanding and jobs being created all around us. While there is much left to be done, I’d like to discuss a few of our proudest accomplishments from the past year.    During the week before Christmas, the Senate passed my bill to help our agricultural producers in the Northport Irrigation District. Once signed into law, this bill will allow individual land owners to repay their portion of federal irrigation infrastructure loans instead of paying only the interest as they have for decades. I was pleased to see the House pass it earlier this year and I thank Senator Fischer for her diligent efforts to shepherd it through the Senate.    Earlier in December, President Trump issued a new rule to supplant President Obama’s vastly overreaching WOTUS rule which threatened the productivity of our farmers and ranchers. When President Obama’s EPA first issued the rule, I introduced a joint resolution to repeal it under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) which easily passed both the House and Senate and forced a veto by President Obama. I appreciate President Trump’s efforts to shield our agricultural producers from overregulation and I look forward to putting this problem behind us for good.     President Trump also recently notified Congress of his intent to negotiate a trade agreement to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers between the United States and Japan. I have long called for such negotiations, including through a House resolution I introduced last year, and I look forward to the 116th Congress when I will take over as co-Chair of the U.S. Japan Congressional Caucus. Through this position, I hope to strengthen our ties with Japanese leaders and build support a mutually beneficial agreement between our two nations.    Among our other accomplishments was an amendment to the FAA’s reauthorization bill which will allow several of Nebraska’s airports to continue receiving safety improvement funding. Many of our airports were hurt by pilot shortages likely brought on by increased pilot regulations which caused them to fall below the traffic threshold required for federal safety funding. Enplanements have already begun to increase under new carriers, and my initiative will help to bridge the gap as Nebraska airports rebounds from this setback.  Last year’s tax reform package was a great accomplishment and I was able to address a number of Nebraska concerns in it, such as maintaining full property tax deductions for agricultural land. This year we were able to ensure the equitable treatment of cooperatives and private grain elevators and buyers under the new tax code by eliminating the “Grain Glitch.” Nebraska’s farmers and ranchers deserve to see the same benefits as other businesses under tax reform.  Overall, it was a very productive year, but there is still much to be done to resolve our current trade disputes and level the playing field for our agricultural producers as well as the Nebraska business sector as a whole. I appreciate President Trump’s leadership on many of these issues and look forward to the many things we can accomplish moving forward.                                              Sincerely, ￼  ADRIAN SMITH Member of Congress

Dear Friend,
A new year and a new Congress are just around the corner. Nancy Pelosi will become Speaker next week, and its uncertain if she’ll want to work with President Trump on common ground for the American people, or if she will use her power to obstruct the president and fight him on behalf of her friends running for president. Despite the uncertainty in Congress, I closed 2018 how I have spent much of the year – meeting with folks in southern Missouri and holding public forums so I can hear thoughts and ideas directly from the people I represent...KEEP READING HERE 


WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH

￼
I hope you and your family had a Merry Christmas! May this wonderful season bring peace and goodwill to you and your family.
￼

Thanks to all the folks who turned out to Dottie's Family Restaurant in Cuba for a public forum on the government shutdown and border security debate. I held two public forums this week and had the opportunity to talk about all kinds of issues important to Missourians including ending the poverty trap, repealing burdensome regulations, and creating jobs.

￼ 
We had a great showing at our public forum at Jen's Diner in Poplar Bluff. I appreciate everyone coming out to share their thoughts and ideas on ending the government shutdown and securing the border so I can share them with the White House.  
￼ I caught up with the press after our public forum in Poplar Bluff and explained why I will be giving up pay until a deal is reached to reopen the government.
￼
Tell Congress: What are YOUR priorities in the new year?

December 29, 2018 
Dear Friends, 
As 2018 draws to a close, I hope you will join me in taking some time to reflect on the past year and consider the opportunities and challenges ahead of us. There is much to be thankful for and celebrate -- including the passage of landmark legislation to finally hold Members of Congress personally liable for sexual harassment and retaliation. And there is much more work to be done to ensure everyone in our great country has a chance at achieving their American Dream.
That is why I am sharing with you the following articles and editorials that have captured my interest this past week. By remaining abreast of current events and educating ourselves through verified, factual reporting, we are better equipped to make crucial decisions and seize opportunities for positive change.    
I wish you all a happy, healthy, and prosperous New Year. 
Happy reading and all the best,   ￼

'What if someone was shooting?'
More than 4 million children endured lockdowns last school year, a groundbreaking Washington Post analysis found. The experience left many traumatized.
By Steven Rich and John Woodrow Cox, The Washington Post
￼
Locked behind their green classroom door, MaKenzie Woody and 25 other first-graders huddled in the darkness. She sat on the vinyl tile floor against a far wall, beneath a taped-up list of phrases the kids were encouraged to say to each other: “I like you,” “You’re a rainbow,” “Are you ok?”
In that moment, though, the 6-year-old didn’t say anything at all, because she believed that a man with a gun was stalking the hallways of her school in the nation’s capital, and MaKenzie feared what he might do to her.

Two children have died in US border custody this month. Before that, none in a decade. Why now?
￼
By Doug Stanglin, USA TODAY
On Christmas Eve, an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy who suffered a cough, vomiting and fever died in U.S. custody at a New Mexico hospital. The boy, identified by Guatemalan officials as Felipe Gomez Alonzo, was the second child in three weeks to die while being detained near the U.S.-Mexico border by U.S. authorities. 
Jakelin Caal, 7, also Guatemalan, died Dec. 8. at an El Paso children's hospital after being detained with her father and while preparing to travel by bus to a Border Patrol station in New Mexico. 
The back-to-back deaths prompted an outcry from immigration activists, politicians and human rights groups and raised questions about the Trump administration policies that have separated children and parents and filled detention centers.

Trump’s presidency has changed Washington, defied convention
By Jonathan Lemire, AP
Mr. Trump went to Washington. And he changed it. 
In his first two years in office, President Donald Trump has rewritten the rules of the presidency and the norms of the nation’s capital, casting aside codes of conduct and traditions that have held for generations. 
In Trump’s Washington, facts are less relevant. Insults and highly personal attacks are increasingly employed by members of both parties. The White House press briefing is all but gone, international summits are optional, the arts are an afterthought and everything — including inherently nonpartisan institutions and investigations — is suddenly political.

Trump’s Syria decision was essentially correct. Here’s how he can make the most of it
By Robert S. Ford, The Washington Post
President Trump’s Dec. 23 tweet promising a “slow and highly coordinated” withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria may ease the gnashing of teeth among officials and analysts in Washington, but it won’t end the criticism of his decision. That is precisely why the president should view the hullabaloo that erupted after he announced the Syrian pullout as an opportunity to take a number of steps to make the most of his essentially correct, but widely unpopular, move.

The Nation of Islam preaches that “Hitler was a very great man” and white people are “blue-eyed devils.” 
  
So why did Louis Farrakhan’s notorious hate group receive taxpayer money to provide federal inmates with “spiritual guide services?” 
  
Read below and let me know if you think this is how your taxpayer dollars should be spent. I certainly don't - which is why I'm writing to the Justice Department demanding an immediate end to this funding.

Nation of Islam receiving federal cash to teach prisoners 
Alana Goodman 
  
The Nation of Islam and its leaders have received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the U.S. government since 2008 to teach religious study programs for federal prison inmates, according to records reviewed by the Washington Examiner. 
  
A black nationalist group led by Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam preaches that white people are “blue-eyed devils” and Jews are “the synagogue of Satan."" Its leaders have received at least $364,500 in contracts and awards from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice between fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2019.
  
The funding was designed to provide ""Nation of Islam religious services,"" ""Nation of Islam spiritual guide services,"" ""Nation of Islam study services,"" and other related programming led by the organization’s leaders, according to Bureau of Prison records. The Nation of Islam has been labeled a hate group by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center.
  
New York Republican Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, told the Washington Examiner the funding was ""beyond the pale.""
  
He said: ""Categorically, no group or entity or individual associated any way with Farrakhan or the Nation of Islam should receive any federal funding.
  
What Farrakhan preaches is hatred and anti-Semitism and racism, and to use any federal money for any group that’s he’s involved with that do any type of teaching or proselytizing is just wrong.""

Congressional Report

Dear Friends, 

This week I had the priviledge of swearing-in my sister, Rosie Cuellar, as Webb County’s new Tax Assessor Collector. Rosie is the former City of Laredo Municipal Court Judge.

In the district, my staff attended numerous meetings and events, including the Doctor’s Hospital at Renaissance (DHR) State of the Hospital Address, the swearing-in ceremonies of several Laredo political officials, and guided tours around the Capitol, amongst others. 

In honor of the upcoming new year, I have also included a video from the Federal Emergency Management Agency that details ways you can resolve to better prepare yourselves in the event of an emergency in 2019.
As always, please contact one of my offices if you need assistance with any federal agency.

Lastly, I hope you join my staff and I for a Swearing-In Ceremony and New Office Open House on Thursday, January 3, 2019.

Weekly Review




December 24

A Little Wisdom on Christmas Eve: I promise a very brief Christmas post tomorrow, but here on Christmas Eve, I wanted to at least send you a copy of my Christmas Card. I’ve always loved this verse from Micah, and it’s my prayer that in these crazy political times all of us as participants would have the wisdom to grab a bit more Micah in what we do and the way we do it.
The construct, I think, is fascinating.
We are to do justice…it’s simply a requirement. But we are to actually love mercy and kindness. This goes well beyond the notion of being a requirement to being a duty of the heart in the way that we conduct ourselves and relate one to the other. Equally fascinating is the second duty of the heart in the way that we are to walk with our God above and those around us…humbly.
If there were just a bit more of those three things in Washington, I suspect our national enterprise would be on much firmer footing.
So I wish you the best in last-minute Christmas shopping and all that you may have to do in preparation for tomorrow, but for now, know how much I wish for you a joyous Holiday season and a happy Christmas Eve.  

￼

￼

December 25

Merry Christmas: Merry Christmas!

I hope your day is a great one and that you’re in the company of those you love.

I also hope the Christmas spirit gets you. In the Christian faith, much of that is about love and the way in which each one of us can be a reflection of God’s love to the other. It’s also to be remembered in the midst of gift-giving of how it is better to give than to receive and how above all things we, in the form of time and presence, can be the greatest of all gifts to those that we love.

Indeed, it’s an important day, and I hope a joyous one for you, family, and friends.

Merry Christmas!

December 26
Thank You and Farewell: I hope that Christmas Day was great for you, family, and friends. Happy Post-Christmas, and before long, it will be Happy New Year!
I’ve embedded below text from the genesis of what would have been my farewell address on the House floor. As it turned out, last week was chaotic and the time that I have reserved on the floor got washed out with all the upheaval that Thursday delivered in Washington.
Take a look below, and know that it has but two main messages:
One, thank you for your part in allowing my time in the arena of politics. It’s been an honor, and I am most appreciative.
Two, we are headed for a shipwreck if we don’t change course. I walk through some of the ingredients of what we need to be careful about in the pages below, but the main point here is what we all know in the way in which Washington cannot continue to do business as it now does and have our republic survive. Click here to read more.                                        
￼
December 27  Tax Cuts 3.0: Last Thursday, the House voted on a package of revisions to the tax code that some called “Tax Cuts 3.0.” It included delays of certain Obamacare taxes, reforms to rules governing retirement savings, changes to the IRS, and technical corrections to the larger tax bill Congress passed last year. It was viewed to be a messaging bill, given that the Senate has made clear that there’s absolutely no chance of its passage.
Think about this. There are several days left in this Congress, and legislation that doesn’t pass in this Congress has to be started from ground zero in the new Congress. So although there was no chance of passage on the Senate side, they advanced this bill knowing it would go back to the drawing board on January 3rd as a way of somehow scoring political points.
I have voted for essentially every component part of the bill over this Congress. But amalgamating these different bills and passing them in the 11th hour as a messaging bill to me made no sense.
If we’re going to message, can we ever message on cuts to spending? Click here to read more.

December 28  Debate over Government Funding: It’s sad the degree to which politics is at times theater.
I think at the end of the day this well describes what took place last Thursday with our vote on a continuing resolution to fund government through February 8th.
Its mechanics were fairly straight forward: to fund that which had not been funded permanently on a short-term basis through February. Short-term pending measures are by no means the way in which to fund government, and they’re certainly not a mechanism that I have been supportive of in the way we fund our federal government.
But this is where the theater comes in….
It would fund a number of agencies that had not received appropriation. These were smaller agencies that had been saved for last because the issues surrounding them, in this case the wall, were contentious. Click here to read more.

Dear Friend, 
As 2018 comes to a close, I wanted to share with you the progress we made this past Congress.   By working together, and finding common ground, I was able to pass nine bills—the most in Michigan’s congressional delegation. Five of them were signed into law by the President. 
I hope you'll take a brief moment and watch this video for a look back at some highlights from the past year. 
￼ 
Best wishes for a happy and healthy New Year, and I look forward to being in your area soon. 
Sincerely, Tim Walberg

One Week And Counting


￼
#TrumpShutdown 
Regrettably, America has now entered a Trump Shutdown.  Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House.  But instead of honoring his responsibility to the American people, President Trump threw a temper tantrum and convinced his party to push our nation into a destructive Trump Shutdown in the middle of the holiday season.  President Trump has said more than 25 times that he wanted a shutdown and now he has gotten what he wanted. 
We have offered Republicans multiple proposals to keep the government open, including one that already passed the Senate unanimously, and all of which include funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security – not the president’s ineffective and expensive wall.  If President Trump chooses to continue this Trump Shutdown, the new House Democratic majority will swiftly pass legislation to re-open government in January. 
￼ 
Death of Felipe Alonzo-Gomez at the Border
On Christmas, an eight-year-old boy died in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which followed the death of seven-year-old Jakelin Amei Rosmery Caal Maquin earlier this month. The tragic death of an innocent child on Christmas Day breaks the hearts of all. 
We all have a moral responsibility to ensure all children of God are treated with compassion and decency.  The death now of two children in U.S. custody is unconscionable. 
I have called on Homeland Security’s Inspector General to immediately open an investigation into Felipe Alzono-Gomez’s death.  The Congress will also investigate this tragedy and the heartbreaking death of Jakelin Amei Rosmery Caal Maquin, to seek justice and ensure that no other child is left to such a fate. 
￼ 

Frequently Asked Questions on the Trump Government Shutdown 
Will my mail still arrive during the shutdown? Yes.  The U.S. Postal Service is not affected by a government shutdown.  The U.S. Postal Service is an independent entity that is funded through the sale of its products and services, and not by tax dollars.   Will I continue to receive my Social Security checks? Yes.  During a government shutdown, recipients continue to receive their Social Security checks.    Will Medicare and Medicaid be interrupted? No.  The operations of Medicare and Medicaid will operate normally during the shutdown.    Can I get taxpayer assistance from IRS personnel during the shutdown? It will likely be difficult.  If the Trump Shutdown goes into January, it will have a significant impact on the IRS.  While the shutdown continues, 90 percent of the IRS staff is furloughed.  IRS’s “tax filing season” is January-April.  Beginning in January, some Americans will start thinking about filing their 2018 taxes, due April 15, 2019.  This will be the first year when Americans are filing their taxes under the new GOP tax law, and many will have numerous questions.  If the Trump Shutdown continues, the limited IRS staff will be unable to keep up with the questions coming in from taxpayers using the IRS customer service hotline.    Can I get a passport during the shutdown? Perhaps, with it depending on where you live.  The U.S. Passport Agency remains open during the shutdown and continues to issue passports.  However, depending on where you live, the State Department could curtail issuing passports where those passport services are offered in buildings run by another agency that is shut down.      Will I be able to continue visiting the national parks during the shutdown?  The Trump Administration claims that the vast majority of national parks are “open” during the shutdown (on the grounds that barriers have not been put up at the parks to prevent entry.)  However, the fact is that there are no services for visitors to National Park Service sites during the shutdown.  Services such as restrooms, visitors’ centers, campgrounds, information kiosks, trash removal, and interpretative programs are all closed during the shutdown.  The vast majority of National Park Service employees are furloughed.  Also, law enforcement staffing is sharply curtailed, so visitors’ safety will be put at risk.  Which federal departments are affected by the Trump Shutdown? There are nine federal departments affected by the Trump Shutdown:  Homeland Security, Treasury, Agriculture, Interior, HUD, Justice, Commerce, Transportation, and State.  In addition, numerous critical smaller independent agencies, including EPA, the Small Business Administration, and NASA, are affected.  (The six federal departments that are already fully funded for FY 2019 and are not affected by the Trump Shutdown are:  Defense, Veterans Affairs, HHS, Education, Labor, and Energy.)        How many federal employees have to work without pay during the Trump Shutdown?  There are approximately 420,000 federal employees, deemed “essential,” including FBI agents, DEA agents, Secret Service agents, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents, who are being required to work without pay during the Trump Shutdown.  None of them will receive a paycheck until the shutdown is over and the government re-opens.  The longer the Trump Shutdown lasts, the longer they are working without a paycheck, increasing their families’ financial difficulties.  How many federal employees have been put on unpaid furlough during the Trump Shutdown? There are also approximately 380,000 federal employees who have been placed on unpaid furlough during the Trump Shutdown. They are also not receiving any pay during the Trump Shutdown.   Will the 420,000 federal employees forced to work without pay during the shutdown receive the pay for their work when the shutdown is over? Yes.  Under federal law, those federal employees forced to work without pay in the shutdown are guaranteed the pay they have earned when the government re-opens.  Will the 380,000 federal employees who were placed on unpaid furlough during the shutdown receive back pay when the shutdown is over? That will be up to the Congress and the White House. Legislation would have to be enacted.  The precedent has been that furloughed employees are later paid, through legislation.  Indeed, after every previous shutdown, Congress has passed legislation mandating that furloughed workers get paid.  What is the impact of the Trump Shutdown on small businesses? A shutdown halts federal loans to small businesses.  During a shutdown, the Small Business Administration stops approving applications for small businesses to obtain loans and guarantees, typically $1 billion per month.  Indeed, on Dec. 22, SBA put a notice on Facebook simply stating, “Due to the lapse in government funding, SBA will remain inactive until further notice.”    What is the impact on home mortgage applications? During the shutdown, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) will see significant delays in loan processing and approvals, due to the furloughing of most employees.  Thousands of people trying to buy a new home or refinance a FHA-insured mortgage will likely be put on standby.   What is the impact on FDA’s food safety activities? During the Trump Shutdown, the FDA will be unable to support a number of its food safety activities.  FDA has furloughed 40 percent of its employees.  As a result, it will have to reduce its routine inspections of domestic food facilities.  For example, in the 16-day GOP shutdown in 2013, the FDA had to delay nearly 360 food safety inspections.

My office assisted with preventing the potential revocation of the non-profit (501c3) status for a local community nonprofit. Due to erroneous filings by the organization, they feared their status had already been revoked. With the assistance of my office, the organization was advised to quickly file the correct paperwork to retain their status.

180-day transition for IR parole

Humanitarian parole policies, under which about 1,500 people currently live in the Marianas, will end on December 31. But those affected will have a 180-day transition period to look for some other immigration status or arrange to leave the islands, USCIS Director L. Francis Cissna told me in a call and letter on Thursday. I worked with the Obama administration to put the parole policy in place in 2011. But President Trump declared his intention to limit use of parole in his executive order of January 25, 2017. The groups losing parole include spouses and parents of U.S. citizens in the Marianas, immediate relatives of citizens of the Freely Associated States, certain stateless individuals and persons with permanent resident status, and in-home caregivers. They were covered by my language in S. 744, passed by the Senate in 113th Congress. But House Republicans would not take up the bill. My legislation, H.R. 1466 in the 112th Congress, also tried to fix the problem. But Governor Fitial got Republicans in Congress to block it. Now that Democrats will control the House, I will re-introduce legislation to help protect those losing parole and keep families together.
 
 
 

January
 

CW bill introduced. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and I introduced the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act. The bill was the product of many hours of discussion within a bipartisan, bicameral working group that was formed to craft a long-term labor policy for the Northern Marianas. The bill sought to give the Marianas access to foreign labor for another 10 years, allow for 13,000 CW workers, and create a new visa category to give long-time foreign workers more certainty.
 

February
 

Confronting the opioid crisis. As Ranking Member of the Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee, I spoke on behalf of Democrats on how the opioid epidemic is affecting America’s workplaces. The human toll is incalculable and billions of dollars are lost from the injuries, absenteeism, and lost productivity stemming from opioid abuse. We need safer workplaces, stronger consumer protections in health law, and greater access to treatment to combat this problem.
 

March
 

Students lead to stop gun violence. I joined Washington, D.C.-area students on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol on National Walkout Day. These smart, articulate, and politically engaged young adults seek sensible gun control policy. I could not agree more.
 

$1.3 trillion spending bill passes. Congress enacted a $1.3 trillion omnibus appropriations law that funded the federal government through September 30, 2018. Funding remained steady or even went up for many federal programs President Trump wanted to cut back or eliminate. Many are important to the Marianas and on my priorities list submitted to the Appropriations Committee, including the preserved 1.5 percent set-aside in water and sewer grants for insular areas that we began in 2010.
 
 

CODEL Murkowski. Senator Lisa Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources, led a congressional delegation, including Rep. Amata Aumua Coleman Radewagen (R-American Samoa) and myself, through the Pacific. This time spent building relationship has made it possible to keep the Northern Marianas Islands U.S. Workforce Act moving forward since the Senator and I introduced the bill in January.
 

April
 

Veterans Resource Fair a success. More than 300 veterans, service members, military family members, providers, and members of the public turned out for the 2018 Northern Marianas Veterans Resource Fairs, held on Rota, Tinian, and Saipan — nearly double last year’s turnout. Improving access to services for Marianas veterans and their families is one of my top priorities as a member of House Veterans Affairs Committee. And better access begins with raising awareness about the services that exist.
 
 

App Challenge winners impress in DC. Daniel Villarmero and Chenoa Bunts-Anderson, Marianas winners of the Congressional App Challenge, showcased their “Student Companion” app in Washington, DC.  
 

May
 

New funds bring iPads to PSS. The CNMI Public School System put 3,000 new iPads in students’ hands thanks to the funding formula I added to the Every Student Succeeds Act in 2015, which brought in $4.1 million this year. Students now use the iPads to learn about coding, math, and problem-solving.
 
 

Renovated troop store. The newly-renovated Saipan Army Reserve Center was unveiled and dedicated to the memory of Army SSG Wilgene Lieto and SPC Derence Jack, who gave their lives during service in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Army and Air Force Exchange Service troop store had its grand opening. A study I included in the 2011 National Defense Authorization Act led to the 5,000-foot expansion of the store, which serves 4,000 active and reserve service members, retirees, and their families.
 

June

Veterans clinic signed into law. President Trump signed the VA MISSION Act, which requires a feasibility study for a veterans’ health clinic in the Marianas. I put Section 213 into the legislation to advance the goal of getting our own Community-Based Outpatient Clinic. Getting a favorable feasibility study is the same strategy we used successfully to expand the AAFES troop store on Saipan.
 

July

U.S. Workforce Act becomes law. President Trump signed the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act. U.S. Public Law 115-218 gave the Marianas economy access to foreign labor for 10 more years and more protections for U.S. workers and local businesses. The legislation also provided 13,000 Marianas-only CW visas beginning in fiscal year 2019, averting the economic disaster that would have resulted from the Trump administration’s earlier move to cut CW slots down to 4,999.
 
 

CODIFY CNMI is up and running. Codify CNMI organizers Blane Wilson and Darren Demapan asked me to introduce them to the CNMI Public School System’s leadership to collaborate on a summer program to teach coding to middle and high school students. I put them in touch and got to see the results: a workshop in full swing at Dandan Middle School, with over a dozen students learning how to code.
 

August

NDAA is law, $51 million to Tinian divert. President Trump signed the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 authorizing $50.7 million for Air Force divert airfield projects on Tinian. $46 million will go towards construction of a cargo pad with taxiway extension and $4.7 million for a maintenance support facility north of the Tinian airport. Section 2863 bars the Defense Department from spending anything on public infrastructure in the Marianas until an Economic Adjustment Committee reports to Congress on what civilian projects are needed to support proposed military activities. The report is due in May 2019.
 

September
 

Making sure Rota is cared for. Rota bore the brunt of Typhoon Mangkhut, so I was there the next day visiting families and making sure that federal agencies were doing everything to help Rota and the Commonwealth government respond. 
 

October
 

Yutu relief takes top priority. Super Typhoon Yutu ravaged Tinian and Saipan on October 24-25, killing at least one, injuring over 130, and causing massive destruction to homes, businesses, and public infrastructure. Within days of Yutu’s landfall, I got pledges from incoming Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and the House Appropriations Committee that the Marianas will be included in any supplemental funding bill for U.S. areas hit by natural disasters this year. The congressional office also served as a temporary registration center for disaster aid applications and an online hub for relief and recovery information following the typhoon.
 

More CIP funds for water. President Trump signed the America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, doubling the authorization for the Safe Drinking Water Act from $1 billion to $1.95 billion in 2021. Because I got the insular set-aside increased beginning in 2010, the Marianas got a larger share of this money. 
 

November
 

Hearing probes disaster response. As a guest of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I questioned FEMA Administrator Brock Long on his agency’s delivery of services in the Marianas after Typhoon Mangkhut and Super Typhoon Yutu. For instance, power and water were slow to be restored. Disaster Recovery Centers took weeks to open. And wait times for inspections took much longer than FEMA promised. The hearing was focused on recurring problems with disaster response nationwide, many of which we have seen in the Marianas. 
 

December

$100M+ for Marianas recovery. The House passed a disaster assistance bill that includes at least $100 million for the Marianas. This is the first time the Marianas has ever been included in a disaster appropriation that provides money above and beyond what FEMA brings to a recovery effort. The bill’s fate in the Senate is undecided because it includes a controversial $5 billion President Trump has demanded for a border wall.

Dear Friend, 

This week, the federal government remained partially shutdown by an unnecessary demand by the President for funding for a border wall. In addition to pushing back against the Trump shutdown, I met with constituents and went on CNN to emphasize the need for overdue oversight of the Trump administration, announced a grant for Early Head Start programs at Porter-Leath, expressed concern at the death of a second child migrant in U.S. custody this month, and offered a holiday health tip about getting enough sleep. Keep reading to learn more about my week and follow me on Twitter and Facebookto see more updates as they happen. 
Criticizing Trump’s Government Shutdown  Talking Future Oversight of Trump Administration on CNN  Announcing $2.3 million Early Head Start Grant to Porter-Leath  Expressing Concern at a Second Death of a Child Migrant in U.S. Custody  Appearing on MSNBC on Sunday  Offering U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars  Signing Up for “Congress On Your Corner” and this e-Newsletter   Weekly Health Tip  Quote of the Week 


Criticizing Trump’s Government Shutdown 
This week, for the third time in Trump’s presidency, portions of the federal government shut down.  This time it was because of Trump’s 11th hour demand for a border wall that the President said Mexico would pay for, not taxpayers. As he boasted how “proud” he was to shut down the government, I spoke out against it. The public deserves and expects the programs and services it pays for to stay open and work. I will continue to work to reopen the government, and get federal employees back to work for the American people. 
Talking Future Oversight of Trump Administration on CNN 
On Wednesday, I went on CNN with Dana Bash who asked me about oversight of the Trump administration after Democrats take the Majority in the House on January 3. I told her oversight is a basic duty of Congress that has been neglected during the past two years and that that will change in the year ahead. See the interview here.  
Announcing $2.3 million Early Head Start Grant to Porter-Leath 
￼  
On Thursday, I announced that Porter-Leath will be receiving a $2,330,982 Early Head Start grant from the Department of Health and Human Services Head Start Office. Early Head Start helps at-risk children under three years old develop the skills they need to give them and their families a shot at the American Dream. I was pleased to announce this important grant funding is heading to Memphis. I appreciate the outstanding work Mike Warr and his staff do at Porter-Leath. 
Expressing Concern at a Second in-Custody Death of a Child Migrant 
￼ 
On Christmas Eve, an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy, Felipe Gomez Alonzo, died while in U.S. custody.  This follows the death of a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl, Jakelin Caal Maquin, earlier this month.  While I understand the necessity of border patrol stations, I am concerned that these overcrowded stations are unhealthy to the point of death. After Jakelin’s death, I wrote to Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen urging her to take immediate steps to end the policy of deterring migrants from applying for asylum at ports of entry which has led these desperate asylum seekers to attempt crossings at dangerous areas. Asylum is a human right and people seeking it must be protected.  I will continue to support oversight of the Department of Homeland Security and seek answers about how these unfortunate deaths occurred.

Appearing on MSNBC on Sunday 
On Sunday, I’ll join MSNBC’s Frances Rivera in the noon hour in Memphis to talk about the ongoing government shutdown, the border wall and the new Congress that convenes January 3.  
Offering U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars

Weekly Health Tip 
￼ 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), getting enough sleep is not a luxury; it’s a necessity for maintaining good health and avoiding mistakes and injuries. See the CDC’s sleep guidelines and recommendations here.  
Quote of the Week 
￼ 
“I’ve been in politics over 50 years in a number of positions and working under nine presidents. I’ve never seen a situation like this, in which almost every important area that is key to this country is confronting crisis.” – Former Defense Secretary, CIA Director, Budget Director and Member of Congress Leon Panetta on “Fox News Sunday.” 
As 2018 draws to an end, I wish all my constituents and friends a very happy 2019. The new year looks to be full of promise.
As always, I remain Most sincerely,

U.S. Capitol and the Capitol Christmas Tree
 
Dear Friends,
 
Last week, the House and Senate negotiated a reasonable agreement that extended funding for nine agencies until February 8th, 2019. However, at the last minute, House Republican Leadership decided to add controversial funding priorities backed by the Freedom Caucus to our budget knowing it did not have bipartisan support and would not pass the Senate.
 
This is all too familiar given the similar mess the Freedom Caucus caused on the farm bill rule vote. In the late hours of the Rules Committee hearing for the farm bill, Freedom Caucus members inserted the Yemen provision, risking the whole bill.
 
The dysfunction that resulted in this shutdown is a good example of what was at stake had I allowed the horrible Yemen provision to derail the farm bill and push it in to this week. Had we taken the farm bill up a week later, it’s clear now that it would have gotten caught up in the shutdown and we would have no farm bill at all. 
 
As it is, the shutdown leaves producers in a really tough spot, at a time when they’re already hurting. Farmers and ranchers count on USDA to deliver a range of services, many of which are now suspended during the shutdown. For those producers hurt by the Administration’s trade war, they may not be able to access payments under the Market Facilitation Program. FSA borrowers can’t cash checks to pay bills and those hoping to build on-farm grain storage are also in limbo. Finally, the shutdown threatens implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill and its improvements for dairy farmers, and the others counting on the funding and program updates it makes.
 
If you are experiencing any hardships or delays in critical services as a result of this shut down, I encourage you to contact my office. My staff remain ready to advocate on your behalf wherever possible as we work to get our government open again.
 
Sincerely,
￼ Congressman Collin C. Peterson

On December 24th, 1869, Sauk Centre’s Church of the Good Samaritan held its first service. This service was the marriage of Nellie A. Barrows to Captain Edward Oakford. This church still stands today, nearly 150 years after that very first service.
 
What’s the Story?
￼
 
In 1991, the Minnesota Twins won the World Series, beating the Atlanta Braves 4-3. In recognition for their sportsmanship and skills, Wheaties cereal recognized two Twins players. Photos of both Kirby Puckett and Kent Hrbek were printed on Wheaties’ cereal boxes. Kirby Puckett was a center fielder and was inducted into the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001. Kent Hrbek was a first baseman and played for the Twins for fourteen years. Both players helped to secure the World Series win in 1991. I have one of these cereal boxes displayed in my Washington office.

 Dear  , 
As we prepare to welcome the new year, I wanted to take a moment to provide you a quick snapshot of the work we have done this year. While it has been an often challenging year for our region and our nation, I’m proud of the work that I’ve done in Connecticut and in Washington for the people of eastern Connecticut. With new opportunities ahead in 2019, I look forward to keeping in touch with you about my work and hearing from you about the priorities you have for the year ahead. 
One of the areas I am most proud of this year is the work my staff does every day to help constituents who have run into issues with their federal benefits or red tape in dealing with federal agencies. Over the course of the year, my dedicated staff has worked on over 1,000 cases from every corner of eastern Connecticut, helping with agencies like the VA or Social Security.  
Thanks to these efforts, we’ve helped return $1,965,729 to constituents who have worked with my office to resolve their cases. This includes nearly $850,000 in back pay and benefit adjustments through the Social Security Administration, over $626,000 in veteran's benefits and pay, and $427,000 in housing assistance such as mortgage rate adjustments and other help. 
As you can see in the examples below, however, not every case is about money or benefits – sometimes it’s about helping someone get their security clearance so they don’t lose their job or helping a veteran receive his or her long overdue military honors. If you think we can help you or someone you know with an issue they are having with federal agencies or benefits, please make sure to call my Norwich office at (860) 886-0139. 

Helping with Federal Student Loans 
Meredith Clermont-Ferrand is a professor at Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic and contacted my office seeking assistance with the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. A representative from her loan servicer, FedLoan Servicing, claimed that because she had rounded up her past 51 monthly payments-- they would not qualify for the loan forgiveness program. Upon receiving this information, our office sent an inquiry to the U.S. Department of Education requesting clarification and discovered that making an “overpayment” would not disqualify payments. Eventually, we received welcome news that all of Meredith’s payments would count towards her loan forgiveness.

Resolving Mortgage Challenges 
“A.H.”, a homeowner from Canterbury, contacted my office in August regarding her mortgage.  Previously, she was approved for a home modification, but the mortgage servicer had rescinded the new payment plan erroneously. Through ongoing communication and negotiation, my office successfully reinstated the modified plan, which saved the family hundreds of dollars each month and kept their local small business thriving.

Another homeowner, Ms. Maria Davila of Norwich, contacted my office regarding insurance monies approved by USAA Insurance Co.  Although the claim was approved, her mortgage servicer held the funds for an extended period in a restricted escrow account.  Due to health concerns, it was imperative that the funds be released for a clean air test and mold remediation. My office contacted the mortgage servicer and the first release of funds became available shortly thereafter.

Securing overdue honors for our veterans 
Thomas Southiere, a local veteran from Hebron, contacted our office seeking help with an issue he was having with military medals. Mr. Southiere served in Vietnam and upon his return home, was awarded several military decorations but never physically received the medals. Decades later he inquired to our office on how he could acquire his medals. Our office went ahead and contacted the national archives and after a bit of paperwork--our office received the medals and was able to give them to a very happy Mr. Southiere and family in an honorary ceremony. He received 10 medals including the Purple Heart.

Speeding up a slow federal bureaucracy  
Mr. Garbo of Stonington, a private airplane pilot, contacted our office seeking help with an issue he was having with the Federal Aviation Administration. Mr. Garbo had filed to have his license renewed before the looming expiration date but had yet to receive a reply. With the concern that this would jeopardize prescheduled flights made by his clients, our office contacted the FAA for a status update on the renewal and was quickly able to secure a digital copy of the renewed license so there were no flight delays!

Mr. Bargo of Stonington

Resolving the security clearance backlog 
With the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) clocking in a backlog of 600,000 for background investigations for security clearances--many individuals applying for jobs with security clearances have found the processing time to receive the clearance to take months and sometimes even years. For our region, that means delays in starting jobs at places like Electric Boat or many other jobs across eastern Connecticut. Although I have to withhold names and examples for security reasons, I can tell you that we have assisted dozens of individuals who were waiting months – or even years – for action on their clearance request. In most cases, we were able to positively resolve the issue and get people back to work or onto their new career path.  
￼

Helping connect families with Social Security 
Danielle, a constituent from Plainfield, contacted our office seeking assistance with an issue she was having with the Social Security Administration. Danielle was attempting to acquire survivor benefits for her daughter, Charlie, whose father had recently passed away. The process for SSA to verify the evidence of paternity that Danielle had submitted was taking an elongated period of time, so she reached out to our office for assistance. Our caseworker intervened and helped Danielle get the correct information to SSA to expedite the claim. Shortly thereafter, Danielle and Charlie were able to receive their survivor benefits and were also able to move into their own home.

Let us know how we can help   
These areas are just some of the many areas that my office is available to help with.  Although I cannot override the decisions made by a federal agency, I can often intervene on a person's behalf to answer questions, find solutions, or just cut through the red tape. The first step is to reach out and seek help, which you can do by calling my Norwich District office at (860) 886-0139 or visiting my website at https://courtney.house.gov/services/help-with-a-federal-agency.  
Thank you, again, for taking the time to read this update and others I have sent this year. My best to you and your family for a safe and happy new year.   
Sincerely,

Long’s Short Report – The first step in the right direction
By: Rep. Billy Long
The media likes to portray Congress as Republican vs. Democrat, and although that’s sometimes the case, there are still areas where we can come together and work to advance important legislation. Prison reform is one of those areas. In December, both the House of Representatives and Senate passed the First Step Act with overwhelming bipartisan support. This bill will overhaul the federal criminal justice system, which is long overdue.
There are nearly 200,000 inmates in our federal prison system. Ninety-five percent of these individuals will leave prison, but unfortunately, due to how the system is currently set up, around 38 percent of these inmates will be arrested again within five years of release. Our failure to provide adequate resources for prisoners has led to challenges reintegrating into society. That’s why prison reform is so important. This bill will not only help provides opportunities for inmates to gain valuable skills to become productive, law-abiding members of society, it will also create safer communities.
The First Step Act’s goal is to ensure inmates don’t return to prison by better preparing them for reentry into society. This bill will provide opportunities for inmates to gain valuable skills through vocational training, educational coursework and faith-based programs. This targeted approach will help keep our streets safe and give inmates the ability to make the most of their second chance.
The First Step Act will also create a fairer justice system. This bill will improve mandatory minimums, which over the years have caused overcrowding and excessive costs that hardworking taxpayers end up paying for. Specifically, this bill will reduce harsh sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and reform the three-strike mandatory life provision. It will also expand the safety valve, which will allow judges to avoid handing down mandatory minimums for certain offenses if the individual meets certain criteria.
Like President Trump said, it’s our job to fight for all citizens, even those who have made mistakes. The First Step Act does just that while also creating a safer America.
For more information on my activities in our district and in Washington I encourage you to follow my Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/Rep.Billy.Longand my Twitter page at https://twitter.com/USRepLong.

Dear Friend, 
As your representative, it is a privilege to serve you. Everyday I’m working to bring your voice to our nation’s capital and make government work for you. 
This year, my focus has continued to be on supporting and protecting my fellow Hoosiers.
	•	I fought to promote access to good paying jobs through my 9th annual Central Indiana Job Fair. The fair featured more than 145 employers and over 4,400 full and part-time positions. 
	•	I worked to draw attention to our city’s role in our nation's civil rights history by getting the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Park designated as a National Commemorative Site and added to the National Civil Rights Network.
	•	I also continued to proudly serve on the House Intelligence Committee, responding to threats around the world and investigating Russian meddling in our democracy. 
￼ 
This year, Congressman Carson's Kennedy-King Establishment Act was signed into law making the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Park a National Historic Site. 
  
My work in the Congress is about more than legislating – it’s about helping individual Hoosier families. This year, I responded to over 28,000 of your letters, calls, and emails, and helped over 700 Hoosiers navigate our federal bureaucracy by helping them get Veterans, Social Security, or other benefits they’ve rightfully earned.
I am looking forward to starting the 116th Congress and the opportunity it brings to fight for Hoosier values and Midwestern common sense. I will continue to push to protect Medicare and Social Security, support local workers and small business owners, and tackle gun violence, including funding a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) study of gun violence, all while advocating for universal background checks and an assault weapons ban. With the Democrats in the majority, I am also slated to become Chairman of a subcommittee on the House Intelligence Committee, where I will work to strengthen our intelligence agencies to prevent terrorism and fight threats to our security around the world. I also look forward to continuing my work on the House Transportation Committee, where I will prioritize investing in our nation's crumbling infrastructure. 
It is an honor and a privilege to serve you. Best wishes for a happy and healthy 2019!  

Your friend,
￼  André

Frequently Asked Questions from North Carolinians on the December 2018 Government Shutdown 
Will my mail still arrive during the shutdown? 
Yes.  The U.S. Postal Service is not affected by a government shutdown.  The U.S. Postal Service is an independent entity that is funded through the sale of its products and services, and not by tax dollars.  
Will I continue to receive my Social Security checks?  Yes.  During a government shutdown, recipients continue to receive their Social Security checks.  
Will Medicare and Medicaid be interrupted?  No.  The operations of Medicare and Medicaid will operate normally during the shutdown.   
Will veterans' health care and other veterans' programs continue as usual? Yes.  The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is funded through separate legislation which has already been approved. 
Which federal departments are affected by the partial federal government shutdown? There are nine federal departments affected by the government shutdown:  Homeland Security, Treasury, Agriculture, Interior, HUD, Justice, Commerce, Transportation, and State.  In addition, numerous critical smaller independent agencies, including EPA, the Small Business Administration, and NASA, are affected.  (The six federal departments that are already fully funded for FY 2019 and are not affected by the shutdown are:  Defense, Veterans Affairs, HHS, Education, Labor, and Energy.)  Read Congressman Butterfield's statement on the partial federal government shutdown.  
Can I get taxpayer assistance from IRS personnel during the shutdown?  It will likely be difficult.  If the government shutdown goes into January, it will have a significant impact on the IRS.  While the shutdown continues, 90 percent of the IRS staff is furloughed.  IRS’s “tax filing season” is January-April.  Beginning in January, some Americans will start thinking about filing their 2018 taxes, due April 15, 2019.  This will be the first year when Americans are filing their taxes under the new GOP tax law, and many will have numerous questions.  If the shutdown continues, the limited IRS staff will be unable to keep up with the questions coming in from taxpayers using the IRS customer service hotline.   
Can I get a passport during the shutdown?  Perhaps, with it depending on where you live.  The U.S. Passport Agency remains open during the shutdown and continues to issue passports.  However, depending on where you live, the State Department could curtail issuing passports where those passport services are offered in buildings run by another agency that is shut down.     
Will I be able to continue visiting the national parks during the shutdown?   The Trump Administration claims that the vast majority of national parks are “open” during the shutdown (on the grounds that barriers have not been put up at the parks to prevent entry.)  However, the fact is that there are no services for visitors to National Park Service sites during the shutdown.  Services such as restrooms, visitors’ centers, campgrounds, information kiosks, trash removal, and interpretative programs are all closed during the shutdown.  The vast majority of National Park Service employees are furloughed.  Also, law enforcement staffing is sharply curtailed, so visitors’ safety will be put at risk. 
Will I be able to obtain a new flood insurance policy or renew my existing flood insurance policy during the shutdown? No.  Just yesterday, December 27, the Trump Administration’s FEMA ruled to not renew the National Flood Insurance Program during the shutdown.  The National Association of Realtors (NAR) has stated that this decision by FEMA “jeopardizes tens of thousands of home sales across America, as NAR estimates up to 40,000 closings are disrupted each month that the NFIP cannot issue flood insurance policies.”  
How many federal employees have to work without pay during the government shutdown?   There are approximately 420,000 federal employees, deemed “essential,” including FBI agents, DEA agents, Secret Service agents, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents, who are being required to work without pay during the shutdown.  None of them will receive a paycheck until the shutdown is over and the government re-opens. The longer President Trump and the Republican-led Congress allow the shutdown to last, the longer these federal employees are working without a paycheck, increasing their families’ financial difficulties. 
How many federal employees have been put on unpaid furlough during the shutdown?  There are also approximately 380,000 federal employees who have been placed on unpaid furlough during the partial government shutdown. They are also not receiving any pay during the shutdown. 
Will the 420,000 federal employees forced to work without pay during the shutdown receive the pay for their work when the shutdown is over?  Yes.  Under federal law, those federal employees forced to work without pay in the shutdown are guaranteed the pay they have earned when the government re-opens.  
 Will the 380,000 federal employees who were placed on unpaid furlough during the shutdown receive back pay when the shutdown is over? That will be up to the Congress and the White House. Legislation would have to be enacted.  The precedent has been that furloughed employees are later paid, through legislation.  Indeed, after every previous shutdown, Congress has passed legislation mandating that furloughed workers get paid. 
What is the impact of the partial government shutdown on small businesses? A shutdown halts federal loans to small businesses.  During a shutdown, the Small Business Administration stops approving applications for small businesses to obtain loans and guarantees, typically $1 billion per month.  Indeed, on Dec. 22, SBA put a notice on Facebook simply stating, “Due to the lapse in government funding, SBA will remain inactive until further notice.”   
What is the impact on home mortgage applications? During the shutdown, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) will see significant delays in loan processing and approvals, due to the furloughing of most employees.  Thousands of people trying to buy a new home or refinance a FHA-insured mortgage will likely be put on standby.  
What is the impact on FDA’s food safety activities?  During the shutdown, the FDA will be unable to support a number of its food safety activities.  FDA has furloughed 40 percent of its employees.   As a result, it will have to reduce its routine inspections of domestic food facilities.  For example, in the 16-day GOP shutdown in 2013, the FDA had to delay nearly 360 food safety inspections. 
  
Need Assistance? 
Congressman Butterfield’s Wilson, Durham, and Washington, DC offices will remain open for normal business hours and will be on hand to help constituents as best we can with the consequences of the partial government shutdown.

Lipinski Honors Area Veterans
￼ Lipinski honors area veterans at a ceremony in Oak Lawn.
“I am committed to ensuring that America’s heroic women and men in uniform and their families continue to be supported once they return home.  From education to healthcare to housing assistance and other benefits, I have always made it a priority of my office to fight for those brave individuals that have sacrificed so much for our nation.  
“I am proud to have a staff member whose primary focus is to address the questions and concerns of veterans in the district.  Whether it is an issue with your benefits as a veteran, a problem with obtaining your service records, or if you have earned medals for your service but never received them, I can help.”
 
Lipinski Bill Commemorating WWII Clears House and Senate
￼
Congressman Lipinski is pleased to announce that S 3661, a bill he co-sponsored that establishes a Depart of Defense program to commemorate the 75th anniversary of World War II, has passed both the House and Senate. The bill will educate the public about the war’s history and pay tribute to the contributions made on the home front.
 “The victory of the Allies in the War and the contributions of America’s Armed Forces must never be forgotten,” Lipinski said. “That is why commemorating this anniversary should be done in extraordinary ways. Commemorating this critical event in history will also allow us to recognize our World War II veterans who are still living. We must listen to and learn from their stories while we’re still able.”
 
Lipinski Helps Dedicate the New Legion Park and Veterans Memorial in Summit
￼
In October, Congressman Lipinski spoke at the dedication ceremony for the new Legion Park in Summit, which features a veterans memorial.
""It's great to have another beautiful location in the area for us to reflect on the brave service and sacrifice of members of our armed forces. And the park provides a nice place for children to play and this close-knit community to come together. Thanks to the Summit Park District, members of the Argo-Summit American Legion Post 735, and Mayor Sergio Rodriguez for their hard work.""
 
Lipinski Encourages Veterans to Share Their Stories for the Library of Congress' Veterans History Project
￼ The congressman discusses the needs of veterans in Washington and  thanks a WWII vet for his service and sacrifice. 
Congressman Lipinski is asking veterans in the Third District to share their stories so they can be preserved in the Library of Congress’ Veterans History Project (VHP).  For any veteran that is interested, the Congressman’s office will set up a recorded interview at a local site.  The VHP collects, preserves, and makes accessible the personal accounts of veterans so that current and future generations can better understand the contributions and sacrifices they made.  All veterans are invited to call Lipinski’s Chicago office at 773-948-6223 for more information or to schedule an interview.  At the conclusion of the recorded interview, participants will receive a copy and one will be sent to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. 
“I encourage all veterans to take advantage of this unique opportunity,” Rep. Lipinski said.  “Our history is the story of every person who has contributed in some way to our great nation, and that means every veteran, including those that served during the Cold War.  Our heroes are not just those we read about in the history books, but every man and woman who has served our nation in uniform.”  All recorded interviews will be housed in the permanent collections of the Library of Congress.  They will be available to researchers, scholars, students, authors, filmmakers, and anyone else visiting the library.  For more information, go online to lipinski.house.gov.
 
Scam Alert
￼
The Palos Park police are warning residents of a telephone scam in which a caller claims to represent the Veterans Administration and then requests money or personal information. Remember that the VA will never call you and request money, even if you see “Veterans Affairs” on your caller ID. Never give out any sensitive data such as financial and banking information. If you need any help with your benefits, please contact my office at (773) 948-6223.
 
Time for a New Flag?
￼
Remember that if your flag or flags have seen better days, the Congressman’s offices in Chicago, Oak Lawn, Orland Park, and Lockport will accept worn American flags for proper disposal. 
If you’re looking for a replacement flag for special occasions, please contact the office in Washington toll free at 866-822-5701 for more information on how to purchase an American flag that's been flown over the U.S. Capitol.  Please be advised that requests cannot be processed more than one month prior to date the flag would need to be flown.  Congressman Lipinski is also happy to provide veterans their first flag free of charge.

About
￼
Dear Friend,
As the year draws to a close, I wanted to update you on some of what I worked on this year, share a few thoughts on what was accomplished, and talk about what we will face next year.
This has been a challenging time for the nation and in Congress. And as we approach the new year with the government still shut down, next year looks to be equally difficult. But I’m proud to say that despite the partisan differences at the Capitol, we have had some success this year advancing local proposals that I have focused on for much of my career — like the expansion of open space, mass transit, earthquake early warning, and quality of life measures for our community — as well as many new ideas.
At a national level, one of my top priorities continues to be my duties as the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. While overseeing the nation’s intelligence professionals and shoring up our cyber defenses, the Committee had the added responsibility this year of conducting the investigation into Russia’s attack on our democracy. In the coming year, we have a lot of work remaining not only on the investigation, but most important, on how to protect our nation from attacks like that in the future.
This year was also spent pushing back against Administration attacks on the freedom of the press, the independence of the Justice Department, and the mission of the EPA and State Department.
January will bring a change to the Congress in the form of divided government when Democrats become the Majority in the House. I believe the first priority must be to put forward a positive legislative agenda — one that helps Americans provide for their families, put bread on the table, and access affordable health care when they get sick. Caring for the needs of the American people goes hand in hand with our oversight responsibilities.
I look forward to the new year with the hope that we can be effective agents for change and with a profound sense of duty at a time when I believe our democracy is at risk. We are a strong and resilient nation and I know we will get through this by doing our part to advance and cherish the values and ideals of America.
Happy Holidays and a very Happy New Year,

2018 Legislative and Oversight Initiatives
Leading the Effort on Funding an Early Earthquake Warning System
￼
Rep. Schiff continues to lead the effort to get an Earthquake Early Warning System up and running along the entire West Coast, including California. The system – called ShakeAlert – has the potential to save lives, prevent injuries and protect infrastructure and property. 
Despite the Trump Administration’s initial lack of support for this crucial lifesaving initiative, Schiff helped secure $22.9 million for the system in the FY18 funding bill passed in March and is working to ensure that funding is sustained. In October, he joined ShakeAlert partners in announcing the next, public phase of the system. Now, businesses, organizations, and local governments can work with ShakeAlert to send alerts to their members. Within the next couple years, individuals all along the West Coast should be able to receive alerts on their phones.

Introducing Legislation to Bring Vision Services to Underserved Students and Communities
￼
In November, Rep. Schiff introduced the See the Board Act. The bill would authorize the Department of Health and Human Services to make grants available to support the work of organizations that are bringing vision services to schools in underserved communities across the country. While these programs would still rely on the generosity and volunteerism of eyecare professionals, the See the Board Act would help nonprofits with some of the substantial equipment and infrastructure costs.
“Thousands of kids across the nation need glasses, but because they have never received an eye exam, they struggle through school and life, for lack of a pair of glasses that would often be free for them and their families,” said Schiff. “Grants to allow these organizations to expand their work to reach more underserved urban and rural schools would be a cost-effective intervention, helping potentially millions of students whose performance and self-confidence suffers for lack of a pair of affordable glasses.”

Bipartisan Congenital Heart Disease Bill Passes the House
In February, the House passed the bipartisan Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act, introduced by Reps. Schiff and Gus Bilirakis (R-FL). The bill supports critical research, education and awareness for congenital heart disease (CHD) — the most common birth defect and the leading cause of infant mortality. Children and adults with CHD require ongoing, costly, specialized cardiac care and face a lifelong risk of permanent disability and premature death. The President signed the bill into law on December 21, 2018.   “Children born with congenital heart defects face lingering health risks and increased medical costs throughout their entire lives,” said Rep. Schiff. “This bipartisan bill will enable the Center for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health to continue vital research studies into early childhood congenital heart defects to assess the lifelong needs of those born with CHD.”
Taking Next Step to Protect the Rim of the Valley Corridor
￼
One of Rep. Schiff’s top legislative priorities for the last decade has been to preserve the Rim of the Valley Corridor. Schiff has introduced legislation to expand the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area by 191,000 acres. This would help protect open space while preserving private property rights.
This year, Schiff worked to grow support across the aisle – including securing the cosponsorship of every representative whose districts include any portion of the Rim of the Valley. With Democrats retaking the Majority in the House next year, Schiff is hopeful that the bill will finally receive a hearing and vote and be passed into law.

Bipartisan Child Protection Improvements Act Becomes Law
When he was first out of law school, Rep. Schiff volunteered with Big Brothers Big Sisters. Through this experience, Schiff grew to understand the tremendous amount of trust put into volunteers at child-serving organizations across the country. In the vast majority of cases, that trust is well placed. Unfortunately, there are exceptions.
For this reason, Schiff championed and introduced the Child Protection Improvements Act (CPIA), a bipartisan bill which would ensure that organizations in every state that serve children, seniors and individuals with disabilities, can access FBI background checks for prospective volunteers and staff. FBI fingerprint background checks are considered to be the gold standard of background checks, and this bill will allow parents to trust that their children and loved ones are in good hands.
Rep. Schiff worked with his Republican colleagues to pass the Child Protection Improvements Act, and it was signed into law by the President in March. The Department of Justice is now required by law to implement the provisions of CPIA by March 2019, and Schiff is keeping pressure on the DOJ to ensure that the deadline is met.

Fighting Against the Trump Administration’s Separation of Immigrant Families
￼
Rep. Schiff has consistently fought against the Trump Administration’s decision to separate immigrant children from their families when they try to come across the southern border. That is why Schiff led an effort in the House to prevent any funds from being used by the Administration to separate children from their families entering the U.S. In a letter with 94 other House Members led by Schiff, he also demanded that no funds could be used to construct so-called “tent cities” on military bases.
Schiff visited a shelter facility in July to witness first hand the confinement and treatment of immigrant children who were separated from their parents. He has also cosponsored legislation that would outlaw the separation of families permanently. Schiff will continue to fight the efforts by the Trump Administration to separate families and militarize the southern border of the United States.
Watch Rep. Schiff discuss visiting the shelter facility here.
Decreasing Helicopter Noise Above Homes, and Making the Skies Safer
This year, Rep. Schiff continued his efforts to pressure the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to regulate helicopter noise above Los Angeles County. After learning that the FAA planned to end the helicopter noise complaint system, which was started as a result of Schiff’s actions, he led a letter with Senators Feinstein and Harris and other members of the Los Angeles delegation urging the FAA to reconsider termination.
In addition, Schiff offered an amendment to the FAA Reauthorization bill to require the FAA to regulate helicopters above Los Angeles County. While this amendment did not succeed, Schiff was able to include an amendment into the FAA bill giving the agency the authority to detect and monitor drones entering restricted airspace. This is in response to the increase in drones entering space above airports as well as areas where firefighters are battling fires across California.

Increasing Funding to Restore the Los Angeles River
￼
For years, Rep. Schiff has been working with the Los Angeles delegation to restore the Los Angeles River to its natural prominence and beauty. This year, he successfully lobbied Congress to provide significant funding for the Army Corps of Engineers so that it could continue its early work on the Los Angeles Ecosystem Restoration Project.

Introducing Legislation to Support our Veterans with a New Opportunity to Serve the Nation During Times of Crisis
In May, Rep. Schiff introduced legislation to provide training, employment opportunities and a new way to serve for millions who served their nation in uniform. The Veterans Crisis Response Corps Act would leverage the unique skills of veterans, augmented by training, and bring them to bear on a variety of disaster response, both at home and abroad.
Schiff’s legislation would establish a new independent agency – the VetCorps – with the mission of matching veterans with a desire and ability to serve with crisis response, hazard mitigation, development, infrastructure, and other projects that can utilize their skill sets. In keeping with our commitment to veterans, it would provide training, employment, and a new way to serve for millions of Americans who served their nation.

Working to Pass the U.S.S. Frank E. Evans Vietnam War Memorial Bill
￼
Rep. Schiff successfully passed a bipartisan amendment to require the names of 74 sailors who died aboard the USS Frank E. Evans in 1969 to be added to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC. For years, Schiff has been urging the Department of Defense to include the Evans sailors on the Memorial Wall. 
The amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act offered by Schiff and Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) passed by voice vote, but was unfortunately stripped out of the final bill by the Senate. Schiff will continue to fight for the inclusion of the names and pursue new legislation in 2019 so that the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives can see their sacrifice properly recognized.

Schiff Participates in Town Hall to Discuss Gun Violence
￼
Last month, Rep. Schiff held a town hall with State Senator Anthony Portantino, Andrea Welsing of the LA County Public Health Department, and Dr. Karen Rogers of Children’s Hospital Los Angeles to discuss the need to deal with gun violence, from mass shootings, daily homicides and people taking their own lives. During the town hall, Schiff called for commonsense solutions that help prevent gun violence as well as treat those who are impacted by this grave threat to the public health and welfare.

Schiff Honors Women of the Year
￼
In April, Rep. Schiff held a luncheon in Echo Park to honor a group of inspiring women from communities in the 28th Congressional District. The honorees included Claudette Nicole Saba Monestime (Atwater Village), Vicky Marachelian (Burbank), Isa-Kae Meksin (Echo Park), Emily Gleicher (Elysian Valley), Lori Hartwell (Glendale), Anastasia Mann (Hollywood Hills), Donna Ford (La Canada Flintridge), Kiljoo Lee Kurumada (La Crescenta), Brenda Levin (Los Feliz), Patricia Anne Kinaga (Pasadena), Nina Sorkin (Silver Lake), Kelly Erin Decker (Kagel Canyon), Medea Kalognomos (Sunland) and Ivy Bottini (West Hollywood).

Schiff Recognizes Student Artists in the Community at the Congressional Art Competition
￼
Each year, Rep. Adam Schiff and Members of Congress from all over the nation host a congressional competition for high school students. In May, Schiff held this year’s art competition at Descanso Gardens in La Cañada Flintridge.
Schiff announced that Jennifer Bae’s acrylic painting “Have a Slice” won first place and will be displayed in the United States Capitol for one year, alongside winners from other Congressional Districts across the nation. Additionally, Schiff announced that Abrielle Marsden’s acrylic painting “Perception” and Alejandra Santana’s photograph “Sunny Light Up” won second and third place, respectively. The “People’s Choice” award went to Vilen Manukyan for his graphite and acrylic artwork, “Path Behind the Glory.” Their artwork will be displayed in Congressman Schiff’s Washington, DC Office, his Burbank District Office, and his Hollywood District Office.
Schiff Joins Seismologists and Officials at Caltech to Announce Roll-Out and Next Phase of ShakeAlert
￼
Rep. Schiff joined seismologists and officials from Caltech, U.S. Geological Service and the California Office of Emergency Services at Caltech to announce the roll-out of the next phase of ShakeAlert, the West Coast earthquake early warning system, marking a major milestone in their efforts to prepare for the next major earthquake.
Even with just a few seconds of warning, trains can be slowed or stopped, surgery can be paused, or a person can quickly take shelter before shaking begins. Schiff will continue to work to secure the funding to build out this critical lifesaving tool, and expand pilot projects across the state like those already up and running in public transportation systems, schools, hospitals, and utilities.

Schiff Speaks with Students at Burbank High School
￼
Young people are leading the way on climate change, gun violence prevention and so much more. In February, Rep. Schiff met with students at Burbank High School to discuss important issues like these.
As President Obama liked to remind his audiences, the new generation can truly say, “we are the ones we’ve been waiting for” and will be the change agents our country needs. Schiff enjoyed talking with such enthusiastic students who are so impressively informed and engaged.
Schiff Marches with Members of the Community to Commemorate the Armenian Genocide
￼
Every year, Rep. Schiff marches to commemorate the 1.5 million men, women, and children killed in the Armenian Genocide more than one hundred years ago. He marches to fight against genocide and hatred all over the world, to call for justice and restitution, and to pledge we will never forget.
Schiff has introduced bipartisan legislation to commemorate the Armenian Genocide each of the nine terms he has served. In the new Congress, Schiff will reintroduce legislation to formally recognize the Armenian Genocide in the new year.

￼
In February, seventeen students and staff members were murdered in a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The next month, in March, Rep. Schiff met with the Southern California alumni of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School to discuss what Congress can and must do to prevent gun violence.

12/28/18 10:47,2018 Report:  Federal Dollars for Tampa Bay,"
￼ 
Dear friends,   As 2018 winds down and we look ahead to 2019, I want to thank you for the opportunity to represent you and the wonderful Tampa Bay community.
Everyday, my Tampa constituent services team, Tery Sanchez, Dee Gonzalez and Tania Fernandez (with help from all of Team Castor) work hard to cut through red tape to advocate for the benefits and services our neighbors have earned, including for veterans, Social Security and Medicare for seniors, people with disabilities and more. In 2018, we returned $2.6 million to veterans, seniors, small businesses and families across Tampa Bay and assisted with more than 2,900 cases. 
More than half of the $2.6 million in federal benefits went to veterans/military and their families. With more than 98,000 veterans in Hillsborough County, the highest veteran population in Florida according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, every day we are focused on benefit adjustments, disability claims and appeals, debt waivers, as well as expedited benefits decisions and record requests.  My team tackles complex cases and works persistently with federal agencies to get results. My neighbors often turn to us as a last resort or when they are on the brink. The dollars and benefits returned to them can be a critical lifeline.   Grants – $340 million  My office also worked this year to secure more than $340 million in federal grants for this district to create jobs, invest in education and infrastructure, and support the important work of local partners.  Grants bolster vital education and job training resources for students and families who need it the most.  They can grow our region’s startup hub, lead to expanding small businesses and boosting jobs.   Among the federal grants that I championed this year, most recently was $300,000 to Tampa Bay Wave to help launch a regional investor collaborative.    Bay Area Legal Services, the Spring of Tampa Bay and Sunrise of Pasco County also received a $600,000 federal grant to provide ”seamless” assistance – legal aid for our neighbors experiencing domestic violence, sexual assault, and other issues. The University of South Florida (USF) received a $2.7 million grant to conduct trials on Alzheimer’s disease prevention. Small and large grants make a meaningful impact – from a $5,365 grant awarded to the Agency for Community Treatment Services (ACTS) by the Department of Veterans Affairs to a $2.7 million grant to H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute.  Earlier in 2018, researchers and scientists from USF and Moffitt Cancer Center shared how grants advance their research and create jobs. USF, Moffitt, nonprofits and the many growing businesses make our region a hotbed for economic growth and I am proud to team up with them to bring our tax dollars back to Tampa to create higher paying  jobs.  We look forward to an active 2019! You can count on us to be your advocates.

Dear friend, 
I want to express my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to represent you in the U.S. House of Representatives. Since 2003, I have had the privilege of providing the residents of the 32nd Congressional District of Texas with a voice in Washington. And before that, I was honored to serve the constituents of Texas' 5th District from 1997 to 2003. 
However, I look at each of you as so much more than constituents. You are my neighbors, fellow church-goers, mentors to my sons, volunteer partners, and friends. 
We share the same love of community and country, we want what is best for our children and families, and we work hard for the good of North Texas.  
While we are in a season of change, I trust that these fundamental similarities and shared values will withstand the test of time. I look forward to continuing to call you my neighbors, friends, and fellow patriots for many years to come. 
In my 15 years as your Congressman, my staff and I have been privileged to: 
Welcome more than 6,000 North Texans to my Washington office and provide them with a personal U.S. Capitol tour.
￼ 
Host nearly 1,500 high school students in Washington, D.C. for my annual Leadership and Growth Program to see firsthand how government works and learn invaluable leadership skills.
￼
Nominate more than 200 North Texas students to our distinguished U.S. Service Academies.
￼
Continue my support for the Boy Scouts of America, for example, by passing the Boy Scouts of America Centennial Commemorative Coin Act.
￼
Serve as Chairman of the prestigious House Rules Committee, ultimately shepherding many critical bills, like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, into law.
￼
It has been the honor of a lifetime and I will continue to be a voice for those who feel their thoughts, concerns, and ideas have fallen on deaf ears.  
From one friend to another, I wish you and your family a Happy New Year.  
Respectfully yours,

Christmas in the Middle East
 ￼ 
One of the greatest honors in serving our community in Congress is spending Christmas Day with our U.S. Troops deployed to war zones overseas, so that I can personally express the love and gratitude that our community has for their brave service and sacrifice. On behalf of our community, I served Christmas dinner to our courageous heroes whose missions include operations in Iraq and Syria. And I ran into Bucks County’s own Andrew Alexander of Doylestown and Mike Mignogna of Warrington, two courageous hometown heroes and public servants! 
  
Senate Passes Fitzpatrick Cyberstalking Bill
 ￼ 
We have no higher responsibility than to protect our kids. I’m pleased that the Senate has advanced the Combat Online Predators Act. We must do everything we can to forcefully respond to egregious instances of stalking and cyberstalking. This legislation, inspired by Erin and Madison Zezzo, ensures that, not only are we increasing penalties for cyberstalking crimes against minors, but we are also requiring federal law enforcement officials to evaluate and update practices to combat this dangerous harassment. I urge House leadership to immediately bring the Senate-passed bill up for a vote before the end of the Congress.

House Send Historic Criminal Justice Reform to President
￼  
The U.S. House overwhelmingly passed the FIRST STEP Act [S. 756], prison reform that would lower recidivism and prison populations through rehabilitative programming. I’m proud to cast my vote in support of the FIRST STEP Act with my fellow Problem Solvers Caucus members. As a former FBI agent, I understand criminal justice reform is critically important to reducing crime and recidivism. This bipartisan measure demonstrates our investment and confidence in our fellow Americans. While there is still more work to accomplish, this vote marks a generational shift towards a criminal justice system that establishes a more practical, efficient rehabilitative framework to keep communities safe.

Statement on Government Shutdown
Government shutdowns are not an effective way to govern. They’re costly, unnecessary, and demonstrate a failure to lead from both parties. I have not, and will not, vote to shut down the government. It’s the basic duty of Congress to fund the federal government. Shutdowns disrupt government services, compromise national security, and cause uncertainty for federal employees. Critical funding for programs like the Violence Against Women Act lapse. Congress should follow the way the American people run their businesses and manage their families: lead by example to build consensus and solve problems in a dignified, honorable manner.

NEWSROOM
ON THE ISSUES
LEGISLATIVE
December 27, 2018
 
Dear Friend,
 
There has been a lot of news about the Affordable Care Act (ACA) recently and I want to ensure you have the latest details.
 
Please know that the ACA remains in effect, and there is still time for New Yorkers to sign up for affordable health care coverage. Visit nystateofhealth.ny.gov or call 1 (855) 355-5777 by January 15th for coverage beginning February 1st. The final deadline is January 31st.
 
There has been confusion due to a December 14th court ruling, wherein a U.S. District Court judge struck down the entire ACA. I believe the ruling, which jeopardizes millions of Americans’ health care, is deeply flawed. If this decision is allowed to stand, the critical consumer protections that families rely on will disappear. That means no protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions, no ban on annual and lifetime limits, and no limit on out-of-pocket costs. On top of that, 17 million Americans would lose their health insurance in the first year alone, and premiums would increase for millions more.
 
But this case is not over. This ruling will be challenged immediately, and I will work tirelessly to ensure that it never goes into effect. My colleagues and I will fight to make sure this lawsuit doesn't take away millions of Americans’ health coverage.
 
The American people have made it clear time and time again that they want to maintain the vital protections within the ACA. That’s why this backdoor attempt to repeal the law cannot stand.
Sincerely, ￼ Eliot L. Engel MEMBER OF CONGRESS

Partial Government Shutdown
Honor to Serve the People of New Jersey’s 11th Congressional District in Congress
Salute: My Excellent Staff
 
Partial Government Shutdown  
It is deeply disappointing that Congress was unable to reach a compromise that would have prevented this destabilizing, unnecessary, partial government shutdown during the holidays. I urge House and Senate leadership—Democrat and Republican—and the White House to come together and find a deal that will reopen the government, provide much-needed border security funding, and help Americans recover from recent natural disasters—as quickly as possible.
 
The Appropriations Committee did its work on all twelve bills and gave our House and Senate leaderships every opportunity to include our bipartisan efforts in the final ‘deal’ to keep the government open.
 
I am proud of the efforts of all twelve Chairs, Ranking Members and all committee members, but most especially the professional committee staff for all their hard work and dedication in recent weeks, but especially during the August ‘break’ or recess, which most missed because they were still in Washington working on their bills to anticipate every ‘exit strategy’!
 
Honor to Serve New Jersey’s 11th Congressional District in Congress
It has been the honor of my life to serve and represent the people of New Jersey’s 11th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives for twenty four years.
 
During my time serving here there have been times of great tragedy including the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the ravages of Hurricane Sandy on my home state.  In my role on the House Appropriations Committee, I made sure that New Jersey’s needs were met in both the immediate aftermath as well as over time in the wake of these events. I have proudly been able to secure key federal investments for New Jersey to strengthen our economy, our institutions of higher education, our hospitals and public transportation systems, to preserve open space and protect the environment and to better serve our veterans and our fellow citizens with mental illness and developmental disabilities.
 
As Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, over the past two years, I had a singular focus on “getting our work done”. In Fiscal Year 2019 we approved 75 percent of all annual discretionary funding prior to the start of the fiscal year – a critical step in returning to the regular federal funding process, and an achievement that has not occurred in twenty-two years. In Fiscal Year 2018, we passed all twelve bills in record time through regular order, and three Disaster Supplemental Appropriations bills, historic in scope, and the expediency with which we acted to help our fellow citizens in times of despair and destruction.
 
Throughout my service in this House, my deepest devotion has been supporting our Armed Forces, all volunteers, wonderful men and women, and their families, here and abroad, and those warfighters who have returned home with injuries and who depend on a functioning veterans’ health care system.  To those of you I have met while you served us overseas and to those of you that I have sat by your bedside, I hope and trust I have served you well.
 
A key component of my focus to ensure our nation’s military remains second to none included supporting New Jersey’s critical military installations. Chief among these was my efforts to expand the mission of Picatinny Arsenal and support the thousands of engineers, scientists and dedicated professionals who work to provide our warfighters with the resources that allow our Armed Forces to succeed on the battlefield.
 
I am also extremely proud of my efforts to provide substantial increases in funding to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency to hasten their critical work of recovering the remains of military personnel lost in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. As a Vietnam veteran, I will never forget those who died, were wounded, or were lost or missing in Vietnam, Laos, or Cambodia.
 
I have worked in a bipartisan manner, not just in times of crisis but always, because I believe it best serves our District, our state and our country. My father reminded me often that we are temporary stewards of the public trust.  I have sincerely endeavored to earn that trust every day and I thank my constituents and my home state of New Jersey for the honor to serve.
 
Salute: My Excellent Staff
The unsung heroes of my time in Congress are my staff who served in Morristown and Washington, my Chief of Staff, Kathleen Hazlett, Austin Bone, Kacy Hobbis, Nora Burns, Aura Dunn, Judith Lemus, Ryan Gallagher, Anthony Pryer, Nick D’Alessio, and many other men and women who dedicated their time and talents to serve my constituents. And, the professional staff of the House Appropriations Committee, led by Nancy Fox, my former Chief of Staff.

News from Congressman Lamb 
￼
Dear Friends,  
Since I was sworn into Congress in April, our office has received thousands of letters and calls from constituents sharing their questions, opinions and suggestions, and I greatly appreciate the time and effort you have taken to communicate with me.

I came to Congress to represent the people of Pennsylvania’s 18th District, to reach across the aisle, find common ground, and get things done.  That's what I've tried to do during my time.  I’ve worked on legislation with members of both parties.  I’ve supported Republican bills and Democratic bills that would help people in our region, and I’ve voted against Republican and Democratic bills that I didn't think were in our District's best interests. 

As a veteran and a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, one of my first priorities has been working on issues that affect veterans and military families in Pennsylvania and all over the country.  I’m glad that we've been able to work together in a bipartisan way to get things done for veterans who have sacrificed so much to protect our country.  I have worked to introduce and help pass meaningful bills through the Committee, including H.R. 5805 to protect the VA from arbitrary budget cuts and H.R. 6815, the Military Learning for Credit Act, to help veterans who are working towards their degrees receive college credit for prior military training. 

Combating the heroin epidemic will also continue to be a top priority in Congress.  Pennsylvania had one of the greatest overdose death rate increases from 2015 to 2017, and in 2017 more than 5,000 Pennsylvanians died from overdoses.  This is a crisis that demands comprehensive action, and I’m going to continue to push for the major investments we need to save lives from the disease of addiction.  We also know that fentanyl is a major factor in the increase in overdose deaths.  That's why I introduced H.R. 5871, the bipartisan POWER Act, which gives first responders the tools to test and identify fentanyl in real time, to protect themselves from exposure and to assist with investigations that get these drugs off the street.  I also voted for the SUPPORT for Patients and Community Act (H.R. 6), a bipartisan package that included dozens of proposals to address the devastating opioid crisis in America.  This important legislation passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in June 2018 by a vote of 396-14 and was signed into law by the President in October.

I believe Congress must also work to strengthen and protect Social Security and keep our commitments to seniors and hardworking Americans.  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 1902, the Social Security 2100 Act, which would expand benefits and keep the system fully funded through the year 2100.  I will continue to fight against any efforts to cut or privatize Social Security and make sure seniors get the benefits they have earned. 

As our economy grows, I think it's critical for Congress to support and encourage that growth while also fighting for strong labor protections to make sure our workers get their fair share of the benefits of a strong American economy.  I will continue to push for a major bipartisan infrastructure bill to help repair our crumbling roads and bridges and create good jobs, and I cosponsored H.R. 5137, the Buy America 2.0 Act, to require that federally-funded transportation and infrastructure projects only use American-made raw materials and manufactured goods.  I also supported efforts to protect workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively, and I cosponsored legislation to protect mine workers' pensions and health care benefits, so we keep the promises we made to people who sacrificed so much to help build this country.

I believe that every American has a right to go see a doctor when they're sick, and that means all Americans deserve high-quality, affordable health insurance -- including for people with cancer, diabetes, asthma, or any other preexisting condition.  No senior citizen should ever have to choose between buying medicine and buying food, and no family should have to choose between keeping their kids healthy and keeping the lights on.  That is why I’ve cosponsored several bills to expand critical Medicare coverage, and I’ll continue to push for real, bipartisan solutions to protect people with preexisting conditions, keep and improve the Affordable Care Act, and make health insurance and prescription drugs more affordable for all Americans.

I believe that when Congress works together and stays focused on getting things done for the people we serve, we can find common ground and make a real difference in people's lives.  That’s what I have worked to do in my first term in Congress, and what will continue to guide me in the future.

It has been an honor representing the people of Pennsylvania’s 18th district.  If you would like to stay updated on my activities in both Washington and southwestern Pennsylvania representing the people of Pennsylvania’s new 17th district, please visit my website at: lamb.house.gov.

Dear Lindsey,

 ￼
 ￼
It’s been an honor to visit our troops deployed to the Middle East every Christmas since coming to Congress; a tradition continuing again this week. I’m so grateful of these men and women who defend our freedoms and sacrifice so much.
Spending Christmas away from their families isn’t easy, and for many of our servicemen and women this isn’t the first holiday season away from home. It was an honor to be able to again spend Christmas and the holiday season with them in the Middle East to personally thank them for their service, serve them lunches and dinner and break bread, let them know how much they are appreciated and how many Americans are thinking of them, praying for them and immensely grateful for their service. It was also great to be able to bring a little bit of home to them by delivering chocolate chip cookies from Tate’s Bake Shop; based in New York’s First Congressional District, to deployed constituents from Orient, Riverhead and elsewhere. 
From my family to yours, have a blessed and safe remainder of your Christmas week.  With Best Regards,   ￼  Lee Zeldin  Member of Congress

A Funding Lapse
As you may know, last Thursday, the House passed legislation that would have kept the government running, taken steps toward securing the southern border by funding the wall, and provided additional disaster aid for those states, including Georgia, affected by Hurricane Michael. Unfortunately, the Senate failed to take further action and the second Schumer Shutdown of the year is now underway.

It’s important to keep it mind that this is a partial shutdown because Congress funded nearly three-fourths of the discretionary budget earlier this year through the passage of several appropriations packages, fully funding the Department of Defense, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, and others. One major item still remaining is the funding for the Department of Homeland Security. 

Democrats have shown their hand – they prefer open borders over an open government. As Members of Congress, we took an oath of allegiance to the citizens of the United States, not those trying to enter it illegally. While we can’t avoid a partial shutdown at this point, Congress can control how long it lasts. I call on my colleagues in both chambers to come to the table and do what is right for our Nation by putting the safety and security of Americans ahead of pandering to their open-border base. 

Border security is national security, and the reality is the Democrats’ platform previously supported a border barrier, border security funding, and additional border patrol agents. Now, they’ve done a complete about-face on these critical priorities and placed political expediency in front of delivering results for the American people. Our constituents did not send us to Washington to shut down the government, and it’s time for Senate Democrats to stop blocking efforts to secure our southern border and protect our communities. 

I appeared on Fox News last week to discuss our efforts to secure the border and deliver on the promises we’ve made to the American people.
￼

 
Hice in the House
Last week marked an important win for criminal justice reform. With the passage of S. 756, the FIRST Step Act, in the Senate on Tuesday followed by the House approval of the measure on Thursday with my support, President Trump signed this landmark legislation into law on Friday.

The FIRST Step Act will not only help make our criminal justice system more efficient and fair, but it will also continue to ensure Americans are protected from violent criminals. This bill makes improvements to our justice system that correct current issues by allowing judges more discretion in sentencing, limiting the harsh potency of mandatory minimums, and adding critical funding to prevent recidivism. To be clear, this new law does not let criminals “off the hook.” For serious offenses, stiff penalties remain enshrined in law. America is the land of promise and opportunity, and the FIRST Step Act paves the way for nonviolent, low-risk offenders with that very opportunity – the opportunity for a fresh start and the chance to become productive members of society.

While no bill is perfect, I am heartened by the potential of this measure. I applaud Governor Nathan Deal and Congressman Doug Collins for their hard work throughout this process, and I’m proud that Congress and President Trump have taken the lessons we’ve learned in Georgia to heart and passed a milestone criminal justice reform law that will apply those lessons throughout our federal criminal justice system. You can read a summary of this bill, which drew broad bipartisan support from faith leaders, law enforcement, governors, and attorneys general, by clicking here.

Hice on the Homefront
Last Tuesday, I enjoyed joining community leaders and officials from Greene, Hancock, Oglethorpe, and Oconee counties for a roundtable to discuss local infrastructure investment, rural broadband, and efforts to combat the opioid crisis. While there, I also highlighted the work being done by Congress and President Trump to reduce barriers to broadband services while ensuring faster and widespread access to high-speed internet for all Americans.

A big thank you to Becky Taylor, the Georgia Municipal Association Federal Relations Director, and Kathleen Bowen, the Association of County Commissioners of GA Associate Legislative Director, for hosting this important discussion. I look forward to seeing many of you next year!

Jeffries Historic Criminal Justice Reform Bill Signed Into Law
 
 
Last week, historic, bipartisan criminal justice reform legislation, S.756, was signed into law. The First Step Act of 2018 is based on the Formerly Incarcerated Reenter Society Transformed, Safely Transitioning Every Person Act (FIRST STEP) co-authored by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (NY-08) and Republican Congressman Doug Collins (GA-09), that overwhelmingly passed the House in May.
The legislation will propel formerly-incarcerated individuals toward success when they return home, while enacting targeted reforms that would improve public safety and reduce recidivism. It authorizes $375 million over five years to develop new programs, including education, vocational training and mental health counseling. Consequently, newly-released individuals will be positioned to successfully re-enter society.
With respect to sentencing reform, the FIRST STEP Act will increase public safety and engineer much-needed changes to draconian sentencing laws connected to the failed war on drugs. It modifies the three strikes law to make it more humane, increases judicial discretion to reduce sentences for low-level nonviolent drug offenders and provides retroactive relief for thousands unjustly sentenced during the crack-cocaine era.
The FIRST STEP Act passed the House of Representatives 358-36 and the Senate 87-12 this week.
Rep. Jeffries said: “The FIRST STEP Act is a victory for all Americans who believe in justice and the power of redemption. This bill will transform lives by providing access to the mental health counseling, education, job training and substance abuse treatment needed to help incarcerated individuals get back on their feet and become productive members of society. It also provides retroactive relief for the shameful crack cocaine sentencing disparity that unfairly destroyed lives, families and communities. The FIRST STEP Act is not the end. It’s not even the beginning of the end. It's simply the end of the beginning of a bipartisan journey to eradicate the mass incarceration epidemic in America.”
￼


Highlights of the bill include:
Address Crack Cocaine Sentencing Disparity: Before 2010, those convicted for crack cocaine-related issues received a sentence 100 times harsher than that of those convicted of cocaine-related offenses. The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 reduced that disparity to 18-1. FIRST STEP makes that change retroactive, thereby reducing the sentences of thousands of individuals serving unduly heavy sentences.
Curtails Juvenile Solitary Confinement:  No young person should be kept in solitary confinement, which can cause substantial psychological damage. This provision severely limits the use of juvenile solitary confinement.
Focus on Dignity for Women: Being pregnant while incarcerated can be a harrowing experience. There are far too few guarantees for the health and safety of both mother and baby. Egregiously, there is no federal ban on shackling pregnant and post-partum women. This bill implements such a ban starting from the moment that a woman is confirmed to be pregnant and extending three months beyond her pregnancy. In addition, the bill requires that BOP provide sanitary napkins and tampons to incarcerated women for free.
Requirement to Move People Closer to Home: The journey to visit loved ones in prison can be extremely burdensome and cost-prohibitive for families. However, contact with family reduces recidivism. That’s why the bill mandates that prisoners shall be placed within 500 driving miles of their families.
Reduce Mandatory Minimums: The bill reduces second strike mandatory minimums of 20 years to 15 years, and reduces the third strike mandatory minimum of life in prison to 25 years. It also solves the 924(c) “stacking” problem by prohibiting the application of recidivist mandatory minimum enhancements for repeat offenders who commit certain firearms offenses to conduct within the same indictment.
Good Time Credit Fix: A provision which will ensure that incarcerated individuals can earn the 54 days of good time credit per year that Congress intended, and not just the 47 days that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) currently allows. This retroactively applies to all prisoners who have earned credit for good behavior. It has been estimated by BOP and GAO that fixing this will lead to the release of roughly 4,000 prisoners and save $40 million in the first fiscal year.
Compassionate Release: The current prison population is aging, causing significant challenges. This bill expands the compassionate release program from the Second Chance Act. It expedites BOP consideration of petitions, providing family members the opportunity to visit terminally ill offenders and ensures assistance with submissions of petitions for compassionate release.
The Establishment of a Risk-Reduction System: This system, which is already used at the state level to best match inmates to programs fitting their needs, must be based on dynamic factors to best lower someone’s risk of recidivating over time. The bill mandates that the system must be statistically validated and must be evaluated to ensure that it does not result in unwanted racial disparities in order to address concerns about prisoners of color being disproportionately impacted.
Focused Resources on High and Medium Risk Prisoners: Evidence shows that this kind of programming has the greatest impact on those prisoners who are at the greatest risk of recidivating. To make the bill as effective as possible, it gives priority to high and medium risk inmates. People will be able to participate in such programming throughout their sentence.
Add Safety Valve: Low-level drug offenders who cooperate with the government should not have to face the certainty of decades in prison. Under the bill, judges will have more discretion to sentence below the mandatory minimum for qualified nonviolent offenders.
Requirement for Provisions of IDs: When transitioning back into society, many formerly incarcerated individuals find themselves without proper identification necessary to access essential services like housing, or to apply for employment. Assisting formerly incarcerated individuals with obtaining ID prior to release will reduce the collateral consequences of incarceration by allowing a quicker integration back into society, as well as create significant cost savings for BOP of approximately $19 million.
The FIRST STEP Act enjoys the support of more than 70 organizations, including the Equal Justice Initiative, National Urban League, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, Gathering for Justice/Justice League NYC, the Charles Koch Foundation, #cut50, Public Defender Association and the CAN-DO Foundation.

December 25, 2018

Dear Friend, 

￼

On this Christmas Day, we have much to be thankful for.  Throughout the history of our great nation, American patriots have fought to preserve the freedoms we hold dear.  

While our family celebrates the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we will remember the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who are watching over all of us.  They include members of the Mississippi Army National Guard 155th Armored Brigade Combat Team who deployed to Kuwait this summer.  The families of thousands of our service members will be without their loved ones in uniform during the holidays.  We are grateful for the commitment they willingly make to help keep our nation safe.

Our thoughts also turn to members of  law enforcement agencies and to all the first responders who will be on duty over the holidays. We remain thankful for their desire to serve.   

Sheila and I wish you and your family a very Merry Christmas.  May God continue to bless the United States of America.

What I Have Been Reading



Chairman Randy Isenhower on Fox Business News

Fox Business 

Recently, Randy Isenhower, the Chairman of the Catawba County Commissioners joined Fox Business to share what having Apple move to Catawba County meant for the local community. When Stuart Varney of Fox Business asked him what it took to get Apple to move to Catawba County, Randy told them what we all know already, it didn’t take much convincing because western North Carolina is a great place to live and work. 


Criminal justice bill passes House, heads to President Trump for his signature

USA Today 

Last week, the House sent the historic and bipartisan First Step Act to the President’s desk. This criminal justice reform bill will not only help make our criminal justice system more efficient and fair, but will also continue to ensure Americans are protected from violent criminals.

Dear Friend, 
During the holidays, we are reminded of all that we are thankful for, and as always I am thankful for the opportunity to represent the good people of Georgia's Eighth Congressional District in Congress. 
It has certainly been a very busy and productive year in Washington, as we have increased funding and investment into our military, provided meaningful reform to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), given our troops the largest pay raise in nearly a decade, delivered on our promises to our farms and rural America by passing a Farm Bill, and much more. 
This year I have also had the opportunity to meet with parents, educators and students, farmers, service members and veterans, and community leaders and local officials throughout Middle and South Georgia to hear concerns and ideas from folks in our communities on how we can make Washington work better for Georgians. 
In the coming year, if I or my staff can be of assistance to you, please do not hesitate to reach out. We have offices in Warner Robins, Tifton, and Washington, D.C. to help constituents with issues they may be having with federal agencies like the Social Security Administration, the VA, or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Just give us a call. You can find our office contact information below. You can also contact me or a member of my staff on my website by clicking here. 
As we celebrate the Christmas season, I want to extend from my family to yours a very Merry Christmas. 
￼ 
Merry Christmas from our family to yours. 
Additionally, please click here for a special message for our troops serving overseas during the holidays.

Merry Christmas! 
Merry Christmas! Today, Christians around the world are celebrating the birth of our Savior, Jesus Christ, who came into the world to give us the gift of eternal life. Every year I am thankful to spend time with family and loved ones, reflecting on all the blessings God has given each and every one of us. While Christmas is a special celebration of faith, I know this time of year can be difficult for many. It is important to remember those who are less fortunate than us and may not have the same blessings as we do. 
I also ask all of us to say a special prayer for our servicemembers who are overseas and unable to be home with their families during this season. Our nation’s heroes sacrifice so much to keep our country safe and free, including time with their loved ones. We owe it all to them that we are able to live in the greatest country in the world, and we cannot thank them enough for their service. 
I hope that whether you are celebrating Christmas or another religious holiday that your holidays are filled with love and fellowship.
If my office can ever be of assistance for you or your family during this season, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Merry Christmas to all!
""For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this."" Isaiah 9: 6,7.

Merry Christmas!
This is a season of hope and renewal – a reminder that even in the darkest days, the greatest hope can emerge.  As Christians, we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.
￼
This beautiful Constitution Christmas ornament was a gift from the Indy Defenders of Liberty. It makes a great addition to the Rokita family Christmas tree.
Celebrating Christmas has long been a part of American history and celebrated by generations of Americans.  In 1783, General George Washington resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army on December 23, so that he could be home in Mount Vernon by Christmas.  When Congress first established the first four federal holidays in 1870, Christmas was one of them.  For Hoosiers, since 1962 Monument Circle has been transformed into the ""world's largest Christmas tree.""  Christmas is a part of our fabric.
￼
My greatest blessing in life is my family - my wife Kathy and our two boys, Teddy and Ryan.
I believe strongly in the need to preserve the true purpose of Christmas as a holiday in America.  I have cosponsored legislation to protect the symbols of Christmas.  I do so because Christmas is a deep part of our Nation's culture and the traditions which are rooted in the Christian faith of our founding fathers.  Our Nation has always cherished our faith.  The Founding Fathers took Christmas seriously, as did successive generations of Americans, and so must we.
￼
Ryan was excited to meet Santa at the Indy Defenders of Liberty-West's annual Christmas party.
As you join with loved ones for Christmas, I hope you too will reflect on the season of giving and remember what Christmas is really about, the greatest gift that we could ever be given - the birth of our Savior in Christ.
And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.” (Luke 2:8-12)
From all of us in the Rokita Family, as our President says, Merry Christmas!


Sincerely,
￼

Dear Friend, 
In a world that too often is full of bad news, it is refreshing to remember angels delivered a message of “good news” a couple thousand years ago “that was for all people."" That news was of a birth of a baby—but not just any baby—a baby who was God in person who came to save the world. He would be known as Emmanuel (which means ""God with us""), Wonderful Counselor, Prince of Peace. He lives today to make a way for us to have a relationship with the Living God.  I’m so grateful for this Good News and hope you get to celebrate the birth of Jesus this day with friends and family and experience His love and presence throughout the year.   Merry Christmas!  
 
Yours in service,
￼

Merry Christmas
 

For a child is born to us, A son is given to us; And the government Is upon His shoulder; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. Isaiah 9:6

￼

Every Christmas Eve, I am reminded of a very special Christmas Eve many years ago where I was boarding the plane to head to Kuwait and serve in Persian Gulf War as a Marine. While spending the Christmas holiday away from my loved ones was not easy, I was honored to serve the country I love so much. I am thankful for the sacrifices of those who are currently overseas serving, and are away from their families this Christmas. It’s not just our service men and women who carry the burden, but also their loved ones who miss them dearly this holiday season.  Christmas is a time for giving and putting others before oneself. It's easy to get lost in the excitement of the holiday, but I encourage you to remember the one true reason for the season. As we celebrate the birth of our Lord and Savior, please join me in praying for our soldiers and their loved ones who are spending this Christmas apart.   Wishing peace, joy, and love to you and your family this Christmas!
In your service,
￼
Steven

The Heart of Christmas

 
     
￼



The holiday season is here, which means A Charlie Brown Christmas and other classic re-runs are back on TV. Sunday sermons, local columnists, and Hallmark movies all teach us about the “true meaning of Christmas.” No doubt you’re familiar with the lessons: valuing gratitude over greed and helping others. I agree with these sentiments, but I’d also like to share a story of giving that encapsulates a lot of what’s worth celebrating this Christmas.
From 2005 to 2006, I served as a combat surgeon in Iraq. We took care of injured American troops, as well as detainees and injured and ill civilians. One day, I was on the phone with my sister and she asked if I needed anything from back home. I said I was fine; the Army feeds me, clothes me, and gives me the tools I need to do my job. But I knew the Iraqi people had lived and suffered under a horrible regime for decades. So I told her about the Iraqis, especially the children, who had nothing.
My sister coordinated support back home, and soon individuals, churches, and local companies like Cincinnati Bell and ProScan Imaging were sending us toys, hygiene products, t-shirts, and school supplies. We were astounded by the outpouring of support. The chaplain on base helped me put together our outreach program, dubbed “Operation Goodwill Gifts.”
Operation Goodwill Gifts was one of the highlights of my time in Iraq. Roberto Clemente, the Baseball Hall of Famer, once said “if you have the chance to make life better for others, and you fail to do so, you’re wasting your time on earth.” Through all of our human weaknesses, I take comfort in knowing that the United States is the most philanthropic nation in the world. We do try to make life better for others, even those we don’t know and will never meet. We donate more of our time and money than any country in history.
There were a few joyful days in this war-torn area, when I’d hand a child a gift, as simple as a yo-yo or school supplies, and tell them:
“These are from the American people, not the government.”
The children and their parents would reply, hand over heart.
Shukran, shukran.
“Thank you, thank you.”
That Christmas I spent in Iraq was special. I missed my family in Ohio, but I was with my military family. Out of everything bad that comes with poverty and war, Operation Goodwill Gifts was a chance to do something good. That was special. And I hope it showed those Iraqi families that we cared, that our hearts and their hearts were not so different.

Dear Friends,  
Carolyn and I wish you and yours a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. This is a beautiful time of year as we celebrate the birth of Christ with family and friends. May we rejoice, count our blessings, and remember, “The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.”  John 1:14 
Please join me in saying a prayer for all those who cannot be home with their family this holiday season - especially the brave men and women of our military serving around the world and our first responders keeping us safe here at home. We are forever grateful for their selfless sacrifice. May God bless them today and every day. 
Sincerely,  
Ted

Wishing You a Happy Holiday Season
￼ 
Dear Friend, 
As the days get shorter and the temperatures get lower, it can only mean one thing: The holidays are here! 
No matter what you celebrate, I hope you're able to find some time this holiday season to cozy up with your family and loved ones, spread some holiday cheer, and trade gifts and blessings for the new year.  
And I hope you take a moment to think of your neighbors who may not be able to experience these same comforts. I thank the many Philadelphia and Montgomery County-area organizations that help these families, and hope you’ll think about how we all can do a bit more to lend a hand this holiday season.  
I wish you a safe and happy holiday and a wonderful year to come.

Conaway Chronicle: Merry Christmas!
__________________________________________

Christmas comes with so many blessings, but as we celebrate the birth of Christ this year, I invite you to remember the incredible gift that is God's love for all of us. 

I pray that God's love is especially with the men and women in the armed forces who protect our nation around the world. Many will be apart from their families this holiday season, as they put the safety of all of us before their own. 

Suzanne and I send our best wishes to you and your families for a very merry Christmas, and may God bless each and every one of you. 


As always, you can follow me on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.

Rounds Report: Merry Christmas and Happy New Year December 24, 2018 
This holiday season, Jean and I wish all South Dakotans a very merry Christmas and happy New Year. It’s a good time of the year to spend with family and friends, participating in traditions and making memories that will last a lifetime. It’s also a good time to reflect on our blessings, most importantly the birth of Jesus, the Christ Child. 
Many families across our state and throughout the country will be spending the holiday season without their loved ones who are stationed all over the globe serving in our armed forces. Without their service and sacrifice, we would not be able to celebrate the holidays freely and safely here at home. We thank everyone who wears the uniform of the United States and we pray for their safe return. We also thank their family and friends who support them while they are protecting our country.
South Dakota is the best place in the world because of our people. I’m thankful for the opportunity to work in the Senate on behalf of all South Dakotans. 
I wish you all a merry Christmas and a happy, prosperous New Year.

 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them,  ""Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.""  And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,  ""Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men”

Dear Friend,

All is calm, all is bright. Merry Christmas from me and my family to you and yours! 
I pray this season is joyful and restful and that you hold your loved ones close.
Who else feels like the Christmas season snuck up on us?

One of my family’s favorite Christmas traditions is breakfast on Christmas morning. 
We make pumpkin pancakes and sit around the table, enjoying the morning. 
I know - pumpkin? At Christmas? 
But what can I say. It's the little traditions of the season that bring the greatest joy.

￼


Blessing to YOU.

Sincerely,

BIPARTISAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM BECOMES LAW

HOUSE ADVANCES PUBLIC HEALTH BILLS TO THE PRESIDENT’S DESK  
Last week, both the House and Senate were busy pushing bipartisan bills through Congress that will surely work to make a difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans.

 Dear Friend,   Tomorrow, like many of you, I’m looking forward to enjoying Christmas with my family. Whether you celebrate or not, I hope that you and your loved ones have a chance to spend some time together over the next few days.   This holiday season, I’m especially grateful for the opportunity you’ve given me to serve our state in Congress and to fight for the issues important to working Rhode Islanders – good-paying jobs, lower health care costs, and honest government. This is a critical time in our country’s history, and I’m honored by the trust you’ve placed in me. I promise to never stop fighting for Rhode Island and for the people who make our state such a wonderful place to live.   I wish you and your loved ones a safe and happy holiday season!   ￼  David Cicilline Member of Congress

Come and Read It Report
Dear Texans, 
Merry Christmas and happy holidays to you and yours! With all the hustle and bustle during this time of year, it is often easy to forget what tomorrow is really all about - the birth of our Lord and savior, Jesus Christ. I hope this serves as a reminder to be kind to one another during the Christmas season and remember that there are many people who are unable to spend this time with loved ones. I encourage you take a moment and think about the brave men and women in uniform, and our first responders, who cannot be with their families. They are spending today and tomorrow protecting this great nation so that all of you can enjoy time at home. Please join me in thanking them for their service, and praying for their safety, wherever they may be around the globe. 
Securing our Borders 
Last week, the Democrats once again chose to put open borders and illegal immigrants over the safety of American citizens. I joined many of my conservative colleagues in the House and proudly voted in favor of $5.7 billion in additional funding to defend and secure our southern border. I encourage our Senate counterparts to follow our lead and do the same. We must do everything in our power to protect this nation, and we should not rest until it is properly done. I will continue to support President Trump and I will oppose any funding bill that does not fully fund his border request.  
High School Football State Champions 
Congratulations to the Grandview High School Zebras, who took home the Class 3A Division I State Championship last week! They defeated the Malakoff Tigers 35-21 and all of us in Texas-25 couldn't be more proud. Great job boys!
I have included some articles and releases you may find interesting located on the right side of this newsletter. It is an honor and privilege to represent the people of Texas’ 25th Congressional District and as always, please reach out to me with any issues and concerns that are important to you.

Senate Passes Walnut Grove Land Exchange Act, Goes to POTUS for Signature
December 20, 2018  Press Release
WASHINGTON – The Senate passed the Walnut Grove Land Exchange Act on Wednesday (December 19), officially sending the bill to President Donald J. Trump for his signature.
Congressman Bruce Westerman introduced H.R. 5923 on May 23 of this year. The bill facilitates an exchange of land between Walnut Grove Church in Jessieville and the U.S. Forest Service. The church and an adjacent cemetery currently sit on 4 acres of Forest Service land. This bill transfers the ownership of that land to the church, and in return, gives the Forest Service 6.3 acres of land adjacent to the Ouachita National Forest owned by the congregation.
“This is a good day for the people of Walnut Grove Church and the community of Jessieville,” Westerman said. “The church has been a longtime tenant of the Forest Service and has sought a resolution to this issue for more than 20 years. The fact that it takes an act of Congress to exchange such small parcels of land simply illustrates how broken the federal government is. I thank Senator Cotton for his co-sponsorship and I thank Senator Boozman for his tireless efforts to see this passed in the Senate before the end of 2018.”
“This is a great day for the Walnut Grove Church,” Sen. John Boozman (R-Arkansas) said. “The church has vigorously pursued an equitable land exchange between itself and the U.S. Forest Service that makes perfect sense given the location of the facility it worships in. With the passage of this bill, the president’s signature is all that is left to achieve this fair, reasonable outcome. I’m pleased to have led the effort in the Senate in support of Jessieville and this congregation.”
“Walnut Grove Church’s congregation shouldn’t have to deal with the federal government in order to simply worship and bury their loved ones,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) said. “I’m pleased that the Senate has approved this land exchange, ending a decades-old problem for the church and Jessieville community.”
Bill Introduced to Protect Communities from Catastrophic Wildfires
December 14, 2018  Press Release
WASHINGTON – Congressman Bruce Westerman introduced H.R. 7315, the Protecting American Communities from Wildfire Act, on Thursday (December 13).
“As more and more Americans move closer to our nation’s forests, it is imperative that Congress protect our communities from the devastation of wildfire,” Westerman said. “The lack of large-scale forest management -- combined with a patchwork of State, local, Tribal, and Federal landowners -- has resulted in dangerous, unhealthy forests, which in turn has led to the catastrophic, deadly fires we see today.
“Congress must act to protect American lives, property, and watersheds. The Forest Service must be provided the management tools to quickly shield these at-risk communities, and further, Congress must provide landowners the incentives and the resources to implement sound management.”
H.R. 7315 accomplishes both goals. This act provides the Forest Service with the management tools they need to rapidly treat the Federal Forests in the Wildland-Urban Interface and simultaneously provides additional grant funding to at-risk communities, supporting programs ranging from the purchase of new firefighting equipment, to the FIREWISE Program.
Expedited Forest Management in The Wildland- Urban Interface
	•	Provides USFS the authority to prescribe forest treatment plans within the Wildland-Urban interface, creating a halo of managed timber around an at-risk community.
	•	The Wildland-Urban Interface is a term defined on the local level: at-risk communities can tailor the amount of protective treatment needed for their town.
	•	Provides USFS the authority to prescribe forest treatment plans around the watersheds which supply at-risk communities, ensuring the steady supply of clean drinking water
	•	Categorically excludes the prescribed action from lengthy NEPA review, ensuring that this critical protection is rapidly implemented. 
Additional State Fire Assistance Funding
	•	Reauthorizes the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 at $100 million a year from 2019 to 2024, a $20 million increase from current funding levels.
	•	This investment will be distributed as block grant funding to states looking to implement protective forest management, with programs ranging from technical assistance to community preparation, like FIREWISE.
	•	This funding will incentivize State, local, and Tribal landowners to ensure that protective forest management is implemented at the landscape level.
	•	With restoration in the Wildland-Urban interface costing millions annually, investing in preventative measures now will save taxpayers money over the long run.
Farm Bill Passes; On Its Way to POTUS
December 12, 2018  Press Release
WASHINGTON – On Tuesday afternoon (December 12), the House of Representatives passed the Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 2, the Agriculture Improvement Act. The legislation, better known as the Farm Bill, will now go to President Donald J. Trump for his signature after passing in the Senate earlier this week.
Prior to final passage, Congressman Bruce Westerman (AR-04) spoke in favor of the legislation. His remarks, as delivered:
“I thank the gentleman for yielding.
“Mr. Speaker, I was blessed to be a walk-on football player for the University of Arkansas and participate on two 10-win conference championship teams. Coach Ken Hatfield’s triple option offense averaged over 300 yards per game but it came in small chunks that resulted in first downs, that resulted in touchdowns, and eventually led to victories.
“Mr. Speaker, farm incomes are down across the board, the West is consumed by wildfires, China and other nations are taking advantage of unfair trade laws. What rural America needs is a first down. Our farmers and ranchers need to see Congress move the ball forward and provide their families the protection and relief they need during these hard times. This Conference Report is not a hail Mary. It does not contain everything I would like to see in a Farm Bill but it does move the ball forward. It is progress that our farmers need right now.
“I’m disappointed that Senate Democrats blocked many needed forest management provisions as we continue to sift through the ashes of catastrophic wildfires. However, this Conference Report strengthens the farm safety net and provides certainty to our farmers. It does address some forest management issues. It provides millions of dollars in new funding to combat a range of issues facing rural America – from funding to eradicate feral hogs to (funds to) address the opioid crisis and to expand rural broadband. This conference report moves farm policy in the right direction. I urge the adoption of the rule for this Farm Bill and I yield back.”

Congresswoman Beatty Celebrates Holidays, Writes Cards to Servicemembers
U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) joined the Red Cross for its Holiday for Heroes program, an annual initiative that gives Members of Congress and all Americans the opportunity to write holiday cards to active duty servicemembers and veterans.
“Holidays for Heroes is all about bringing holiday cheer to the brave women and men who sacrifice so much to defend our nation,” Betty said. “Sometimes, a kind word is all it takes to make someone’s holiday. I always enjoy taking time to thank our servicemembers, and I can’t wait to do it again next year.”
Reflecting further on the spirit of the holidays, Beatty continued “The holiday season is all about giving thanks, spending quality time with loved ones, and remembering our fellow Americans who are in need. That’s why I challenge each of you to take time before the New Year to give back. You can make the holidays even more special.”

Dear Friends, 
First, a Merry Christmas to all who are celebrating tomorrow, and Happy Holidays to all who celebrated Hanukkah and Diwali earlier this month. I hope this holiday season will be a time that fosters joy, peace on earth, and goodwill to all. Let us also keep in our thoughts and prayers the men and women serving our nation around the world who will spend this time far from their homes, family and friends. We are grateful for their service at this season, and each and every day.
Regrettably, the federal government is currently in a shutdown after federal funding lapsed at midnight on Friday, December 21. I am disappointed that President Trump refuses to accept a bipartisan compromise that funds our government, and am working to resolve this situation. 
Our office remains open during a government shutdown. If you have issues involving a federal agency and need assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us via email or by calling (847) 383-4870. We have also answered many frequently asked questions about a shutdown on our website.  
We are a nation with incredible potential, being limited by our political dysfunction. I urge President Trump and my Republican colleagues to do their duty and end to this self-created crisis so we can come together and tackle the real challenges before us in the New Year. 
Sincerely, ￼  Bradley S. Schneider Member of Congress 
 P.S. A big thank you to Natalee Lizardo, a 5th grade student at North Elementary School in Waukegan who designed the cover of my holiday card this year. I think she did a great job!

Dear Neighbor,  As the bells ring, the angels sing and the rooms fill with laughter from loved ones, we know the Christmas cheer has arrived.
With the festivities of the holiday in full swing, it is a time to come together, enjoy each other’s company and be reminded of the freedoms, liberties and opportunities we have right here in our backyard.
This Christmas, we would like to extend a jolly hello to the men and women serving in our Armed Forces who put their life on the line every single day, our law enforcement officers and first responders who never fail to come to the aid of people across our community when they are in need.
We are also blessed to have our friends and neighbors in NY-23 who put their trust in me as I work to help the people back home and all across America.
From my family to yours, we wish you a very Merry Christmas and a prosperous New Year.
See you in 2019,

Dear Friend,

Amidst all of last week's news about the partial government ""shutdown"" and much more, you might have missed a very significant, bipartisan achievement that (briefly) united almost all of the legislative and executive branches. 

On Friday, December 21st, President Trump signed into law
the First Step Act, a monumental bill supported by both parties in Congress and dozens of organizations from across the political spectrum that will pave a new pathway for our criminal justice system, reforming decades of policies that have failed the American people.

This historic new law focuses on reducing rampant recidivism among federal prisoners, reforming select sentencing laws, and increasing community safety.

Reducing Recidivism and Increasing Public Safety: 
 
The bill creates a risk and needs assessment system that will ensure each prisoner's risk of re-offending is assessed. The First Step Act also:
	•	Provides evidence-based recidivism reduction programming for federal prisoners;
	•	Provides incentives to federal prisoners for participating in First Step programming, including the earning of time credits towards a pre-release custody at a halfway house or home confinement; and
	•	Excludes violent and high risk criminals, including fentanyl traffickers, from using time credits.
Reforming Select Sentencing Laws: 
 
Under the First Step Act, sentencing is made fairer through narrow reforms. Namely, the First Step Act:
	•	Clarifies that enhanced penalties for using a firearm during a crime of violence or drug crime should be reserved for repeat offenders of such crimes;
	•	Reduces the three-strike penalty for non-violent drug offenses from life imprisonment to 25 years;
	•	Broadens mandatory penalties for serious violent offenders;
	•	Expands the existing federal safety valve to include more low-level, non-violent offenders and maintains safeguards to prohibit violent criminals from potentially benefiting from reduced sentences; and
	•	Allows for the retroactive application of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 for drug offenders sentenced under the ""crack disparity"" who petition for a reconsideration of their sentence.
Reauthorizing the Second Chance Act of 2007: The First Step Act reauthorizes and streamlines eight Second Chance Act programs and repeals four that have not been funded by Congress.

By preparing inmates to successfully rejoin society and enacting commonsense sentencing reforms, the First Step Act will make our justice system fairer for all Americans.
 
See a list of 42 bipartisan groups who strongly support the new law here.
 
Read more about it here and here.
 
Sincerely,
 
 

PS: Merry Christmas to you and your family!
 
  

SPECIAL NOTE
 
During the ongoing lapse in appropriations for certain parts of the federal government (a.k.a. the partial government shutdown), please note that approximately 75% of the government has already been funded through September 2019. This includes Social Security, Medicare, and all VA benefits and hospitals, which are fully funded and will remain totally operational.

House Passes Kelly Legislation to Increase Retirement Savings for Americans

Year-end tax relief package includes text of three retirement reform bills authored by Rep. Kelly
 
 

WATCH HERE
 
Last Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Retirement, Savings, and Other Tax Relief Act of 2018 and the Taxpayer First Act of 2018 (also known as the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 88). The package includes major parts of legislation previously introduced by Rep. Kelly -- founder and co-chairman of the House Retirement Security Caucus and a member of the House Ways and Means Committee -- during the 115th Congress. These include the Family Savings Act of 2018 (H.R. 6757), the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act of 2018 (H.R. 5282), and the Rightsizing Pension Premiums Act of 2017 (H.R. 3596).

General Summary of Provisions:
	•	Helps businesses provide retirement plans to their workers and helps families to start saving earlier and more throughout their lives. Includes provision expanding use of 529 accounts
	•	Modernizes the IRS and makes taxpayer service the focus of the agency by improving the ease and efficiency of the taxpayer experience when filing taxes, retrieving information, resolving issues, and making payments.
	•	Delay of Obamacare taxes:
	•	5-year delay of the Medical Device Tax
	•	2-year delay of the Health Insurance Tax
	•	1-year delay of the excise tax on high cost health plans (a.k.a. ""the Cadillac Tax"")
	•	Repeal of the Tanning Tax
	•	Repeal of the Church Parking Tax
	•	Provision to allow tax-exempt charitable and educational organizations to make collegiate housing and infrastructure grants to specified tax-exempt social clubs, such as fraternities and sororities, in order to fund college and university housing.
	•	The Free Speech Fairness Act (repeal of the Johnson Amendment)
	•	Tax provisions related to disaster relief: Provides special rules allowing access to retirement funds, temporary suspension of limits on deductions for charitable contributions, allowance of deductions for personal casualty disaster losses, special rules for measurement of earned income for purposes of qualification for tax credits, and a special credit for employees to individuals and businesses affected by Hurricanes Florence and Michael, Typhoons Mangkhut and Yutu, California fires, Kilauea volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, and severe storms in Alabama, Hawaii, Indiana, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Texas.

Rep. Kelly Celebrates Policy Victories for Rural America   
  
U.S. Agriculture Department announces new program to build broadband infrastructure in rural communities

House & Senate pass bipartisan Farm Bill, send to White House
   
Rep. Kelly issued the following statement earlier this month regarding the federal advancement of two major priorities for the nation's rural areas: 1.) the passage and enactment of the final version of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (H.R. 2, also known as the ""Farm Bill""), and 2.) the Office of Rural Development at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s decision to launch the ReConnect Program to expand e-connectivity to rural communities in need.

Statement by Rep. Kelly:
 
""Rural families in Western Pennsylvania and across our country received a tractor-load of good news from Washington this week. By an overwhelming bipartisan margin, Congress passed a powerful farm bill that will protect our natural resources, develop new trade opportunities, level the playing field for producers, and help millions of Americans access the nutritious foods they need to keep their families healthy. We'll accomplish these goals while also rolling back regulations, streamlining services, eliminating unnecessary programs, and increasing efficiency in the programs that work best and serve the most. I'm also excited by the USDA's brand-new pilot program to bring high-speed internet to these same hardworking American households. These are not red or blue issues-they're red, white, and blue issues.""

Kelly hosted a joint press conference at the Butler County Government Center to formally announce the awarding of $20,000,000 to Butler County from the BUILD (Better Utilization Investments to Leverage Development) Transportation Discretionary Grant Program for Gateway 228 capacity and safety improvements-Butler's County's most critical transportation initiative-as confirmed the day prior by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
 
WPXI-TV News:
 
Officials are celebrating a huge federal grant that will benefit Butler County's ""most critical transportation initiative"" - the Route 228 corridor.
 
On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Transportation awarded a $20 million grant to make capacity and safety improvements on the ""Gateway 228""project focused on upgrading the state road that runs from Ambridge in Beaver County to Buffalo Township in southwestern Butler County.
 
The Butler Eagle:
 
It was a triumphant gathering of partners Thursday afternoon, as the county commissioners announced that they received the large federal transportation infrastructure grant they applied for in July.
 
The commissioners, who produced the Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) grant application in collaboration with a number of other entities, requested $24.3 million to realign and expand Route 228 in Middlesex Township between Route 8 and Quality Gardens.
 
...
 
The mood at the county government center was jubilant Thursday as U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, R-3rd, joined the three commissioners; Mark Gordon, county director of economic development; Dick Hadley, Cranberry Township supervisor; and representatives from the SPC, PennDOT, and state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe's office, and others clapped one another on the back in light of their achievement.
 
A beaming Kelly extolled the collaboration of the entities involved in the grant application and the dogged determination of the commissioners in seeing the project through.
 
""This is an example of the way we are supposed to function,"" Kelly said. ""Local, state and federal people coming together for something that just makes sense.""
 
Kelly said Route 228 has a crash rate three times the state average, at 232 crashes and one fatality between 2013 and 2017.
 
He said 6,000 students from eight schools are transported on the highway each school day.
 
""We put our most precious commodity on a road that will be safer now,"" Kelly said.
 
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette:
 
After working for nearly 30 years, Butler County officials celebrated Thursday when they received news that the county has been approved for a $20 million federal grant for the last pieces of the Gateway 228 road improvement project.
 
The federal Department of Transportation announced the first round of grants under the Trump administration's Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development program. The program is designed to help fund transportation projects that have an economic importance in rural areas.

""This is the way we are supposed to function- local, state and federal people coming together for something that just makes sense,"" U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly said during a news conference Thursday.
 
According to Kelly, Route 228 has a crash rate three times the state average, and 6,000 students from eight schools are transported on the highway each school day.
 
 
  

Rep. Kelly Secures Sand Replenishment for Presque Isle
  
In response to personal appeal by Rep. Kelly, President Trump promised federal support for beach nourishment at rally in Erie in October
    
On November 28th, Rep. Kelly issued the following statement in response to news that the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers has allotted $1.5 million in federal funding for sand replenishment for Presque Isle State Park in Erie, Pennsylvania.

Statement by Rep. Kelly:
 
""Christmas has surely come early for Erie and for our entire region. Last month, President Trump made a public commitment to me and to our district that Presque Isle's beaches would get fully replenished-and now that promise has been kept! Earlier than usual, federal action has been confirmed and sand replenishment for Presque Isle will officially begin next May, ahead of the busy summer tourist season. I couldn't be prouder to see this natural and economic treasure be maintained for the countless families who enjoy it.""
 
Watch President Trump's live pledge to answer Rep. Kelly's call to replenish Presque Isle while speaking at the Erie Insurance Arena.

Kansas Common Sense  December 23, 2018
Hello,
 
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
Wishing You a Happy Holidays Happy holidays to you and yours! Robba and I hope that are able to spend quality time with loved ones during this joyous season. May God bless you and your families in the New Year – we look forward to what 2019 has in store! 
As we gather with loved ones to celebrate this season, we are also thinking of the many men and women in uniform at home and abroad who are unable to be with friends and family as they fight to protect our homeland. Missing the holidays represents one of the many sacrifices our servicemembers make, and I am grateful for their dedicated service to their fellow Americans.  
An Update on the Partial Government Shutdown I am actively working with my colleagues and the president to reopen the government and secure our borders, and I believe my colleagues can and should come to a bipartisan consensus on this national security issue, while keeping the government fully operational. To view more information on what this means for Kansans, federal agencies and federal employees, click here.   
Thanking Secretary Mattis I have great respect for Secretary Mattis and his nearly 46 years of service to our nation. Over the course of his honorable career, he has undeniably been one of the most influential leaders of our Armed Forces, demonstrating a character and resolve that our enemies should fear and our allies can trust. 
The men and women who serve our nation deserve stability during this time of transition and uncertainty as we face growing global threats.  
Encouraging Further Deliberation on Troop Withdrawal from Syria  I join my Senate colleagues in calling on President Trump to reconsider his decision of a full withdrawal from Syria at this time. Substantive deliberation regarding a withdrawal strategy in Syria is needed, and ought to involve consultation with our nation’s top national security leaders and military officers overseeing operations in Syria, as well as with our anti-ISIS coalition partners.
Americans Should See Mueller Investigation Report  Since the special counsel investigation began, I’ve been a proponent of allowing Robert Mueller to complete his work. I recently reiterated this point when former AG Jeff Sessions announced his departure from the Trump administration. 
Regardless of who the Attorney General is, the findings of the investigation and relevant materials should be released to Congress and the American people. The disclosure of information will help restore Americans' trust in our institutions of government during a divided time in our nation. 
Voting Against Stop-Gap Government Spending   The American people are tired of stop-gap funding measures and partisan politics. Rather than immediately resorting to another CR, we ought to work together to get back to the basics of governing. 
The president repeatedly indicated his interest and flexibility in striking a funding deal for FY2019. Democrat leaders’ refusal to compromise is extremely frustrating, and after speaking with numerous colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I remain convinced that we could have reached a long-term agreement that would have also better secured our borders. 
We ought not be in a position where we’re relying on last year’s appropriations bills to fund this year’s government. I’m disappointed that after Congress successfully passed appropriations bills to fund 75 percent of the federal government through 2019, we couldn’t come to an agreement for the remaining appropriations bills – including my bipartisan CJS bill, which funds vital agencies like the Department of Justice and NASA. Punting on spending decisions now will only make funding the government in February more difficult. 
Therefore, I did not support the short-term and short-sighted CR. Click here to watch my floor remarks following the Senate’s vote. 
￼
Passing Historic Criminal Justice Reform The First Step Act is a remarkable bipartisan achievement. Supported by the president, a supermajority of the United States Senate, and law enforcement and advocacy groups from across the political spectrum, this legislation will allow non-violent offenders to serve time that fits their crime and then, importantly, provide them the opportunity to re-emerge as productive members of society. This legislation is an important first step in promoting a fair and effective criminal justice system, and as an original cosponsor of this bill and chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees funding for our state and federal law enforcement agencies, I will work to make certain law enforcement has the tools it needs to remain tough on crime and provide former prisoners a second chance at life. 
Included in the First Step Act is reauthorization of the Second Chance Act, which includes grant programs for drug rehabilitation, vocational training, mentoring, and other reentry and recidivism reduction initiatives. My Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee overwhelmingly voted to fund the Second Chance Act’s grant programs at $90 million for FY2019. 
This comprehensive package aims to reduce crime by helping low-risk inmates prepare to successfully rejoin society through participation in proven recidivism reduction and professional development programs. But it is important to ensure that some crimes don’t go unpunished, and this legislation preserves the maximum potential sentences for violent and career criminals. I appreciate the hard work of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on this legislation, and I look forward to it becoming law. Click here to read more on this legislation. 
USDA Issues Second Round of Tariff Payments to Farmers
Last week, the president announced the authorization of the second round of tariff mitigation payments from USDA. This announcement is welcome news for Kansas farmers and ranchers as they continue to struggle with low prices. These payments will provide short-term relief to producers harmed most by the tariffs; however, no disaster package will be enough to cover the long-term costs of lost export markets. 
I was encouraged by China’s recent decision to purchase more U.S. soybeans. As discussions continue between the U.S. and China to resolve our trade dispute, I look forward to more positive developments regarding trade agreements as Kansas farmers and ranchers continue to feel the effects of this tit-for-tat tariff battle. I will also continue to focus on maintaining strong trade relationships with other trading partners, including Kansas’ largest export markets, Canada and Mexico.
Raising Concern on OPTN’s Liver Transplantation Allocation Policy Changes I spoke on the Senate floor this week regarding the process followed by the Organ Procurement Transplant Network (OPTN) to create a new liver allocation policy for the United States. I delivered this floor speech on the heels of probing Health and Human Services Secretary Azar with Senator Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) over recent changes to the national liver distribution policy made by the OPTN. Under the new policy, Midwestern and Southern transplant hospitals, including hospitals located in the Kansas City and the St. Louis areas, could see patients from Kansas and Missouri waiting longer for a liver match. This decision would radically alter how donated livers are distributed across the United States, to the detriment of Kansas patients and transplant hospitals. 
This decision is the result of a deeply flawed process in which expert, surgeon, and patient input was openly ignored by the boards responsible for crafting how organs are distributed across the country. OPTN’s recent decision would limit Kansans’ ability to access donated organs for transplant, and hinder the Midwest Transplant Network, Kansas’ lone organ procurement organization, from ensuring there are organs available for those that need them. The Midwest Transplant Network is a national leader in procuring organs for later donation – a testament to Kansans willingness to help one another. 
I remain committed to finding answers to why this policy was rushed forward so recklessly and finding a better solution that puts patients and providers first in these life-or-death scenarios. I will continue to work to protect our hospitals, doctors, and patients from this policy that disregarded all input from those in the transplant community. Watch my floor speech here and read more about this issue here. 
Ensuring the Proper Implementation of the VA MISSION Act  On Wednesday, I questioned Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Robert Wilkie, during a joint hearing of the House and Senate Veterans Affairs Committees on the Implementation of the VA MISSION Act. I led several key provisions included in the VA MISSION Act that were meant to safeguard the intent of Congress to transform the VA into an integrated healthcare system for the 21st century, and to prevent the VA from limiting access to healthcare as we have seen in the past under the Veterans Choice Program.   During the hearing, I reminder the Secretary that the VA MISSION Act requires the VA to consult with Congress to make certain that we have a voice on behalf of our veterans in the regulations that will dictate the new community care program before they are determined and published by the VA. I requested additional detail be provided to Congress as the VA formulates community care regulations so that we may encourage, comment and suggest alterations prior to decisions being made.  I also received the Secretary’s commitment to work with me as the VA crafts a definition for “episode of care” for veterans under the new community care program, which is so important to reducing the burdensome process veterans face having to return to the VA each time they need another appointment or service to treat or resolve the same condition. 
Another key provision that I made certain was in the VA MISSION Act was requiring the VA to establish access standards for veterans to receive care in the community and I received the Secretary’s assurance that these standards will be applied to where a veteran resides and in relation to the closest VA facility that offers the care the veteran requires. I was encouraged to hear the Secretary commit to fixing the VA’s broad interpretation of where care is available within the VA. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to make certain that the VA implements the VA MISSION Act in the best interest of veterans as Congress intended. Click here to watch my questioning. 
Honoring Lynn Jenkins and Kevin Yoder on the Senate Floor I spoke on the Senate floor to honor and recognize two of my Kansas colleagues, Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins and Congressman Kevin Yoder. 
The senior U.S. Representative from Kansas, Lynn has gracefully and honorably served Kansans for two decades in both our state and federal government. Her career began in Kansas, as a CPA with a deep desire for financial and tax reform. As a member of Congress, she fulfilled those desires as a high-ranking Republican in House leadership and on the Ways and Means Committee, where she was instrumental in overhauling our tax code – a feat that was completed for the first time in 30 years. 
A fellow small town kid, Lynn grew up on a dairy farm and knows the value of hard work and in rolling up your sleeves to get things done. Kansans will remember her for the incredible progress she made on tax reform and on Mental Health First Aid, but more importantly, on her compassion for others and her dedication to our state. Thank you, Lynn, for your years of service, for being a friend and for not being afraid to tell me like you see it. To view my floor remarks, click here. 
Congressman Kevin Yoder leaves the U.S. House of Representatives having served Kansans and residents of the Third District honorably and energetically. I first met Kevin when he interned in our office when I was a member of the House of Representatives. I remember his tenacious spirit and passion for serving Kansans, which he continued to feel long after he left my office, later serving as the student body president at the University of Kansas and as a member of the Kansas Legislature. 
In the United States House of Representatives, Kevin serves on the Appropriations Committee and as a steward of Kansas taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars. Through this committee, Kevin has worked to make medical and cancer research a top priority, fought for Head Start and early childhood programs, and has worked to protect and incentive high-skilled immigration to our country. Thank you, Kevin, for your years of service. I hope you’re able to spend some well-deserved time with Brooke and your girls. To watch my complete floor remarks, click here. 
Passing the Forever GI Bill Housing Payment Fulfillment Act Earlier this week, the Senate unanimously approved the Forever GI Bill Housing Payment Fulfillment Act, legislation I cosponsored, to make certain the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) reimburses veterans for missed or underpaid Forever GI Bill housing benefits. 
It is imperative that the VA make every effort to restore confidence with veterans by delivering the care and benefits they have earned. I am pleased the U.S. Senate sent a clear message that the VA must earn back GI Bill beneficiaries’ trust, and I’m proud to help lead efforts that will make the VA worthy of the service and sacrifice of our nation’s heroes. The unanimous passage of this legislation moves us one step closer toward that goal. 
This legislation will address the VA’s failure to fully comply with reimbursement rates set by the Forever GI Bill. The improper payments resulted from IT systems that had not been properly updated and lack of internal processes to get the VA the necessary information about payment rates. Read more information here. 
Applauding the Inclusion of the FARMERS FIRST Act in the 2018 Farm Bill On Friday, the President signed the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, the Farm Bill, that included legislation I championed, the Facilitating Accessible Resources for Mental Health and Encouraging Rural Solutions For Immediate Response to Stressful Times (FARMERS FIRST) Act, to provide our nation’s agricultural community with critical mental health support and resources. 
Farmers and ranchers are facing a net farm income that has been cut in half over the last five years, continued low commodity prices, uncertain market access and unfavorable weather. The inclusion of this legislation in the Farm Bill will provide the ag community with necessary mental health programs, such as a crisis help line and suicide prevention training for farm advocates during these tumultuous times for our producers. I will continue working with my colleagues to make certain this legislation is implemented in a way that will best serve our farmers and ranchers who need help during trying times. 
This inclusion in the Farm Bill will result in a host of new programs and resources for the agricultural community and rural Kansans. For more on the FARMERS First Act, click here. 
Honored to Serve You in Washington It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

12/23/18 21:34,Gosar Review: Schumer shutdown ,"Click here to view this email in your browser 
￼
￼
  
Our country can't afford for Republican leadership to roll over to open border Democrats. We must send a bill to President Trump’s desk that finally secures our border with a wall and by ending “catch and release” and chain migration policies that encourage illegal immigration.  
This week, I’m proud to have stood with my conservative colleagues and voted on a spending bill that included funding for a wall. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats would rather shutdown the government over Christmas than vote to secure our border. I will continue to stand strong and hold the line to ensure that Congress delivers on its promise to the American people.
If you would like to stay updated on the current shutdown situation please follow me on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Stop the Flood of Opioids
More than 49,000 Americans died last year from heroin and opioid related overdoses. If open-borders liberal Democrats or weak-kneed establishment Republicans stop us from fixing the problem by closing the loopholes and building the wall, they will be accomplices to the next 49,000 deaths. Check out my latest op-ed in Breitbart that takes a look at the link between America's opioid crisis and our porous borders.

Two Gosar Forest Management Policies Signed Into Law
Following one of the most devastating wildfire seasons in our nation’s history, it is critical that we do everything in our power to provide the Forest Service and public land management agencies with the tools they need to reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfires and protect our communities. Years of mismanagement has left our forests vulnerable to insects and disease and ripe for catastrophic wildfires. While the Forest Service still needs more authorities from Congress, including things like Balance of Harms and Action/No Action policies, I am pleased that we were able to add two more tools to President Trump and his Administration's toolbox this week.

Flashback!
It use to be common sense to defend our borders and combat illegal immigration. It is my hope the Senate Democrats stop playing politics and put the safety of the American people first.

12/23/18 19:25,My December Newsletter,"￼ 
  

Hello Neighbors,  I hope you’ve stayed warm these first few weeks of winter and enjoyed your Thanksgiving with your loved ones this holiday season. As we reflect on all that we have accomplished this year and begin to make goals for the next, I would also like to take this opportunity to update you on my recent activities in Congress, in our community, and my efforts to expand recognition of the fundamental dignity of work.  I have continued to work to modernize and promote career and technical education as a path to not only a family-sustaining career, but also a middle-class life. Currently, there are more than 7.1 million unfilled jobs in the United States because employers simply cannot find workers with the relevant skills to fill them. As you may be aware, my legislation to modernize and reform skills education programs, The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, was signed into law in July and since then I’ve worked tirelessly with Illinois educational institutions and students to help them take advantage of this new law. In November, I visited Wilbur Wright College’s career, technical, and vocational education facilities, and we met with students who will benefit from the programs and courses my legislation funds and strengthens. 

￼
Congressman Krishnamoorthi meets with students who are currently participating in career, technical, and vocational education programs at Wilbur Wright college 
In response to the tragic shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh and other hate-motivated acts of violence in recent months, I hosted a unity breakfast in November with religious leaders from the Jewish, Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Jain, and Sikh communities, as well as local elected officials, business leaders, representatives from law enforcement, and members of the African-American, Latino, Asian-American, and LGBTQ communities. I was inspired to see such a diverse group of leaders from our area come together, unified by our shared values and determination to rid our country of hate, discrimination, bigotry, and prejudice.
 
￼
Faith and community leaders meeting with Congressman Krishnamoorthi at his unity breakfast
Late in the summer, I was proud to join with Congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis to speak out on the need to ensure that every American’s right to vote is protected and fairly counted through passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act. In his more than half a century of service, Congressman Lewis faced down Ku Klux Klan members, firehoses, and angry mobs as he courageously advocated for fundamental human rights to all Americans. It’s inspiring to see Congressman Lewis continue his long walk for justice, having played a pivotal role in so many of the movement’s successes while bearing the scars of its struggles. I’m honored to serve alongside Congressman Lewis, and I’m grateful he joined me to speak out for voting rights here in Illinois.
￼
Congressmen Lewis and Krishnamoorthi greeting audience members after their press conference on the Voting Rights Advancement Act
Earlier this year, the President signed into law my legislation to rename the Post Office in Bloomingdale the “Bloomingdale Veterans Memorial Post Office Building.” I was grateful to be able to address local veterans and community leaders at the November renaming ceremony. Through both large and small measures, we must ensure that veterans are getting the recognition and support they deserve. 
￼

Lastly, I want to mention legislation I’ve introduced to address a problem that many of us face: receiving phone calls from spam and “spoof” dialers who take on familiar numbers and pose as government billing agencies or other authorities to scam people. This issue initially came to my attention based on my own experiences receiving harassing, computer-generated calls. To address this problem, I introduced the Stop Harassing Calls Act. This bill would require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to develop an ambitious plan to study illegal robocalls and in turn make recommendations to phone carriers on what they can do to better protect their customers. Some carriers are already developing and implementing these initiatives, and it’s important that these best practices and policies become commonplace. The problem with spoofed calls isn’t just the enormous annoyance they impose on families, it’s also the risk they pose to every American’s health and financial safety. 

As always, thank you to everyone who has contacted my office to share your concerns or ask for assistance. Please continue to reach out to my staff and me with your questions, thoughts, and concerns.

Warm Regards,
￼

News from Representative Bradley Byrne

ABOUT BRADLEY | HOW CAN I HELP | CONTACT BRADLEY | WANT TO RECEIVE MY UPDATES?
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
This past week in Washington was quite eventful.  
But before we get to the events of the past week, I think it is important to pause and remember the reason we celebrate Christmas this week. 
￼
I was recently asked what my favorite Christmas tradition is and found that a surprisingly hard question to answer. 
It seems that nearly every moment is a tradition with my family, and that makes it hard to pick just one. 
From making gumbo Christmas Eve morning to wrapping presents to gathering on Christmas Day, there are so many individual moments that add up to make the season special.
My favorite Christmas tradition is without a doubt going to church as a family on Christmas Eve and worshipping Jesus on his birth. 
From the light of the first candle, all those in attendance on Christmas Eve light their own candles. No one person’s candle could light the church, but together, we all fill the church with the soft amber glow.
In the same way, the good news of the birth of Christ cannot be proclaimed by one person alone. His light must be carried by millions, proclaiming His word and salvation. 
Those living in the darkness of fear, illness, poverty, or other challenges this year, I hope you take comfort this Christmas season in the words written in John 1:5, “the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.”
As you celebrate your favorite Christmas traditions this year, I hope you take a moment to give thanks for your blessings and remember the birth of our Savior. 
From my family to yours, we wish you a very Merry Christmas! 
Fund the Wall 
I’m stunned to see the length to which some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will go simply to oppose enhanced border security, including a border wall. In fact, Democrats have now shut down a portion of the federal government instead of supporting President Trump’s urgent request for $5 billion to fund the border wall.
On Thursday, the House passed a bill to keep the government open while providing $5 billion for a border wall and additional funding to respond to the natural disasters earlier this year. Sadly, the bill has not been passed in the Senate due to the obstruction of Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats.
￼ 
I went to the House floor last week to deliver a passionate speech about the need to build the wall. You can click here of the image above to watch my speech. 
What is especially strange is that many of my colleagues on the other side have supported a wall in the past. Some of have even voted in support of a border wall. 
What has changed? 
I think the answer is very simple. I think some of my colleagues are so committed to appeasing the so-called ""resistance"" that they find themselves opposing a very basic and commonsense idea like border security just because they want to earn points from the most extreme part of their political base.
This is really not a complicated issue. This is about the safety and security of the American people. This is about keeping terrorists out of our country. This is about keeping illegal drugs out of our country. This is about keeping criminals out of our country. This shouldn’t be hard.
I urge my colleagues to stop playing to the ""resistance."" Come back toward a commonsense idea like securing our border, and let's get the government back open. 
In the meantime, I believe we must stand firm in our efforts to get President Trump's border wall. The safety and security of the American people is worth the fight. This is a fight worth fighting, and I hope we hold the line against Democrats and their open border policies.
Dauphin Island Funding 
￼ 
On Tuesday, I had the pleasure of announcing and celebrating the news that the Army Corps of Engineers is dedicating $4 million to place dredge material in the expanded Sand Island Beneficial Use Area (SIBUA). The Army Corps also obtained environmental clearances to expand the SIBUA.  
This has been an ongoing priority for our office for some time now, so I appreciate the help of Senator Richard Shelby in securing this funding. I am committed to working with the Army Corps, Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier, and local leaders to ensure Dauphin Island is protected in the years ahead.
Our Thriving Shipyards! 
￼ 
Last week we got some outstanding news for Austal USA here in Mobile. 
The U.S. Navy has ordered 2 more Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) from Austal for Fiscal Year 2019. 
By again giving Austal 2 of the 3 contracts for new LCS, it shows that our shipyard continues to meet the needs and demands of the U.S. Navy. Great work by the entire team at Austal!  
Farm Bill Signed Into Law 
This past week, President Trump signed the 2018 Farm Bill into law. This is huge news and a positive development for Alabama's farmers, foresters, and rural communities! 
The Farm Bill will allow for improved crop protections and loan options for farmers, incentivize rural development, support animal disease prevention and management, and will continue our nation’s commitment to agriculture and farmers. 
I am especially pleased to see the substantial resources provided to improve rural broadband access to communities. Providing Internet access to people in rural Alabama is absolutely critical to economic development and the success of these communities in the 21st Century. 
Thanks to President Trump for signing the 2018 Farm Bill into law!

This week marked the last week with my Defense Fellow, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Malik Harris. Thank you for being an invaluable part of my Congressional team over the last year. We wish Malik fair winds and following seas as he moves on to Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. 
What's Ahead  
At this point, we do not expect any votes in the House or Senate until December 27th. Negotiations over government funding will continue in the days ahead, but it seems neither side is close to an agreement. I believe we must continue holding strong and insisting on funding for border security, so I cannot say for sure when the next votes will take place in the House. 
In the meantime, I hope you and yours have a very blessed Christmas. I hope everyone can spend time with their family and loved ones, and I hope we will all take the time to reflect on the reason for the season and the many blessings in our lives. 
I also you to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to get up-to-the-minute updates from Washington. At the end of the day, my staff and I are here to serve you! 
Stay in touch, 
￼

The Health Implications of an Unsecure Border


Our government was founded for one purpose: to fulfill the charges set forth in the Constitution, “. . .establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty.” 

Lawmakers take an oath to the Constitution. We fail in our sworn duty if we refuse to ensure the sovereignty, security, and well-being of this nation through secure borders.
 
     
￼



What is coming through our borders is just as important as who is coming through our borders. This goes for good things like new phones, clothes, and wine, as much as it goes for bad things like illicit drugs, weapons, and diseases.
I had an interesting experience on a recent trip to Australia with the House Intelligence Committee. When I landed in Perth, customs and immigration officials asked me many questions. Had I been in contact with any cattle over the past month? Was I up to date on my vaccinations? Had I been in a lake in the last six weeks? When I answered yes to the lake question, they put me in a separate quarantine line for processing.   
I didn’t begrudge the Australians their many questions and concerns. I was visiting their country. They did not know what I was bringing with me or what I may have been recently exposed to, and it was their job to find out. Australia is an island, geographically isolated, and at ripe risk for a health catastrophe. An epidemic could wreak havoc on their population or ecosystem.
We live in a globalized age. Humans travel and trade more than ever before and new animal handling, agricultural, and land use practices are developed every year. While these are positives by many measures, the same factors contribute to fast-moving and border-jumping epidemics.
In truth, we had a close call with the gruesome 2014 Ebola epidemic. West African countries weren’t so lucky. The World Health Organization believes the reported 11,310 deaths understates the scope of how deadly and widespread the outbreak was. The Center for Disease Control (CDC), the U.S. Government’s national health protection agency, cited porous borders, highly mobile populations, and poor health infrastructure as leading factors in Ebola’s uncontrollable spread. Among the main reasons why Ebola was eventually contained was the CDC’s partnership with immigration authorities across West Africa and the United States. Identification procedures isolated Ebola-exposed travelers before they could spread the disease to further populations. When travelers entered a country through specified ports of entry, this protection regime was centralized and effective. When migrants slipped across rivers between Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone without going through the proper authorities, the disease flourished.
Proactive border security in the U.S. also allowed us to dedicate our resources toward developing vaccines and deploying doctors, nurses, and expertise to the front line of the Ebola epidemic, rather than focusing on outbreaks at home. Our nation ultimately played a critical role in containing the epidemic.
Border security does more than protect just our citizens, it protects our agricultural and economic interests. Minnesota is one of the largest pork-producing states in the U.S. The Star Tribune, the largest newspaper in the state, recently ran an article warning of the danger our farmers face from the rapidly spreading African swine fever. The virus spread from China into Western Europe in a matter of months, and exposure in the United States could decimate a $23 billion domestic industry. Questions at an airport, official border checkpoint, or seaport as simple as “have you been in contact with livestock in the past month?” can prevent these nightmare scenarios for our farmers and economy. These questions cannot be asked of migrant farm workers illegally entering our country. They can be asked of those entering our country legally.
For those who downplay the dangers posed by an epidemic, history offers a cautionary tale. World War I killed a combined 16 million combatants and civilians. The same year the war ended, the Spanish flu killed an estimated 50-100 million people. Microbes kill as easily as guns or bombs, and we cannot assume that circumstances will always favor us.
Protecting our citizens and our land is not xenophobic, but ensures the health and safety of all Americans. A well-secured border helps us welcome legal immigrants, turn away those who wish us harm, and protect against epidemics. 
This is the final installment of a four part series on border security. 
Part 1:A secure border is part of the fight against the opioid crisis 
Part 2: Immigration Reform is Not Possible Without A Secure Border 
Part 3: Border Security Is National Security

Dear Friends,

This week, important bills that benefit Arkansans were signed into law. I spoke out against the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, wished our veterans a Merry Christmas, delivered Christmas packages, and much more. Thank you for taking the time to follow my work in central Arkansas and Washington. Here are the highlights from this week.

Two Big Wins for Arkansans
￼
The five-year farm bill was signed into law by the president this week. Agriculture is Arkansas’s number one economic industry, and I am pleased that that this bill helps bring much needed security and support to hardworking Arkansas farm families.

￼
I am pleased the president, on Friday, signed the criminal justice reform package, the FIRST STEP Act. Since I came to Congress in 2015, I have actively worked with groups like Arkansas Baptist College, Restore Hope, Goodwill, Shorter College, the Exodus Project, and many more on ways we can better tackle crime, help lower recidivism rates, assist incarcerated Arkansans successfully shift back to society, while promoting individual opportunity. 

Through my Community Empowerment Initiative (CEI), I have brought together over 100 community members and have conducted more than 25 site visits throughout central Arkansas and around the country. This bill is a first but crucial step for criminal justice reform, which is an issue that affects everyone and transcends party lines. 

""A Sad Case of Political Expediency""
￼
The president's decision to withdraw from Syria is, in the words of the late Senator John McCain, ""a sad case of political expediency supplanting military necessity,"" and I object. We must ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS; a withdrawal from Syria now opens the door for Iran to consolidate gains in Syria. 

Should the president also withdraw from our NATO mission in Afghanistan, I am especially concerned for civilians like a remarkable Fulbright student, Naheed Esar, with whom I was able to meet in 2015 in Kabul. The indomitable spirit of her and her family resulted in Naheed's successful graduation from the University of Arkansas as a Fulbright Scholar with a master's degree in cultural anthropology. Her story should remind all of us that there can be a future with a free Afghanistan and that now is not the time to abandon these civilians to the Taliban. Watch my House floor speech here.

Visiting Patients at McClellan VA Hospital
￼
Nurses like Julie, Sharonda, and Shannon (pictured above, left to right) at the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare Systems truly care for their patients and are providing top-notch treatment for our heroes. I appreciate Dr. Margie Scott, Chris Durney, and all the members of the hospital team who took time with me to discuss their programs and what they do to support central Arkansas veterans. I was grateful to be able to visit the VA staff and patients and spread some holiday cheer.

Delivering Christmas Packages with UPS!
￼
I enjoyed starting off my week delivering packages with Antoine James (pictured above) to small businesses in Little Rock. En route, we dropped off orders at Feinstein's, Boulevard Bread Company, WordsWorth Books, Sissy's Log Cabin, Mr. Wicks: The Gentleman's Shop, Tipton & Hurst, and the Toggery. Over the years, I have enjoyed this opportunity to visit with terrific UPS team members and be one of Santa's helpers for the day! 

Putting Women and Children First
￼
On Monday, I enjoyed visiting Women & Children First: The Center Against Family Violence to discuss the programs and necessary services they provide to women who are suffering from domestic violence. Thank you for your hard work in providing a safe haven in central Arkansas.

If you or someone you know is in a dangerous situation, please reach out on their website at www.wcfarkansas.org for help, or call their hotline at 1-800-799-7233.

Reaching out to the Spouses of Deployed Service Members
￼
Throughout the week, I have been calling the spouses of soldiers who are deployed to wish them a Merry Christmas, and thank them for their service and sacrifice to our country. During this holiday season, take a moment for those who do not have their loved ones with them and thank them or offer support in any way that you can.

Thank you for taking time to keep up with the work I'm doing on your behalf. If I can be of any assistance to you or your family, please reach out to my office at (501) 324-5941 or Hill.House.Gov. 

Sincerely,
￼

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend, 

This week, the Senate failed to pass a government funding bill and the federal government shut down on Friday at midnight. Senate Democrats are completely ignoring the will of the American people. They are solely to blame for this unnecessary government shutdown. The House did its job – we funded the government and border security, and we put a down payment on disaster funding for Hurricane Michael. Shutting the government down should never be used as a bargaining chip, yet year after year we end up in the same place. Rest assured that during this shut down, the essential functions of FEMA, the VA, and our national defense will remain open. President Trump has stood strong with House Republicans in ensuring we take steps to secure our borders and provide disaster funding to those who need it most. I will continue to fight for disaster funding until the hardworking people of the Panhandle are back on their feet.

On Thursday, the House voted to fund the government and fund disaster relief, while securing our border. President Trump is a man of his word. I commend him for remaining steadfast in ensuring our border is secure and those who were devastated by disasters this year are not forgotten. Hurricane Michael destroyed communities, decimated the agriculture industry, and left a path of destruction on our military bases in the Second District. This supplemental disaster funding is a down payment on getting the hardworking folks in my district back on their feet. It is the beginning of a long and expensive commitment to those in the Panhandle, but it is a step in the right direction. 

￼ 
[Click the photo to view Dr. Dunn's remarks]

My votes this week were for all those back home whose lives were forever changed in October – I have not forgotten you and I will fight to ensure you are taken care of. 

Hurricane Michael Recovery
￼ 
On Monday, I was honored to join Henry Turner the Vice President for government affairs for Altria as he presented a $100,000 check to the Red Cross in Tallahassee for Hurricane Michael recovery efforts. Our area will need significant help in the coming months and years to rebuild from the devastation caused by Hurricane Michael. Thank you to Altria and to all those who have donated their time and resources to helping those who need it most in the Panhandle.
￼ 
Washington Office Move ￼  This week, my DC office moved to the office that was once held by President Gerald Ford. Congressman Brian Babin (TX-36) presented me with the ceremonial photos of then Congressman Ford in the office. My father worked for President Ford and I have fond memories of his time serving the 38th President of the United States. These photos have been passed down from member to member for years and I am honored to be the newest occupant of 316 Cannon House Office Building.  ￼   Thank you for your continued energy and enthusiasm, as reflected in your letters and Facebook posts. If you haven’t already, LIKE my Facebook page. You can also follow me on Twitter @DrNealDunnFL2. 
Thank you for the opportunity to serve you in Congress!

Token Taxonomy, First Step, Private Funds Raised for Border Wall
Congressman Warren Davidson was in Washington, D.C. last week as Congress was in Session. 
On Thursday, Congressman Davidson introduced his long-waited Token Taxonomy Act, H.R. 7356, to provide light-touch regulatory certainty for businesses, entrepreneurs, and regulators in the blockchain economy. Implementing this fix will stop fraud from spreading and provide the certainty innovation needs to flourish in Ohio and across the country. 
“In the early days of the internet, Congress passed legislation that provided certainty and resisted the temptation to over-regulate the market. Our intentions are to achieve a similar win for America’s economy and American leadership in this innovative space,” said Congressman Davidson.
Read more about the Token Taxonomy Act here. 
Among other bills, Congress passed the First Step Act on Thursday. Congressman Davidson supported the First Step Act, which the President signed into law on Friday. The First Step Act, S. 756, makes reforms to our criminal justice system and prison system. The new law aims to reduce recidivism and promote rehabilitation by encouraging inmates to participate in educational and vocational training, and by improving conditions in federal prisons.  
On Friday, Congressman Davidson reacted to news about military veteran Brian Kolfage raising more than $13 million in donations in four days for the border wall. Congressman Davidson said it would take an act by Congress to direct the U.S. Treasury to accept these funds. He said legislation he recently introduced is able to accomplish this.  
The Buy a Brick, Build the Wall Act creates an account at the U.S. Treasury dedicated to holding public donations for the completion of a wall along the U.S. southern border. Without this legislation these funds would be lost in a general use fund.  
Over the weekend, Congressman Davidson was invited to join Trish Regan of Fox Business's Primetime to share more about his efforts to help Kolfage. 
Watch the interview here.

￼
  
￼
The Government Shutdown
The government shutdown late Friday night after Democrats refused to work with Republicans to secure funding for border security. The President has made it clear, securing our border is a non-negotiable issue.  
On Saturday, Congressman Davidson reacted to the government shutdown, saying it should have been resolved long before the appropriations deadline in October, and that the Senate should now follow through and close the deal. Read his post on Facebook here. 
Watch his interview on Fox Business here.

Merry Christmas! 
Renee, Lane and I wish you and your loved ones a very Merry Christmas!
 
￼
 
As we spend time with our loved ones this holiday season, join me in remembering our fellow Americans who are serving in uniform, our veterans and their families. To our soldiers serving abroad: thank you. We are praying for your safe return home. God Bless our troops, our veterans and our military families! 
 

Friends,
 
No, your mind wasn’t playing tricks on you. It wasn’t a case of déjà vu. Last week, Washington found itself in a stand-off facing a last-minute funding deadline. 
 
Again.
 
What brought us here? Earlier this year, Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed into law five of the 12 annual spending bills, funding the majority of the federal government for fiscal year 2019. This was a big deal and a huge priority for me because it marked the first on-time annual funding bill for the Department of Defense in 22 years. We also provided a well-deserved pay raise – and the second in a row – for our brave service members.
 
Unfortunately, Democrats wouldn’t come to the table and work with Republicans to improve border security – among many other issues – so we were forced to pass what’s known as a continuing resolution (CR) that lasted until December for the remaining seven funding bills. This included funding for the Department of Homeland Security which is in charge of border security.
 
This brought us to this week’s deadline. I was extremely disappointed when the Senate on Wednesday passed a short term spending bill that failed to offer any new funding for a border wall and would punt on this important issue – again. It would have put off negotiations until February – when Democrats take control of the House of Representatives.
 
Kicking the can down the road will not secure our border. With Democrats in the majority, there is no way expected-Speaker Nancy Pelosi would support building the wall and we would have had zero leverage. Congresswoman Pelosi admitted earlier this year, “I'm not the wall's biggest advocate in Congress” and she suggested “mowing the grass so that people can't be smuggled through the grass” is a good idea to secure our border. That’s foolish.
 
That’s why the House of Representatives passed on Thursday a reasonable bill to fund the remaining government agencies and President Trump's requested $5.7 billion for border security. Senate Democrats, led by Senator Chuck Schumer, had a choice: another Schumer Shutdown and open borders or a fully funded government and border security.
 
Like you, I was extremely disappointed when the Senate failed to act by midnight Friday to avert a partial government shutdown and secure our border.
 
The American people are tired of this gridlock. They’re tired of Washington ignoring our country’s priorities. Americans on both sides of the aisle agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform and border security. Why can’t Washington get it done? 
 
I’m willing to make compromises. 
 
But earlier in the week, when presented with a reasonable compromise funding bill that provided only a fraction of President Trump’s request for border security funding, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi said, “No.” It baffles me that my Democratic colleagues yet again put partisanship over the American people.
 
So far, Washington Democrats are completely unwilling to show the same good-faith compromise that the president and Republicans have shown time and again. I am calling on my colleagues in the Senate to do the right thing: vote to fund the rest of the government, secure our border, and put the safety of the American people first.
 
As I'm writing this column on Sunday morning, December 23, we still don't have a resolution to the partial government shutdown. I remain committed to standing with President Trump to get the resources we need to secure our border and keep you and your family safe.
 
Until next week,
￼
Richard Hudson 
Member of Congress (NC-08)

2018 By the Numbers
 
 
I am so proud of all that my team and I have accomplished for the Seventh District in 2018. Here are a few highlights from this year: 
	•	My offices closed over 1,350 constituent cases– helping people with things like Social Security benefits, passport applications, and VA claims processing.
	•	We delivered 50 flags flown over the Capitol and facilitated 250 tours of the U.S. Capitol.
	•	39,415 letters and e-mails were sent in response to your opinions and questions.
	•	I held 21 Coffee with Your Congressman events in all 8 counties and hosted 2 telephone town halls.
	•	I introduced 4 bills and cosponsored 17 bill. 5 bills I cosponsored became law, including efforts to fight opioid addiction, improve healthcare, and ensure veterans get better care.
	•	As a member of the Ways & Means committee, I helped renegotiate trade deals and advanced legislation to repeal harmful Obamacare taxes and engage our workforce. I also helped pass legislation that supports small businesses and farmers.

Securing Our Border 
 
 
On Thursday, the House passed a spending bill that reflected the priorities of not only South Carolina, but the entire country. We sent the Senate a bill that provided critical disaster relief funding, secured our border, and kept the government open. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats chose open borders over an open government. 

As we continue to recover from Hurricane Florence, additional disaster relief funding is critical to helping as many people as possible rebuild. Furthermore, securing our border is a matter of national security and a matter of life and death in the Seventh District. Law enforcement officers have attributed the 150 opioid overdoses in our district last year to drugs coming across our porous borders. I spoke on the House floor in support of securing our border and keeping the government open. You can watch the full speech by clicking the link below.

Tax Relief for Disaster Victims
 
 
This week, the House passed a tax package that includes three of my bills that provide relief for disaster victims and modernize technology at the IRS! 
The Disaster Certainty Act will create an automatic 60-day deadline extension immediately following a Presidential Disaster Declaration. If a natural disaster coincides with a tax filing deadline, as was the case during Hurricanes Matthew and Florence, people will be able to focus on their safety rather than worry about filing a tax return. The Hurricane Florence Tax Relief Act gives Florence victims the flexibility to access emergency funds, encourages charitable giving, and enhances the deduction for personal casualty losses. These targeted provisions will provide tax relief and ease the financial burden on people recovering from this disaster. The Electronic Signature Standards Act requires the IRS to implement uniform standards to accept electronic signatures, an important step forward in the agency’s long overdue IT modernization efforts.  Read More »

Wall Funding and Government Shutdown
I am proud of President Trump for drawing a line and insisting that we fulfill the promise we made to the American people in 2016 to build the wall and finally get serious about illegal immigration. On behalf of the nation, President Trump declared that he would not sign a bill to fund the government unless it also funds the wall we need, and he stuck to his word.
￼
To read article, please click here.
My House colleagues and I came together to provide over $5 billion to fund the wall, secure additional border security measures, and keep our government running. Earlier in the week I spoke on the floor urging the House to listen to the American people and take action. This bill remains in the Senate, which has not yet acted to end a partial government shutdown.

Newton Wins State
I want to congratulate Coach W.T. Johnston and the Newton Eagle football team for winning the Class 3A Division II state championship for the second year in a row, and fifth state title in Newton High School history. 
￼
Newton was victorious Thursday over the Canadian Wildcats, 21-16. They overcame great odds. In March, Coach Johnston was told he had eight months to live. That was nine months ago. Coach Johnston did not let that news stop him from continuing to touch the lives of his students and passionately coach the sport he loves. His story inspires us all to truly “live before [we] die,” and know that our relationship with God and the people around us is what truly matters in life.

Moving Offices 
This week was bittersweet as my staff and I moved out of the Cannon Office Building, where we served the people of Texas for four years. Our Cannon office is full of history as it was occupied by Michigan Congressman Gerald Ford from 1948-1955. 
￼
I have been proud to display photos courtesy of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library of the future president working in our office. Wednesday, I passed on those photos to the office’s new occupant, my friend Congressman Neal Dunn, M.D. of Florida (pictured below).
￼
My new office is located in Room 2236 of the Rayburn Office Building, right across the street from our Capitol. I encourage residents of the 36th District of Texas to come see us whenever they visit Washington
Babin Comments on Secretary Mattis' Service
The American people are losing a very smart, tough and patriotic public servant in Secretary of Defense General James “Mad Dog” Mattis. His departure will leave a big void, and we will miss his leadership, experience and knowledge. Our enemies feared and respected him and our friends appreciated him.

The Greatest Generation: Celebrating Those Who Fought in WWII
I recently participated in a ceremony commemorating the 74th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge by honoring the 110th Regimental Combat Team - 28th Division.
The 28th Division, which was - and is to this day - a Pennsylvania Army National Guard Unit, played a critical role in the Battle of the Bulge. Outnumbered and outgunned, the 110th Combat Team was part of an American front positioned at the Luxembourg border that held back the advances of nearly four German divisions. This effort delayed the Germans by nearly four days and allowed American forces to maintain control of the city of Bastogne, Belgium - a key strategic position against the German offensive on the Western Front.
A member of the 28th Division during World War II was William Bull, a Chester County resident. Mr. Bull, now 97 years old, enlisted in the Army in 1943 - when he was 21 - and saw combat action in Europe at Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge. He was honorably discharged from the Army in 1945, earning a Bronze Star, two Purple Hearts, a Combat Infantry Badge, and a French War Cross for his service.
Mr. Bull was presented with a copy of the Congressional Record honoring the 10th Regimental Combat Team - 28th Division, an American flag that flew over the U.S. Capitol, and a citation from the Chester County commissioners.

Bipartisan Overhaul of Our Criminal Justice System
This week, the Senate overwhelmingly approved the First Step Act, a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill.
This is an important measure that will enhance the fairness of certain mandatory minimum sentences and increase public safety by reducing recidivism among offenders.
I'm pleased that the First Step Act included my legislation requiring the Bureau of Prisons to provide a safe means for federal correctional officers to store their personal firearms while at work so that they can protect themselves on their commutes. Federal correctional officers place themselves in harm's way every day to protect the rest of us, so they should have the ability to defend themselves while on and off duty.
However, the fact that the First Step Act was not subject to a full and robust amendment process represented a missed opportunity. It was particularly disappointing that Senate Democrats blocked my amendment to help victims of crime. Nonetheless, the productive reforms contained within the First Step Act outweigh the measure's shortcomings, which is why I supported its passage.

Reasserting Congress' Role in Trade
The tariffs on steel and aluminum imports - which were established under the false pretense of ‘national security' - are hurting American workers and consumers. Making matters worse is the broken bureaucratic process for qualified companies to obtain an exemption from these tariffs.
In November 2018, I worked across the aisle with U.S. Senators Doug Jones (D-Ala.) and Tom Carper (D-Del.) to ask the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review the steel and aluminum tariff exclusion process at the Commerce Department.
This week, the GAO agreed to our request and will begin its review process early next year.
The exclusion process at the Commerce Department has resulted a large backlog of petitions and has placed significant burdens on American workers and businesses. At the end of October, Commerce had received nearly 50,000 exclusion petitions (including resubmissions), but had issued decisions for just one-third of them. I hope the GAO's review produces recommendations for fixing this flawed process so more Americans are spared from these onerous taxes.

Palazzo Introduces Bill to Allow Americans to Purchase Border Wall Bonds
 

I serve as Vice Chairman of the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, and this week I introduced the Border Bonds for America Act of 2018, which allows American citizens the opportunity to purchase revenue bonds to help finance the construction of a southern border wall.   This bill is a safe investment into the infrastructure and security of our country.   During World War II, 85 million Americans purchased $185 billion in war bonds and financially supported our troops while they were defending our country. This legislation would allow for the patriots of today’s era to help support American security in the same way as previous generations. 
￼
In November of 2016, Americans voted for better border security and as Vice-Chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, I believe this legislation allows new alternatives for our citizens to support their values and defend our homeland.  The Border Bonds for America Act directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue government savings bonds, known as ""Border Bonds,"" specifically for the construction of a border wall on the United States border with Mexico, as well as related technology, and improved infrastructure. 
The American people are fed up with the political games fueled by the Democrats’ inaction to secure our borders and protect our citizens. Democrats have time and time again proved they are willing to put the life of an illegal immigrant over the life of an American citizen. Republicans in Congress have worked to secure our border, and ensure our citizens remain safe.  
￼
As always, I'd like to remind you to connect with me on social media so you can receive frequent updates on the work I am doing in Congress through Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.   
In your service,

Friends,
As you know, this weekend Congress was unfortunately unable to agree on and pass a bill to fund the remaining 25% of the government that has yet to be funded, causing a partial shutdown. 
This past year, my colleagues and I on the Appropriations Committee worked hard to fully fund the government, passing all 12 appropriations bills out of our Committee so they could head to the House floor for a vote and get to the President's desk on time. Five of these measures have already been signed into law, funding our military, health services and other critical government programs. 
Unfortunately, despite several opportunities earlier this year to fund the remainder of the government, many of my colleagues decided to play politics instead of putting their constituents first. Sadly, Americans across the country are paying the price for their choice. 
I am of the firm belief that while federal workers across the nation are furloughed and certain government services are interrupted, it is not appropriate for Members of Congress to continue receiving their salaries. That's why I requested that my pay be withheld until the government is fully operational again. 
￼
My hope is that we can come to a final agreement with the Senate that includes strong border security, sets the tone for commonsense, bipartisan legislating in the 116th Congress and gets this funding out the door as quickly as possible and into the communities that depend on it. 
While I continue to work across the aisle to get our government back up and running, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the blessings of this holiday season and wish you and your family a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. 
I hope your holidays are filled with love, laughter and joy!
￼
Dave

From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:
Good Afternoon,
This week in Congress,I voted to reduce the risk of recidivism for individuals within our prison system by supporting H.R. 5682, the Formerly Incarcerated Reenter Society Transformed Safely Transitioning Every Person Act (FIRST STEP Act).
￼
Helping to Shape Responsible Citizens 
I was proud to support the FIRST STEP Act to provide the men and women in our prison system the educational, vocational, and substance abuse training they need to reenter their communities. This bill institutes reforms in the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to reduce the risk of recidivism, requires the Department of Justice (DOJ) to establish a system to assess and classify the recidivism risk of individual prisoners, and incentivizes the completion of recidivism reduction programs. In addition to these measures, H.R. 5682 requires the BOP to report on its ability to treat heroin and opioid abuse as well as plans to expand access to medication-assisted treatment. I was also pleased to see that the Lieutenant Osvaldo Albarati Correctional Officer Self-Protection Act was in included in this bill, guaranteeing that corrections officers will have a secure place to store their firearms to and from work.
Secretary Nielsen Testifies Before House Judiciary Committee
I had the opportunity to question Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security’s enforcement priorities are in line with federal law.
￼
As a former U.S. Attorney, I worked closely with the Department of Homeland Security and I have the utmost respect for these dedicated professionals. During the hearing, I discussed how our Customs and Border Patrol agents can most effectively secure our borders. In 2018 alone, agents apprehended 396,579 illegal immigrants crossing between our Southwest border ports of entry. Congress has a two-pronged responsibility to ensure DHS has the resources to perform their duties while protecting the health and safety of those currently in custody at our border.
Providing Certainty to American Farmers and Ranchers
On Thursday, President Trump signed into law the Farm Bill, revamping American agriculture. I am proud to support a Farm Bill that will prioritize the needs of Pennsylvania’s farmers, ranchers, consumers, and rural communities.The conference report to H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act extends major federal farm, nutrition assistance, rural development, and other USDA programs. I believe this bill will provide the certainty and flexibility our farmers and ranchers need to produce food and fiber for Americans and the world.
Keeping My Commitments 
I voted to keep the government open, secure our borders, and provide disaster assistance to those affected by severe weather events across the country. The continuing resolution passed on Thursday provides funding for the federal government until February 8, 2019 and provides $5 billion for construction of the border wall. This vote represents a commitment by House Republicans to fund the government and keep our promise to the American people to secure our nation’s southern border by building the wall. Additionally, providing relief to those affected by natural disasters in the West and Southeast is imperative to ensure the indemnity and well-being of those communities.
Lake Ariel Office Closing
Due to the recent redistricting of Pennsylvania, I will represent PA-12 beginning in the 116th Congress. It is important to note that PA-12 no longer covers much of its northeastern tier, including Wayne, Lackawanna, Pike, and Monroe counties. Potter, Clinton, and parts of Centre and Tioga counties will be added. Because of these changes, my Lake Ariel office closed on December 21, 2018. A new office will be added, and I will update you with this change once I have more information.
The official start of PA-12 is January 3, 2019. At that time, you can click hereIf you have any questions about who represents you in the 116th Congress.

December 23, 2018
Dear Friend,  
Last week was full of action.  I saw two of my bills pass both the House and Senate, which I will discuss in greater detail below.  Congress also extended the National Flood Insurance Program until May 31, 2019, which is very important to local homeowners, the housing market and our regional economy.  While I would have preferred a longer extension, this continuation does allow more time for negotiation regarding many of the provisions that need to be fixed within the program.  
Despite tremendous legislative success, we were unable to reach agreement on the outstanding spending bills by midnight Friday, which means that we are currently in a partial shutdown of the federal government.  It is important to note that several appropriations bills have already been signed into law that fund the following departments:  Defense, Education, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Labor, Heath and Human Services, the legislative branch, and some smaller agencies such as the Bureau of Reclamation. These agencies will not be impacted by the partial government shutdown.   
However, there are seven budgets that have yet to be finalized.  They fund the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Homeland Security, Interior, State, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, and some other smaller agencies.  This article explains more about what the public can expect during the partial government shutdown.  Of importance, Social Security checks will still go out as scheduled, Medicare payments will be processed, and both active duty military and Veterans’ services will be unaffected.  
To be clear, I believe it is our responsibility to work together and find solutions.  Government shut-downs, even partial ones, are disruptive to the American public.  However, I do believe that it is important to fight for one’s priorities.  And, our national security, including strengthening our border is undeniably a priority.  It is disappointing to me that some of my colleagues are refusing to appropriately fund the Department of Homeland Security, despite their prior support of budgets that contained funding for strengthening the border.  While we are trying to minimize the negative impact of this partial shutdown, this entire situation is political in nature and it is the American people who are short-changed.  Negotiations are ongoing, and I am optimistic that we will resolve the situation soon.  Please be assured that throughout these negotiations, I will continue to fight for appropriate levels of funding to meet our national security needs.  
Lastly, I want to wish each of you a very Merry Christmas.  I hope you are able to spend quality time with your loved ones over this most joyous time of the year! 
Please continue reading for a brief overview of other efforts on your behalf this week. 
Saving Lives 
Last week, President Trump signed my Congenital Heart Futures Act into law. This is the 26th bill I've authored which has become law since 2015. This important legislation addresses the need to invest in continued research to assist the millions of Americans living with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD).  It is estimated that there are currently between 2-3 million adults and children living in the United States with CHD, and nearly 1 in every 100 babies are born with a CHD.  Sadly, five percent of these babies will not live to see their first birthdays. However, due to recent advancements in technology, CHD patients are surviving longer. This legislation seeks to build upon that success by ensuring continued investment in surveillance research to assess the lifelong needs of individuals with CHD.  These surveillance efforts will help improve understanding of CHD across the lifespan, from birth to adulthood.  In addition, the legislation emphasizes the need for continued biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of CHD.  NIH will further research the causes of congenital heart defects, including genetic causes, and study long-term outcomes in individuals with CHD of all ages. NIH will also study data to identify effective treatments and outcomes, and identify barriers to lifelong care for individuals with congenital heart defects.   CHD is a true public health issue that does not discriminate by race, gender, or socio-economic status.  The road ahead may be scary and uncertain for any parent with a newborn who has CHD, but this meaningful legislation gives hope to those coping with the diagnosis.   It will also expand the infrastructure to track the epidemiology of congenital heart defects. For the sake of those living with CHD and the estimated 40,000 babies who will be born in the next year with CHD, I made passage of this bill a priority.  Research is key to understanding the causes of CHD, preventing it and improving treatment.  The near unanimous passage of this important bill will improve the care of people with CHD at all ages and advance the field in critical areas.
Better data leads to better research. This bi-partisan initiative is about giving hope to families who have suffered and improving the quality of life for millions of Americans by investing in life-saving research.   Doing the right thing on behalf of sick kids is a moral imperative, and I am glad we were finally able to get it over the finish line.  Click here to watch me speak about this life-saving legislation on the House Floor.

Fighting for our Nation’s Heroes 
I am proud that my bill, the SIT-REP Act, passed the Senate as part of S. 2248 last week, after passing in the House earlier this month. This legislation, which ensures our Veterans are not adversely impacted when bureaucratic red tape causes GI Bill payments to be delayed, is very timely given the recent delays by the VA in processing payments. I am continuing to closely monitor that situation and have been assured that all Veterans will receive the full amount they are due. However, my bill will guarantee, moving forward, that Veterans will not lose access to education or be charged with additional fees from the schools. The bill is now headed to the President’s desk for signature, which will mark the 27th bill I have offered to become law since January 2015.
I was also honored to participate in last week's press conference during which a bipartisan group of legislators who serve on the House VA Committee implored Senators to do the right thing by sending the Blue Water Navy bill to the President's desk to become law. These heroes have already waited far too long. We must honor our commitment to them by ensuring they receive the benefits and healthcare they deserve.  This needs to get done before the end of the 115th Congress.  Click here to watch the press conference.  
Additionally, I was extremely disappointed to read this article about unspent funding in the VA’s mental health budget. It is unconscionable to know that despite unprecedented funding levels for the VA, dollars went unspent to help our nation’s heroes like USMC Colonel Jim Turner who took his life this month at Bay Pines VA Medical Facility. I intend to get to the bottom of this travesty, so we can ensure our Veterans that they will get the care they deserve - even one suicide per day is one too many.

I was proud the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act, which I co-sponsored, passed the House last week by a vote of 361 to 3. It is now headed to the President's desk to become law. This important legislation authorizes grants for training and support services for Alzheimer's patients and their families. It also authorizes funding for critical research into better treatments. This debilitating disease has impacted my family and millions of other families around the country. We must continue to invest in the research needed to find a cure.
￼  
Fundamentally, I believe it is vital that officials at all levels of government work together to meet the needs of their constituents, which is why I was honored to speak at last week's Pasco County Legislative Delegation meeting.  I provided a brief update on the work we are doing to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and provide Veterans with better access to the benefits and care they deserve. But my primary reason for attending was to ask them to work with me to ensure that children (including two of my constituents) with rare and terminal illnesses are able to access the Medicaid Waiver Program. At my invitation, one of these constituents, five-year old Lincoln DeLuna, also came to the meeting (pictured below). His parents made a similar request of Pasco's state officials. I will keep fighting for Lincoln and other children in similar circumstances until they get the care they need.  To read more about Lincoln’s story, click here.

FEDERAL FUNDING

This week, I was proud to vote for legislation to fund the federal government and support President Trump's border wall. 

Over the past few days I've heard from many of you in the First District loud and clear. I've heard a loud ""build the wall"" and I couldn't agree more.
I have been to the Southwest border and I have seen the threats we face firsthand. There are illegal drugs, human trafficking, gang members and terrorists coming across our border. It is critical to our national security that we secure our border and it is great news that the House approved this funding.
The legislation also includes critical disaster assistance for our own agricultural community in the First District and for agriculture across our state. For months I have been working to secure assistance for Georgia's blueberry growers to help in their recovery from devastating winter weather. This bill authorizes and directs the United States Department of Agriculture to provide disaster assistance to these farmers. Blueberries are a billion dollar industry in Georgia and the commodity is the backbone of some of our communities. These growers and communities need and deserve this support.   Unfortunately, the Senate has failed to act on this legislation resulting in a partial shutdown of approximately 25% of the federal government. In the Senate, this legislation requires 60 votes to pass so there needs to be bipartisan cooperation. However, Senate Democrats have put party politics ahead of our national security, disaster assistance and federal workers preventing passage of this federal funding legislation.   I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to come to the table and support our national security as well as America's farmers and others who need this disaster funding.  We need to get this job done for the American people. 

MERRY CHRISTMAS!

From our family to yours, Merry Christmas!

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CXCI

Monday, December 17, 2018:  On Saturday I attended one of the most meaningful events that I have the honor of attending each year, the Annual Wreath Ceremony in Honor of Fallen Heroes of the 3rd Infantry Division of Fort Stewart. 
￼
Rep. Carter participating in the Annual Wreath Ceremony in Honor of Fallen Heroes of the 3rd Infantry Division of Fort Stewart
For the past 12 years, “Wreaths for Warriors Walk, Inc.,” (W4WW) an all-volunteer, nonprofit organization founded in 2007, has held this event to honor the sacrifice of the soldiers represented by the trees on Warriors Walk and their families.  Before the ceremony, I attended the Gold Star family reception held at Newman Gym on base where I had the opportunity to visit with family members of our fallen heroes and have them share memories of their loved one.  Afterwards, I walked over to Cottrell Field where the wreath laying ceremony was held.  The moving ceremony included a poem reading of Another Tree Planted written by Mrs. Reese Bishop as well as comments by Maj. General Leo Quintas before the placement of wreaths. 
￼
Rep. Carter meeting with a resident of the First District to discuss important issues
This morning I’m at my Savannah district office where I meet with a constituent regarding the opioid epidemic that is currently gripping our country.  While the rules and regulations covering the prescribing and use of these drugs have been tightened, I continually remind my colleagues that there are still people such as hospice patients and long term pain management patients who need these medications and we have to make certain they continue to have access to them.  Next, I head to Smiley Elementary School in Ludowici where I have the opportunity to read Pete the Cat 12 Groovy Days of Christmas to first grade classes at the school.  This excited group of well-behaved students is looking forward with great anticipation to the arrival of Santa Claus. 
￼

Afterwards, I head to Liberty Regional Medical Center in Hinesville where I meet with health care professionals to discuss some of the challenges that they face today.  Next, I travel to Coastal Manor Nursing Home in Ludowici and visit with my good friends who I worked with for many years.  Led by Administrator Elise Stafford, this great group of health care professionals provides much needed quality care to the residents here.  Afterwards, I head back to Hinesville to the Angel Tree (Giving Tree) at the Liberty County/Armed Services YMCA where I present a boy and girls gift for inclusion in the Giving Tree which contains Christmas wishes from children ages 0-18.

Wednesday, December 19, 2018:  After an early morning flight from Savannah I’m back in Washington this morning hoping that the next few days are successful ones in preventing us from having a partial government shutdown at midnight Friday.  Once I’m situated, I head to the House Chamber where I pay tribute to one of the most influential military civic leaders in America, Parker Greene from Valdosta, who passed yesterday.  A link to my tribute can be found here.  I also pay tribute to one of my former pharmacy professors at the University of Georgia (UGA), Dr. George Fransico, who has announced his retirement and congratulate the Valdosta State Blazers for winning the NCAA Division II football championship this past weekend. 
￼
Rep. Carter remembers Parker Greene on the House Floor
A link to these tributes can be found here and here.  Afterwards, I head to the Library of Congress to attend the farewell address of Speaker Paul Ryan who has done an outstanding job of leading our conference for the past three years.  Introduced by Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), who always refers to the Speaker as the “smartest kid in the class,” Paul Ryan’s career has been exemplary.  From a young intern in Washington fresh out of college, to a member of Congress, to a Vice Presidential candidate and finally to Speaker of the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan has served his country proudly and we are all better off as a result of his service.  After returning to my office, I have a phone interview with The Savannah Morning News, to discuss the recent clarification and improvements to the permitting process used by the Army Corps of Engineers.  Next, I head to the House Chamber where, for two hours, I preside as Speaker Pro-tem over the House.  After returning to my office for a short period of time, I head back to the House Chamber for our first and only vote series of the day.

Thursday, December 20, 2018:  My morning begins with our weekly GOP Conference where we discuss the continuing resolution (CR) to the government budget that the Senate has sent for our approval.  Earlier this year we approved a budget that accounts for approximately 75% of our budget to run through the end of the fiscal year (September 30, 2019) of next year but the remaining 25% is set to expire tomorrow at midnight unless we pass a CR or some other funding package.  A CR is simply a continuation of the funding from last year and is the least desirable of funding packages.  What the Senate has sent us is a clean CR with nothing else included.  As we get into the discussion this morning it is clear that our members, including me, want disaster relief for, among other things, wildfires in California and hurricanes and freezes in the Southeast, as well as funding for border security in the Southwest.  As a result of this long but productive meeting, leadership heads to the White House where discussions of a path forward takes place.  Next, I head back to my office and meet with key members of my staff to discuss our approach to this situation as part of the disaster relief package is much needed funds for blueberry and peach farmers in the First District who suffered devastating losses in 2017 due to a late freeze. 
￼
Rep. Carter speaking about the importance of border security and disaster assistance on the House Floor
Later, I head to the House Chamber where we have our first vote series of the day and word comes to us that the President is in full support of our budget proposal.  Next, I head back to my office and have a phone interview with WTOC TV in Savannah to discuss the Farm Bill that was signed into law today by the President.  Afterwards, I rush back down to the House Chamber to vote to table a motion made by the Minority Leader to bring the Senate CR bill to the floor for a vote.  Later, after I have returned to my office, I head back down to the House Chamber for another vote series and remain on the floor to speak in favor of the House version of the CR that includes funding for border security and disaster relief.  A link to my comments can be found here.  Later that evening, I return to the House Chamber for our last vote series of the day and we pass the House version of the CR and send it over to the Senate for their consideration.

Friday, December 21, 2018:  As you can imagine, the tension in Washington is extremely high today as we face a partial government shutdown tonight at midnight if we do not get a budget deal done.  We have our first vote series around mid-morning and then we hurry up and wait to see what is going on in the Senate.  The ball is in their court now and, because they operate under a completely different set of rules, we don’t know what to expect or when to expect it.  Much of my day is spent in discussion with other members trying to figure out what is going on and what we can do to help the process.  After a phone interview with WJCL TV in Savannah to discuss the tenuous situation up here in Washington, I head back to the House Chamber for another vote series before heading back to my office.  Later, I head back to the House Chamber for our third and final vote series of the day and afterwards most members remain in the Chamber to hear from the Majority Leader as to the situation with the Senate and on-going negotiations.  Because of Senate rules and the on-going negotiations, it becomes clear that a partial government shutdown cannot be avoided and as the clock strikes midnight we officially begin a partial government shutdown.

Saturday, December 22, 2018:  Negotiations among leadership continue today but unfortunately no resolution has come about so it’s another day of hurry up and wait.

Border Security is National Security


Our government was founded for one purpose: to fulfill the charges set forth in the Constitution, “. . .establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty.” 

Lawmakers take an oath to the Constitution. We fail in our sworn duty if we refuse to ensure the sovereignty, security, and well-being of this nation through secure borders.
 
     
￼



I never want to see another American killed by someone we could have stopped at the border. Sometime between 9/11 and today, our conversation about border security got muddled. The wall, border patrol, surveillance of human trafficking routes – all of these have been recast exclusively into the context of immigration policy. Border security is a key component of our national security, the common defense, and homeland security.
On the micro scale, there’s no question that we’re safer than we were before events of 9/11. Thanks to important reforms like the creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), thorough intelligence gathering and no-fly lists, new technology at border checkpoints and more, we are better equipped than ever to catch terrorists and drug traffickers before they can enter the U.S.
On the macro scale, extremism and criminal networks flourish across the globe even as we shift focus back to threats from nation-states like Russia and China. In the Middle East, 98 percent of Islamic State (ISIS) territorial claims have been recaptured. However, the collapse of the caliphate resulted in thousands of trained, radicalized, and committed militants fleeing to different parts of the world, vowing to carry out destruction in the West. Attacks throughout Europe have been especially high-profile, including a suicide bombing outside a pop concert in Manchester, England, and a truck attack in Nice, France, that killed 86. Throughout Central and South America, cartels operate with impunity and Venezuela teeters on collapse and threatens to destabilize the entire region.
In recent testimony, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen signaled her agency’s alarm over recent developments. First, in 2017 alone, the U.S. government caught or prevented over 3,700 known or suspected terrorists from traveling to the United States, a rate of 10 per day. Second, Secretary Nielsen revealed the discovery of materials written by ISIS militants encouraging their followers to cross into the United States through our southwest border and take advantage of our well-known immigration loopholes.
This much is undeniable: terrorists are seeking to enter our country and they are aware of our existing border security weaknesses. This is beyond alarming, it is damaging to the legitimacy of our immigration system and collective sense of safety. It takes a combination of good intelligence, physical barriers, and careful surveillance to have strong borders and thorough vetting. When we prevent people from crossing the border illegally and can vet everyone entering our country, we can better distinguish between those who come to proudly contribute to our society and the terrorists who seek to destroy it. If a terrorist enters our country illegally and carries out an attack, it costs us lives, resources, and distracts from our efforts to create a well-structured immigration system that works for everyone.
Some politicians in favor of open borders ridicule the fears about terrorists entering our country, declaring that no terrorist groups operate in Mexican territory, that ISIS fights in Syria, not Tijuana. Besides dismissing the murderous nature of drug cartels just to score political points, this position also ignores the well-documented nature of criminal networks. Central and South American drug cartels have extensive resources and a track record of working with corrupt governments, gangs, and other criminal networks. A recent Politico article titled “The secret backstory of how Obama let Hezbollah off the hook,” reports how Hezbollah, the Lebanese terrorist organization responsible for a host of anti-American and anti-Israeli attacks, is deeply involved in cocaine trafficking, money laundering, and weapon smuggling in Venezuela. The Politico article tells of how cocaine from Hezbollah-linked networks enters U.S. cities through our southern border with the cooperation of cartels. We should not kid ourselves; terrorist organizations are already at work in Central and South America. No one else will save us. We must save ourselves.
We must secure our land borders, our airports, and our seaports. We must know who and what is coming into our country. That is a basic responsibility of government. It is a shield against terrorists and criminals, necessary to protect our communities and country.

WHAT TO EXPECT DURING A 
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
As you may know, there have been growing concerns that the federal government will shut down. A full shutdown occurs when Congress does not pass any of the 12 appropriations bills, while a partial shutdown happens when some of the appropriations bills have been passed, but others have not. It is necessary, like any law, that the President sign the appropriated bills once passed by Congress. To return to regular order, all 12 appropriations bills would have to be passed prior to October 1, the beginning of the next fiscal year. Complete and timely appropriations for the federal government has not occurred since 1997.
This year, Congress successfully passed, and the President signed, five of the twelve appropriations bills. The remaining bills had their funding extended until December 8, 2018, through, what is called, a Continuing Resolution. If we reach December 8th and Congress has not passed the remaining seven appropriations bills or another Continuing Resolution, then the government will go into a partial shutdown.
The agencies and departments which are operating on a normal budget and will not be affected by a partial government shutdown are: The Department of Defense, the Department of Labor, the Department of Energy, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, and Congress. For more information, visit my website at https://norman.house.gov/legislation/budget-and-appropriations-process.htm. Below you can find a graphic with links to information about each specific appropriations bill.
While many services will be impacted by a shutdown, essential government functions will continue to operate. Activities that are related to national security; safety and order, like air traffic control and law enforcement; and medical care, like veterans’ hospitals, are deemed essential activities and continue to operate, regardless of a government shutdown. However, many agencies will not receive funding during a shutdown. For example, the Department of Homeland Security will not be funded, meaning our border will be patrolled, but those agents will not be getting paid. TSA agents will be keeping our airports safe without pay, even though the Department of Transportation will not be receiving funding.
 
Importantly, in the event of a government shutdown:
·         Medicare and Social Security checks will continue to be mailed;
·         Food stamps will continue to be distributed, and;
·         Mail will still be delivered.
I have long been an advocate for a return to regular order, and the uncertainty and strife caused by nearing a government shutdown, further illustrate the need to fund the government each year, on time. Our system is truly broken, and we need to focus on fully debating each appropriations bill and providing responsible funding to our agencies before the end of the fiscal year. If you have thoughts or questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office at (202) 225-5501, or email me at RepRalph.Norman@mail.house.gov. 
 
 

Sincerely,

""The enemy of my enemy is my friend.” While I served in Iraq, my job was the Chief of Surgery at Abu Ghraib hospital. Our job was to take care of our own men and women in uniform as well as the enemy. We often relied on translators to communicate. They risked their lives and the lives of their families by helping us. The Iraqi insurgency viewed them as the worst kind of enemy; a traitor. They served alongside us with no promise of citizenship or entry to the United States. They did so because they believed it was the right thing to do. In my opinion, they have more than earned entry to the United States, so I proudly served as a special immigrant visa sponsor for those who sought safety and freedom in our country.
Fortunately, for most immigrants, the cost of entry to our nation is far lower. Indeed, we are a nation that welcomes the world’s tired, poor, and huddled masses, and we should continue to do so.  But we should not reward those who do not follow our nation’s laws and cut the line by entering our country illegally.
When asked about recent headlines on illegal immigration, a Russian immigrant who followed the legal channels to enter the United States remarked, “Those who violated U.S. laws to get here, arrived through acts of disrespect for this country. Why do these people get to go ahead of me?”
We are fortunate to live in a country that is so generous, but we also must not lose sight of our sense of fairness. Why are we insisting that law-abiding citizens travel to embassies, wait, complete applications and pay the resulting fees, and in some cases attorney fees, while we permit others to simply cross our border?
There is no doubt, our legal immigration system is broken. I saw this firsthand as I struggled to help my translators navigate the visa process. We need to fix our immigration system. The cheapest and most convenient way to become an American is by illegally entering our country. Some excuse this by saying our immigration process is too cumbersome. It is true that our legal immigration system needs reform, but we will never come up with an orderly legal system of immigration that is easier than process-free illegal entry.
Even 100 years ago, our immigration system required order.  I still have the papers from when my grandfathers and great-grandfathers came to the United States from Italy. Immigration officials recorded height, weight, physical state, city and country of origin. They were also required to sign pledges that they were not anarchists or polygamists, and pledge their fidelity to the United States.
This documentation might seem burdensome, but the reality is we need to know who is entering our country. We have a responsibility to protect our nation and its citizens. We must ensure that those entering our country are here to do good, not evil, and that they are not importing illicit drugs or criminal connections.
Of course, skipping this process will always be easier. That’s the allure of an open or unsecure border. Unless we have secure borders to prevent illegal entry, illegal immigrants will continue pouring over our borders instead of following the legal routes. We cannot expect any legal system to work if we do not have border control and management. Any fixes to the legal immigration system, such as improvements to widely-used guest-worker visa programs, would surely be undercut by those unfairly entering our nation illegally.
I am grateful to live in a nation where more people want to come in, not out. However, open or unsecure borders put the lawless ahead of those who play by the rules. A secure border encourages people to go through the process the right way, but it is also basic fairness to those who have respected our nation’s laws.

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
As you may know, Congress failed to pass either continued funding or fiscal year 2019 appropriations for the seven remaining annual bills, which resulted in a partial government shutdown that started at midnight. The House did pass a Continuing Resolution on Thursday, which would have kept our government running, funded the wall, and provided disaster aid – but the Senate did not take further action. 
Democrats have shown their hand—they prefer open borders over an open government. As Members of Congress, we took an oath of allegiance to the United States, not those trying to enter it illegally. It is unacceptable to hold the government hostage to play political games. While we can’t avoid a partial shutdown at this point, Congress can control how long it lasts.  I call on my Democratic colleagues in both chambers to come to the table and do what is right for our nation. 
The reality is the Democrats’ platform previously supported a border barrier, border security funding, and an increase of border patrol agents. Now, they’ve done a complete about face on these critical priorities and placed political expediency in front of delivering results for the American people. Our constituents did not send us to Washington to shut down the government. Congress needs to end this chaos and do our job. Border security is national security. It’s time for Democrats to stop blocking efforts to secure our Southern Border and protect our communities.  
I joined Fox News this morning to discuss the partial shutdown and what next steps are needed to get the government funded and running. 
￼ 
Watch the segment here.  
Negotiations will likely continue throughout the week. You can follow updates on my Twitter. 
WEEK IN REVIEW
￼
To start off this week's From the Front... I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nation’s capital, including Eric, Amber, Ashley and Austin Lunnen of Mountain Home, Tyler and Peggy Young of Western Grove, Phillip Bowen of Western Grove, Jennifer and Brandon Klingaman of Western Grove, Michael, Kelli, Kason, Carter, and Maci Adkins of Mountain Home, Robert and Tina Steiner of Bentonville, Ray Mary and Emma Taylor of Bentonville, and Isabella Arkin and Sophie Quandt of Bentonville. Safe travels back to the Natural State! 
Last weekend, thousands of Americans gathered across the U.S. to participate in Wreaths Across America and honor those who sacrificed for our freedom. My grandson Kaden and I laid wreaths at Fayetteville National Cemetery to thank our fallen heroes. It was very humbling to lay a wreath at the grave of one of my former UA Cadets, Todd Williams. I’m forever grateful for his service. Teaching Kaden about those lost and seeing so many Arkansans come together to remember those who gave their all was a truly moving experience. 
￼
It was a busy week. I started off in Arkansas and met with Bella Vista Mayor Peter Christie, Bella Vista Fire Chief Steve Sims, and Bella Vista Communications Manager Cassi Lapp to discuss the latest information about the Trafalgar Road stump dump fire. We then visited the site, so I could see and assess the situation firsthand. My office continues to monitor updates and support state and federal officials as an action plan is put together. On Wednesday, I had a follow-up call with the EPA, Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality, Arkansas Department of Health, Senator Boozman, and the Governor’s office to discuss additional updates related to the situation. Local and federal officials are working together to find a way to safely extinguish the fire. Resources for impacted residents can be found here: bit.ly/2QC0kZ8 
￼
There was big legislative news throughout the week. The House passed another tax reform package to further support hardworking U.S. families. The legislation improves access to retirement savings accounts, implements reforms to the IRS to increase efficiency, and frees Americans from several burdensome Obamacare taxes. Last year, Congress passed monumental tax reform that has led to a booming economy and opportunity. This bill builds on that work, and I was proud to support it.  
Historic criminal justice reform was also passed by the House and Senate, and then signed into law by President Trump. The First Step Act is an important bill that makes substantive reforms to our criminal justice system. America is the land of promise and opportunity.
￼
The First Step Act gives nonviolent, low-risk offenders that very opportunity—the opportunity for a fresh start and the chance to become productive members of society. This bipartisan legislation does so while also ensuring that dangerous and violent prisoners stay behind bars and making our communities safer. I was proud to vote in support of these important criminal justice reforms.
Additionally, President Trump signed the Farm Bill into law. This legislation will provide Arkansas farmers, ranchers, and dairy producers five years of policy certainty and stability, which will also support consumers, families, and rural communities across the U.S.

Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-GA) issued the following statement after he met with President Trump at the White House about funding for the federal government, disaster relief for Georgia, and security at our southern border:

“Today, I met with President Trump and House leadership to discuss the urgency of securing our southern border. The President agrees it is of paramount importance to end the flow of drugs, illegal weapons, human trafficking, and terrorists entering our country. I believe Congress should not leave Washington, D.C. without completing our job, and many of my Republican colleagues in the House agree we should stay in town and continue to fight for the American people.

Press Release of the Week [2 of 2]: House Passes Retirement Savings Tax Incentives, Obamacare Reforms, and Tax Relief for Disaster Victims
 
 
Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-GA) issued the following statement after the House passed the Retirement, Savings, and Other Tax Relief Act, H.R. 88: 

“This vote reaffirms House Republicans’ continued commitment to alleviate the tax burdens placed on the American taxpayer. This package of bills will provide some retirement savings tax incentives, as well as tax relief for victims of disasters, specifically hurricanes Florence and Michael, in addition to the California wildfires. Among other provisions, Republicans voted to permanently repeal the Obamacare tanning tax and delay the Obamacare medical device tax, the health insurance tax, and the Cadillac tax. This legislation also makes several technical corrections to the 2017 tax reform law, which businesses in Georgia’s 11th Congressional District desperately need, and requires the IRS to develop a customer service strategy - something I have long advocated for. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to quickly consider its importance, and how it will improve the lives of America’s hardworking taxpayers.”

THE SCALISE CAPITOL REPORT
Fighting for Border Security This Thursday, House Republicans overwhelmingly voted to support President Trump's request for border security funding to keep our country safe. We are a nation of immigrants and we are also a nation of laws. There is a legal way to come to our country, and more than 1 million people come to our country legally every year. Unfortunately, we know there are people that illegally cross our southern border and do harm to our neighbors and our country. We cannot let this continue. We need to secure the border.   I spoke on the House floor to urge support for this funding. You can watch the clip here.   While the House showed our commitment to keeping this country safe, the Senate needs to act. I am urging the Senate to quickly reach an agreement with President Trump that secures our border.   Ensuring Certainty of NFIP Millions of families across the country, and hundreds of thousands in Louisiana, depend on the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and we must ensure that there isn’t a lapse in the program. Earlier this week, I led the effort in Congress to pass legislation ensuring there wouldn’t be a lapse in the program as it faced a December 21 deadline for renewal.   I spoke on the House floor about my dedication to keeping this program running and to promoting commonsense reforms. You can watch the clip here. 
Awarding Steve Gleason the Congressional Gold Medal In Louisiana, Steve Gleason inspired all of us as a New Orleans Saint and has continued to inspire us with his bravery and service to others battling ALS. More than 5,000 people each year are diagnosed with ALS, and Steve Gleason serves as a leading voice in championing the fight against ALS. I am pleased to announce that to honor this service, Congress is awarding Steve Gleason a 2019 Congressional Gold Medal. More than 350 Members of Congress signed on to support this legislation, a sign of how powerful a mark Steve Gleason has made on this country. 
 It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more information please visit my website, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook pages.   God Bless,
￼

Dear Friend, 
I, like many Americans, am frustrated that the Senate could not come to an agreement on a spending measure late Friday night, causing a partial government shutdown. 
For years, we have promised the American people that we would fix security and manpower issues along the southern border that have allowed not only illegal immigration, but also drug, weapon and human trafficking to occur. Thankfully, the House successfully amended the Senate continuing resolution (CR) earlier in the week to include $5 billion the President has continuously requested to protect our country from criminal activity along the southern border.
I am also thankful that after a long fight we were able to amend the CR to include $7.8 billion in federal assistance to help farmers and families recover from catastrophic weather events in Georgia, Alabama, Florida, the Carolinas and California. 
Chuck Schumer seems to have two goals: First, embarrass the President no matter the cost to America, and second, protect Nancy Pelosi no matter the cost to America. 
As we continue to work through negotiations, I will press my colleagues and the White House for additional resources for disaster assistance and border security. 
  
2018 FARM BILL SIGNED INTO LAW 
After nearly five years of countless meetings, round tables, hearings and farm visits, our farmers and rural communities have an updated agriculture policy to meet the needs of today. 
The 2018 Farm Bill contains provisions to strengthen the farm safety net, prioritize research and development, improve credit programs for farmers, and develop additional risk management policies for specialty crops like peaches and pecans, among others.  
I was very honored to be at the White House for the signing of this legislation, and I thank President Trump for his support of rural Georgians and commitment to advancing policies that benefit all Americans.

Merry Christmas!
This is a season of hope and renewal – a reminder that even in the darkest days, the greatest hope can emerge.  As Christians, we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.
￼
This beautiful Constitution Christmas ornament was a gift from the Indy Defenders of Liberty. It makes a great addition to the Rokita family Christmas tree.
Celebrating Christmas has long been a part of American history and celebrated by generations of Americans.  In 1783, General George Washington resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army on December 23, so that he could be home in Mount Vernon by Christmas.  When Congress first established the first four federal holidays in 1870, Christmas was one of them.  For Hoosiers, since 1962 Monument Circle has been transformed into the ""world's largest Christmas tree.""  Christmas is a part of our fabric.
￼
My greatest blessing in life is my family - my wife Kathy and our two boys, Teddy and Ryan.
I believe strongly in the need to preserve the true purpose of Christmas as a holiday in America.  I have cosponsored legislation to protect the symbols of Christmas.  I do so because Christmas is a deep part of our Nation's culture and the traditions which are rooted in the Christian faith of our founding fathers.  Our Nation has always cherished our faith.  The Founding Fathers took Christmas seriously, as did successive generations of Americans, and so must we.
￼
Ryan was excited to meet Santa at the Indy Defenders of Liberty-West's annual Christmas party.
As you join with loved ones for Christmas, I hope you too will reflect on the season of giving and remember what Christmas is really about, the greatest gift that we could ever be given - the birth of our Savior in Christ.
And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.” (Luke 2:8-12)
From all of us in the Rokita Family, as our President says, Merry Christmas!


Sincerely,
￼

Dear Friend,  No matter how you spend the holidays, I hope this Christmas season brings peace and goodwill into your life. Inspired by the perfect savior given to imperfect people, many will find the ‘Christmas Spirit’ in their hearts and take care of the needy, volunteer at food shelters, sing Christmas carols to their neighbors, attend religious services, and find ways to spread cheer into the world. All of the acts of kindness and generosity around the world remind me that the child born in Bethlehem has touched more lives than any one person or even nation could ever dream of...KEEP READING HERE

I was thrilled to help Kingston and Lake Road Elementary Schools celebrate being named National Blue Ribbon Schools! It's a tremendous honor that was earned by only 349 schools in the nation. I presented both schools with my remarks in the U.S. House of Representatives celebrating their achievements, which will be preserved forever in the Congressional Record. 
￼  I caught up with Faune Riggin in Cape Girardeau to discuss the ongoing debate over funding border security and why I believe it's time to properly protect our country - listen here.

I donated books of every variety from the Library of Congress to the Bonne Terre Regional Library this week. One of the books was about the Chicago Cubs... I have a feeling somebody was pretty eager to get rid of that one.

Dear Friend,  Today is the one year anniversary of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act becoming law! Since its enactment, America has benefited from the strongest labor market in nearly 20 years. Over 2 million jobs have been created and our 3.7 % unemployment rate is at a 17 year low. That’s historic economic growth!  While we all filed our taxes under the old tax code this past spring, Texans have already reaped the benefits of the new tax law. Many folks received bonuses at local companies and others received higher wages or stock options. Folks have more money in the bank and more peace of mind knowing they can set some extra money aside for future emergencies. In addition, when you file your taxes this upcoming spring, most Americans will see lower rates and a simplified process – saving you both time and money! Here are a few ways the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will do just that:  Lowered Rates for All Americans - With lower rates across the board, American workers will keep more of their hard-earned income. A typical family of four earning $75,000 will see a tax cut of more than $2,000. Folks will have more money to pay bills, purchase groceries or send their kids to college.  Nearly Doubled the Standard Deduction – We increased the income tax standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples. That’s almost double the amount folks received under the old tax code!  Doubled the Child Tax Credit - We doubled the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000 and preserved both the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and the Adoption Tax Credit. Families will be able to use 529 accounts to save for elementary, secondary and higher education. This provides real relief for parents coping with the high costs of raising a family.   A Simpler Tax Filing Process – 2018 was the last year of filing your taxes under the old, complicated tax code. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is designed to help Americans file taxes in a simpler way, saving time and money. The IRS also released a withholding calculator to help you determine the correct withholding amount for you and your family.    Repealed the Obamacare Individual Mandate - The new tax law repealed the unpopular Obamacare individual mandate, which forced folks to purchase  health coverage they didn’t want, didn’t need or couldn’t afford. Folks are no longer fined if they don’t purchase these government mandated plans. Now they have the freedom to buy the health care plan they want and that is right for them and their families.  I'm honored to represent you in Congress.

A Chaotic Finale...
Dear Friend:
I appreciate you taking the time to read this brief update. It remains an honor for me to serve as your United States Representative in Washington, D.C.  I returned to Washington this past Wednesday, along with my Congressional colleagues, to conclude the work of the 115th Congress. While we also passed other important legislation this week – more on that below – our primary reason to return was to complete our work on the Federal Government’s 2019 fiscal year appropriations.  As you probably have heard from news reports, a handful of federal agencies were funded on a Continuing Resolution scheduled to expire on December 21st. These agencies represent about 25% of annual federal discretionary funding. Congress did provide on-time, full-year funding for the departments of Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Labor, Veterans Affairs, and Congressional operations. So far so good, but then events took some surprising twists.   On Wednesday, December 19th, just prior to the expiration of the Continuing Resolution, the Senate decided to “punt” by extending the Continuing Resolution to February 8, 2019. While this would have avoided a partial government shutdown, my view is that we should focus on passing final appropriation bills – not continuing resolutions. The job of the 115th Congress is to complete the 2019 appropriation process. Pushing this into next year means that the 116th Congress will be delayed in getting started on 2020 appropriations and will instead have to spend time and effort dealing with matters that this Congress should have resolved.  The primary reason for this failure was a dispute between the President and my Democratic colleagues over how much to appropriate to the Department of Homeland Security to construct additional fencing and other security measures on our southern border. The President wanted $5 billion in funding for this program, while my Democratic colleagues were only willing to provide $1.6 billion. When the Senate bill arrived in the House, we amended it to add the $5 billion for border security, plus another $8 billion for disaster relief to assist the victims of the California fires and the hurricane in Florida.    I voted for the amended version of the Continuing Resolution presented to the House even though it was not, as I noted above, my first choice. I voted for it because when presented with an “either-or” choice of pass the resolution or shut down the government, my priority is to keep the government open so that it can continue to serve the American people.  I do not know what the right dollar amount is for the U.S. to spend right now on improving the security of its southern border. What I do know is that it is our job in Congress (and for the President) to work out reasonable compromises of our differences and focus on taking care of our country and its citizens. The unwillingness of either my Democratic colleagues or the President to bend even a bit is deeply troubling to me. If this is the state of affairs today, I worry about how partisan positioning will impact the ability of the 116th Congress to function in 2019 and 2020. So at the time of this writing, I remain in Washington waiting for House and Senate leadership to come to some sort of an agreement with the President so we can vote on a final bill to fund the government for 2019. This is not the way I had planned to spend the Christmas holiday or to end my time as your representative in Congress.  On a more positive note, while we were back here in Washington this week we passed, on a bipartisan basis, the First Step Act. This bill takes some significant steps toward altering the federal criminal justice system by easing overly punitive federal prison sentences. This legislation only affects the federal system that currently incarcerates about 180,000 out the total U.S. jail and prison population of 2.1 million. However, if these reforms do successfully decrease recidivism, I would expect the states to adopt similar policies. If we can reduce the number of people we imprison without an increase in rates of criminal activity that will represent a major accomplishment. I look forward to seeing how these reforms work. This bill is on its way to the President for his signature.  The House also passed this week the Retirement, Savings, and Other Tax Relief Act and the Taxpayer First Act. This 253-page bill includes tax-related disaster relief, technical tax corrections, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reform, retirement savings measures, and a delay of certain healthcare related taxes. Many of the reforms in this bill are designed to make it easier and simpler for you to deal with the IRS.  Finally, I invite you to stay in contact with me via my website, Facebook or Twitter. See you around the district! 
Sincerely, 
￼

Congressman Smith's E-news: December 22, 2018  
￼  I was honored to fill out holiday cards for our men and women in uniform as part of the American Red Cross's Holidays for Heroes program.    
Merry Christmas   As we prepare to join our families for Christmas, I am reminded of so many things we should be thankful for. This year will be our second Christmas with our young son, Zeke. Much of what I do in Washington is motivated by a desire to leave a healthy country for coming generations to inherit.   When I listen to former President Ronald Reagan’s speeches, it is clear he was motivated by the same feelings. He always appealed for unity with a positive disposition, but he never shied away from directly addressing the American people.  President Reagan understood the importance of fiscal discipline, family values, and the American embrace of freedom. As is my tradition, I would like to share with you one of his speeches which holds the same truths as it did in 1981 when he gave it.   I wish your family a Merry Christmas and a very Happy New Year.    President Ronald Reagan Radio Address to the Nation  December 23, 1981   Tonight, in millions of American homes, the glow of the Christmas tree is a reflection of the love Jesus taught us.  Like the shepherds and wise men of that first Christmas, we Americans have always tried to follow a higher light, a star, if you will.  At lonely campfire vigils along the frontier, in the darkest days of the Great Depression, through war and peace, the twin beacons of faith and freedom have brightened the American sky.  At times our footsteps may have faltered, but trusting in God's help, we've never lost our way. ... Like the National Christmas Tree, our country is a living, growing thing planted in rich American soil.  Only our devoted care can bring it to full flower.  So, let this holiday season be for us a time of rededication.  Even as we rejoice, however, let us remember that for some Americans, this will not be as happy a Christmas as it should be.  I know a little of what they feel.  I remember one Christmas Eve during the Great Depression, my father opening what he thought was a Christmas greeting.  It was a notice that he no longer had a job.  Over the past year, we've begun the long, hard work of economic recovery.  Our goal is an America in which every citizen who needs and wants a job can get a job. ... A few months before he took up residence in this house, one of my predecessors, John Kennedy, tried to sum up the temper of the times with a quote from an author closely tied to Christmas, Charles Dickens.  We were living, he said, in the best of times and the worst of times.  Well, in some ways that's even more true today.  The world is full of peril, as well as promise.  Too many of its people, even now, live in the shadow of want and tyranny. ... Once, earlier in this century, an evil influence threatened that the lights were going out all over the world.  Let the light of millions of candles in American homes give notice that the light of freedom is not going to be extinguished.  We are blessed with a freedom and abundance denied to so many.  Let those candles remind us that these blessings bring with them a solid obligation, an obligation to the God who guides us, an obligation to the heritage of liberty and dignity handed down to us by our forefathers and an obligation to the children of the world, whose future will be shaped by the way we live our lives today. ... Christmas means so much because of one special child.  But Christmas also reminds us that all children are special, that they are gifts from God, gifts beyond price that mean more than any presents money can buy.  In their love and laughter, in our hopes for their future lies the true meaning of Christmas. 
Sincerely,
￼

December 22, 2018


WE MUST SECURE OUR BORDER The crisis we face at our southern border is a national security issue. Nancy Pelosi Democrats have decided that keeping our borders open is more important than keeping the American people safe and our government open. I supported the funding bill because it fully funds President Trump’s $5 billion request for border security. The national security of our country can’t wait any longer.
The House has done its job to make America safer. Now it’s up to the Senate. 
KEEPING IHS DOORS OPEN DURING A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN This week, I introduced the Pay Our Doctors Bill to keep IHS' doors open despite the potential for a government shutdown. Congress needs to stop putting Native Americans’ health care in the crossfire of political spending fights. The Pay Our Doctors Act is a good start. Learn more about the bill on my website.  
REAUTHORIZING THE STATE OFFICES OF RURAL HEALTH Rural hospitals are closing their doors at an alarming rate. Eighty-five rural hospitals have closed since 2010, and 673 are vulnerable to closure. More closures are coming and Congress needs to start making changes to ensure that rural Americans have the healthcare they need. My bill, the State Offices of Rural Health Reauthorization Act, will help Oklahoma rural hospitals keep their doors open and continue to improve and build on the quality care they provide their patients. The bill is now on its way to be signed by the president. I spoke on my bill before it passed the House floor. Watch on my YouTube page.  
￼
STIGLER ACT AMENDMENTS HEADS TO PRESIDENT'S DESK The Stigler Act Amendments passed the House this week. Land that is handed down from generation to generation in Native American families is a part of our culture. It is what allows families like mine to continually pass their family’s history on to the next generation. The members of the Five Tribes deserve the right to hand down their history without blood quantum requirements—just like members of every other tribe can. I was proud to work with Congressman Tom Cole to get this bill across the finish line. On to the president's desk! 
OK IN DC It was great to have Kim Teehee of the Cherokee Nation visit the office this week for the passage of the Stigler Act Amendments.  
￼
 
￼
Enjoyed having the Shaddix Family of Verdigris in town!
WEEKLY WRAP-UP Since Congress has not completed its work to fund the remaining 25 percent of the government, our work this week is not done. I will continue to update you about Congress's efforts to fund the government on my Facebook and Twitter pages.   
THE RETURN OF THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT It’s hard to remember a time when the real meaning of Christmas was the same as what the world was celebrating.  By and large, Christmas as we know it is about giving and receiving presents, Santa coming to town, and the commercialization that comes along with it.
Somewhere along the way, we lost the true spirit of Christmas.  Between giving the perfect gift and getting everything on our list, we forgot the real meaning of Christmas.  Christmas—as it should be—got lost in the noise.
Matthew 1:21 tells us: “And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins.”  The true meaning of Christmas is the celebration of the Lord Jesus Christ who was born to this earth to save sinners like us. 
For the last two years, I have been wished Merry Christmas, rather than Happy Holidays, by the President of the United States.  The war on Christmas is over.  And in turn, Americans are free to say Merry Christmas again, without political correctness getting in the way.  We are free to celebrate our faith in God, just as are others are free to practice their religion. 
The miraculous birth of Jesus Christ calls us to rejoice.  This Christmas, my family will partake in the celebration of the real spirit of Christmas.  “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life (John 3:16).” 
On behalf of the entire Mullin family, I want to wish you and your family a very, Merry Christmas.

Congressional Report

Dear Friends, 

This week, I met with various individuals and organizations, including a meeting with the President of the Texas Farm Bureau. I was also named Chief Deputy Whip for the 116th Congress, a great leadership opportunity that I am looking forward to. 

In the district, my staff attended several events including the Atascosa County Justice Center ribbon cutting ceremony, the Baptist Health Foundation grant presentation, and more. My Outreach Coordinators also presented several Congressional Certificates of Recognition to different outstanding constituents throughout the area.  

I have also included a video from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that details ways you can ensure your pets' safety this holiday season. 

As always, please contact one of my offices if you need assistance with any federal agency. 

Lastly, I hope you join my staff and I for a Swearing-In Ceremony and New Office Open House on Thursday, January 3, 2019. 

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!

The Trump Shutdown is  Bad for Our Country
A MESSAGE FROM CONGRESSMAN STENY H. HOYER   
I am extremely disappointed that President Trump and Congressional Republicans forced a partial government shutdown. Not only is the chaos and uncertainty of a government shutdown bad for our country, it jeopardizes thousands of federal employees, many of whom live in the Fifth District.  
For the second time in a calendar year, Republicans have shut down the government of the United States. This cynical ploy, just days before Christmas, is extremely irresponsible. Republicans still control all levers of government. If they are serious about ending the shutdown, they will work with Democrats to find consensus. I urge my Republican colleagues to end this irresponsible shutdown and work with Democrats to reopen the government as soon as possible.  
My office will be open to help residents of Maryland's Fifth Congressional District to the best of our ability during the Trump shutdown. Please do not hesitate to reach out should you need assistance.  
As always, I encourage all Fifth District residents to continue to share their concerns and insights with me by contacting my office or connecting with me on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.    
Sincerely Yours,   ￼  Steny H. Hoyer

Thank You and a Look Back: Tomorrow, I head back to Washington, and it remains to be seen if a deal will emerge with regards to passing the remaining spending bills before funding expires this Friday. I’ll have more on that later, but I wanted to take minute to say the obvious…it’s been an honor to represent you in Congress and to attempt to advance the ideals of limited government and personal freedom while there. I’ve tried my very best to do these things, and my team put together what follows as a synopsis of our collective endeavors on your behalf. Indeed, the operative questions of leadership at any inflection point lie in what does it mean and where do we go from here and this piece at some levels represents our office's attempt to answer those questions.

What they put together is, in essence, a footprint of the thousands of hours invested over the last five years in trying to represent the people of the Lowcountry and the principles of limited government. The legislative review is broken down into the five sections that represent the focal points of our efforts. Click here to read more.

December 19
                               
Suspension Votes are Supposed to be Noncontroversial: Tonight, we had a series of ten suspension votes whose topics ranged from fisheries management to educational programs on heart disease. At the bottom of this vote description, I have included each of the bill numbers, names, and sponsors - and how I voted.
So as to avoid a twelve-page post in describing these votes, let me give you a little overview of at least my thinking on suspension votes like these. Suspension votes are non-controversial votes that have an expedited path to the floor. As a consequence, they require a two-thirds vote rather than the simple majority usually required on votes.
Because they are non-controversial, many of the T’s that normally get crossed are looked over - and this phenomenon goes on steroids as you get to the closing days of a session. And that’s obviously where we are.
Structurally, my concerns over these votes fell into four categories.... Click here to read more.

December 20  Government Funding Debate: Just a quick update to let you know what I know as I know it….
Last night’s votes went late, and it looks like that was just a precursor to the way that votes will go today.
There are three things at play that I think will very much impact the day and today’s voting schedule.
First, it’s the end of session, and given that whatever time we have remaining represents the last train leaving the station in carrying legislative ideas forward, a lot gets added here at the end. This creates its own time drag.
Two, we’re now in for a fight. I wouldn’t have said this yesterday, but after stepping out of an hour and a half long conference meeting a bit ago, it certainly seems to reflect the mood of the majority of Republican Conference members. Click here to read more. 
￼
December 21  Getting Philosophical After a Successful Surgery: How about a strange and rather philosophic post here at the end of a long Friday?
I say this because we are now in hurry-up-and-wait-mode here at the capitol. There is a tug of war on funding for the wall in the continuing resolution versus no funding for the wall. I’m here with about 400 other members waiting to see what negotiations bare over the hours ahead. We’re in complete limbo for the evening. And so while I wish I could give you an update on what’s going to come next, that will certainly not come until tomorrow…if it comes then.
So let me go back to the strange and philosophical.
I say that because it has been a long week at many different levels. Over the last few days, we have actually set records with regard to the number of recorded votes outside of amendments to appropriation bills. It’s been a grind trying to keep up with all of the different topics covered in each of these bills, but that seems to be the season that we’re in right now.
It’s also becoming a long week given all the explosions on the Hill that have ranged from the Gen. Mattis resignation to the looming government shutdown that will likely come at midnight.
But, in my case, it’s also been a long week, given I spent last Friday at MUSC undergoing a heart procedure. Click here to read more.

Dear Friends, 
There has been a lot going on in our neck of the woods of Wisconsin, and I wanted to take a moment to share some of the latest news with you!
 Top Five In The Nation...Number One In Our Hearts 
There are a lot of reasons to be proud to be from Wisconsin; it's hands down the best place to work, raise a family, or vacation in the country.  But we're also leaders when it comes to Christmas tree production! That means that Wisconsin continues to bring joy to families across the country this season.

 Our Nation Deserves Border Security 
At my recent townhall meeting at Northcentral Technical College in Antigo, I discussed the need for our nation to have a secure border. 
There are too many families across our nation who have lost loved ones because of the meth and heroin that pours over our southern border.  In fact, at a recent Law Enforcement Roundtable, Wisconsin law enforcement leaders told me that even though our state is more than 1,000 miles away from Mexico, more than 90% of the meth and heroin in our community can be traced back to Mexico.  This is unacceptable. Click HERE to watch a short interview with Eau Claire's Channel 18 about the need for border security. 
￼ 
 More Town Halls! 
Not only did we have a productive townhall meeting in Antigo, but it was great to chat with folks in Eagle River and Medford as well. It's important that we routinely get the opportunity to discuss the issues face to face.

A secure border is part of the 
fight against the opioid crisis 


Our government was founded for one purpose: to fulfill the charges set forth in the Constitution, “. . .establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty.” 

Lawmakers take an oath to the Constitution. We fail in our sworn duty if we refuse to ensure the sovereignty, security, and well-being of this nation through secure borders.
 
     
￼

On an otherwise calm August morning I sat in the Clermont County Courthouse listening to the devastating story of a local couple who had struggled to save both their lives and the lives of their children as they wrestled with the throes of addiction. Their stories started as so many do, from childhood exposure to drug abuse, or a workplace injury that led to a deadly addiction, and then the desperate lengths they would go to, putting themselves and their children in danger for the next fix. Fortunately, for the couple I spoke to, they found treatment and successfully broke from the intense grip of addiction.
Many Ohio families are not so lucky. The Cincinnati Enquirer won a Pulitzer Prize for their piece documenting a week tracking the opioid crisis in southern Ohio. They found there at least 180 overdoses, 18 overdose deaths, and 15 babies born with heroin-related medical problems were reported in our Southern Ohio counties in just one week. Our backyard has been ground zero for the opioid epidemic. The book Dreamland: The True Tale of America’s Opiate Epidemic, by Sam Quinones, tells the story of how opioids devastated the city of Portsmouth, located in Ohio’s 2nd Congressional District.
The very detailed book tracks the flow of drugs from Xalisco, Mexico, to Ohio — a route that had surprisingly no obstacles for drug traffickers and dealers. It talks about cartels using customer service to “ deliver just like pizza delivery.” Drug dealers would prey on the most vulnerable, waiting outside of treatment centers to tempt people on shaky ground early in their recovery back into addiction.
The claims in the book about the origins of the drugs are supported by the Council on Foreign Relations, which estimates that “most of the heroin coming into the United States is cultivated on poppy farms in Mexico, with eight cartels controlling production and operating distribution hubs in major U.S. cities.” They also estimate that “most fentanyl coming into the United States is produced in China, and commonly transited through Mexico.”
U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported just three years ago that 99.8 percent of methamphetamine seized in the U.S. came through the southern border. Burying our heads in the sand will not solve this urgent problem.
To truly curb the flow of illicit drugs into our community, we must secure our border. Some have said that a wall would not stop drug traffic. But the wall is just one component used to describe an all-of-the-above approach to border security, from physical barriers, to surveillance technology, to increased personnel patrolling the border and ports of entry.
I have always believed that there is not a single solution to complex problems, but rather multi-faceted solutions needed to combat problems on multiple fronts. Increased border security will not be a magic bullet. It will not stop every drug lord from trafficking drugs and people over the border, but it will help curb the flow. It is not the single solution, but rather one of many important solutions. Earlier this year Congress passed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6), a comprehensive package of bills targeted toward advancing treatment and recovery initiatives, improving addiction prevention, protecting our communities, and bolstering efforts to fight deadly synthetic drugs like fentanyl. This was an important effort to help fight the opioid crisis. However, securing the border is a step we cannot skip.
Sadly, gridlock in Washington has stopped any possible progress toward securing the border. To date, the solutions proposed by Democrats have been to leave the status quo, which is effectively no solution at all, or to fully advocate for open borders. Open borders would make the situation worse and would welcome even more drugs and violence across the border.
Funding for border security shouldn’t be about a political point. This should be about keeping Americans safe, keeping illicit drugs out of our country, protecting families, and our precious lives. 
This is the first installment of a four part series on border security.

Part 3: Border Security Is National Security
Part 4: The Health Implications of an Unsecure Border

Approaching Health Care in the Upcoming Congress
Just last week a federal court declared all of Obamacare unconstitutional. I know many read about the ruling and wondered what it means for them. The short answer is that nothing changes for next year. Obamacare is still in effect, except the individual mandate has been repealed so there’s no fine if you choose not to buy a government-approved plan. If you are currently covered by an Obamacare policy, this ruling won’t affect you. Long-term – if the ruling is upheld on appeal – this could be the catalyst that brings the two parties together to get a workable, bipartisan health care solution that provides affordable access to quality, patient-centered health coverage. 
Why did the federal court overturn the law? When the Supreme Court upheld Obamacare in 2012, the majority argued that Obamacare’s enforcement mechanism to require people to purchase insurance – the individual mandate – was a tax. While I disagreed with that ruling at the time, the judge in this case said that because this fine was repealed, the rest of Obamacare – which for the first time compels U.S. citizens to purchase a product – was unconstitutional. Americans will no longer be forced to buy a product they can’t afford – or don’t want – or face a tax penalty if they go without. Obamacare has resulted in taxpayers, at state and federal levels, paying more to fund government health care programs, and it needs to be replaced. 
If you have a pre-existing condition, I think it’s important you know something else: both parties agree that protections are needed to ensure these folks can access affordable health coverage. I think a better alternative to Obamacare would be extending the same protections that exist for employer-sponsored health plans to the individual and small group markets, where many small businesses purchase their health insurance. Before the enactment of Obamacare, if you had a pre-existing condition and a plan through your employer, you were able to get affordable health insurance. Folks in the individual and small group markets should have that same sense of security.  
Another approach we can take to make health care coverage affordable is to allow people to purchase their plans across state lines, which will spur competition, thereby lowering cost. These are just a few suggestions, and I hope the incoming Democrat majority will seriously consider these ideas to come up with alternatives that do a better job of keeping health insurance affordable. 
In the upcoming Congress, we need to start with a clean slate where both parties come together to craft a bipartisan plan that works for all Americans. I hope Democrats will recognize that many Tennesseans see Obamacare as a failure because average premiums have risen by 176 percent since the law went into effect. For the past three Congresses I’ve introduced the American Health Care Reform Act, a comprehensive bill that would have replaced Obamacare with free-market competition in our health care system. I think many of the ideas included in this legislation – which included protections for people with pre-existing conditions – deserve bipartisan support. But I’ve said it before and will say it again: health care isn’t a Republican or Democrat issue, it’s a people issue. If the court ruling stands, I hope we can put partisan politics aside and fix the very real problems that exist in the health care market.  
As a physician, there is nothing that I want more than for every individual to have access to affordable health care. I believe if Congress can work together we can find a path forward that works for both sides of the aisle, and every American. I will continue reaching out to Tennesseans, listening to their concerns and working across the aisle to find better health care solutions.  

Feel free to contact my office if I can be of assistance to you or your family.

12/22/18 9:48,Latest from Lamar: Thanking Tennessee for giving me the privilege to serve our state ,"

If you are having trouble viewing this message or would like to share it on a social network, you can view the message online.￼
￼
￼ ￼ ￼ ￼
The people of Tennessee have been very generous in electing me to serve more combined years as Governor and Senator than anyone else from our state. I am deeply grateful, but as Ecclesiastes teaches us, there is a time for everything. And now after three terms as our state’s Senator and two terms as governor, it is time for someone else to have that privilege.
I have gotten up every day thinking that I could help make our state and country a little better and have gone to bed most nights thinking that I have. I will continue to serve with that same spirit during the remaining two years of my term. When I was governor, 80 percent of my best work for Tennesseans was done in my second term, when everybody knew I was leaving. So I have two more years as chairman of two Senate committees that are important to Tennessee, and in that time, I intend to get results.
On Sunday night, I called President Trump at the White House. He called me right back and the first thing he said was, ""Let's talk about you running for the Senate for another 20 years."" I said, ""Mr. President, I'm actually calling to tell you that I'm not going to run for reelection in 2020."" The president congratulated me and said we'll find some things to work together on. I look forward to working with him over the next two years to continue get results for Tennessee.
 
￼
 
 
For the last eight years, Governor Bill Haslam’s example, actions, and leadership have made all of us look and feel a little better about being from Tennessee. I enjoyed being at his portrait unveiling this week.
 
 
 
President Trump signs legislation I sponsored to prevent preterm births  
This week, President Trump signed into law the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act -- legislation I sponsored that will reduce infant deaths and improve infant health by continuing research and education programs aimed at preventing preterm births. In Tennessee, about 11 percent of babies are born preterm. Since it was first signed into law in 2006, this legislation has helped improve our understanding of premature births and support health care professionals caring for these infants. This new law will give more babies the chance at long and healthy lives.
 
President Trump signs farm bill that will help 340,000 Tennessee farmers
President Trump signed an important law on Thursday that will provide much-needed certainty to Tennessee’s 340,000 farmers. Agriculture is one of Tennessee’s most important industries, with more than 66,000 farms contributing approximately $74 billion each year to our state’s economy. This bill supports agriculture, rural development, and conservation programs that benefit farmers across Tennessee, as well as agricultural research at Tennessee’s universities to help find ways for farmers to grow better crops. This new law will also help provide much-needed certainty to farmers in Tennessee and across the country, which is one of the reasons it is supported by the Tennessee agriculture community -- including the Tennessee Farm Bureau, Tennessee Soybean Association, Tennessee Cattlemen’s Association, Tennessee Farmer’s Cooperative, and other agriculture and conservation groups.
Included in the Farm bill that was signed into law this week was the Tennessee Wilderness Act -- legislation that will protect 20,000 acres of federal land in the Cherokee National Forest as “wilderness,” where Tennesseans can roam and enjoy nature. This is land in East Tennessee that's already managed as wilderness, but not made a part of the wilderness law. Designation as wilderness will not only better protect ecosystems and watersheds, but also benefit the diverse recreational value of these areas, which is a crucial part of East Tennessee’s economy.
 
￼
 
 It was good to have U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary, Sonny Perdue, and Acting Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Andrew Wheeler, in Lebanon this week to highlight the importance of the Trump administration’s new proposed Waters of the U.S. rule that would end the Obama administration’s excessive regulation on waters, streams, and wetlands.
 
Making it easier for students and families to apply for federal student aid
The former president of Southwest Community College in Memphis once told me he believes that he loses 1,500 students each semester because of the complexity of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Over and over families have asked me, “I’ve already given most of this information to the federal government when I paid my taxes, why do I have to do it again? Once is enough.” I agree. This week, the U.S. Senate passed legislation I sponsored that will make completing the complicated FAFSA much easier for students and families -- allowing them to answer up to 22 questions on the form with one simple click, while securing the applicant’s data. It is my hope that the House of Representatives swiftly passes this legislation.
 
￼
Last month, I visited Sevier County High School with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to show students and local guidance counselors how to use the new phone application that makes it easier for students to apply for federal and state financial aid.
Improving the federal criminal justice system and reforming federal prisons
The Senate and House passed and President Trump signed bipartisan legislation this week that will help improve the federal criminal justice system and reform federal prisons. This legislation will take some important first steps to help non-violent offenders re-enter their communities and reduce the likelihood that they would commit another crime. I commend President Trump, Chairman Chuck Grassley, and Jared Kushner for their leadership in passing this legislation.

12/22/18 9:36,A Year In Review ,"￼
￼

As the 115th Congressional Session draws to a close, it's exciting to look back on all that we have accomplished. 
￼
A Year In Review 
In my office, we’re dedicated to serving our constituents any way we can. This year, we’ve hosted 2,823 constituents in our DC office, flown 96 flags over the capitol building, and have given 694 capitol tours. Be it by phone call, email or letter, we’ve responded over 60,200 times to constituent comments and inquires this Congress, including over 24,000 in 2018 alone. On top of that, my tireless caseworkers have helped 1,268 constituents with casework. What a year! 
￼
115th Congress By The Numbers 
Under Republican leadership, the 115th Congress had an extremely productive session. Collectively, we’ve passed 1,135 bills out of committee, which is 343 more bills than the congressional average. On the floor, we’ve passed 1,011 bills out of the House, which is 279 more bills than average. Of these 1,011 bills, 245 have been signed into law; and I’m proud to have sponsored four and co-sponsored ten. 

￼
Rep. Brady speaks at a joint press conference with Speaker Ryan.
ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT 
On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law. When I first introduced this bill, my goals were simple: cut taxes for the middle-class, simplify our unfair and broken tax code and make America the most competitive place in the world to do business.  
One year later, it is clear these goals have been accomplished. Our new tax code is simple and allows hardworking Americans— not Washington— to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks. Small businesses are thriving, consumer optimism is at record-highs and the economy is booming in a way we haven’t seen in decades. Workers are seeing higher wages and decreased unemployment, and families are taking advantage of increased deductions and the ability to save for retirement earlier. There can be no question the Republican led tax reform altered the trajectory of the American economy for the better. Simply put, our nation is winning again.
￼
REBUILDING AFTER HURRICANE HARVEY
Hurricane Harvey was one of the most devastating storms in history, and the damage was felt by the residents of the Eighth Congressional District and our neighbors. The storm left thousands of Texans homeless and without resources, and 88 Texans lost their lives. In the aftermath, Texans came together to rebuild and recover. In Washington, the Texas Delegation worked to deliver the quickest disaster relief in history, and in just six months we were able to provide $146 billion in relief funding. My team and I were on the ground and witnessed first-hand the incredible outpouring of love and support, not only from fellow Texans, but from folks all across the country. Looking back, what I remember most is the resilient and unbreakable spirit of all Texans and a state that truly showed what it means to be #TexasStrong.
CUTTING RED-TAPE
Throughout the 115th congress, I’ve been dedicated to protecting America’s businesses and hardworking people. As part of our fight to reduce Washington’s regulatory burdens, Republicans have repealed 17 burdensome regulations from the previous administration, which have saved the U.S. economy over $4 billion (Leader McCarthy, American Action Forum). Just this month, the Administration also announced that regulatory reform efforts have saved American families and business $23 billion in fiscal year 2018—even more good news. 
SUPPORT FOR MILITARY AND VETERANS
For the first time since 2008, Congress and the Administration worked together to fully fund our military – on time. This appropriations bill increased funding to every branch, boosted troop levels, provided dedicated funding for equipment maintenance and gave our service men and women the largest pay raise in nine years. In addition, President Trump made it clear that supporting our Veterans is a top priority, and I agree. I am proud to report that the 115th Congress has prioritized legislation impacting our Veterans. In fact, the House passed more than seventy Veterans bills—over twenty of which have been signed into law by President Trump—to improve the care and services provided to our Veterans. This included legislation to improve accountability and whistleblower protections at the VA, improve veterans’ Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA), and expand veterans’ access to community care. Measures like these are crucial for national defense and ensure the brave men and women serving our nation have our full support.
COMBATTING THE OPIOID CRISIS
In response to the opioid crisis, Congress put aside party politics and came together to provide necessary support to communities who are struggling. The Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act was a bipartisan bill signed into law by the President that took an important first step in defeating the opioid crisis once and for all. By expanding treatment resources, educating folks on the dangers of opioids and stopping the flow of synthetic opioids into our country, the SUPPORT act will save lives and make towns across the country safer.
LOOKING FORWARD…
We’ve accomplished a lot in the 115th Congress—but there is still more work to be done. As we head into the new year and new Congress, I look forward to working with my colleagues to address the critical issues facing our nation, and as the Ranking Member on the House Committee on Ways and Means, I remain committed to fighting for the hardworking folks of the Eighth Congressional District of Texas and for American workers all across the nation.

I'm always interested in hearing about which issues matter to you most, so please consider filling out this survey.

From my family to yours, I wish you a Merry Christmas and a happy and healthy New Year. 

Thank you and God Bless,

The suicide rate among veterans is twice that of the general population – 20 vets a day take their own lives. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs was allocated $6 million to address the problem through outreach and prevention. How much did it spend? Less than 1 percent, $57,000. 
Why? “bureaucratic confusion” according to a new report by the General Accounting Office.

Vern Buchanan furious at Veterans Affairs inattention to stopping suicides  Jacob Ogles 
U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan demanded answers why the Department of Veterans Affairs spent less than 1 percent of its suicide prevention funding this year. 
Buchanan wrote a letter to Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie, calling it “unacceptable and disgraceful” for the agency to ignore a crisis. 
“Of the 20 veterans who commit suicide on a daily basis, it is estimated that 14 of those individuals have had little or no contact with the VA in the months preceding their death,” Buchanan wrote.
“This demonstrates that the VA must dramatically improve its outreach to those veterans who are not taking advantage of the department’s mental health services and exactly why Congress allocated funds for this purpose.” 
The Government Accountability Office yesterday released a report showing the VA spent just $57,000 out of $6.2 million set aside for suicide prevention in 2018. 
There’s been a sharp decline over the past two years in spending on the effort, something officials at the VA attributed on the GAO report to “not having leadership available for a period of time to make decisions about the suicide prevention media outreach campaign.”
There’s been sharp declines in spending over the past two years, in particular in the first 10 months of 2018. 
Most of the spending has gone to publicize a suicide prevention hotline. Wilkie did release a message across media platforms in August, Suicide Prevention Month, encouraging veterans to take advantage of mental health services.
“Ultimately, whether Veterans choose VA, or get care or support from a peer, or a community agency, there is no wrong door when it comes to saving lives,” Wilkie wrote then. “Preventing Veterans suicide is a top priority for VA, the Department of Defense and this administration. Our goal is to prevent suicide among all Veterans, including those who may not receive care from us.”
But Buchanan said the failure to devote more resources to preventing suicides proved disturbing, especially considering Wilkie had proclaimed suicide prevention to be such a priority. 
“As you are undoubtedly aware, an astonishing 20 veterans a day commit suicide, accounting for 18 percent of all suicides nationwide,” Buchanan wrote in his letter to Wilkie.
“Among veterans younger than 35, the number of suicides has increased dramatically in recent years. These statistics are not only heartbreaking; they are downright inexcusable.” 
Florida’s 16th Congressional District, which Buchanan represents, includes a high percentage of veterans, so programs to help veterans have been a priority for the Sarasota Republican.
Buchanan said stopping veteran suicides remains a top priority of his, and he expects the department tasked with caring for veterans’ health to focus on the issue as well. 
The congressman requested Wilkie provide a report before Congress reconvenes on Jan. 3 offering a written explanation “as to how these failures were allowed to take place and what you will be doing going forward to ensure that they do not occur again on your watch.”

Tax Reform: One Year Later
Dear Friend, 
One year ago today, Congress passed and the President signed into law the first comprehensive tax reform legislation in nearly 31 years.  This much-needed relief has given hard-working Kentuckians the ability to keep more of their paychecks, simplified the code by eliminating special interest loopholes, and made our businesses more competitive.  
￼ 
More Opportunities through Economic Growth:

PROGRESS FOR OUR WATERWAYS!
￼ 
Lindsey - 
The federal government, through the Army Corps of Engineers, has played a huge role in perpetuating the human health crisis caused by Lake Okeechobee discharges and they need to take responsibility for the damage by helping to pay for the cleanup. 
This week we made big progress to do exactly that: 
Congress passed my bill to make federal funding available to communities impacted by harmful algal blooms and ensure the continuation of a federal program aimed at combating harmful algal blooms. In total, the bill authorizes more than $100 million to be spent to combat harmful algal blooms. Now, states and local governments will be able to access federal resources when Harmful Algal Blooms have a detrimental impact on a state's environment, economy or public health! 
Our coalition fighting for clean water also grew substantially this week as I helped lead a group of more than 60 Members of Congress in lobbying the Administration for full funding of programs designed to combat toxic algal blooms. Securing these resources is essential, especially as we move toward construction of the EAA Southern Storage Reservoir and other projects! 
Finally, after increasing the size of the Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge to increase the land and habitats that are protected, we also voted to rename the area after environmentalist Nathaniel Reed, who passed away in July. He led conservation fights throughout the United States and was one of our state's most influential environmental leaders.
The government needs to stop prioritizing special interests over human health and put an end to the crisis once and for all! Our bipartisan progress this week will help deliver the federal resources needed to end this environmental disaster. To hear more, watch this week's Week In Review video:

 Merry Christmas
Normally at Christmas, I take time to reflect upon the previous year. However, this year Congress will adjourn, rather than recess for Christmas, marking the end of the 115th Congress. I’d like to take a look at the past two years, my 4th term on Capitol Hill.
It’s no secret that the past two years in Washington have been some of the most tumultuous in history, certainly since I’ve been here. Following a bitter election, there has been gridlock, vitriol, and setbacks, but all things considered, it’s been a remarkably productive two years. The 115thCongress rolled back disastrous and burdensome regulations, implemented financial reforms that increase market liquidity, and passed the most sweeping reforms to our tax code in a generation. 
On a personal level, I finished my first term on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. While I cannot discuss my work on the committee in depth, I have thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of overseeing the Intelligence Community. This Congress, I also became the Chair of the Congressional Steel Caucus, which develops and implements policies to protect the American steel industry from our adversaries who are intent on destroying it. Cooperating with the Administration, we have given the steel industry the policy support it needs to compete in its own domestic market against price dumpers and trade abusers. While I have enjoyed becoming involved in new issues in Congress, I got my start with Agriculture, and it will always hold a special place in my heart. As a member of the Agriculture Committee, and a member of the Farm Bill conference committee, I helped draft, refine, and pass the Farm Bill recently signed into law by President Trump. In a time of foreign hostility, uncertain markets, and bad weather, farmers can rest assured that the support programs that have existed for generations have been strengthened and will continue. American farmers feed the world, and the Farm Bill just signed by President Trump will enable them to continue to do so.
My next Congress will be my first in the minority. While I wish my party had fared better in the midterms, I am optimistic about the future and am honored to continue to represent the First District of Arkansas. The place we call home truly is a cross section of America. We have great industry, great agriculture, and great people. This Christmas, I am content knowing that steel workers don’t have to fear low-quality foreign steel being sold below market price on our shores, that farmers can finish this season and prepare for the next knowing that a farm bill is in place, and that hardworking parents across Eastern Arkansas have more money in their take home pay each month, making this Christmas easier financially.
I’d like to thank you once again for allowing me to represent you in Washington. From my family to yours, I wish you a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year.

The Hill
Farm bill’s expansion of trade opportunities between the US and Cuba historic and mutually beneficial
A natural next step for Congress is to remove financing restrictions on U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba, and we have introduced legislation in the House and Senate to do just that. Although Arkansas rice, poultry and soybeans are only a few hundred miles away, Cuba has little choice but to purchase more expensive and lower quality goods from countries like Vietnam and New Zealand. Estimates show the U.S. could capture at least half of Cuba’s total agriculture market if the cash-in-advance requirement were removed. Our farmers deserve access to nearby markets, just as the Cuban people deserve the ability to stock their shelves with high-quality U.S. food.

Western Farm Press
Officials laud passage of Farm Bill
The Congressional Western Caucus offered the following comments from some of its members:
Rep. Rick Crawford (AR): ""For too long, rural America has been left behind as the rest of the nation moves forward. The farm bill is important for those engaged in production agriculture but also includes key provisions that address issues facing our rural communities, such as the opioid crisis, food deserts, and broadband access. This legislation is a resounding commitment from this Congress to rural constituencies that we recognize their needs and delivers on our promises to farmers and ranchers across America. The Farm Bill ensures our farmers and ranchers can continue to produce a reliable food and fiber supply, even amid uncertain economic times.”

TB&P
USDA launches second round of trade mitigation payments to farmers

U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Jonesboro, has supported Trump’s bailout since it was announced. He was pleased that the second round of relief has been doled, and he hopes it will compel the Chinese to strike a fairer trade deal.
“I am pleased to see the President not only deliver such a quick response to the concerns I voiced last week, but to see him continue to stand with rural America. Like any other industry, farmers are harmed by unfair foreign trade practices, but are also challenged by risks inherent to agriculture and a struggling farm economy,” Crawford said.

McKinley Calls For Bipartisan Healthcare Reform 
Last Saturday, a federal judge in Texas ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional. This decision should spur Congress into action to reform health care on a bipartisan basis. With divided government we have a chance to improve affordability, ensure access to care, address the cost of prescription drugs, and protect coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. 
This ruling will not have any immediate impact on premiums or coverage for the coming year and will likely be appealed. In the meantime, Republicans and Democrats alike should take this opportunity to put aside the partisan squabbling and enact reforms that will help people get affordable and quality health care.   Click here to read more 

McKinley Nominates 17 Students To Military Academies 
This month we nominated 17 West Virginia Students to United Sates service academies. These young men and women will be the next generation of leaders in West Virginia. They have earned their nomination through hard work, achievement and good character, demonstrated in the classroom, the athletic field and their community. 
Nominating deserving young people for the opportunity of a lifetime is one of the best parts of my job representing the First District. I am proud to endorse these students in the first step towards appointment at America’s service academies.   Click here to learn more

Criminal Justice Reform Includes McKinley Bill To Protect Correctional Officers
This week Congress passed a major criminal justice bill called the First Step Act, aimed at reducing recidivism and pushing a second chance for individuals who have committed non-violent crimes. This includes our Lt. Osvaldo Albarati Correctional Self-Protection Act which provides for safe storage of personal firearms for corrections officers to protect them during transit to and from work. We look forward to the implementation of this policy as it heads to the President’s desk for signature. This bill is in honor Lt. Albarati’s life as we work towards ensuring the safety of our correctional officers.

House Passes Bill To Provide Funding For Border Wall
As of Thursday night, the House voted 217-185 on legislation to avoid the government shutdown. This bill included an allotment of $5.7 billion for the President’s proposed border wall and border security, as well as, several other government agencies. The bill awaits approval from the Senate.
 

Congress Passes Museum and Library Services Act With Bipartisan Support
This week, Congress passed S.3530, legislation to reauthorize the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services, with bipartisan support. With a 331-28 vote in the House, many of West Virginia’s libraries will continue to benefit as a result of this legislation. This past year, West Virginia was allotted $1.3 million in grants. As the lead co-sponsor and firm advocate towards the betterment of our nations museums, libraries, and other related organizations, this is a step forward in ensuring that our constituents will continue to have access to furthering their education.  Click here to learn more

Dear Friend, 
At midnight on December 21, 2018, funding for the federal government expired. We are currently operating under what is called “a lapse in appropriations” – that is, a partial government shutdown, because we still need to fund for Fiscal Year 2019 the federal Departments of Homeland Security, Agriculture, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, State, Interior, Commerce, and Justice.
The Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, Energy, as well as the Legislative Branch and United States Postal Service have already been funded and will continue to operate without disruption. 
I voted to keep the government open, which included voting to strengthen border security and provide relief to communities struggling to rebuild after devastation caused by natural disasters. It is government’s job to work together to fund the government and I am disappointed my colleagues in the Senate have not yet voted.
￼ 
Because the government has not been fully funded, this morning, I submitted a letter requesting that my pay be withheld for the duration of the shutdown. My offices will remain accessible for constituents who need services during the shutdown. 
Please know that during this time, government programs involving the safety of human life or the protection of property continue to fully operate.
What this means for you according to the Office of Management and Budget: 
	•	HOLIDAY TRAVEL: 
	◦	PLANES: Air travel will not be affected, meaning Transportation Security Administration’s (TSA) airport functions will continue to operate. Air traffic controllers, critical airline safety inspections and the registration of aircraft would also continue to work if a government shutdown occurs. 
	◦	TRAINS: Amtrak will continue its normal operations during a short-term shutdown. Railroad inspectors and accident investigators at the Federal Railroad Administration will remain at work.
	◦	CARS & TRUCKS: The Federal Highway Administration and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which regulates trucking, will continue their operations. Highway tollbooths are typically staffed by state authorities.
	◦	PASSPORTS: Consular operations domestically and abroad will remain fully operational as long as there are sufficient fees to support operations. However, if a passport agency is located in a government building affected by a lapse in appropriations, the facility may become unsupported. The continuance of consular operations in such instances will be treated on a case-by-case basis by the Office of the Under Secretary for Management.    
	•	MEDICARE & SOCIAL SECURITY: 
	◦	Medicare services for current beneficiaries will continue without interruption. 
	◦	Social Security and Supplemental Security Income payments to beneficiaries will continue with no change in payment dates.    
	•	BORDER SECURITY: 
	◦	The vast majority of Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement workers will stay on the job if there's a shutdown.    
	•	EMERGENCY RESPONSE: 
	◦	At the Federal Emergency Management Agency, almost 90 percent of the agency's more than 20,000 employees are exempt from furlough, according to a contingency plan released in March of this year. Nor will the shutdown halt FEMA's disaster payments, which go to victims of recent hurricanes, wildfires and other emergencies.  
	•	  
	•	HEALTH, SAFETY & NEEDED SERVICES: 
	◦	The U.S. Department of Agriculture will continue inspecting agricultural products.
	◦	The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s homeless assistance grants, including support for veterans, will continue to operate.
	◦	The Department of Justice activities that involve the safety of human life and protection of life and property will continue.  
	•	  
	•	NATIONAL PARK SERVICE: 
	◦	National Park Service roads, lookouts, trails and open-air memorials will generally remain open. 
	◦	The park service won't provide visitor services, including restrooms, collecting trash and plowing roads. 
	◦	Campgrounds, boat ramps and other recreational sites overseen by the Bureau of Land Management will stay open, but restrooms will be locked and water systems will be shut down. Campgrounds, picnic areas and boat launches operated by the Forest Service funded by user fees will remain open.
Thank you for taking the time to read this newsletter. I continue to stand ready to negotiate a solution that will re-open the federal government.  
Sincerely, ￼  Congresswoman Susan W. Brooks

The partial federal government shutdown is yet another sad example of Washington dysfunction. While I hope leaders from both parties will come to the table and reach a compromise as quickly as possible, I wanted to share an article by the AARP detailing which federal offices and services will be affected as well as those that will not be affected.

Social Security, Mail, Air Travel Would Continue in Government Shutdown 
A potential preholiday shutdown of the federal government would not affect mail delivery, air travel, Social Security benefits or Medicare reimbursements to doctors and hospitals.
The partial shutdown may occur starting Saturday because nine departments wouldn’t have money to continue to operate. The agencies affected are the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Interior, Justice, State, Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development. Although those departments technically would not be funded, more than 400,000 workers will continue on the job — without being paid. (In previous shutdowns they have been paid for their time once normal operations resume.) They will provide law enforcement, air traffic control and other services the government deems essential. Veterans’ health care, vital food inspections and National Weather Service forecasting also will continue. 
Here’s a look at some key government responsibilities and what would happen during a shutdown: 
Social Security and Medicare: These agencies are funded and would not be affected by the shutdown, so Social Security payments to retirees, individuals with disabilities and other beneficiaries will continue, and Medicare beneficiaries will still be able to get health care services.
Mail service: Mail will be delivered. The U.S. Postal Service, which is an independent organization, will remain open, and mail service will not be affected. 
National parks and U.S. monuments: According to the National Park Service, while some parks might still be accessible to visitors, no visitor services would be provided. That includes snow removal from roads and keeping restrooms, shops and other amenities open. Contact individual parks or check online for more information. To reschedule camping reservations, call 800-365-2267. In Washington, D.C., the shutdown would close most of the museums on the National Mall. The National Gallery, which is not part of the Smithsonian Institution, says it has enough funds to stay open at least through Dec. 31. 
Veterans benefits and services: The Veterans Administration is funded, so VA hospitals, medical centers and clinics will stay fully operational.  
Taxes: The Internal Revenue Service would be affected by the shutdown, which would slow the processing of any tax documents, including audits and tax returns. 
Travel: Flights will not be affected. Air traffic controllers will remain on the job. So will the Transportation Security Administration's airport security screeners. 
Passports: The State Department will continue to issue passports. 
Food safety: The Food and Drug Administration will continue to handle high-risk food recalls. Routine meat, poultry and egg inspections will also continue because the U.S. Department of Agriculture considers them essential to safeguarding human life. 
Federal home loans: There could be a delay processing some FHA loans because furloughs at the IRS would reduce its capacity to verify information about borrowers.

On my weekly ""Capitol Hill Report,"" I spoke with Brian Fancher of KLMJ Radio in Hampton and Terri Queck-Matzie of Successful Farming about criminal justice reform, the Farm Bill and the Senate Finance Committee chairmanship.  
Q&A: First Step Act
Q. What is the First Step Act? Q. How does the First Step Act change sentencing laws? 
Quick Links
My bill, the First Step Act, overwhelmingly passed the Senate and the House and has now been signed into law by President Trump. There haven't been significant reforms made to our nation’s criminal justice and prison policies in a generation. The First Step Act takes lessons from history and from states – our laboratories of democracy – to reduce crime, save taxpayer dollars and strengthen faith and fairness in our criminal justice system. This bill is the product of careful deliberation and input from a wide range of stakeholders and law enforcement organizations. I’m grateful for the engagement from those who joined us to pass the bill and for President Trump’s leadership. 
  
The Christmas season is a busy time of the year. Like you, I’m preparing to celebrate the holiday with my family and friends on my farm in New Hartford. But as we look forward to celebrating the birth of our Lord and Savior, I want to take a moment to wish you all a safe and joyful season. Thank you for the honor of serving you in the United States Senate. Have a blessed Christmas. You can watch my message here or below.  
￼
I’ve spent more than three decades reviewing egregious spending at the Defense Department. But it seems like the Pentagon has done very little to change its ways. Over the past few months alone, the Defense Department has had to explain why it’s been paying $14,000 for individual 3-D printed toilet seat lids and purchasing cups for $1,280 each. Americans routinely balance their checkbooks, scrutinize their credit card statements and review their banking phone apps to manage their household budgets. There’s no reason the Defense Department can’t effectively do the same thing. Read more about my oversight of the Defense Department in my op-ed here.  
  
Each year, I have the opportunity as a U.S. senator to nominate either current or future Iowa high school graduates for a select few service academy placements. This year, I nominated 33 Iowa students to be considered for appointments to the U.S. service academies. These young Iowans who want to enter the academies and serve our country are a remarkable reflection on our state. Their accomplishments, leadership and desire to serve are exceptional, and signal continued excellence in the U.S. armed forces. 
  
As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I’ve made it a top priority to champion bipartisan initiatives to enhance victims' rights and protect our nation’s at-risk children. In the 115th Congress, I introduced and led the Senate in approving multiple bills to prevent crime, identify missing children, enhance services to crime victims, and reform our juvenile justice system. These include the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act, Kevin and Avonte’s Law, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, the Missing Children’s Assistance Act and the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. I’m proud of what we’ve achieved on the Judiciary Committee in this period, as we sent half a dozen of these measures to the President’s desk after both chambers passed them unanimously.
Post of the Week
￼ 
Senate passed criminal justice reform/First Step Act 87-12. House of Representatives passed it 358-36. Overwhelmingly bipartisan in both chambers! Thx to Pres Trump for working w me on this legislation & for your support

$100M+ for Marianas recovery

There is at least $100 million for the Marianas in legislation passed by the House on Thursday night—the first time ever for our islands to be included in special disaster relief above and beyond what FEMA provides. The bill’s fate in the Senate is undecided, as we go to press, because it includes a controversial $5 billion President Trump has demanded for a border wall. Incoming Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi gave me her pledge of support for Marianas recovery a few days after Yutu struck, as did the incoming Chairman of the Appropriations Committee Nita Lowey, when she called on November 10. Since then, I have worked with appropriators on both sides of the aisle to ensure that any help for U.S. areas hit by natural disasters this year includes the Marianas. 

What’s in the bill

Much of what I asked for in my formal request on November 26 is in the bill:
	•	$1.1 billion for community development block grants is available to the Marianas as one of the areas most impacted by a disaster in 2018. The money can be used for long-term recovery efforts, restoration of infrastructure and housing, economic revitalization, or as a local match for other federal grants.
	•	$56 million for solid waste for the Marianas, enough for new sanitary landfills on Rota and Tinian and to open a new cell at the existing Marpi landfill on Saipan.
	•	A $20 million territorial set-aside for highway repairs.
	•	$2 million to the Marianas for additional technical assistance from the Office of Insular Affairs.
	•	$8.5 million for the Marianas Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps.
	•	$300 million for grants from the Economic Development Administration for relief, recovery, and restoration from typhoons Mangkhut and Yutu, hurricanes Florence, Michael, and Lane, and other natural disasters.

Other funding I requested and the bill makes the Marianas eligible for includes:
	•	School and college restart: $50 million
	•	Public transportation: $10.5 million
	•	Head Start: $25 million
	•	Community health centers: $7.5 million 
	•	National Parks: $128 million
	•	Watershed and flood protection: $125 million 
	•	Crop loss and reforestation: $1.3 billion 
	•	Legal Services Corporation: $5 million for local branches, like Micronesian Legal Services, that aided typhoon survivors.

What comes next?

Whether this bill is enacted now or dies because of the controversial wall funding, there will certainly be disaster assistance taken up in the new Congress. And what the House approved on Thursday will be the basis for any future legislation. The task now is to increase funding—particularly for food stamps—and make even more programs available to us. We already have a very good start. My thanks to Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Nita Lowey, and all the Members who are helping me with typhoon recovery.
 
 
 

$17.9 million for Yutu recovery

The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Public Assistance Grants for the Northern Marianas for Super Typhoon Yutu recovery. A total of $6,929,271 was awarded for temporary classrooms and $13,447,432 for power restoration. FEMA obligates funding for these projects directly to the Commonwealth, which is then responsible for reimbursing agencies for costs associated with those activities. To date, FEMA has approved more than $7.8 million under the Individual and Households Program and more than $20.5 million for Public Assistance projects. The funds are authorized under Section 403 of the Robert T. Stafford Act.
 

Disaster tax relief passes House

The House passed a year-end tax package with tax relief for the Marianas and other communities hit by natural disasters this year. Under the bill, qualified disaster relief distributions will be exempt from the 10-percent penalty levied on retirement money withdrawn before age 59 and a half. The bill also allows homebuyers to re-contribute retirement plan withdrawals for home purchases that were cancelled due to eligible disasters, and provides flexibility for loans from retirement plans for qualified hurricane relief. To help disaster-affected employers retain employees, the bill provides a tax credit for 40 percent of wages (up to $6,000 per employee). There is also a temporary suspension of limitations on charitable contributions associated with qualified disaster relief made before December 31, 2018. And families that lost income in 2018 may use their 2017 income to determine their Child Tax Credit for this year. Any loss of revenue for the Commonwealth resulting from these tax changes will be covered by the U.S. Treasury. The bill must still pass the Senate and be signed by the President to be effective.
 
 
 

Typhoon Yutu relief updates

Water
Saipan has 95 percent of its water restored. Tinian has all its water service restored.  

Power
63 percent of power has been restored on Saipan with Tinian still operating at 20 percent power restored.

Transitional shelters
There are about 40 families – about 150 people – still at the Kagman transitional shelter.

Tents
1,593 tents have been installed on Saipan. 203 tents have been installed on Tinian.

SBA Loans
The U.S. Small Business Administration has approved a total of 737 loans to home and business owners totaling to over $46.8 million.
 

We must address climate change

With two typhoons this year, the Marianas understands the impact of climate change. That is why I joined 100 of my colleagues this week urging President Trump to pay attention to his administration’s own National Climate Assessment. The report is a comprehensive, science-based evaluation of the consequences of climate change, the risks of inaction, and strategies we can adopt. President Trump has dismissed the findings. I believe our nation should follow the scientific evidence—and what we have seen with our own eyes—and, in collaboration with nations across the globe, act to address climate change.
 
 

Farewell, Mr. Speaker. Retiring Speaker of the House Paul Ryan invited Members for a commemorative photo this week. The Wisconsin representative and once-vice presidential candidate is leaving after 20 years in Congress. We did not always agree, but thank you for your public service, Mr. Speaker. 
 

Farm bill signed

President Trump signed the farm bill into law on Thursday. See our write-up from last week’s e-news on the new micro-grants program for the Marianas in the Agriculture Act of 2018, Public Law 115-334.
 
 

Implementation of the VA MISSION Act, which authorizes the study needed for a Veterans Community-Based Outpatient Clinic in the Marianas, was the purpose of a joint hearing of the House and Senate Veterans Affairs Committees on Wednesday. I was there along with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX). Your congressional office has held veteran registration drives throughout the year to increase the numbers of Marianas vets and help justify having our own C-BOC.
 

Urging action on Agent Orange

More than a year later, no decision has been made on the recommendation of former VA Secretary David Shulkin to add bladder cancer, hypothyroidism, Parkinson-like tremors, and hypertension to the list of diseases that are presumed the result of exposure to Agent Orange and other herbicides. This week I wrote the Office of Management and Budget urging immediate action. The letter from 29 Members of Congress also asks that Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) be included on the list. The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine has found sufficient evidence of association between MGUS and the chemicals in Agent Orange. Veterans exposed to toxic substances during their service and who now suffer from these diseases should receive benefits without question.
 
 

Congratulations to the Public School System’s exemplary educators of 2019: Teacher of the Year Roselle Carreon of Oleai Elementary School, Instructor of the Year Michael Berbes of Hopwood Middle School, and Teacher Aides of the Year Salote Kesol of Hopwood Middle School and Grace Belyea of Garapan Elementary School. Two students were also recognized during Education Day festivities this week: 4th grader Daniel Job of San Vicente Elementary School, who won the Education Day Theme Contest, and 8th grader Adrian Manalang of Dandan Middle School, who won the Education Day Logo Contest. Kudos to all!

December 21, 2018
Friends,   I’m sorry to bother you on a Friday night. But, I wanted to check in from Washington, DC.   As I wrote this, our nation is once again on the brink of yet another government shutdown.      This has happened so many times this year that it’s starting to feel like the norm.    That should never be the case.   Shutting down the government is a bad idea.   It’s bad for federal workers, it’s bad for taxpayers, it’s bad for the economy and it’s bad for the American people who depend on important government services.    This time is different, too.   This isn’t happening because of a disagreement between factions in Congress--there’s a bipartisan path to keeping government open. In fact, there’s a bipartisan path for dealing with immigration issues, too.  I’m for border security, but I’m not for holding the government hostage in hopes of spending $25 billion on a 14th century solution to a 21st century challenge.      The president said he would be ‘proud’ to shut down the government.    I couldn’t disagree more. I hope the president comes to his senses and embraces a bipartisan path to keeping the government open.  And I hope that you know I’m doing what I can on an individual level to try to fix this.   Because I know what is at stake for Washingtonians when the government shuts down:   All Visitor Services in the National Parks Will Be Suspended.  While there will not be barriers put up to prevent entry, there will be no services for visitors to National Park Service sites – with restrooms, visitors’ centers, and interpretative programs all closed during a shutdown.    More than 420,000 federal employees nationwide will be working over the holidays without pay, including federal law enforcement and correctional officers from the FBI, ATF, DEA and US Marshal Service.   Almost 90% of Homeland Security employees nationwide will also be working without pay in agencies like Custom and Border Protection, the Secret Service and TSA (so those of you traveling—throw out your liquids, remove your shoes and maybe have a little mercy on the people patting you down—it’s a tough time of year to wonder when you’ll be paid)   An additional 400,000 federal employees nationwide will be furloughed, sent home without pay with no guarantee of when their next pay check is coming. 
The federal agencies that protect you from identity theft will have most of their staff furloughed, leaving us all more vulnerable.   Crime victim services and law enforcement training programs will stop, and other Justice Department activities will halt.   Mortgage applications will slow as most of the staff who process them will be sent home.   During A Difficult Time for Farmers, Critical Services Will Be Stopped.  As farmers begin to make their plans for next year’s planting season, the Department of Agriculture will be forced to close Farm Service county offices throughout the nation and stop providing aid to farmers already hard hit by the trade war. With the dramatic drop in commodity prices brought on by the trade war, many farmers have had to rely on USDA as their lender of last resort to help pay the bills and stay afloat.    Small business loans will stop. During the 2013 shutdown, nearly 700 businesses were unable to have $140 million in loans processed by the SBA.   Even if the president backs down before midnight, all this posturing has real consequences.   I met with a hotel owner near Olympic National Park after a shutdown a few years ago.  He laid it out pretty well. 
He said: “Derek, when the government shut down, I lost a ton of business because people weren’t sure how long the park would be closed. They just went somewhere else. I’m still recovering a year later, and every time this seems like it is going to happen, people decide to go someplace else.”   The president’s decision has a direct effect on our economy. It risks the $26.2 billion that outdoor recreation generates in our state, and 201,000 jobs that are directly dependent on the outdoor economy. And, it cuts into the bottom line at restaurants and other small businesses around our parks.   Worst of all, this kind of behavior in Washington, DC undermines citizens’ faith in their government.  The American people expect and deserve better.   If you’re watching this from our neck of the woods, you’re likely frustrated by all this.  I share that --I’m also highly motivated to get this back on track.  
  
We’ll keep pushing!   ￼   Derek

Providing Opportunities for Low-Risk Inmates to Rejoin Society & Helping Women in the System 
This week, a sentencing reform bill became law. The First Step Act will not only reduce recidivism and improve fairness in sentencing of federal crimes – but it will also help women, especially mothers, in our justice system by addressing their unique needs.

The comprehensive and bipartisan legislation provides opportunities for low-risk inmates to rejoin society, while ensuring that dangerous criminals stay behind bars. 
The First Step Act uses data-driven tools to evaluate each person in the prison system to see if they are eligible for earned time credits.  Anyone convicted for a number of serious offenses disqualifies them, but those who are found to be low risk will be given an opportunity to participate in workforce development programs that could lead to a portion of their federal sentence being served in pre-release custody –like a halfway house. 
As a conservative, I supported this legislation because I believe in providing opportunity. 
And, I also believe that we need to address the disturbing trend of women, especially mothers, who are going to prison at higher and higher rates.  Women are the fastest growing population segment of the prison population, and about two-thirds of incarcerated women are mothers to children under the age of 18. 
In a time of intense partisanship, the First Step Act brought the House, Senate and the president together around a common goal of helping people in the system get another chance.

Dear Friend,   
This time of year, we pause as Nebraskans, as Americans, to celebrate the origins of an ancient faith tradition and its enduring spiritual beauty: the idea of family, the idea of giving, the idea of Christmas.  Nebraska has a longstanding, well-earned reputation for nurturing vibrant communities, for singular and often anonymous generosity, and for carefully cultivating storied traditions that renew our commitment to each other.
In that spirit, I invite you to view the work of an intern in our DC office, Miriah Goeres, whose wood-burning art poignantly captures the beauty and meaning of the season. 
Merry Christmas!

 Year In Review 
Dear Friends,  

As this year comes to an end, I wanted to take the time to reflect on the 115th Congress (2nd year). This past year, our economy saw record numbers, Congress passed significant legislation to combat the Opioid Crisis, and we continued to improve the new tax law. This is only to name a few of our accomplishments. In this newsletter, you will find a month-to-month highlight of major accomplishments made. 

In the 116th Congress I look forward to working to surpass the numbers outlined in the graphic below and supporting the interests of Arizonans. 

Sincerely, 

￼
David Schweikert
Member of Congress

January
                                                                   
Ways and Means Hearing on ""The Opioid Crisis: The Current   Landscape and CMS Actions to Prevent Opioid Misuse."" 
￼
Myself at the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee hearing. 
During this hearing, Ways and Means members spoke about the multiple pieces of legislation that we could put together to help combat the Opioid Crisis. This package we all discussed during the hearing later became H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act.   Included in the package, I proposed legislation that supports a prior authorization standard in Medicare. H.R. 4841. This legislation was later included in the H.R. 6 package to help move pharmacies and doctors away from faxing the prior authorization forms and encourage them to communicate in real time through electronic means.   The bill consists of two main ideas: to prevent the delays caused by the current system of non-electronic/real time prior authorization requests so that Medicare patients receive prescriptions as soon as possible, and by making the process electronic, there will be an improved oversight in the system to ensure patients are only receiving approved medications. 
February
 ASU Law Blockchain Event 
￼
Speaking to students of ASU Law at the Blockchain Summit

This February I joined ASU Law students for a conference on ""Blockchain and the Law"" to discuss how government can better support emerging technologies. 

As a co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, this issue has become a fixation of mine. There are so many technologies being developed that I believe can create a disruption in government processes. Arizona is a state that has become very accepting of new businesses in the technology industry. I look forward to working with stakeholders in the technology field that have the same fixation on creating a revolution. 
March
 This March, our DC team wanted to create a time during the week were all staff and I were in one spot, at the same time. With unknown vote schedules, and staff meetings all throughout the day, we set aside an hour for Arizona groups to join our team for an Open House.   We have come to really appreciate the time allotted to connect with Arizonans on their legislative priorities. Below are a few photos from my meetings with these groups.   If you are in Washington, D.C. and your group would like to discuss legislative priorities, email Schweikert.Scheduling@Mail.House.Gov for more information.

At the Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Pensions

This year, I was selected to serve on the Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Pension Plans. It was an honor to serve on this committee and to take a deep dive into this complex issue. 

In April, the committee held a hearing titled ""The History and Structure of the Multiemployer Pension System"" with two witnesses Mr. Barthold from the Joint Committee on Taxation and Mr. Goldman from the American Academy of Actuaries.

H.R. Subcommittee Hearing on Jobs and Opportunity: Local Perspectives on the Jobs Gap

This April, the Ways and Means H.R. Subcommittee welcomed two Arizonans to testify. Mrs. Connie Wilhelm and Mr. Brian Potaczek came to speak about Arizona's labor shortage. Mr. Potaczek was a part of the criminal justice system and towards the end of his time serving he joined a program that provides training for skilled labor jobs to prior offenders. 

It was a pleasure to have some Arizonans join me in the hearing room. I look forward to seeing programs like this bring success to our community.

This May, a handful of my colleagues and I had the opportunity to visit South Korea to see the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea and discuss with troops on the ground the day to day operations and concerns at the border. 
During the trip we visited US forces Korea (USFK) troops, the leadership team at Osan Air Base, and the 25th Fighter Squadron. 

As the Holidays near, my team and I would like to thank all of the men and women protecting our country during this season. 


Trip to the U.S.-Mexican Border

This May I took a trip down to the U.S. Mexico border with Representative McSally and Secretary Nielsen. During our visit we met with border patrol agents and Arizona stakeholders to discuss how to keep America's borders secure and safe. 

I thank all of the men and women border patrol agents working to keep our country safe.

Summer Internships
￼
A photo with my Fall 2018 Washington, D.C. interns

My Scottsdale and Washington, D.C. offices offer internships throughout the school year and summer. 
We are now accepting applications for Summer 2019! Applicants should be motivated, detail oriented, display a strong work ethic, and interact well with constituents. In addition, applicants should have a interest in the legislative process and the function of Congress. 
Strong ties to the sixth district of Arizona or the state of Arizona are preferred, but not required. Priority is given to current college students, but recent high school graduates with exceptional credentials may be considered. 
July
The FORWARD Act

This July, I joined Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, as co-chairs of the Valley Fever Task Force, to introduce H.R. 6562, the Finding Orphan-disease Remedies With Antifungal Research and Development (FORWARD) Act. The FORWARD Act is designed to strength endemic fungal disease research and help bring new fungal diagnostics, antifungal treatments, and eventually a fungal vaccine to patients. 

This legislation also represents a breakthrough for medical research; Section 9 of the FORWARD Act establishes a blockchain pilot to ensure Valley Fever researchers have access to robust clinical data without compromising patient privacy. 

The graphic below provides a concise description of how the pilot will operate, ensuring data accessibility and security. I am proud to sponsor this legislation, which will support Arizona and other states in their continued efforts to fight endemic fungal diseases, including Valley Fever!

On August 25, 2018, we lost a great man, a great leader and a great voice for our home state of Arizona. Throughout his long and distinguished life, Senator McCain personified honorable service to one’s nation. There is no question that with his passing, Senator McCain will serve as a shining example to all who endeavor to a life of service to America.

  Click the photo above for a link to watch me speak during the Ways and Means Mark-Up on Tax 2.0
 This September, the House passed Tax Reform 2.0 which included three bills:   - H.R. 6760 Protecting Families and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018: This legislation would make the individual and small business tax cuts permanent, as they are now set to dissolve in 2025.  - H.R. 6757 Family Savings Act of 2018: Helping to expand access to savings vehicles and helps local businesses expand their ability to provide retirement plans for their employees as well as have better access for employees to use those retirement plans.   - H.R. 6756 American Innovation Act of 2018: This legislation will support new ventures by supporting their start-up costs and capital that is incurred when opening to create innovation.   These three pieces of legislation locked in tax cuts for middle-class families and show continued support for small businesses. By continuing to work on tax reform, we will ensure our tax code will never fall behind global competitors again.  
October
 H.R. 6 SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act

￼
 I am very proud of this bi-partisan, bi-cameral package Congress passed for the President to sign into law. My contribution to the package, which is mentioned above in the January subheading, is H.R. 4841, the Standardizing Electronic Prior Authorization for Safe Prescribing Act of 2018. 

As we enter 2019, I look forward to seeing how this package has helped the Opioid crisis in America.

This November, Congresswoman Lesko invited the Arizona delegation to her office for a breakfast to discuss how we can all work together for Arizonans next Congress. 


 ""Championing American Businesses"" Bill

In November, my colleague Congressman Michael McCaul and I introduced the 'Championing American Businesses Through Diplomacy Act.' This bill prioritizes economic and commercial diplomacy at the Department of State and U.S. missions throughout the world, allowing U.S. businesses better access to markets abroad. 

Here are a few key points the bill seeks to address: 
· Authorizes in statute the Assistant Secretary for Economic and Business Affairs, setting in statute their responsibilities to promote and support U.S. economic and commercial diplomacy;
· Streamlines and combines two commercial diplomacy guides – the Investment Climate Statement and the Country Commercial Guide, respectfully produced by the Department of State and Department of Commerce –  into one annual guide for each country focused on critical information that businesses rely upon when assessing whether to do business in a particular country;
· Requires Ambassadors and their Embassies to submit a report to the Department of State of the specific actions they took in the year prior of how they are aided businesses achieve market access, while assessing levels of private-sector commercial competition from other strategic competitor nation-states;
· Requires the Secretary to report to Congress general commercial diplomacy trends, as well as assessments of commercial activity in strategic areas from competing nation-states that threatens U.S. national security; and
· Places further emphasis on training our diplomats on matters of commercial diplomacy.

 As we wrap up this year, my team and I wish you and your family a joyous holiday season, a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year. I look forward to working with you all in 2019 to best support Arizona.

Friend - As this year comes to an end, I wanted to share a couple of highlights of what we were able to accomplish together in 2018 and tell you why I'm excited about 2019. I put together a video sharing some of my thoughts with you. This year we made progress to combat Alzheimer's, address the opioid crisis, and support military families, and I'm excited to tell you about it. Looking forward, I have a lot of priorities for 2019 like expanding health care access, bringing down the price of prescription drugs, and keeping America safe.

December 21, 2018 


Today, we are on the brink of an unnecessary and reckless partial government shutdown. Earlier this week, the Senate passed a bipartisan agreement to prevent such a shutdown. While far from perfect, it would have avoided the havoc a shutdown wreaks on our country and hardworking federal employees. Then, yesterday, we watched as President Trump pulled the rug out from under the agreement after he was criticized by conservative talk show hosts. I was then deeply frustrated to see Speaker Paul Ryan and House Republicans do the President’s bidding instead of letting democracy work its will and allowing the House to vote on the Senate compromise to fund the government.  This argument is not about border security. There is strong bipartisan support for securing our borders. This is about wasting $5 billion on an ineffective, 2,000-mile-long border wall that President Trump said Mexico -- not American taxpayers -- would pay for. The short-term budget agreement the Senate passed earlier this week maintains the significant funding for border security that the Congress passed last year -- much of which the President has yet to put to use. But it’s clear that this common-sense approach is not sufficient for the President, who said he would be “proud” to shut down the government if he didn’t get everything his way.    I will continue fighting to keep the government open. A shutdown will have dire consequences on our state and country -- shuttering large portions of agencies ranging from the Department of Justice to the Department of Agriculture to Homeland Security. The closings negatively impact small businesses, farmers, homeowners, and more. Over 26,000 jobs in Maryland could be directly impacted.  If the government does shut down, hardworking federal employees should not be punished for political dysfunction they had nothing to do with -- they should at the very least be provided the comfort of knowing that they will receive full retroactive pay once the government reopens. Senator Cardin and I have introduced legislation to do just that, and I'm very pleased to report that we passed it out of the Senate today. Now the House should pass it immediately.   As we move forward, I will keep urging my colleagues to put party politics aside to fund our government.

Protecting Americans’ Health Care
Since day one, President Trump and Congressional Republicans have worked to repeal, sabotage, and dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Each time, we stood together and refused to stay silent because we knew what was at stake. Without this landmark law, tens of millions of Americans, including many of our friends, neighbors, and family members, would be left without the lifesaving care they need. Healthcare costs would become unaffordable for millions more, and people would be left without important protections.  Unfortunately, we must unite once again to defend our healthcare system. Last week, a federal judge in Texas -- after pressure from Congressional Republicans, the Trump Administration, and Republican Attorneys General -- ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional. If upheld, this ruling will have a devastating impact on our entire healthcare system. It will threaten access to coverage and protections -- including for those with pre-existing conditions -- for millions of people, potentially leaving them with astronomically high costs or no healthcare coverage at all.  As this ruling makes its way through the courts, the President and the GOP are trying to accomplish in court what they couldn’t do in Congress. I will continue to use every tool at my disposal to fight against this effort -- and I urge you to do the same. This week I introduced a bill with some of my Senate colleagues authorizing the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the Senate in court to defend all provisions of the ACA. I’m confident the new House will authorize their legal counsel to do the same come January. 

Supporting Farmers, the Chesapeake Bay, and Our Environment 
Last week, Congress passed a bipartisan five-year Farm Bill that authorizes and updates programs that help our farmers and protect our environment. It includes important wins for our state, and we defeated attempts to undermine conservation efforts.  I’m pleased to announce that the legislation includes three major initiatives that I’ve championed in the Senate. First, the Farm Bill includes my plan to significantly increase funding for the Regional Conservation Partnership Program -- a program that helps farmers and conservation groups work together to reduce runoff and prevent pollution. It also makes improvements to the program so that increased funding goes to sensitive environmental areas like the Chesapeake Bay watershed.  The bill also contains provisions I introduced to reauthorize and improve access to assistance for veteran and socially disadvantaged farmers, as well as language I introduced to correct an inequity and give 1890s Land-Grant Universities (which are all Historically Black Colleges and Universities) the same flexibility to use their funding as other Land Grant universities. Both of these programs will help the University of Maryland Eastern Shore and the great work it’s doing in our state. 
Improving Justice for All
For all the understandable cynicism about Congress being unable to accomplish anything significant, there was a little ray of light here as we head into the New Year: the Congress took an important first step to reform our broken criminal justice system. The First Step Act is backed by a diverse group of supporters -- from the American Civil Liberties Union to the Fraternal Order of Police. It includes crucial reforms to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent crimes, end juvenile solitary confinement, and provide more people with a second chance.  As the bill makes clear, this is just the beginning of the work we need to do to ensure that all Americans have equal rights and equal justice under the law. For example, I’ve partnered with my friend Senator Cory Booker to push to end private prisons, which have seen countless abuses and create perverse profit incentives to lock up more people for longer periods of time. I also believe Maryland has taken several important steps, including on bail reform, that the federal government should examine on a national basis. And through my role on the Appropriations Committee, I’ll keep fighting to secure critical resources for programs that improve our justice system, such as the Justice Reinvestment Initiative and the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion program.  America’s history has always been tied to the struggle for equal rights and opportunity for all. Working together, we will keep fighting to build an ever more perfect union.

The Webster Wire
Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends: 
""For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given..."" Isaiah 9:6 Christmas is one of my favorite times of year because we get to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ with our beloved family and friends. Sandy and I pray that you and your family have a wonderful Christmas and Happy New Year! 
￼  
______________ 
Yesterday, I voted to provide $5 billion to begin construction of a border wall.  I dislike funding the government through Continuing Resolutions. They act as a slush fund allowing agencies to follow their own path independent of proper congressional oversight. Because of this lack of oversight and high spending, I typically oppose these bills.  However, I supported it this time because we must secure our borders and I believe wall funding is an important component of that.  
I remain concerned about our nation’s debt and spending trajectory. This concern will continue to guide my decision making as I evaluate budget/spending plans in the 116th Congress. I pledge to continue to work hard on behalf of Florida’s hardworking taxpayers and families to advance common-sense reforms and principled policy and budgets that get our fiscal house in order. 
￼
______________ 
I was disappointed to hear that General Jim Mattis is retiring from serving as Secretary of the Department of Defense at the end of February.  General Mattis has spent his entire life in service to his country.  We owe him a debt we can never repay.
￼  
_______________ 
On Wednesday, President Trump announced that American troops would begin to withdraw from Syria where they have been supporting the Kurds in their fight against ISIS. ISIS has sustained significant defeats in Syria and removing troops from Syria fulfills a campaign promise President Trump made in 2016. However, I share the concern of some of our military leaders and allies that an early withdrawal empowers Iran, Hezbollah, ISIS and Russia.  These individuals assault that which is at the heart of America—freedom.  The images of war and the news of terrorist attacks remind us of the differences between the United States and many other countries.  
I look forward to learning more details from the White House and Pentagon to better understand their plan in Syria. We must not forget the horrific human rights abuses and ethnic cleansing that was perpetrated on Syrians by their government.  We must remain vigilant in the ongoing fight against ISIS and global terrorism.
￼ 
_______________ 
Tuesday, a disturbing report was issued by the Government Accountability Office, asserting that the Department of Veterans Affairs spent less than $57,000 out of $6.2 million appropriated by Congress for veteran suicide prevention outreach. 20 veterans commit suicide daily, many of them their contact with the VA is little to none. Outreach to veterans could change this and give these men and women the opportunity to receive vital mental health services.   
Serving our veterans is one of my priorities, from improving access to and the quality of services that our veterans receive to holding government leaders accountable for providing our veterans the care they have earned and need. I have contacted VA Secretary Robert Wilkie asking him to inform me how the VA will remedy this inaction and hold individuals accountable, so this failure is not repeated.   
_______________ 
This week the House also passed H.R. 88, the Retirement, Savings, and Other Tax Relief Act, with my support.  This bill builds on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we passed a year ago and provides additional relief, streamlining corrections and changes that further assist everyday Americans as they file and pay taxes. Change include: 
	•	 Repealing the onerous Johnson Amendment, which the IRS has used to threaten to remove churches and faith-based non-profit charitable groups tax-exempt status for exercising their First Amendment free speech rights on public policy and political issues.
	•	Allowing individuals to access their retirement funds, if needed for disaster relief.
	•	Expanding the use of 529 accounts to allow families to start saving earlier and more. 
	•	Modernizing more elements of the IRS to improve the efficiency of filing taxes, retrieving information, resolving issues and making payments.
	•	It also repeals or delays taxes that were imbedded in Obamacare, including medical device tax, health insurance tax and tanning tax.
￼ 
_______________ 
Thursday, I supported the House passage of S.3777, the Forever GI Bill Housing Payment Fulfillment Act. This bill holds the Veterans Affairs Department responsible for inaccurate housing stipends for thousands of Post-9/11 GI Bill students. The VA will be required to retroactively pay these veteran students the housing money they are owed. It requires the VA to create a “Tiger Team” within 15 days, whose purpose will be to correct the technology that caused this error and ensure veteran students receive their proper stipends. Retroactive payments are set to begin in January. We owe our veterans a debt we can never repay. It is essential that the federal government hold the VA accountable, fulfill its promises to our nation’s heroes, and provide our veterans with the assistance they deserve and need. 
_______________ 
The United States Air Force (USAF) recently announced its Inaugural Air Force Pitch Day. This is a new initiative that will connect small businesses, startups and entrepreneurs across the nation with opportunities to work with the USAF. The Air Force Pitch Day is modeled after commercial investment pitch competitions, and their goal is to award up to $40 million in startups using one-day, one-page contracts. They are looking for startups that can help the USAF in command, control, communications, intelligence and network, battlefield air operations, and digital technology. Startup solutions can be pitched from January 9th through February 6th. The Air Force will then contact those selected to do an in-person pitch. I encourage all interested constituents to visit this page, familiarize themselves with the process and details, and apply for this exciting opportunity.

A constituent from Weeki Wachee contacted our office because she was having an issue obtaining a new passport card for her upcoming trip. We sent an inquiry to the passport center and learned that original documents were needed, instead of the photocopies that were provided with the application. We relayed the information to the constituent who then mailed the originals overnight. The constituent called our office to say she received her passport and was thankful for our assistance.

Legislative Update 
Last week, Congress passed the FIRST STEP Act with my support. This legislation requires the Department of Justice to develop and apply a risk and needs assessment system to identify a prisoner’s risk level and assign them to participate in an appropriate evidence-based program. These programs could include vocational training, educational support, substance abuse treatment, mental health care, anger management courses, faith-based initiatives or other resources. Prisoners could then earn incentives such as extra commissary items, extra yard time, or even halfway home placement towards the end of their sentences (only those with the lowest risk) for participating in these programs. 
For individuals who make mistakes and subject themselves to the justice system, we should provide pathways that afford them the opportunity to regain their footing in life and transition into the classroom or workforce. Such opportunities will improve communities by reducing recidivism and empowering formerly incarcerated or committed inmates to contribute in a meaningful way in the workforce and become productive citizens.
The FIRST STEP Act also gets rid of harmful prison practices, such as shackling pregnant inmates. Additionally, inmates will be placed in prisons within 500 miles of their homes, making family-visits possible. Finally, it gives judges more discernment on a case-by-case basis in deciding the length of prison sentences. These initiatives have proven to reduce recidivism in state prisons.

News from Representative Bustos 
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
During a hectic and far too partisan week in Washington, I’m pleased to share some good news for the hardworking people of Illinois. 
Infrastructure Improvements  
￼
Congresswoman Bustos announced funding this week to help keep homes safe and lead-free 
It started on Tuesday, when I announced federal dollars for lead abatement available to folks in Galesburg and across Illinois who want nothing more than a safe and lead-free home to raise their family. Whether it’s toxic lead-based paint or unsafe drinking water, we can and must work tirelessly to keep our children safe and to make our region a great place to live, work and raise a family. These dollars will help us do just that. Click here to learn how to apply for funding. 
Additionally, the House passed my bipartisan Water Infrastructure Improvement Act. This bill would formalize the process for communities to create integrated plans for water infrastructure improvements. My legislation encourages green infrastructure development, paving the way for cities like Peoria to address combined sewer overflow through investments in modern, environmentally-sound infrastructure. Learn more by clicking here.  
Support for Gold Star Spouses  
￼
Congresswoman Bustos with Gold Star spouse, Kylie Riney
Wednesday evening, the Senate unanimously passed my legislation, the Gold Star Spouses Leasing Relief Act, sending it to the president’s desk to be signed into law. This bill extends residential leasing protections of surviving spouses of servicemembers killed in the line of duty. I was inspired by the experience of Kylie Riney, whose husband – Sergeant Douglas J. Riney – tragically died defending our country in Afghanistan. Kylie chose to move back to their home state of Illinois as they mourned his passing, but was confronted with costly lease cancellation fees. Once this bill is signed into law, Gold Star spouses will no longer have to go through this experience – and I want to thank Kylie for sharing her story and helping us change the law for the better. To hear from Kylie, click here. 
To keep up on the work that I am doing to fight for the hardworking families of Illinois, make sure to stay connected with me @RepCheri!

Salute: Secretary James Mattis
Worth a Read:“Stay in Syria”
Pleased to Receive National Park Service Award
Historic Criminal Justice Reform Legislation Approved by House
Happy Birthday New Jersey!
 
Salute: Secretary James Mattis who has served our nation with honor and distinction for 44 years, most recently as the 26th Secretary of Defense. Yesterday, Secretary Mattis announced his resignation in a letter to the President. I would encourage you to read that letter here.
 
I had the honor of working with former Generals Mattis and John Kelly as chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. Both of these men were and are excellent public servants and Marines.
 
Further, I was extremely honored to receive a personal note from the Secretary today, which reads:
 
DEAR CHAIRMAN FRELINGHUYSEN,
 
On behalf of the men and women of the U.S. Department of Defense, thank you for your 24 years of committed service in Congress and especially for your leadership the House Committee on Appropriations: first as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Defense, then as Chairman of the full Committee.
 
In an era of renewed Great Power Competition, you ensured our Armed Forces received essential funding required to protect our Nation. It was a comfort to know that, in you, we had an effective advocate- an Army veteran who carried the motto “This We’ll Defend” with him in Washington’s halls of power.
 
From America’s founding to the antebellum years to the present day, public service runs in your family. As you prepare to bid farewell to “the People’s House,” know that you leave a lasting legacy, written in terms of increasing military readiness and greater security for the American people.
 
Thank you for your leadership. We wish you fair winds and following seas.
 
WITH GREAT RESPECT,  
Jim Mattis     
 
Worth a Read: “Stay in Syria”, National Review’s opinion, which I strongly share, highlighting the many reasons why the U.S. should maintain our strategic presence in the war torn country.  
 
Pleased to Receive National Park Service Award
On Wednesday, I was very pleased to receive, the rarely presented, National Park Service (NPS) Ranger Hat for my longstanding support of our nation’s parks, including Morristown and Thomas Edison National Historic Parks. 
 
In a letter from, NPS Deputy Director, Daniel Smith stated, “I want to personally express my sincere gratitude for your dedication to America’s national parks and public lands.  For over 23 years you have served as the U.S. Representatives for New Jersey’s 11th Congressional District: a district that encompasses Thomas Edison National Historic Park (NHP) and Morristown National Historic Park (NHP). You have been a true champion for these parks in addition to the 415 other units in the National Park System.”
 
You can view Deputy Director Smith’s entire letter here.
 
You can read Eric Kiefer’s article in the West Orange Patch on the award here. 
 
Historic Criminal Justice Reform Legislation Approved by House
On Thursday, I was pleased to support the passage of the First Step Act on the floor of the House of Representatives, which was approved by a vote of 358 to 36. This bipartisan legislation will bring historic reforms to our criminal justice system that will keep New Jersey communities safer and give nonviolent offenders a real chance after serving their sentence, reducing the chance of recidivism.
 
Specifically, the legislation revises federal sentencing laws, reducing the ""three strikes"" penalty for drug felonies from life behind bars to 25 years and retroactively limiting the disparity in sentencing guidelines between crack and powder cocaine offenses.
 
Further, the bill establishes an evidence-based risk and needs assessment tool to tailor expanded rehabilitative programs to individual prisoners and affords low-risk, well-behaved inmates the opportunity to access alternative confinement near the end of their sentences in order to ease their transitions to society.
 
The First Step Act will now go to the president’s desk where it is expected to signed into law. The bill has wide support, especially from the law enforcement community.
 
You can read the entire text of the legislation here. 
 
Happy Birthday New Jersey!
This week we marked the 231st Anniversary of New Jersey joining the Union. On December 18, 1787, New Jersey was the third state to ratify the Constitution.
 
With a past rich in patriotism, New Jersey has played a significant role in the history of United States, and maybe most importantly, during our founding. 
 
Known as the “Crossroads of the Revolution”, there are nearly 300 sites in New Jersey with direct ties to the American Revolution. Among the landmarks are Washington’s Headquarters in Morristown, Jockey Hollow, the Old Trenton Barracks, the Dey Mansion in Wayne, the Princeton, Monmouth, and Red Bank battlefields, and the Great Falls of the Passaic.
 
I was extremely proud to introduce legislation to recognize the critical role our state played in the American Revolution. This legislation was included in the National Heritage Areas Act of 2005, which was signed into law on October 12, 2006. The Crossroads of the American Revolution National Heritage Area Act has raised the profile of New Jersey's historical importance.

Weekly Update From Congresswoman Anna G. Eshoo 
Members of the House returned to Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, December 19th to vote on legislation to fully fund our government. Congress has already funded 75% of the government through September 2019. However, funding for the remaining agencies: the Departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, State, Interior, Commerce and Justice will run out at midnight tonight.  
On Wednesday, December 19th, the Senate unanimously passed a ‘clean’ Continuing Resolution to fund the government through February 8, 2019, after the President vowed to sign it. No less than 24 hours later, the President revoked his promise and threatened to veto any Continuing Resolution that does not include $5 billion for his border wall. This led the House Majority to add $5 billion to the Senate’s ‘clean’ bill to fund the President’s border wall and the agreement has fallen apart. 
As I write to you, the Senate is currently debating legislation, but it is not expected to pass. If no action is taken by midnight, there will be a partial government shutdown.  
What a sad and unnecessary ending of the 115th Congress. 
This is my last E-Newsletter of the year. May the holidays be filled with blessings for you, your family and our country. It’s an honor to represent you. I will resume sending my weekly E-Newsletter to you in the New Year when the 116th Congress will be sworn-in on Thursday, January 3, 2019. 

All my best, ￼  Anna G. Eshoo

Trump Temper Tantrum
On Thursday night, House Republicans voted to shut down government – refusing to vote on a bill to keep government open that was unanimously passed by the Senate, and choosing instead to push a radical border wall bill that is dead on arrival. Now – knowing that he doesn’t have the votes in the Senate to fund his immoral, ineffective and expensive wall – President Trump is throwing a tantrum, threatening a “very long” shutdown.
Over and over, President Trump has declared that he’d be “proud” to shut down the government, even saying “I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down” if he cannot force American taxpayers to spend billions of dollars on an immoral, ineffective and expensive wall. 
￼ 
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer held a press conference this week after President Trump announced that he would not keep government open if it did not include funding for a border wall. 
Democrats have offered three options to keep government open – but President Trump and House Republicans are deciding to drive our nation into a pointless, destructive shutdown over the holidays. If they steer our nation into a Trump Shutdown, in early January, the new House Democratic Majority will swiftly pass the appropriation bills with a CR for Homeland Security to re-open government.

My office was able to advocate for an emergency disability benefit check for an unhoused constituent. My constituent opened a new bank account and closed his old account prior to changing his direct deposit information with the Social Security Administration (SSA). Because of this, my constituent had not received his benefits necessary to support himself. SSA dispersed an emergency check within 24 hours of our request.

Dear Lindsey,
As I write this, our country is on the verge of a government shutdown. As many of you saw, President Trump said last week that he would be “proud to shut down the government for border security.” Right now, it looks like he is going to make good on that threat even though here in the House and Senate, we had come to a bipartisan agreement. This is terrible news for working families across the country and for our economy and I and my Democratic colleagues have repeatedly offered ways to avoid it.
However, there is also some good news to report. This week, Congress passed the First Step Act, a monumental criminal justice reform bill. As the name suggests, this bill is an important first step in our long journey to reform our criminal justice system. I was proud to have voted for this bill yesterday and hope it is just the first of many that we can pass to make our country’s justice system fairer.
The legislation increases funding for educational and vocational training for prisoners in a bid to reduce recidivism rates. It equalizes sentencing for drug offenses involving crack cocaine and powder cocaine and makes this change retroactive, which will reduce the sentences for thousands of prisoners currently in jail on crack convictions. The First Step Act also makes some changes to mandatory minimum laws for drug offenses, including giving federal judges discretion to make exceptions on a case-by-case basis, while also reducing the three-strike penalty from life in prison to 25 years. While there is certainly more work to be done to reform our criminal justice system, this bill is a huge step forward.
Unfortunately, this spirit of bipartisanship stopped with the First Step Act. Without an agreement to avoid this Trump shutdown, 380,000 government employees will be temporarily laid off and many others will be forced to work without pay, including 50,000 Customs and Border Protection Agents, 50,000 TSA agents, almost 14,000 FBI agents, and the Secret Service agents who will be protecting the President. 
Families will likely find National Parks facilities closed, travelers will be unable to get passports, home buyers will need to wait longer to get loans, and millions of Americans will find that services they rely on are now unavailable.
If this impending shutdown lasts more than a very short period, it could also have serious economic costs.
The effects of shutdowns don’t end when we reopen the government. They create economic risks that hamper growth, may reduce business investment, and create uncertainties that slow economic growth, which in turn leads to fewer jobs and real pain for working families.
For millions of Americans, a Trump shutdown would be like coal in their stockings. Apparently, this is his way of saying “Merry Christmas.”
Our country deserves better. We need to keep the government up and running. We need to do our jobs. And the President needs to give up on his vanity-project; a border wall that will do nothing to make us safer.
I continue to support the deal passed unanimously in the Senate on Wednesday or either of the options that Speaker-designate Pelosi presented. There is a way to avoid this shutdown, but it’s now up to the President.
Sincerely,
￼

Dear Friend,
Today, families in Colorado and across America should be enjoying the holiday season with their loved ones. Instead, an impending government shutdown is forcing many to worry about their livelihoods during what should be a relaxing and celebratory time of year.
If President Trump gets his shutdown, more than 800,000 federal employees will be forced to go without pay, including 420,000 federal employees who will still have to show up to work, and that includes more than 41,000 federal law enforcement and correctional officers. Additionally, federal efforts to help Americans buy homes, support small businesses, maintain public housing, ensure consumer safety, and more will be significantly hampered. And it will significantly cut services at our National Parks. 
It’s shameful that President Trump is willing to harm so many Americans in a desperate ploy to secure funding for his senseless and racist border wall. Even worse, he claims the shutdown will last for “a very long time,” creating even more misery for working families across Colorado and the country who need financial security. After nearly two years as President, he still hasn’t recognized the fallacy of his immigration policies and the need to work with Democrats in order to effectively serve the American people. 
I support border security, and my Democratic colleagues and I are willing to work with the President and our colleagues across the aisle to keep America safe. But I don't support this wall -- a symbol of xenophobia and bigotry that our community whole-heartedly rejects. I will continue working to avoid a government shutdown in a manner that doesn’t compromise our values. And you can be sure that when Democrats lead the House of Representatives in 2019, we will not entertain these outrageous shenanigans from the President and his allies in Congress.   
Even in this trying week, we managed to make progress on some important goals.  
On Thursday, the House overwhelmingly passed my bipartisan bill, H.R.7328, which streamlines the way the Food and Drug Administration approves over-the-counter drugs. The antiquated framework now in place hasn’t been updated since the 1970s, harming public health and stalling innovation. I spoke on the floor of the House of Representatives to urge my colleagues to support this needed update, and I’m pleased so many did. I now urge my Senate colleagues to swiftly pass it so it can become law before the end of the year. 
￼ 
On Monday, I led 68 of my colleagues in submitting comments to EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler strongly condemning the agency’s proposed rule to weaken Obama-era emissions standards for methane and other compounds. Methane is an especially potent greenhouse gas, and its emissions are also associated with public health problems such as asthma, reduced lung function, chronic respiratory damage, cancer, nervous system damage, and birth defects. In the fight to protect our health and stop climate change, it’s imperative we reduce these emissions, and I will continue holding this administration accountable for that responsibility. 
I also want to clear up any confusion regarding the deadline for Open Enrollment and the recent court ruling in Texas on the Affordable Care Act: The ACA remains law of the land and it’s not too late for Coloradans to get covered through it. You still have until January 15 to secure health coverage in 2019. Visit connectforhealthco.com to select an affordable plan that’s right for you.

Dear Friends,
 
This week, I was happy to see President Trump sign the Farm Bill into law. This law comes during a difficult time for agriculture and the reforms it makes will provide increased certainty for producers over the coming years. Congress got this done by eliminating partisan proposals and focusing on what Americans need most at this time. Currently, negotiations on a spending plan to fund the government into the new year are ongoing. Funding expires at midnight tonight and, if an agreement is not reached, unfunded agencies will halt or limit their activities and an extended shutdown will delay the implementation of the Farm Bill that was just enacted with significant bipartisan support. Lawmakers must focus their efforts on keeping the government open so that it can continue to provide services that many Americans depend on. 
 
Sincerely,
￼ Congressman Collin C. Peterson
Minnesota 7th District
 
Farm Bill Signed into Law
￼
 
On Thursday, President Trump signed the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 into law. I attended the signing ceremony at the White House to commemorate this bipartisan success with my colleagues in the House and Senate. The law includes programs that will support farmers and ranchers, conservationists, and food-insecure families. It also provides expanded risk management options for dairy farmers. During the next Congress, I look forward to working with USDA to ensure these programs are implemented quickly and effectively in the way lawmakers intended. 
 
KASM Focus on Farming Panel in Albany
￼
 
On Tuesday, I went to Albany to participate in a panel discussion hosted by radio station KASM’s Joe Gill. The “Focus on Farming” panel members included AMPI Chairman Steve Schlangen, Minnesota Farm Bureau President Kevin Paap, Minnesota Farmers Union President Gary Wertish, Minnesota Soy Bean Growers Association Vice President Jamie Beyer, Minnesota Department of Agriculture’s Dave Frederickson and Tom Haag from the Minnesota Corn Growers. We discussed health care access and costs, The Waters of the U.S. Rule (WOTUS), nitrogen rules, tariffs, soybean exports to China and crop insurance. I answered questions about the recent passage of the farm bill and gave an overview of the challenges faced to get the farm bill to a vote. I also shared information about the dairy provisions of the Farm Bill and explained how the new Dairy Margin Coverage program focuses on ensuring small dairies benefit from the bill.
 
ELD Mandate for Livestock Haulers
Last week, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announced that livestock and insect haulers are indefinitely exempt from the requirements of the electronic logging device (ELD) mandate. According to the agency’s website, drivers transporting livestock and insects can continue to use paper logs to document their hours of service “until further notice.” In the 115th Congress, I sent letters to FMCSA calling for increased clarity and flexibility around the ELD mandate as it relates to livestock and insect haulers. I also introduced the bipartisan Agricultural Business Electronic Logging Device Exemption Act (H.R. 5949) to completely exempt agricultural businesses from the ELD mandate.

International Call Fraud Update from Arvig
Arvig contacted my office this week alerting us that Arvig customers have recently become victims of international call fraud. As of now, the incidents have occurred to only a small number of people. Arvig is taking steps to secure customers’ phone lines by placing international call blockages on customers’ lines. To remove an international call block, please contact Arvig Customer Care at 1-888-992-7844. Affected customers will need to create a new passcode to secure your account. If you believe you have been the target of international call fraud, contact my office in Washington D.C. at 202-225-2165 and we will be happy to assist you.

This Week in American History
￼
 
On December 20th, 1902, Clearwater County was established by Governor Samuel Van Sant. The county’s name was taken from the Ojibwe word “gawakomitgweia” that was translated to “clear water.” The Clearwater River also runs through the area. Clearwater County is home to Lake Itasca, parts of Red Lake and most famously, it contains the source of the Mississippi River.
 
What’s the Story?
￼
 
In 2005, I performed at the 20th annual Farm Aid concert with my band, The Second Amendments. Willie Nelson, Neil Young, and John Mellencamp organized the first Farm Aid concert in 1985 to raise awareness about the loss of family farms and to raise money to keep struggling family farms in business. Farm Aid has since grown into a nonprofit organization that supports farmers and rural communities. In addition to the annual Farm Aid concert, the Farm Aid organization works to expand local markets for farm goods. They advocate for fair farm policies and offer a range of resources to assist family farms in crisis. I have a t-shirt from the 2005 Farm Aid concert in my Washington D.C. office.

Foxx Report
 
This week, Congress has been in session to continue funding the federal government for FY 2019 and pass its final pieces of legislation before a new session of Congress commences next year. Yesterday, House Republicans voted to provide $5.7 billion to strengthen our national security with a wall along the southern border, including technology and infrastructure improvements. To protect our national security, we must stop illegal immigration and other crimes like drug and human trafficking that threaten the safety of our communities. The Senate should take funding for our nation’s security seriously when considering the continuing resolution.
Strengthening our Libraries
On Wednesday, the House sent S. 3530, the Museum and Library Services Act to the Oval Office. Growing up in the mountains of North Carolina, libraries were vital to my own education, and I know that continues to be the case for the North Carolinians I represent. Almost 19 years into the 21st century, libraries are still lifelines to lifelong learners all across this great country. I was proud to support this legislation to honor the place of libraries in our diverse communities and ensure they have funding for library services and technology through Fiscal Year 2023. 
Juvenile & Criminal Justice Reform
On Thursday, the House sent S.756, the First Step Act to the President’s desk with a strong bipartisan vote of 358-36. Today, President Trump signed both the First Step Act along with the Committee on Education and the Workforce’s legislation, the Juvenile Justice Reform Act.
The First Step Act is modeled after state-based reforms that have proven to reduce crime, prison populations and taxpayer expenses. The legislation helps low-risk inmates prepare to rejoin society successfully through evidence-based recidivism reduction programs. It also provides sentencing reform, granting greater discretion to judges in sentencing of low-level, nonviolent drug offenders who cooperate with law enforcement while preserving the maximum potential sentences for violent and career criminals. Any savings generated by the reforms under this legislation are automatically reinvested into law enforcement programs to further reduce crime and improve community safety. 
The First Step Act is the bipartisan product of the collaboration between lawmakers and a wide criminal justice coalition. It was endorsed by President Trump and backed by a number of law enforcement groups, including the nation’s largest police group and conservative organizations that recognize the need to be tough on crime and increase fairness in the justice system.

Dear Friend,
As we conclude 2018 and prepare to enter a new session of Congress, I’m thankful to represent San Diego, Coronado, and Poway.
This year was filled with both challenges and accomplishments for the U.S. and San Diego, but our region’s people, innovation, and spirit continue to drive our mission even as national headlines distract from the truth and seek to divide us.  

Serving San Diegans
Team Peters has been hard at work in San Diego and in Washington. Here’s a look at what we’ve done to serve you and deliver results for San Diegans:
￼
 
We returned $485,333 to San Diegans, who had trouble retrieving backlogged funds from the IRS, Social Security, the VA, and more.
￼
 
In all, our office helped 579 San Diegans navigate federal agencies, get answers, and find a solution. If you can't get an answer from a federal agency in a timely fashion, or if you feel you have been treated unfairly, you can contact my office for help.
 
While we cannot guarantee you a favorable outcome, we will do our best to help you get a fair and timely response.

Hearing from You
￼
 
We answered 52,381 of your calls, letters, and emails about issues important to you. Every letter, email, and call is read and answered because I want you to feel your voice is heard and to know where I stand. Your input is always welcome.
￼
 
We attended 381 community meetings and events to update you on our work in Congress and to hear directly from each part of the district. We also presented 1,170 certificates to San Diegans making a difference in their communities.

Taking San Diego's Solutions to Washington
￼
We arranged 1,001 tours for San Diegans visiting D.C. and I hope you’ll let us know if you’re ever in town.
￼
We introduced 9 bills and resolutions and cosponsored 161 more. You can sign up for legislative updates, based on the issues you care about here or visit my website for the latest news.
I hope you’ll keep in touch in the new year. Please do not hesitate to call our San Diego office at (858) 455-5550 or our Washington, D.C. office at (202) 225-0508. You can also follow me on Facebook and Twitter for the most recent updates.
I am honored and humbled to serve in Congress on behalf of San Diego, and I am looking forward to seeing all we will accomplish in 2019.
Sincerely,
￼

Friends, 
 
Coming into this week I knew we had our work cut out for us, I did not want a government shutdown, but I also couldn’t, in good conscience ignore matters of national security. I was firm in that we should fund the $5 billion to help secure our borders. 
After much back and forth, I am proud that the House voted and passed $5.7 billion in border security funds, which will fully fund President Trump’s request as the American people have demanded. 
The fate of the bill is unclear as it sits in the Senate, and a partial shutdown is still possible if a final bill doesn’t reach the President’s desk by tonight. But I am fully prepared to work through the holidays to make sure border security funding is protected. 
Kansas farmers back home will be working on Christmas Day, the cows have to be milked and the cattle fed. And as a physician, almost every year I delivered a Christmas baby, so I am perfectly accustomed to working through the holidays to do my job. Anyone who thinks that we are going to get a package that prioritizes border security when Nancy Pelosi takes over the House in January is delusional.
Ahead of the vote, I joined Fox Business to discuss my stance and emphasize the need for border security. (Click the clip below to watch)

Preventing Maternal Deaths Act 
Recently the House passed H.R. 1318, the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2017. This legislation aims to address maternal deaths across America by improving data collection analysis. Earlier this year, I joined The Hill, a Washington-based newspaper, for an in-depth discussion focused on improving outcomes in maternal and child health in the U.S. (Click image below to watch.) 
￼ 
The number of mothers who die today from pregnancy-related causes remains far too high. According to the CDC, nationally maternal deaths have actually increased in recent years to 20.7 deaths per 100,000 live births. The good news is that Kansas has set the standard, already bucking the national trend, with maternal mortality decreasing from 19.6 to 17.7 deaths since 2016. Currently, there are gaps in identifying trends and developing
I was one of the first to cosponsor this bill and worked tirelessly with patient advocacy groups to urge Congress to pass this much-needed legislation. I am so proud that it passed through the House. 
Small Business Lending Fairness Act
This week, Rep Velázquez (D-NY) and I introduced the “Small Business Lending Fairness Act,” bipartisan legislation that aims to put an end to the practice of small business borrowers signing an obscure legal document known as a “confession of judgment,” which essentially requires the borrower to waive their legal rights.
 Shady lenders are using confessions of judgment as a weapon to take advantage of entrepreneurs and small business owners. (Click the article below)  
￼ 
Bloomberg: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-confessions-of-judgment/ 
 Closing this loophole ensures that predatory lenders are unable to seize the assets of small firms without due process and extends protections to small business owners looking to obtain a loan. I am proud to work across the aisle to end this scam.

President Trump Signs the Farm Bill 
￼
This week President Trump signed the 2018 Farm Bill into law. I was fortunate to be invited to join the president for this signing. It truly has been an incredible journey to see this process from start to finish. I am so proud of this Farm Bill and happy to report that we have delivered on our promise to provide farmers with five-years of certainty. This Farm Bill will be a great Christmas present to our producers across Kansas who will see many wins in this bill.  
 In addition to the Farm bill being signed into law, the Department of Agriculture announced that it would move a key focus of the House’s Farm Bill that was lost in the final negotiations forward, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) reform. Secretary Sonny Perdue proposed a rule to restore SNAP’s integrity.   This rule helps able-bodied Americans move off welfare and into work, and cracks down on states that are waiving the 20-hour per week work requirements. We want to help people by assisting them in finding work, and preparing them with the skills and training they need so that they can prosper. I am thrilled that the Trump administration is tackling this issue.
ACA Ruled Unconstitutional
On December 14, a federal district court in Texas ruled that the ACA was deemed unconstitutional without the individual mandate. The individual mandate, repealed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was a penalty as a tax that legitimized the ACA under a Supreme Court decision years ago. Without the penalty, the federal court ruled that the health care law no longer met that Constitutional test. I’m not surprised by this decision. The ACA was and is not the solution to addressing health care. 
 
As a physician, I’ve lived the nightmare of the ACA in rural Kansas. Where one can see a success story, I can give you a failed one. I came to Congress to work proactively with my colleagues across both sides of the aisle. I understand that there is a lot of talk about what the court’s decision means. 
 
This court decision isn’t the end all, be all. It will most likely be appealed. Until then  Congress should focus its efforts on coming together to develop bipartisan health care reform that focuses on increasing transparency and consumer choice, improves quality of care, lowers costs, and protects patients with preexisting conditions.

My daughter Lauren spent the weekend with me in D.C. We went to the Library of Congress (one of my favorite places in D.C.), and I took her with me to the White House Congressional Ball. We admired the White House Christmas decorations and enjoyed our time at the ceremony. 
I so enjoyed having Lauren in town to join me for this special event. 
An end of an era:
This week we said goodbye to my friend and mentor, Speaker Ryan. From day one him and Janna were so kind and welcoming to Laina and I. In his farewell address he said, ""well-done is always a better than well-said."" Speaker Ryan has been great leaders, he is genuine and thoughtful and we will miss him dearly.

Dear Friend,

 In September, the President signed five of the 12 Appropriations bills into law for 2019. These bills included: Defense, Energy & Water, Labor-Health & Human Services-Education, Military Construction-Veterans' Affairs, and the Legislative Branch. Therefore, in the event of a shutdown, around 80% of the federal government will remain fully funded by the previous passage of these bills.
 
Funding for the remaining seven appropriations bills – Agriculture, Commerce-Justice-Science, Financial Services, Homeland Security, Interior, State-Foreign Operations, and Transportation-Housing & Urban Development – expires today. If Congress is unable to come to an agreement on a short-term spending bill to fund these remaining programs and agencies, the federal government will partially shut down at midnight tonight.  
In the event of a government shutdown, my offices will remain open during normal business hours if you are in need of assistance. For specific information regarding what happens if the federal government shuts down, which agencies are affected, and guidance on emergency furloughs, please see below:     
How will the government shutdown affect different agencies?  
Please click here for agency contingency plans and frequently asked questions during a lapse in appropriations.    
In the Event of a Government Shutdown:  
Which federal employees continue to work? During the event of a government shutdown, agencies must classify their employees as “essential” or “nonessential”. Those classified as “essential” will continue working throughout the government shutdown, receiving pay at the first of the month for the preceding month. Click here for more information regarding shutdown furloughs.  
Will furloughed federal employees receive back pay in the event of a government shutdown? This is up to Congress and the White House. The precedent has been that furloughed employees are later paid, through legislative action, which is what occurred after the government shutdown in 2013.  
Will I continue to receive my Social Security, Social Security Insurance (SSI), and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) checks? Yes. Social Security checks will continue to be mailed out.  
What happens to Medicaid and Medicare? Medicare and Medicaid will be unaffected.  
Will Veterans’ Hospitals remain open? Yes. The VA will be unaffected in the event of a government shutdown.    
Will I get continue to receive my mail? Yes. United States Postal Service operations will not be impacted.  
Will National Parks be open? Effective immediately in the event of a lapse in appropriations, the National Park Service will take all necessary steps to suspend all activities and secure national park facilities that operate using appropriations that would lapse, except for those that are essential to respond to emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property. Click here for the Department of Interior’s contingency plan for our national parks.  
What will happen to the Department of Defense and active duty military? The DoD and active duty military will be unaffected in the event of a government shutdown.     
As I’ve said before, I do not find government shutdowns to be an effective or responsible tool for negotiation – especially when it comes to providing critical funding for the programs and agencies Americans rely on. This is why I’ve done everything possible to keep our government open, voting last night to support a Continuing Resolution that would fund the remaining portion of our federal government through February 8, 2019. This legislation successfully passed out of the House by a recorded vote of 217-185. As Congress continues working alongside the Administration to reach a deal before midnight, please know my staff and I will keep you informed of any updates surrounding a short-term spending bill.

Friend, 
The highest responsibility of Congress is to ensure the safety and security of our nation and the American people.It’s an embarrassment that Nancy Pelosi and other Washington Democrats would play politics and risk shutting down the federal government over common sense security measures that they are already on record supporting. Not only does this bill avert a shutdown of the federal government, it also makes our nation safer by providing critical funding to strengthen security on our borders. Let me be crystal clear: we must secure our borders, and no threat of a Pelosi shutdown changes that fact.

Dear Friend, 
It has been a busy December for many of us in the San Joaquin Valley, as students and teachers finish their fall semester, businesses wrap up the quarter, and we gather with family and friends at holiday celebrations. It has also been busy in Washington, D.C., with Congress working through the final days of the legislative session. Below are highlights from December of some of the recent victories and key issues I have been working on for the people of the Valley.
Farm Bill Supporting Valley Farmers and Families Enacted 
Debates and disagreements over this year’s Farm Bill have been long and intense, but we successfully enacted a strong Farm Bill on December 20th. 
I served as a member on the Farm Bill Conference Committee, which was responsible for negotiating a final agreement that would receive support by a majority of members in the U.S. House and Senate.
As a third-generation farmer, I am proud to support our bipartisan, bicameral Farm Bill that is good for the San Joaquin Valley, California agriculture, and farmers and families throughout the nation. It feeds Americans, provides our nation with food security, and provides assistance to agriculture producers as they work to put food on dinner tables across America every night.
For more on specific wins for the Valley in the Farm Bill, click here.

Legislation Critical for Valley Survivors of Child Abuse Passes
With strong bipartisanship, both chambers of Congress voted to update and reauthorize funding for programs in the Victims of Child Abuse Act (VOCAA) this week, including Children’s Advocacy Centers and support organizations. As co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Victims’ Rights Caucus, I was a strong advocate and lead Democrat on the House’s version of the bill.
There are currently five Children’s Advocacy Centers (CACs) located in Fresno, Merced, and Madera counties providing services for thousands of children in the Central Valley. For example, VOCAA funds support the Family Healing Center in Fresno, which provides trauma-informed forensic interviews and therapy to 300 children every year. The Valley Children’s Hospital clinic sees another 1000 cases per year.
These programs are vital for providing Valley survivors of child abuse the services and justice they need to grow up healthy and safe and pursue their fullest potential. I will continue to lead serious bipartisan efforts to ensure that all survivors of crime receive the justice and resources essential to heal and live healthy, full lives.
For more on the reauthorization of VOCAA and the crucial role CACs play in serving victims of child abuse, click here.  
￼ 
Determination to Protect Valley Water Continues 
Last week, over my and many others’ opposition, the California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) voted to adopt amendments to the Bay-Delta plan that will direct more water from the Merced, Tuolumne, and Stanislaus Rivers to the ocean. I have been working across the aisle with my fellow Valley Congressmen, state and local officials, and community leaders to stop this flagrant water grab, and I will never stop fighting for Valley water.
This vote was a missed opportunity to reset the water wars of the past and to find a better path forward by delaying adoption of the staff proposal to allow for continued negotiations. The Board refused to provide additional time for a negotiated solution for both the San Joaquin and the Sacramento watersheds that appeared to be very close to being reached. Instead, the Board chose to adopt the staff’s proposal – a proposal that doubles down on the failed policies of the past and brings harm to San Joaquin Valley communities and to California’s agricultural economy.
Although the vote occurred last week, the fight over this blatant water grab is far from over. Water is the lifeblood of our Valley, and I will use every tool at my disposal to protect the communities I represent and our way of life.

$100M+ for Marianas recovery

There is at least $100 million for the Marianas in legislation passed by the House on Thursday night—the first time ever for our islands to be included in special disaster relief above and beyond what FEMA provides. The bill’s fate in the Senate is undecided, as we go to press, because it includes a controversial $5 billion President Trump has demanded for a border wall. Incoming Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi gave me her pledge of support for Marianas recovery a few days after Yutu struck, as did the incoming Chairman of the Appropriations Committee Nita Lowey, when she called on November 10. Since then, I have worked with appropriators on both sides of the aisle to ensure that any help for U.S. areas hit by natural disasters this year includes the Marianas. 

What’s in the bill

Much of what I asked for in my formal request on November 26 is in the bill:
	•	$1.1 billion for community development block grants is available to the Marianas as one of the areas most impacted by a disaster in 2018. The money can be used for long-term recovery efforts, restoration of infrastructure and housing, economic revitalization, or as a local match for other federal grants.
	•	$56 million for solid waste for the Marianas, enough for new sanitary landfills on Rota and Tinian and to open a new cell at the existing Marpi landfill on Saipan.
	•	A $20 million territorial set-aside for highway repairs.
	•	$2 million to the Marianas for additional technical assistance from the Office of Insular Affairs.
	•	$8.5 million for the Marianas Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps.
	•	$300 million for grants from the Economic Development Administration for relief, recovery, and restoration from typhoons Mangkhut and Yutu, hurricanes Florence, Michael, and Lane, and other natural disasters.

Other funding I requested and the bill makes the Marianas eligible for includes:
	•	School and college restart: $50 million
	•	Public transportation: $10.5 million
	•	Head Start: $25 million
	•	Community health centers: $7.5 million 
	•	National Parks: $128 million
	•	Watershed and flood protection: $125 million 
	•	Crop loss and reforestation: $1.3 billion 
	•	Legal Services Corporation: $5 million for local branches, like Micronesian Legal Services, that aided typhoon survivors.

What comes next?

Whether this bill is enacted now or dies because of the controversial wall funding, there will certainly be disaster assistance taken up in the new Congress. And what the House approved on Thursday will be the basis for any future legislation. The task now is to increase funding—particularly for food stamps—and make even more programs available to us. We already have a very good start. My thanks to Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Nita Lowey, and all the Members who are helping me with typhoon recovery.
 
 
 

$17.9 million for Yutu recovery

The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Public Assistance Grants for the Northern Marianas for Super Typhoon Yutu recovery. A total of $6,929,271 was awarded for temporary classrooms and $13,447,432 for power restoration. FEMA obligates funding for these projects directly to the Commonwealth, which is then responsible for reimbursing agencies for costs associated with those activities. To date, FEMA has approved more than $7.8 million under the Individual and Households Program and more than $20.5 million for Public Assistance projects. The funds are authorized under Section 403 of the Robert T. Stafford Act.
 

Disaster tax relief passes House

The House passed a year-end tax package with tax relief for the Marianas and other communities hit by natural disasters this year. Under the bill, qualified disaster relief distributions will be exempt from the 10-percent penalty levied on retirement money withdrawn before age 59 and a half. The bill also allows homebuyers to re-contribute retirement plan withdrawals for home purchases that were cancelled due to eligible disasters, and provides flexibility for loans from retirement plans for qualified hurricane relief. To help disaster-affected employers retain employees, the bill provides a tax credit for 40 percent of wages (up to $6,000 per employee). There is also a temporary suspension of limitations on charitable contributions associated with qualified disaster relief made before December 31, 2018. And families that lost income in 2018 may use their 2017 income to determine their Child Tax Credit for this year. Any loss of revenue for the Commonwealth resulting from these tax changes will be covered by the U.S. Treasury. The bill must still pass the Senate and be signed by the President to be effective.
 
 
 

Typhoon Yutu relief updates

Water
Saipan has 95 percent of its water restored. Tinian has all its water service restored.  

Power
63 percent of power has been restored on Saipan with Tinian still operating at 20 percent power restored.

Transitional shelters
There are about 40 families – about 150 people – still at the Kagman transitional shelter.

Tents
1,593 tents have been installed on Saipan. 203 tents have been installed on Tinian.

SBA Loans
The U.S. Small Business Administration has approved a total of 737 loans to home and business owners totaling to over $46.8 million.
 

We must address climate change

With two typhoons this year, the Marianas understands the impact of climate change. That is why I joined 100 of my colleagues this week urging President Trump to pay attention to his administration’s own National Climate Assessment. The report is a comprehensive, science-based evaluation of the consequences of climate change, the risks of inaction, and strategies we can adopt. President Trump has dismissed the findings. I believe our nation should follow the scientific evidence—and what we have seen with our own eyes—and, in collaboration with nations across the globe, act to address climate change.
 
 

Farewell, Mr. Speaker. Retiring Speaker of the House Paul Ryan invited Members for a commemorative photo this week. The Wisconsin representative and once-vice presidential candidate is leaving after 20 years in Congress. We did not always agree, but thank you for your public service, Mr. Speaker. 
 

Farm bill signed

President Trump signed the farm bill into law on Thursday. See our write-up from last week’s e-news on the new micro-grants program for the Marianas in the Agriculture Act of 2018, Public Law 115-334.
 
 

Implementation of the VA MISSION Act, which authorizes the study needed for a Veterans Community-Based Outpatient Clinic in the Marianas, was the purpose of a joint hearing of the House and Senate Veterans Affairs Committees on Wednesday. I was there along with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX). Your congressional office has held veteran registration drives throughout the year to increase the numbers of Marianas vets and help justify having our own C-BOC.
 

Urging action on Agent Orange

More than a year later, no decision has been made on the recommendation of former VA Secretary David Shulkin to add bladder cancer, hypothyroidism, Parkinson-like tremors, and hypertension to the list of diseases that are presumed the result of exposure to Agent Orange and other herbicides. This week I wrote the Office of Management and Budget urging immediate action. The letter from 29 Members of Congress also asks that Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) be included on the list. The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine has found sufficient evidence of association between MGUS and the chemicals in Agent Orange. Veterans exposed to toxic substances during their service and who now suffer from these diseases should receive benefits without question.
 
 

Congratulations to the Public School System’s exemplary educators of 2019: Teacher of the Year Roselle Carreon of Oleai Elementary School, Instructor of the Year Michael Berbes of Hopwood Middle School, and Teacher Aides of the Year Salote Kesol of Hopwood Middle School and Grace Belyea of Garapan Elementary School. Two students were also recognized during Education Day festivities this week: 4th grader Daniel Job of San Vicente Elementary School, who won the Education Day Theme Contest, and 8th grader Adrian Manalang of Dandan Middle School, who won the Education Day Logo Contest. Kudos to all! 
 
 

Returning intern. Michael Ortizo returned to the congressional office this week to intern with us over the winter break. Ortizo is majoring in Political Science and Criminal Justice at the University at Delaware and will be until February. Welcome back, Michael!

Dear Lindsey,            As the 115th Congress draws to a close, I want to thank you and the people of Pennsylvania’s Twelfth Congressional District for allowing me to serve over the past six years. It has been an incredible honor to represent the residents of Lawrence, Beaver, Allegheny, Westmoreland, Cambria and Somerset Counties in the U.S. House of Representatives. I wish you and your family a Merry Christmas and blessed holiday season, as well as a healthy and prosperous 2019. 
￼ 
Changes in Congressional Districts 
          Beginning January 3, 2019, the Twelfth Congressional District of Pennsylvania will no longer be in Western Pennsylvania. The old Twelfth District has been carved up into five new congressional districts:
          Residents of Lawrence County will be in the 16th District to be represented by Mike Kelly; residents of Beaver County and part of Allegheny County will be in the 17th District to be represented by Conor Lamb; residents of Westmoreland County will be divided between the 14th and 13th Districts to be represented by Guy Reschenthaler and John Joyce, respectively; residents of Cambria County will be divided between the 15th and 13th Districts to be represented by Glenn Thompson and John Joyce respectively; and residents of Somerset County will be represented by John Joyce.  To find out your new representative, after January 3, 2019, visit https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative 
Suicide Prevention 
          Suicide is at epidemic levels in our country. As we enter the season of hope, we should be aware that there are those who struggle. If you or a loved one have lost hope and believe suicide is a way out, I encourage you to reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). My remarks on suicide prevention can be seen here.
Honoring the Fallen 
          Three service members from the Twelfth Congressional District were killed in Afghanistan over the past several weeks. Air Force Staff Sergeant Dylan Elchin of Beaver County and Army Sergeant Jason Mitchell McClary of Westmoreland County were killed as a result of an improvised explosive device that destroyed their vehicle while in Ghazni province. Army PFC Joshua Mikeasky died of non-combat injuries at Bagram Air Base north of Kabul. Please remember these service members and their families in your prayers. 
Border Security 
          For years Congress has promised to secure the southern border. In fact, a bipartisan majority voted for the Secure Fence Act back in 2006. The problem is they never finished the work. The House voted on December 20 to allocate funds to secure the border, which is vital to ensure that we are interdicting the maximum amount of heroin and other narcotics being shipped into the United States. Ninety percent of the heroin coming into the US comes across our southern border. We need to put up physical barriers where appropriate, and increase capacity for screening at our ports of entry along the border. To listen to my most recent House floor remarks urging Congress to secure the border, click here and here. 
￼  You can listen to my Fox Business interview with Elizabeth MacDonald to secure the border here. 
President Bush Funeral 
          It was a privilege to represent the Twelfth Congressional District at the funeral of our 41st president, George H.W. Bush. Among the memorable moments, Senator Alan Simpson(R-WY) noted the former president’s humility stating, “those who travel the high road of humility in Washington D.C. are not bothered by heavy traffic.” My condolences to the family of President George H.W. Bush. He was the last president of the World War II generation and he saw the Berlin Wall and Iron Curtain fall on his watch. President Bush knew the power of freedom, the value in every human life, and the beacon of light -- the brightest of the thousand points of light -- that our country is. May he Rest in Peace. 
￼ 
Legislative Update 
          Over the past month, Congress passed major legislation on farm policy and criminal justice reform. Unfortunately, Congress missed a real opportunity to reform our agriculture programs. I believe there should have been reforms to limit the availability of farm subsidies to wealthy farmers and reforms to the supplemental nutrition program that would have incentivized able-bodied adults without dependents to enter job training or the workforce. Because these reforms were not in the legislation, I could not vote for it. 
          Congress passed a significant criminal justice reform bill that I cosponsored, the First Step Act. The President signed it into law on December 21st. This legislation aims to reduce recidivism and get people back in the game after they have paid their debt to society. It supports education and vocational training opportunities for prisoners, which helps lower their chance of reoffending. It also provides substance abuse treatment among other rehabilitation programs. We all benefit if offenders can be successfully reintegrated back into society as productive citizens. 
Foundational Principles 
          One of my last talks on the House floor focused on our founding principles and the hope that we can rediscover those principles as our nation works to find what should unify us. 
Thank you 
          Thank you again for your input over the years. May God bless you and may He bless the United States of America as we all work together to build on the vision of our Founders and the principles on which our nation was founded.

 President Trump signed the 2018 Farm Bill into law and I was honored to attend the White House signing ceremony with many of my colleagues. 
￼
**Official White House Photo by Joyce N. Boghosian and Andrea Hanks**

This five-year farm bill has been a work in progress since I was elected to Congress in 2014. After several years of negotiations, hearings, and a number of district-wide farm tours aimed at gathering input from those who are directly affected by this legislation, I can confidently say that we have delivered a new sense of certainty for rural America. 
United States Department of Agriculture Secretary, Sonny Perdue, also announced a proposed change to the waiver rule for able-bodied adults without dependents currently receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.
￼

I applaud Secretary Perdue and the Trump Administration for taking meaningful action to assist Americans currently receiving SNAP benefits in securing gainful employment, while also protecting our most vulnerable communities. With over seven million available jobs throughout the country, we must ensure that we provide able-bodied adults without dependents a pathway out of poverty to prosperity. The 2018 Farm Bill allowed the Administration more flexibility in SNAP policy, and I hope to see this new rule come to fruition in the near future so that we may get America back to work.

H.R. 3946, my legislation to rename the Statesboro VA Clinic after Sergeant Major Ray Hendrix, was also signed into law by President Trump.

￼

I am thrilled that we were able to get this legislation across the finish line to officially rename this facility the “Ray Hendrix Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic.” I have no doubt that Ray Hendrix’s name and legacy will live on for generations to come with the quality care that this clinic will continue to provide to our nation’s bravest.
The House passed S. 756, the First Step Act – historic legislation to reform our criminal justice system and it was signed into law today! 
￼


The First Step Act will help prisoners in their effort to return to society, find a good job, and reduce the risk of recidivism. By affording individuals with the dignity and respect that comes with a good job, we can effectively reduce the risk of further criminal behavior significantly and provide a new sense of hope for many families and communities throughout our nation.
The House voted to fund the government, the wall, and provide disaster assistance for communities affected by natural disasters—but the Senate has not yet finished voting on whether or not to move forward with our legislation. 
￼

As we wrap up the 115th Congress, I’d like to wish you and your family a very blessed and Christ-filled Christmas and Holiday season.

￼

As we commemorate the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, may we all find time to pray for those less fortunate, be thankful for our loved ones, and cherish the time we have together.

Merry Christmas, Central Washington!  
I wish you and your family a very Merry Christmas and a safe holiday season. I hope you are able to spend time with your loved ones and reflect on the true meaning for the holiday. 
Farm Bill Signed Into Law 
￼ 
Yesterday, President Trump signed the 2018 Farm Bill into law. This is a major accomplishment that gives Central Washington farmers and agriculture producers across the country much-needed certainty and a secure safety net. Learn more about the Farm Bill here. 
This legislation is critical for Farm Country, but I would have preferred that the Farm Bill included stronger provisions to improve nutrition programs. That is why I am glad U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced a proposed rule intended to move more able-bodied recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to self-sufficiency through the dignity of work. This rule focuses on work-related program requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents between the ages of 18 to 49.  
Passed: Local Control for KID 
￼ 
I am pleased to announce that my legislation, H.R. 6652, passed the House. I worked with the Kennewick Irrigation District (KID) to introduce this bill, which will transfer title of Bureau of Reclamation works and lands to KID. Local resources should be responsively managed by local entities wherever possible, and that's what this legislation will ensure. This will be a big improvement for Central Washington water users. Click here to learn more. 
￼ 
Click here to watch me speak on the House floor in support of this bill. 
Statement on Service of Defense Secretary Mattis 
I am grateful for Secretary Mattis’ honorable service. A fellow Washingtonian, he has served our nation with distinction. Every Americans can be proud of his record both in uniform as a U.S. Marine and as Secretary of Defense. He has shown himself to be a man who exemplifies duty and patriotism and a true role model for every young Tri-Citian. 
More Relief for Taxpayers  
This week, the House also passed the Retirement, Savings, and Other Tax Relief Act of 2018, which gives Americans more flexibility in saving for their futures and enables small businesses to better provide retirement accounts and pensions. Tax reform has allowed taxpayers to keep more of their hard-earned money, and we should be encouraging them to save and invest their money the way they see fit. By allowing small businesses to band together to provide retirement plans, we ensure better access to these critical savings accounts and give people the peace of mind they deserve. 
In addition, the bill provides relief from burdensome health care taxes, such as the medical device tax, the health insurance tax (HIT), and the ""Cadillac"" tax. These taxes, which were implemented by the ACA, threaten access to health insurance and potentially life-saving medical devices to people across the country. I am proud to have voted to suspend these costly taxes for the people and health care providers of Central Washington. 
We'll Miss You, Fredi 
￼ 
Click here to watch my remarks. 
I spoke on the House floor to honor the life, service, and spirit of my friend Fredi Simpson. Fredi was well-known and admired in Central Washington. She was filled with passion and dedicated her time to improving her community and lending a helping hand to whomever was in need. I have many joyful memories with Fredi, and I find peace in knowing she is at rest and reunited with God. My prayers go out for her husband, Bruce, her son, Kane, and all her loved ones. We'll miss you, Fredi.
Thank you for reading this e-news update. It is an honor and a privilege to represent you in Congress.  
Sincerely,  ￼  Dan Newhouse Member of Congress

H.R. 88 Tax Relief 
This week, Congress passed H.R. 88, the Retirement, Savings, and Other Tax Relief Act. This legislation includes a number of changes to the federal tax code. The bill proposes retirement and education savings enhancements, provisions to restructure the Internal Revenue Service, and further suspends the Affordable Care Act’s medical device tax and health insurer tax. Additionally, H.R. 88 provides temporary tax relief for victims of the wildfires in California and for communities impacted by Hurricanes Florence and Michael. The disaster-related tax relief also applies to states affected by severe storms and tornadoes this past summer, including Wisconsin.

This bill includes a number of important provisions that will benefit the people of the Sixth District and residents throughout the country. Providing relief to the communities affected by the severe storms that swept through Wisconsin this past summer is very important, as a number of counties in the district were affected. Additionally, those in other states who suffered greatly as a result of the hurricanes earlier this year remain in need. H.R. 88 will help these individuals recover by providing disaster-related tax relief. 

Other important provisions of the bill include the suspension of the medical device tax and health insurer tax (HIT). The health insurer tax, which was previously scheduled for reinstatement in 2020, would drastically drive up health care premiums and limit a patients ability to pay treatment costs. H.R. 88 suspends this tax for both 2020 and 2021, protecting patients from burdensome premium increases. I look forward to seeing the benefits H.R. 88 brings to the people of the Sixth District and throughout Wisconsin.    

Wisconsin Cranberries 
This week, I joined my colleagues in crafting a bipartisan letter to USDA Secretary, Sonny Perdue, urging him to prioritize relief to cranberry growers while retaliatory tariffs are still in place, as the Department has done for other producers. While other commodities, including specialty crops such as almonds and cherries received direct payments in the tariff relief package, the relief provided to the cranberry industry was limited.  

The cranberry industry serves as an important source of agricultural production for several states across the country, especially Wisconsin. Wisconsin's cranberry industry represents the state's leading fruit crop in both acreage and value. Therefore, it is crucial that the cranberry industry is taken into account when determining relief levels for crop producers throughout the country.

Providing temporary assistance to the cranberry industry in the United States will allow growers and processors to adjust to the adverse market conditions and maintain production levels while we modernize our country's trade policies in order to level out the global playing field.      

Office Move Day
This week, my staff and I said goodbye to our office of two years, 1217 Longworth. If you plan to visit my Washington D.C. office in the New Year, please note that we have moved to 1427 Longworth.

Dear Friend,  As we approach the final days of 2018 and the close of the 115th Congress, it’s important to reflect on the year we’ve had.  There’s no question that as Californians and Americans we’ve faced significant challenges and successes this year.  I look forward to continuing the work of strengthening our national security and expanding economic opportunity when Congress returns in January.  
Once again, I am grateful to the people of California’s 50th District for the responsibility you’ve entrusted in me to serve the people and State I love so dearly.  I thank you for always speaking your mind and making your voices heard. 
Building the Wall 
Earlier this year, I was pleased to join the President in his tour of San Diego’s board wall—and show him first hand the security that strong border infrastructure can bring.  Last month, I wrote a letter to President Trump offering a solution for completing a large portion of the border wall.  Specifically, I called on President Trump to utilize the construction assets of the U.S. Army and engineering units to move the appropriate equipment and personnel to border bases as well as build a road along the southern border while supporting the Border Patrol and providing additional resources along the border.  These actions will protect our homeland while, at the same time, reinforce the President’s commitment to uphold federal immigration law and his efforts to invest in the necessary infrastructure to make our entire border secure. 
In addition, I support President Trump’s position of requiring any spending bill passed by Congress to contain funds to increase our border security—particularly for building the border wall.  This week, I joined my Republican colleagues in the House to pass legislation to keep that promise.  This is good news.  While funding negotiations continue, I will remain a strong advocate for a secure border.  Coast Guard Authorization Act 
Earlier this month, S. 140, the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act, that I authored and introduced was signed into law by President Trump.  As the former Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee Chairman, I appreciate the President’s strong support for the Coast Guard.  The Subcommittee that I led for nearly six years worked hard to ensure this bill provides the resources the Coast Guard needs to protect the safety and security of our nation.     Wildfire Relief   San Diego County, and California as a whole, know firsthand the destruction caused by wildfires and the need for active forest management.  The 2018 Farm Bill, which was signed into law by President Trump, includes 10 categorical exclusions that allow for active management of our nation’s forests and critical response.  This will go a long way to helping mitigate future fires, and I applaud Chairman Mike Conaway on his work to include these forestry provisions. 
Access to Federal Lands   Earlier this month, I sent a letter to the Secretary of the Interior to make him aware of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors action to ban recreational shooting on publicly managed lands in San Diego County.  It is my understanding that under this provision, local law enforcement will be authorized to arrest citizens on federal public lands for exercising their constitutional 2nd Amendment rights. As your Congressman, I am doing everything in my power to reject this action in the strongest terms.  It is my hope that the Department of the Interior can provide an official statement providing the official position of the Department of Interior and the Bureau of Land Management regarding this action. 
AMERICA Act 
Since 2005, the U.S. Census Bureau has issued an annual, 14-page mandatory survey to 3.5 million households across the country, called the American Community Survey (ACS).  The ACS asks each recipient dozens of extremely personal questions—everything from household income to which type of fuel is used to heat the home.  And every year I hear from my constituents how they are forced to complete the survey and provide private information outside of what should be required under the Constitution. These stories are why I introduced legislation, H.R. 7106, the Authorizing Moderated Enumeration Responses Including Citizenship Acquisition (AMERICA) Act, to help protect their privacy and limit the penalty for not completing the survey.  Specifically, my bill will limit the penalty imposed on U.S. citizens refusing or neglecting to answer one or more questions in connection with the 2020 census. The bill also authorizes the U.S. Census Bureau to consider questions based solely on the number of individuals living in a household and their citizenship status.  If no action is taken on the bill in the remaining weeks of the 115th Congress, I intend to reintroduce this bill at the beginning of the new 116th Congress, which will convene in January 2019.  A copy of my bill is available here. 
Remembering 41 
This month I joined my colleagues to mourn the passing of our 41st President of the United States, George H. W. Bush.  Thousands of people across the country descended on Washington to pay their last respects to a beloved patriot and hero.  
Prior to starting his career in politics, President Bush served in the U.S. Navy as the youngest pilot during World War II.  He then attended Yale University before moving to Texas where he entered the oil industry.  After a failed run for U.S. Senate, Bush ran again for the U.S. House of Representatives and served for two terms as a U.S. Congressman from Texas.  From there he served as the Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in the People’s Republic of China, and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).     From 1980 to 1988, he served as Vice President under President Ronald Reagan.  He then went on to become the 41st President of the United States.  During his presidency, President Bush navigated the United States through the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union.  After leaving office, President Bush continued to touch thousands of lives and his passing is an incredible loss for our country. 
Social Security   Finally, I want to remind Social Security recipients that the monthly Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits will increase 2.8 percent in 2019.  The 2.8 percent cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) will begin with benefits payable to Social Security beneficiaries in January 2019 and increased payments to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries will begin on December 31, 2018. For more information about how the COLA is calculated please visit www.socialsecurity.gov/cola.  Information about Medicare changes for 2019 will be available at www.medicare.gov. 
Visiting Washington, D.C. 
If you’re planning a trip to our Nation’s capital in the new year, my Washington, D.C. office can help in scheduling Congressional Tours at some of the city’s most beloved historical sites.  I recommend that you submit your tour request 3-6 months in advance of your visit.  While you are in Washington, D.C., I encourage you and your family to stop by my office.  If you have any questions, please contact my staff at (202) 225-5672.  We will be happy to help you with any further requests you may have.

Pathway Forward in 2019
My mission in Congress is to preserve the freedoms that you and I hold so dear and to advance opportunities for all Americans.  In the final days of the 115th Congress, the House and Senate made a significant push to move several outstanding bills meant to spur economic growth, reduce burdensome regulations, and hold the federal government accountable for their actions.  
When Congress reconvenes in January, I look forward to hitting the ground running. I will continue to advocate for secure borders and a strong national defense, ensure the men and women of our military receive the resources they need to complete their mission and veterans receive the quality care they deserve, as well as foster an environment to further grow our economy.    Thank you for another great year!  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.    Sincerely, ￼  Duncan Hunter

Dear  , 
Wishing the families across eastern Connecticut a wonderful and safe holiday season. Here with my weekly update on a few important issues from this week. 

Investing in Eastern CT’s Maritime Supply Chain 
This week my office announced $62,100 in federal grant money to the Development Agency to the Naval & Maritime Consortium in Groton, providing the network with the resources for establishing a framework that supports capital investment and job creation in eastern CT. Our region is preparing for tremendous growth in submarine construction work in the coming years, and a robust supply chain will be a critical component for successful execution. I was honored to be a part of the launch of the Naval & Maritime Consortium at UConn Avery Point last month, and am proud to work with partners like UConn and Thames River Innovation Place to accomplish this important and exciting goal. 
￼
Congressman Courtney speaking at the launch of the Naval & Maritime Consortium at UConn

The First Step Towards Reforming Our Nation’s Criminal Justice System 
Proud to vote for the House passage of The First Step Act, a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill that re-evaluates a system that has resulted in our country’s stunningly massive prison population, and enforces key changes to the way inmates are treated. Among these changes are the elimination of solitary confinement in juvenile facilities, which has been demonstrated to exacerbate behavioral and mental health disorders among imprisoned youth, and a ban on using restraints on pregnant women in custody. First Act also bolsters critical reentry programs, providing a much needed pathway for inmates to reintegrate into their communities in a way reduces the likelihood of re-incarceration. 
The First Step Act is culmination of years of work over the course of multiple administrations and Congresses, and exemplifies what is possible when both parties work together. Aptly named, this bill marks an important first step towards continued, comprehensive criminal justice reform, and a more just America. 
￼ 

Understanding the Benefits of Expanding Industrial Hemp Production 
One of the most exciting areas of opportunity in the recently-passed Farm Bill is the expansion of industrial hemp production, which I have long seen as a tremendous opportunity to grow our agricultural sector in Connecticut. Industrial hemp is an incredibly versatile crop, with over 25,000 different uses, and brings in an estimated $580 million in annual sales in the U.S. Hemp farming is widely seen in Connecticut as an existing opportunity to expand our agricultural markets, which is why I have been a strong supporter of removing outdated federal barriers to cultivation of this crop. 
There’s a lot people don’t know about hemp – and a lot that people get wrong about it. For more information, check out this useful resource. 
￼

A Meeting with the Ukrainian Ambassador 
Last week I met with the Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States Valeriy Chaly as well as Commander of the Ukrainian Army Ihor Voronchenko to receive a briefing on Russia’s seizure of 3 Ukrainian vessels and 24 sailors who remain in detention. This outrageous and flagrant violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and Russia’s international legal obligation can not stand. It is paramount that Russia return the Ukrainian vessels and release the detained sailors safely and expediently.

Transcript: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to what I expect to be my final speech on the House floor.

After eight terms, I have chosen to go home to Texas, the land of my forefathers, and with hope of being a better father and a better husband myself. I'm also going home because I believe America is best served by the Jeffersonian model of American democracy. And that is a citizen legislature.

I fear too many wish to become members of the permanent ruling class. I am not among them. I also know that this congressional seat, Mr. Speaker, it never belonged to me. It belonged to the people of the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. It's always belonged to them. They allowed me to hold it in trust. It was a sacred trust, Mr. Speaker. A sacred trust to be the guardian of their freedoms and their opportunities. And I will always, always be grateful for that privilege. So come January 3, I reverently return their seat back to them. And I wish my successor, Lance Gooden of Kaufman County, Texas, all the best. All the best.

Mr. Speaker, 16 years ago I went to these very same people in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, and I told them, I believe I know what the genius of America is. It's faith, it's family, it's free enterprise, and, yes, it is freedom. And it does indeed all start with faith, because, Mr. Speaker, over your chair right there is emblazoned our national motto: “In God We Trust.” And it is my firm prayer that for our nation, may it always be so. And I firmly believe we cannot be a virtuous nation unless we are first a Godly nation.

People have come to America for many reasons. They've come here for political freedom, economic freedom, but also, most profoundly, for religious freedom. May we never forget Jefferson's prophetic words enshrined, quote, “can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of people that these liberties are gifts of God?” Mr. Speaker, as vital as faith is, so are our families. And the family that made me in College Station, Texas all those years ago was blessed with two wonderful parents. Chase and Anne. My father was a poultry farmer, my mother was a stay-at-home mom. Together they taught me and my siblings invaluable lessons about hard work, fairness, faith, discipline and honesty. In a word, Mr. Speaker, values.

They lovingly led by example, which is what my wife and I attempt to do today with our two children. We now have so many different years of history showing that it is our families that can best perpetuate our values, raise our children and care for our elderly. Now, let me turn to free enterprise.

1776 wasn't just a revolutionary year for America. It was a revolutionary year for free enterprise. For American capitalism. Free market capitalism as well, because it was in that year that Scottish moral philosopher Adam Smith penned its intellectual foundation. In his opus magnum, The Wealth of Nations, prosperity would never, never be the same. We now have over 200 years of history in this country proving that free market capitalism produces the greatest wealth for the greatest number of people.

Yes, free enterprise is about wealth creation. But this not to be confused with materialism. Yes, free enterprise does produce Porches, it produces Jacuzzis, and it produces vacations to Paris. But more importantly, it empowers a factory worker in my district in Mesquite, Texas to start her own business. It helps a family in Jacksonville, Texas, send their first kid to college. It puts ample nutritious food on the kitchen table and that kitchen table is found in a home that some hardworking family in Forney, Texas never dreamed they could own. But they have, because of American free enterprise.

But even perhaps more profound than wealth creation, free market capitalism is really about the pursuit of happiness. It's about the freedom to use your God-given talents to create, to innovate and to produce. To take pride and joy that can only arise from what American Enterprise Institute scholar Arthur Brooks terms “earned success.” As is written in the the book of Isaiah, chapter 65, verse 22: “My chosen ones will long enjoy the work of their hands.”

And finally, freedom, Mr. Speaker. The inalienable right to liberty endowed by our Creator. Never in the vast expanse of time, history and space have the blessings of liberty been enjoyed in greater abundance than they have here in the United States of America. Only in America are you only limited by the size of your dreams. As my friend and mentor, former Senator Phil Graham, is fond of saying, only in America can ordinary people achieve extraordinary results. Mr. Speaker, generations, generations of our forefathers have taken up arms in defense of liberty and found it worthy of the very sacrifice of their lives.

There is no greater foundational principle to the American people than liberty. Personal liberty, political liberty, religious liberty and economic liberty. May we in this body always fight to preserve it.

Now, in the federal city, political calculus changes by the moment. Policies come and go, but principles endure and there are no more enduring or foundational principles in America than faith, family, free enterprise and freedom.

I believed it 16 years ago when I came to this body, I believe it even more fervently today, Mr. Speaker. Now, Mr. Speaker, I have learned a couple of things in my 16 years of service in Congress. One thing I learned is that when one announces their retirement, two things happen. One, people begin to say nice things about you. Had I known about this phenomena earlier, perhaps I would have retired years ago.

Second of all, reporters ask you about your so-called legacy. Mr. Speaker, I have to laugh because I'm not sure there's anything as soon forgotten in the federal city than as a former member in Congress. So I don't think in terms of legacy. I frankly don't know if I have changed Washington, but, Mr. Speaker, I know Washington didn't change me.

I do take solace, though, and I take a measure of pride knowing that along with a handful of other conservatives in this body, I fought steadfastly against the forces of what I view crony capitalism. And that be either by earmark, set aside, subsidies, tax preferences or trade protectionism. Particularly now, as the specter of socialism once again rears its ugly head in our nation, we can never let our fellow countrymen somehow confuse free market capitalism with crony capitalism. In the one, your success depends upon how hard and how smart you work on Main Street. In the other, it depends on who you know in Washington. The latter is a threat to the former, and the Republican Party will lose its moral authority to prevent a social welfare state if we ever acquiesce to a corporate welfare state. This, we cannot allow to happen.

Mr. Speaker, you know personally, as does the previous speaker, the gentlelady from New York, how much pride I take in the work of the great men and women of the House Financial Services Committee. Most Americans today are seeing the best economy that they have ever seen in their lifetimes, and that is in no small measure to the work of the men and women of the House Financial Services Committee. I’m not going to argue that our work was on the same order of magnitude as tax reform, it wasn’t’. But the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act signed by President Trump was the most pro-growth banking bill in a generation and has certainly done more to grow our economy than any other legislation passed by the House besides tax reform. Now, Mr. Speaker, economic growth cannot solve all of America's problems, but it lifts the downtrodden from poverty. It empowers middle-income America and enables tens of millions to achieve their version of the American dream.

It has indeed, for 16 years of my service, been worth fighting for. And as I prepare to leave office, Mr. Speaker, I leave with many, many hopes. And Mr. Speaker, I leave with a few fears as well that I believe my fellow countrymen should pay attention to.

First, I'm concerned about the state of America’s entrepreneurial spirit. I wonder how long we will have robust economic growth if the government continues a regulatory onslaught against American business in attempt to render all risk out of our financial system. From its earliest beginnings, America has always been the land of the entrepreneur, the land of the dreamer and the risk taker and, yes, that includes the risk of failure. Several of the colonies, such as Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, and Virginia were founded not by the Crown of England, but by profit-seeking corporations that were willing to take risks. You know, someone who clearly understood something about risks was Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, I believe still the largest company in the world. In an interview, Jobs was once asked how he thought about himself. He said “I look at myself as sort of a trapeze artist.” And then the reporter asked, is that one with or without a net? He didn’t bat an eyelash, he said “Without.”

Steve Jobs was a risk-taker, and because he took a risk, Apple again became the most valuable company in the world whose innovations have revolutionized our lives. And what’s important isn’t the amount of money that Steve Jobs made, but what he was able to do with it. And that is to create a successful company, to employ and serve millions who have collectively exercised their God-given right to pursue happiness.

Fewer entrepreneurs taking fewer risks means fewer jobs, Mr. Speaker. It's that simple. And so one day, if we lose our ability to fail in America, we will soon lose our ability to succeed. There are simply too many burdensome regulations that crush the entrepreneurial spirit. This must cease.

Another fear I have, Mr. Speaker, I fear we are drifting away from our Constitutional mooring as I witness the rise of the administrative state, Because we need to appreciate our birthright, the sheer genius of the Constitution, which, unfortunately, today is threatened. Our Constitution’s framework of checks and balances, limited government, and co-equal branches of government, that has secured our fundamental rights and given us the freest, most prosperous society that the world has ever known.

But we are witnessing a century-long liberal expansion of unconstitutional government that has unleashed the modern regulatory state as we know it. Extremely powerful, exceedingly intrusive, imperiously opaque, bafflingly bureaucratic, and alarmingly unaccountable. Instead of being governed by the rule of law, increasingly citizens are being ruled by the rule of rulers.  Specifically the rules promulgated by legions of unaccountable, unelected bureaucrats. The result? It’s OSHA now, that governs over workplace safety. It’s the E.P.A. now, not Congress, that governs over our air quality. It’s H.H.S., not Congress, that now governs over our healthcare.

Today the citizens' right to carefully deliberate proposed legislation through their chosen, elected representatives in Congress is now reduced to nothing than little more than a notice and comment period where the citizens are permitted to lodge complaints and suggestions, all of which the unelected bureaucrats are free to ignore and which they may actually use to retaliate against the citizens. Madison in Federalist 47 warned us of this phenomena when he wrote the combination of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny. It's time for Congress to reclaim its constitutional power of the purse, to no longer allow these economically significant rules to pass without congressional approval, and to outlaw the Chevron doctrine that has tilted the scales of justice towards the state. This must change.

The next fear I have as I get ready to leave Congress, Mr. Speaker, is one that has really come about fairly recently in the state of our union, and that is the tenor and tone of the national debate. In other words, what is happening in our public square.

Now, on the one hand, for those who believe we are on the precipice of something truly catastrophic, I remind them: we have survived a bloody Civil War. We survived the turbulent 60’s of my youth. Politics has rhetorically always been a full-contact body sport, and if you read biographies of our founders such as Jefferson, Adams, and Hamilton, you will discover just how coarse and vile ad hominem attacks could be at the dawn of American politics.

But with the exception of the notorious Alien and Sedition Acts, I don't recall ever there being a greater effort in our nation’s history to ever actually silence dissent. The cry for civility in political discourse, as welcome as it is, is actually somewhat misplaced. The threat to democracy does not come from incivility, but from instead those who are committed to preventing the debate as opposed to winning the debate. That’s where the true threat comes.
Democratic self-governance relies on a free flow of differing ideas within the public square to fully inform all opinions and challenge all accepted orthodoxies and ideologies. And there was a time in America’s history that the American ethos was encapsulated by the words that had been attributed to Patrick Henry: “I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it.” Regrettably, I can hear all over the nation today people saying something along the lines of “I disapprove of what you say, and I'm going to harass and intimidate you and your family, defame your character, and attempt to take away your livelihood until you simply shut up and withdraw.”

Those who do not respect the rights of others to be heard in the public square may be little better than book burners and represent a clear and present danger to American democracy. It is a time for every citizen who cares about the destiny of their nation. It is time for courage, but it is a time also for goodwill and mutual respect among our citizens. It is time to re-secure our democratic values in the public square.
Mr. Speaker, my greatest fear for my nation, though, is our national debt. When I first came to Congress, the national debt was 6.7 trillion dollars. Today, it has tripled. Tripled.

My greatest regret in public office is my inability to convince more of my colleagues and more of my fellow citizens of the peril of this national debt. We are experiencing debt to G.D.P. ratios that haven’t been seen since World War II. But in World War II, they were episodic and temporary. Today's debt is structural and permanent. As a veteran of the so-called “Super Committee,” Simpson-Bowles Deficit Reduction Committee, and now Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, my iPad is awash in reports saying that our national debt is simply unsustainable, yet denial, justification and obstruction continue to rule the day.

We should all be troubled and sobered by the fact that if one carefully reviews history, you will find few examples of republics that have existed beyond 200 years. And most of those republics met their demise through some kind of fiscal crisis. There is so much at stake.
Now Mr. Speaker, in my heart and in my head, I don't really believe that America one day will wake up and become Greece, But I do believe that we are on the path, within a generation, to being a second-rate economic power, a second-rate military power, and frankly a second-rate moral authority as we become the first generation in American history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. It is beyond time for both a spending limit to the United States Constitution and fundamental reforms of our current entitlement programs for future generations. It is not too late to take America off the road to national bankruptcy.
Mr. Speaker, I spent the last few minutes speaking about my fears, but please note that I have far, far more hope than I have fear as I come to the House floor for the last time to give a speech.

Most Americans, as I observe, are enjoying the greatest economy in their lifetimes. Oh, what a difference that has made in the lives of millions of Americans. And indeed, to borrow a phrase from the past, it is morning in America again.

Opportunity abounds like few periods in our nation's history. In our military might that has been hollowed out, it is being rebuilt, and it is respected and feared around the globe again. As we look at our nation's history we cannot but conclude that we live in a time of relative peace, relative security, and we should always, always be grateful. But the main reason I come to this floor tonight so hopeful, so hopeful for the future because of the people I’ve met in the 5th District of Texas that I’ve had this privilege to represent. I’ve met great entrepreneurs like Sam Bistrian of Lake Highlands. You know, he immigrated to this country as a 12-year old boy from Romania, didn’t even speak the language. And a few years later, he managed to get a job at one of the local retailers, Neiman Marcus. He got a job starting at the bottom, I think it was stocking shelves. And with hard work and vision, he ended up one day launching his own line of designer rain boots called Roma, and now heads up a multi-million dollar enterprise and, oh by the way, he gives his boots away to poor people all over the world.

Another entrepreneur I met is Rick Carmona from Terrell, Texas. As a kid, he used to visit a local Tex-Mex restaurant and after going there a few times, he said “you know what, my mom cooks better food than this.” After saving his money from a number of jobs, he finally took the great leap. He invested his money, took out a small loan and started his own restaurant. He seated the customers, he bussed the tables. His mom did the cooking. His office consisted of a back table and pen behind his ear. A couple of decades later, he runs one of the most successful restaurants in the entire county because of his entrepreneurial vision.

I also have hope because I met great patriots. Patriots like Doc Collins from Van Zandt County, who is a real conservative leader from that county. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, he has bone cancer that he continues to battle. But during a recent election, he got chemo in the morning for his bone cancer and he was working the polling places in the afternoon because he felt that strongly about his cause and his country.

And then, Mr. Speaker, there’s Howard Banks of Kaufman, Texas. I wish that everyone could me this wonderful patriot. He’s legally blind, he’s a World War II veteran, and he flies Old Glory every day. Every day. One day, some no-account vandal decided he would take Mr. Banks’ flag, and Mr. Banks fought him. He fought him. He is age 92 and he still decided that he would fight for and he was willing to die for his American flag and the country it represents. These patriots inspire me, Mr. Speaker.

And then there are the social entrepreneurs that I have met in the Fifth District of Texas. People like Morgan Jones of Athens, Texas. He owns a pawn shop and every single year, what he’ll do is he’ll take himself and all of his managers on mercy ships to Africa in order to deliver care and gifts. This is something that he does at his expense.

There are so many people I wish had time to mention in the Fifth district of Texas who represent the best of America. I don't have all that time, Mr. Speaker, so let me mention one more. Ken Watterson of Terrell, Texas. I mean, he is a bulldog of a Marine veteran and he opened the Veterans Resource Center not a block, maybe two blocks away from the Dallas VA hospital. And now, if homeless veterans will go to the VA hospital to get their healthcare, as soon as they come out, they can get clean clothes, they can get showers, they can get counseling, they can get access to computers and people to help them find a job in society. So, Mr. Speaker, when I see entrepreneurs and good Samaritans who are stepping up every day in the Fifth District of Texas, I know America has a very bright future ahead.

So let me simply conclude where I began. For me it's time for me to go home. It is time to go home to my family, it is time to go home to Texas. All things must pass, including our congressional service. I continue to have so many blessings in my life, but, Mr. Speaker, I don't believe I'll ever have a greater privilege than fighting for freedom and opportunity in the People's House, the House of Representatives. My heart is just full of gratitude. Full of gratitude to my staff whose work empowered me. Full of gratitude to my constituents whose encouragement and prayers supported me. And most of all, to my family. So much gratitude to Melissa, Claire, and Travis, whose support, love, and grace have sustained me all those 16 years. They are my rock.

Here's what I know after 16 years, Mr. Speaker. I know if we will continue to trust in God, I know if we will continue to revere freedom, I know that if we will keep faith with our founders' vision, our children will have brighter futures, and our republic will be forever preserved. May God continue to shed his grace on this great country. And for the final time on the House floor, I yield back the balance of my time.

Dear friends,

As of the time we distributed this newsletter on Friday afternoon, the leaders of the Senate and House were still negotiating with the president on a path forward to fund the rest of the federal government and avoid a partial government shutdown.
Criminal Justice Reform 
On Tuesday, I voted for bipartisan legislation to reform the criminal justice system in the United States and make our communities safer. The First Step Act of 2018 passed the Senate by a vote of 87-12. After passing the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, the legislation was signed into law by President Trump this morning.   In addition to lowering crime rates, enhancing prison security and improving officer safety, the First Step Act of 2018, also reforms mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines and prepares inmates for a successful return to society.  In Georgia, we’ve already seen positive results from our criminal justice reform efforts led by Governor Nathan Deal, and I’m glad to see this push at the federal level, because we know it can work. Representative Doug Collins deserves real credit for this bipartisan effort, which has earned widespread support in Congress, from our state and law enforcement officials, our churches and faith communities. These reforms can help change lives and help ensure a better long-term outcome by focusing on rehabilitation of low-level, non-violent offenders so that they can become productive members of our society.   Record Two Years of Accomplishments for Veterans  On Wednesday, I was pleased to see the Senate pass a package of 18 pieces of veterans’ legislation to improve veterans’ education and burial benefits, prevent veteran homelessness, and improve the transition process for veterans and their families. The passage of this legislation caps off a remarkable two years in Congress. We have passed significant reforms to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to improve the daily lives of our nation’s veterans.   During this 2017-2018 Congress, the Senate passed 25 pieces of legislation, which have all been signed into law or await the president’s signature, to reform veterans’ health care and benefits and to make the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) more responsive to the veterans it serves. Of those bills, some of the most significant reforms include the VA MISSION Act, the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, and the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017.  At the start of this Congress in January 2017, we set political party differences aside and vowed to find common ground on behalf of veterans. We now have significant, positive results to show for it. I look forward to continuing our efforts into the new year by working with my colleagues in Congress, President Trump and VA Secretary Wilkie to meet these challenges head on and transform the VA into a department worthy of our veterans.
￼
In Other News
	•	On Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs joined the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs for a joint hearing to review the progress made by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on its implementation of the VA MISSION Act. The legislation streamlines the department’s community care programs and removes bureaucratic obstacles to care in the community for veterans. I will continue to keep a close watch to ensure the VA implements this law as Congress intended.
	•	On Wednesday, I spoke on the Senate floor to honor two-term Governor Nathan Deal and thank him for his eight years of leadership that have led to positive results for Georgia. Governor Deal, First Lady Sandra Deal, and his chief of staff Chris Riley have made a huge difference for our state - the eighth largest in population, and the number one state for business. Their leadership will be missed. 
￼
	•	This week, Senator Lamar Alexander announced his retirement in 2020. Senator Alexander’s decision to retire in 2020 is a great loss to me personally, because he has been a great friend. More importantly, he has been a great son of Tennessee, U.S. secretary of education, president of the University of Tennessee and a committed public servant. I can’t thank Lamar enough for his work, and I look forward to continuing to work together with him during the next two years.
￼
What’s on Tap?
Dianne and I wish everyone celebrating a blessed Christmas and a happy New Year. The next Congress is scheduled to convene on Jan. 3, 2019.   Sincerely, ￼
In Case You Missed It

Long’s Short Report – 115th Congress: Cutting taxes, rolling back regulations and fighting opioid abuse
By Rep. Billy Long
Soon after the 115th Congress kicked off, President Trump promised the end of all talk and no action. Over the past two years Congress has worked hard to make good on this promise by passing landmark legislation that cuts taxes, combats opioid abuse and rolls back regulations.
I’ve always felt hard working taxpayers should be able to hold on to as much of their own money as possible. In 2017, Republicans came together and passed H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which modernized our decades old tax system. This bill decreases the number of tax brackets, increases the child tax credit and provides new incentives for small businesses to expand. Since we passed tax reform, nearly two million jobs have been added to the economy, the unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been since 1969 and the American people have more money in their pockets.
Along with tax reform, Republicans have spent the last two years rolling back Obama-era regulations that have cost businesses millions of dollars. During their first year, small businesses will spend more than $83,000 to stay compliant with regulations. Given their excessive cost, more than half of small businesses say that regulations are their top concern. Republicans have worked hard to pass legislation limiting the federal government’s role and ensuring businesses can thrive. Since 2017, we have passed bills that increase congressional oversight, such as the Midnight Rules Relief Act, and bills that roll back regulations entirely, such as the BRICK Act, which targets abusive environmental regulations.
While I’m proud of the work my colleagues and I have done cutting taxes and rolling back regulations, I’m especially proud of the work we have done combatting the opioid epidemic. This bipartisan issue brought together both parties, leading to the passage of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which targets treatment, recovery, prevention, communities and combatting fentanyl. H.R. 6 directly helps communities impacted by this epidemic by creating recovery centers for those struggling with addiction, increasing research and boosting telehealth technologies.
While the 115th Congress was filled with a number of accomplishments that will make life better for many Americans, I look forward to continuing our efforts during the 116th Congress.

Dear Friend: 
As the 115th Congress comes to an end, it is important to reflect on the progress we made for Oregon’s Second District over the last two years.  
￼ 
Click here or on the image above to view my remarks 
We made historic strides in the fight against the opioid crisis, which now takes the lives of more Oregonians than traffic accidents. Throughout our district, I heard from victims, families, and those on the front lines of combating opioid abuse in Oregon. My bipartisan legislation -- the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act -- that was signed into law in October, provides new tools and resources to help stem the tide of opioid addiction and save lives. 
We also passed into law the most significant reforms to forest management in more than a decade. That includes fixing the way we pay to fight wildfires, so that we aren’t robbing forest management funds to pay for firefighting costs. Beginning in 2020, we will finally treat wildfires like the natural disasters that they are. There is more to be done to protect our communities from smoke, but this is important progress towards that goal. 
I am also proud of the work we did to strengthen public health programs upon which patients in Oregon rely. I worked hard to pass into law historic extensions of the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and boost funding for community health centers. Both provide crucial health care to people and families in our district, and the resources Congress provided will ensure these programs can continue serving our communities. 
And bipartisan measures I helped pass into law will help boost hydropower production in Oregon, connect rural areas of our district with high speed broadband, and give communities resources to put old industrial sites back into economic use through the Brownfields program, which is being used from Grants Pass, to Bend, to Pendleton. 
Most importantly, we provided our veterans with unprecedented resources so they can get the care and support they deserve at the VA. That includes my legislation to bring medical scribes into the VA, so that doctors are not burdened by paperwork, and can spend more time caring for veterans. And we boosted funding for our military to give them the tools they need to safely carry out their missions to defend freedom around the world. 
I look forward to continuing this bipartisan progress in the next session of Congress.  
There is much to be done to improve forest management to reduce catastrophic wildfires that choke our communities with smoke. After another devastating wildfire season across our state, we need to redouble our efforts to save our forests and communities from fire and destruction. 
We should be using the proven management tools that work in eastern Oregon forests in all of Oregon’s forests. When we’re losing towns, and people, and firefighters, and our communities are choked with smoke, we need to do a better job in the way that we manage our forests. 
We also must continue our efforts to increase transparency and patient control in our health care system, which will help bring down drug costs. And I will continue to look for solutions to help connect rural communities with the 21st Century economy and crack down on the bad actors contributing to the spread of the opioid crisis. 
None of this is possible without the feedback of people on the ground in our district. Through roundtable meetings, in person and telephone town halls, and more than 168,000 messages responded to, I added a lot to my “to-do” list over the last two years.  
I am committed to adding more to that to-do-list in the upcoming session of Congress as I continue to reach across the aisle to solve problems and get results for the people of the Second District.

It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. Congress.

Let’s face it: the House of Representatives has been a disaster for the last eight years. In the past two years alone, with Republicans in charge of Congress and White House, we’ve seen an alarming rise in hate crimes and ugly rhetoric, a ballooning deficit, and an unfair tax policy penalizing every day Americans. Even the minimal steps to we’ve taken to address the climate crisis have been under constant attack and Trump and his Republicans are spiraling us into our third government shutdown in one year.
As their eight-year grip in the House comes to an end, Republicans have left a trail of failure and missed opportunities, and making a broken tax system worse. The Republican tax bill added $2 trillion to the deficit and put Medicare, Medicaid, and the middle class at risk. Most benefits flow to the largest corporations and the wealthiest 1 percent—further widening the income gap.
As Paul Ryan ends his tenure as Speaker of the House, it gave us an opportunity to reflect on his legacy which:
	•	Exploded the deficit with increased spending, especially for defense and nuclear weapons; 
	•	Made a hash of the tax code while increasing income inequality; 
	•	Pushed Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda and separated desperate families;
	•	Continued the GOP assault the healthcare system;
	•	Made no meaningful steps to prevent the epidemic of gun violence; 
	•	Rolled back Wall Street reform; and 
	•	Refused to stand up to Trump and his reckless administration.
No wonder Ryan led his party to the largest defeat in 42 years. When history is written, the story of Republican congressional rule will be one of heartless policies, spineless complicity, and thoughtless decision-making.
There is a bright spot: their time in power is coming to an end. In 13 days, Democrats will take back control of the House, keep the liar-in-chief in check, and push for our vision of America—one that does not include a wall. I’m focused on rebuilding and renewing America’s crumbling infrastructure, advancing Medicare-for-all, and developing a Green New Deal to address the climate crisis. Perhaps most important, Congress will finally conduct much-needed oversight on Trump and his administration.
With Democrats in control of the House and dozens of exciting new members, in 13 days, we all can get to work.
 

Courage,

Dear Friend,   
This week, I grew even more concerned about our erratic President and his sudden and reckless decisions on withdrawing troops from Syria that resulted in the Defense Secretary quitting, and his insistence on a $5 billion border wall that, as I write, has us approaching another partial government shutdown.  I also saw our Stop, Observe, Ask and Respond (SOAR) to Health and Wellness Training Act passed by both the House and Senate, planned for my January 18 District Issues Meeting, voted for a significant criminal justice reform bill that will now become law, questioned the Homeland Security Secretary about the rise in hate crimes, asked Governor Bill Haslam to look at possible clemency for a juvenile victim of sex trafficking, praised Senator Lamar Alexander’s long service to our state following his announcement that he will retire in 2020, and offered a health tip about drinking and driving during the holidays. Keep reading to learn more about my week and follow me on Twitter and Facebook to see more updates as they happen. 
Expressing Concern about More Bad Decisions by an Impulsive President  Passing the SOAR Act   Holding a District Issues Meeting January 18  Passing the First Step Act  Questioning Homeland Security Secretary about Hate Crimes  Asking Governor Haslam to Consider Clemency for Cyntoia Brown  Praising Senator Alexander for his Service  Offering U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars    Weekly Health Tip  Quote of the Week  

Expressing Concern about More Bad Decisions by an Impulsive President 
This week we faced more alarmingly impulsive decisions by President Trump. After indicating he would support a bipartisan compromise to keep the government open, he suddenly reversed course, and now, as I write this, it appears we may be heading for a partial government shutdown.  Even more alarming, the President surprised our allies, Republican members of Congress and even his own advisors by announcing that ISIS had been defeated and that he would hastily withdraw American troops from Syria.  The move was so alarming, Defense Secretary Mattis announced his resignation.  The only person happy about the move seems to be Russian President Vladimir Putin.  I will continue to work to ensure that America works with our allies to protect our nation’s citizens from ISIS and all other threats. 
Passing the SOAR Act  
￼ 
On Thursday, I voted for and the House passed my Stop, Observe, Ask and Respond (SOAR) to Health and Wellness Training Act addressing human trafficking. This followed Senate passage earlier in the week. The SOAR Act was inspired by an event for front-line health and public safety officials at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center two years ago, and will go a long way toward combatting human trafficking. See my press release about it here. 
Holding a District Issues Meeting January 18 
￼ 
My district staff and I will be hosting my annual District Issues Meeting on January 18 between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. at the Clifford Davis/Odell Horton Federal Building, 167 North Main, Suite 369. I look forward to hearing from you and updating you on my work for the 9th Congressional District. 
Passing the First Step Act 
On Thursday, the House followed the Senate in passing the First Step Act, the first major criminal justice reform measure in a long time, and one that will shorten sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, give judges more latitude to work around mandatory sentences where appropriate, and allow offenders who were sentenced before Congress reduced the disparity between penalties for crack and powder cocaine in 2010 to petition to have their cases re-evaluated for possible sentence reductions. I have long championed these causes and will be pleased to see these reforms implemented. See my press release about it here. 
Questioning Homeland Security Secretary about Hate Crimes 
On Thursday, I questioned Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen about the President’s sudden, reckless and dangerous declaration that ISIS had been defeated and decision to withdraw American troops from Syria and discovered she had not been consulted beforehand. I also asked her about the President’s use of racial, ethnic and anti-Semitic dog whistle and code words and whether they have contributed to the rise in hate crimes. See our exchange here.  
Asking Governor Haslam to Consider Clemency for Cyntoia Brown 
This week, Shelby County Commission Chairman Van Turner and Commissioners Willie Brooks, Tami Sawyer and Mikell Lowery and state Senator Katrina Robinson this week sought clemency for Cyntoia Brown, a juvenile victim of sex trafficking. Last week, I wrote a letter asking Governor Bill Haslam to consider Ms. Brown’s case for clemency and released the letter on Wednesday. See my press release about it here. 
Praising Senator Alexander for his Service 
￼  
On Monday, Senator Lamar Alexander announced he would retire in 2020. It has been my pleasure to have a fine working relationship with Senator Alexander in Congress as well as when he was Governor.  We have partnered often to the benefit of Tennessee.  I worked with then-Governor Alexander as a state senator on the Tennessee State Scenic Highway legislation and, in Congress, on the 21st Century Cures Act which delivered important resources to the National Institutes of Health for medical research, particularly on Alzheimer’s. I look forward to continuing to work with him over the next two years. I know he is looking forward to spending more time with his wife Honey and his wonderful family, and wish him well. 
Offering U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars   
￼  
My office has a limited number of 2019 U.S. Capitol Historical Society calendars available. If you would like to receive a calendar, please complete this form on my website. Due to the rules of the House, I can mail calendars only to residents of Tennessee’s 9th Congressional District. Please feel free to share this email with other residents of the 9th District who may be interested in receiving one but who do not receive my e-Newsletter.   
Signing Up for “Congress On Your Corner” and this e-Newsletter   

￼    
I enjoy meeting regularly with constituents in the district and helping get answers for them to questions about dealing with federal agencies. If you are interested in attending one of my “Congress on Your Corner” events, you can sign up here to receive notification as soon as the next event is scheduled.   
For those who haven’t participated in a telephone town hall, it’s easy to sign up for them by using this form.

Weekly Health Tip 

￼ 
With holiday season upon us, many of us will be going to Christmas, New Year’s Eve and other festivities where drinks are served. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests you save yourself and many others a lot of grief by designating a sober driver to take you home. See its advice here. 
Quote of the Week 
￼ 
“My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.” -- Secretary of Defense James Mattis in his letter of resignation Thursday. 
I want to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! 
As always, I remain  Most Sincerely, 

 ￼

￼  

Friends, 
As the year draws to a close, I wanted to take the time to share a few of the things we accomplished in 2018. I put together my 2018 Year in Review report to highlight all of the work my office did this year on the issues that matter most to Connecticut. Here are a few of the highlights: 
￼ 
CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL REPORT 
I’m proud of the what we’ve been able to accomplish. This year three of my bills were signed into law – the bipartisan Fix NICS Act to improve the background check system, the Recovery COACH Act to help people in recovery from substance abuse, and the Honor Our Commitment Act, which provides access to mental health care for more than 500,000 veterans who were previously ineligible. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I secured federal funding to grow jobs in our state.
At times, this year was tough. I’ve always said I’ll work with President Trump if he’s doing something good for Connecticut and the country. But too often, President Trump’s actions and rhetoric divide us. I fought back against President Trump’s dismantling of the health care system and his reckless immigration policies, and I’m committed to doing everything I can to fight for Connecticut values.
By far, the highlight of my year was hearing from so many people in Connecticut – at town hall meetings, during my walk across the state, and through the calls and letters you’ve sent to my office. I want to thank you for taking the time to reach out to me this year to share your thoughts and opinions. Your feedback helps me be a better Senator, and I couldn’t do this job without you.
Wishing you and your family a happy new year. 
Every best wish, 
Senator Chris Murphy

Dear Neighbor,
We care about rehabilitating our nation’s prison population so that when re-entering society they can make a positive impact on their communities.
Six months ago, the Problem Solvers Caucus was approached by Jared Kushner, Van Jones and Grover Norquist to take a look at the bill, provide feedback and have bipartisan support.
Earlier this week, the House and Senate passed a criminal justice reform package that has been signed by the President.  Reforms in the First Step Act include:
	•	Overhauling the federal sentencing system to lower mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes – excluding heroin and fentanyl. 
	•	Expanding job training. 
	•	Boosting early-release opportunities. 
A bill like this gives people a second chance at life that they might not have had to make an impact on the community and better their lives.
We need more bipartisan bills like this in Congress because when members from across the aisle work together, the American people win.
 
Until next time,
￼
Tom

Border Wall Funding
Dear Friend, 
As you may know, this week, Congress has been debating border wall funding.  
We have a national security crisis in our country, and our Commander-in-Chief has asked for the necessary resources to defend our sovereign borders and protect our citizens and communities. 
I am proud to stand with him in his efforts to secure the border and stop illegal immigration by voting to give him the funding he requested for the border wall and other physical barriers. 
There is no country without borders; there is no freedom without security; and the first and most important job of the federal government is to keep the American people safe.

Max Hollis and Jeff Yang demonstrate their winning app to Congressman Elijah E. Cummings. 
On December 17, I named Mr. Max Hollis and Mr. Jeff Yang the winners of the 2018 Congressional App Challenge for Maryland’s 7th Congressional District.

Congressman Elijah E. Cummings introduces a financial aid panel at the 22nd annual How to Pay for College Seminar.  
On December 3, I hosted my 22nd annual How to Pay for College Seminar. High school students and their parents were invited to learn about the educational opportunities and financial assistance available to enable the students to attain a college education. Seminar attendees learned about college academic programs, federal and state financial aid programs, private scholarships, SAT preparation, and the college admissions process. Representatives from community and state colleges, public and private universities, and scholarship organizations were on hand to answer questions.
If you missed this event, but are looking for information about how to pay for college, please contact my office at (410) 685-9199. Or, you can review my scholarship guide.  
  
In Washington

On November 30, I joined Dr. Leana Wen, President of Planned Parenthood and former Baltimore City Health Commissioner, and my congressional colleagues to observe World AIDS Day. We remembered all those who we have lost to HIV/AIDS and honored their memory by recommitting ourselves to fighting HIV/AIDS. To find out more information about HIV/AIDS, best practices to prevent its transmission, and living with HIV please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website. Through educating one another about HIV/AIDS and working against the stigma associated with the disease, we move ever closer to achieving an AIDS-free generation.

At the 2018 How to Pay for College Seminar, I reconnected with Mr. Tyrese Springer. Back in 2012, Mr. Springer’s mother, Ms. Toyanda Wimby, reached out to me informing me that her son was being bullied at his elementary school. I worked with the family and Baltimore County Public Schools to transfer Mr. Springer to a new school where he became excited about school and was able to excel in his studies.

Christmas Traditions
Christmas brings with it many traditions and memories. Whether a family gathering, an annual party, a song, a food, or something else, almost everyone has something they look forward to savoring at this time of year.
I recall from my childhood the delight my sister Betsy and I took for years in a Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer decoration my mother made for her classroom and brought home from the school where she taught. It was a profile cutout with the body covered in white cotton balls and a red ball nose. From when we were three or four years old to about fifteen, we insisted that it hang on the door of our little house on Broad Street, even having it remade when the original one wore out.
Certain songs and books centered on Christmas still strike a chord, year after year, and I have used this column during the holiday season to dwell on some of my favorites, each with its own backstory making it especially powerful or resonant.
For example, to return to Rudolph, this story originated with a Montgomery Ward catalog writer named Robert L. May. He created the red-nosed reindeer for a coloring book the store gave to children, pouring himself into it after his wife passed away. With the help of his brother-in-law, a composer, May then fashioned the story into a song. Several high-profile singers passed on recording it, so the legend goes, but Gene Autry’s wife persuaded him to sing it. His version is the one most familiar to us.
In 2014, I wrote in my Christmas column about Charles Dickens’ first novel, The Pickwick Papers, which he published in 1837. One of its stories involved a lonely, miserable man, who on Christmas Eve was shown the past and the future by supernatural beings and reformed his life as a consequence.
If this story strikes you as familiar even though you have never read The Pickwick Papers, you may recognize it as the general plot to a book Dickens published six years later. A Christmas Carol, Dickens’ tale of the reformation of the miser Ebenezer Scrooge after his haunting by the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future, remains widely beloved, both as a book and in its various cinematic and theatrical adaptations. Just in the past few weeks, I enjoyed a play based on Dickens’ book with my family.
Each Christmas we revisit the traditions that mean the most to us. As other circumstances in our lives change over the years, the songs, stories, or other traditions of the holiday season maintain their familiar, timeless aspects. Even in the most horrific conditions, they can provide comfort.
This is what happened in 1914 along the Western Front during World War I, as I wrote in my 2016 Christmas column. On Christmas Eve, German soldiers in their trenches sang “Silent Night,” and the British responded with “The First Noel.” A few soldiers ventured from each side and met in “No Man’s Land” between the trenches, and soon hundreds met to swap gifts and play soccer in what is remembered as the Christmas Truce.
Whatever it is about this season that you most enjoy, I hope that you can spend this time in safety with your family and friends.
I will close with the subject of my first Christmas column, in 2011, which told the story of I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day. This carol began as a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow called Christmas Bells. He wrote it in the 1860s after he lost his wife, killed in a fire that left him badly burned, and after his son was severely wounded in the Civil War.
Despite these twin tragedies, the bells of Christmas still offered hope to Longfellow, as well as his fellow men and women:
I heard the bells on Christmas day Their old familiar carols play, And wild and sweet the words repeat Of peace on earth, good will to men...   Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:  ""God is not dead; nor doth he sleep! The Wrong shall fail, The Right prevail, With peace on earth, good will to men!
No matter what your particular faith, peace on Earth, good will to men!

12/21/18 14:05,a simple choice,"￼
￼
Dear friend, 

Yesterday, the House voted to pass legislation to fund the federal government and allocate money towards border security -  without a single Democrat vote. I joined the vast majority of my Republican colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.

For me this was a simple choice – stand with President Trump, keep the government open and build the border wall. 

Democrats would prefer to have open borders, despite the risk this poses to our national security and the thousands of Border Agents who risk their lives to protect our sovereignty and secure the border. 

This is political gamesmanship at its worst. The safety and security of our citizens and our homeland are not pawns, and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer should be ashamed for treating them as such.

I know my constituents are deeply concerned about border security, so rest assured that I will continue to stand beside President Trump as he fights to prioritize our national security.

Sincerely,
￼

Congress has until Friday to pass spending legislation and avoid a partial government shutdown, but there have been disagreements over certain aspects of the budget, notably funding for a border wall. President Trump has threatened to shut the government down until the border wall is fully funded. Democrat leaders in Congress refuse to support a measure that provides border wall funding, causing a stalemate. 


 Would you support a partial federal government shutdown over border wall funding? 

A border wall is critically important to our security and so I would support a partial government shutdown to get funding for it. 

A border wall is important but not enough to shut down portions of the federal government. 

I oppose shutting down the federal government for any reason - it's just irresponsible. 

I oppose a border wall and efforts to fund it completely.

 Keeping the Government Open 
I oppose government shutdowns and in Congress have consistently voted to keep the government open. That’s why I voted to fund the government this week with additional funding for border security and disaster aid, and I will continue to vote to keep the government open. This political brinkmanship is misguided and unnecessary. Our district is home to many DHS personnel who could be affected if government funding were to lapse. Furloughs could affect border traffic and security, and many personnel would be forced to work without the guarantee of a paycheck right before Christmas. In the event of a partial government shutdown, my offices will remain accessible for constituents who need assistance. 
Supporting North Country Agriculture 
￼  
This week, President Trump signed the Farm Bill into law. I thank the President and all of my colleagues who worked tirelessly to deliver this important legislation for our North Country farmers. Getting the Farm Bill across the finish line was my top priority for the end of this year, and I am pleased that this law will deliver important wins for our district. This law includes reforms to help our dairy farmers, increases access to rural broadband, improves conservation and environmental stewardship, and provides resources to combat the heroin and opioid epidemic affecting many families in our region. I will continue to work on behalf of our North Country farmers in Congress. Click here to read more about the wins for our district in the Farm Bill.   
Reforming our Criminal Justice System 
￼ 
I proudly helped the House pass the FIRST STEP Act -- an important piece of legislation to reform our criminal justice system. This legislation provides important reforms that enhance public safety and expand programs to help inmates prepare for release with education and vocational training, and drug-abuse recovery courses. I'm grateful to Republicans and Democrats in both chambers of Congress for reaching this important bipartisan agreement, and look forward to President Trump signing it into law. 
Wishing you a Merry Christmas! 
￼ 
I wanted to take a moment to wish you and your loved ones a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. The holiday season is a time to enjoy traditions with friends and family. Though we may celebrate the season differently, Christmas unites all of us around the shared values of charity and gratitude. This season, let us remember to keep the vulnerable and less fortunate in our prayers, and do all that we can to spread the Christmas spirit to others through good will and charity. 
Let us also recognize the sacrifices being made by members of our armed forces – including members of the 10th Mountain Division – who are deployed this Christmas while risking their lives to keep us safe. It has been my honor to serve you and your families this year, and I’m looking forward to accomplishing even more together next Congress. 
From my family to yours, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Press Republican: Congresswoman praises Adirondack 46s stewardship, mentorship 
Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R, Schuylerville) recognized the 100th anniversary of the formation of the Adirondack 46ers from the House Floor earlier this week. To be eligible for membership in the Adirondack 46ers, hikers must climb all 46 peaks of the Adirondack Mountains. In the century since its founding, more than 10,000 have completed the challenge. “Since their founding by brothers Bob and George Marshall,” Stefanik said, in part, “the 46ers have been central to promoting environmental stewardship, protecting our natural resources, and encouraging younger generations to enjoy the great outdoors.

News from Representative Gary Palmer
￼
Dear Friend, 
At this time of year, when people are thinking about gathering with family and friends to celebrate Christmas or Hanukkah, to share gifts and family time and the joys of the season, a message about Washington, D.C. is not high on the list of things people want to read. In that regard, let me just say that it is my honor to serve as your Congressman. It is my objective every day that I represent you in a way that will make you proud – by the way I conduct myself, by making thoughtful well-founded decisions, and by exhibiting the strength of character that you desire and expect in the person that represents you.    
As this year and this Congress come to an end, I look forward to the coming year and the next Congress and meeting the challenges that we will face. Having just been elected Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee and made a member of our leadership team, I will endeavor to bring the right ideas and solutions to the issues that we will be facing. 
Best regards, 
Gary Palmer

12/21/18 13:03,Blaine’s Bulletin: The True Meaning of Christmas,"￼ 
December 21, 2018

BLAINE'S BULLETIN

From last minute Christmas shopping, to decorating the tree, to putting the finishing touches on our Christmas menus, December is often the busiest time of year for families in Missouri and across the nation. With a bustling house full of grandkids and increasing pressure to have beautiful gifts under the Christmas tree, I always urge my family to take a step back and appreciate the true meaning of the Christmas season.
Getting wrapped up in the expectations and pressures of Christmas can be overwhelming, but Christmas is truly a season of gratitude and giving. This year, I am grateful for a new addition to my family, a grandson, and for the opportunity to serve the great people of Missouri’s third district for another term. I am grateful for my congressional Colleagues who have been fighting to keep our economy on track and ensure every American has the opportunity to achieve their American Dream.
The excitement and hopefulness of children at this time of year is infectious. The look of pure joy on Christmas morning makes you forget about the late-night shopping trips or the stress of finding the perfect present, but we cannot forget to instill in our children and grandchildren the true meaning of Christmas. The holiday is not about the newest or most expensive gift, but about giving. Giving back to our family, giving back to our friends, and giving back to our communities.
Even the smallest acts of kindness can mean so much to those around you. Missourians understand the spirit of the season, and I am always amazed by the generosity of those in our communities who are quick to step up to the plate. The holiday season is an opportunity for each and every one of us to reach out to our friends, neighbors and loved ones in the spirit of love, charity and hope.
As a busy year comes to a close, I hope each of you gets the opportunity to rest and unwind with those you love the most. In the spirit gratitude and giving, please keep our brave armed forces in your thoughts and prayers this holiday season. While many of us focus on the trivialities of the season, military families across the nation will spend the day without their loved ones who have made unbelievable sacrifices. Their selflessness and love of country serve as the purest embodiment of the Christmas spirit and set a shining example for all Americans to follow.
I wish you all a safe, happy, and blessed holiday, Merry Christmas!

Dear Friend,
The end of the 115th Congressional session is just around the corner, and this is my final email newsletter. Let me first thank you for the tremendous privilege to serve and represent you and fellow Minnesotans in the U.S. House of Representatives for ten years.
I depart especially fulfilled from the rewarding experiences, friendships and relationships made, as well as a list of important accomplishments that have actually made a difference in improving people’s lives.
In the past couple of weeks, several significant legislative initiatives passed with bipartisan support and are being signed into law, including a Farm Bill and notable criminal justice reform. The House also passed a tax bill Thursday with important policy provisions, including my initiative for an additional 5-year suspension of the medical device tax, which is important to keep America and Minnesota at the epicenter of innovation and patient care.
You can watch my floor speech here.
I also was interviewed by Dave Lee on WCCO radio about the end of the session and a special dinner with my roomies. You can listen to our conversation here.
I wish you and your family the best in the holiday season and a very Merry Christmas! Blessings in the New Year as well!
 

With thankfulness and gratitude,

Dear Friend,   As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, the safety and well-being of students is my top priority.   In an effort to compile the best practices to keep our children safe in school, my office has hosted three innovative school safety summits.  After each summit, we have taken together the best practices from the day and released a follow-up report.  The first summit in 2015 was focused on best practices to keep our children safe.  The second summit was conducted in 2017 and focused on cyberbullying and the opioid epidemic.  I would like to take this opportunity to share with you the report from our Third School Safety Summit.
Earlier this week, I discussed the newest report with David Williams of WISH TV.  Education leaders and government officials across our state will be receiving a copy of this report that I am sharing with you today.
I encourage you to read it, study it, and recognize that Hoosier schools are each unique and there is no one-size-fits all answer to securing our schools.

The federal government could shut down. Here's what it would mean for Middle Tennessee.  Tennessean When the clock strikes midnight Friday, a portion of the federal government will shut down without Congress and the White House agreeing on a budget, a development could leave some in Middle Tennessee feeling the effect. 
Jim Mattis, Defense Secretary, Resigns in Rebuke of Trump’s Worldview  New York Times Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose experience and stability were widely seen as a balance to an unpredictable president, resigned Thursday in protest of President Trump’s decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances.  Gov. Bill Haslam granted 11 people clemency, but he has yet to address Cyntoia Brown case  Tennessean Gov. Bill Haslam on Thursday granted clemency to 11 current or former Tennesseans.

Greg's Treasure State Update
Stronger, booming economy heading into 2019 

President Trump and congressional Republicans have enacted pro-growth policies, from cutting taxes for hardworking Montanans to cutting red tape for Montana farmers, ranchers, and businesses. As a result, our economy is booming and opportunities are growing.
	•	Our economy is expected to grow 3.1 percent for 2018, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The U.S. economy hasn’t grown at or above 3 percent in 13 years.
	•	America’s unemployment rate is near a 50-year low.
	•	Montana’s unemployment rate has been at or below the national average for the last several months.
	•	Americans’ wages are growing at their fastest rate in nine years.
	•	Optimism is at record levels heading into the new year.
I’ve heard about that confidence and growing optimism as I’ve met with Montanans throughout the state, whether at Big Sky Wholesale Seeds in Shelby, Billings Flying Service, or with female entrepreneurs in Bozeman. 

I’ll continue to support pro-growth, pro-family policies in 2019.

Pro-Montana Farm Bill now law 

President Trump recently signed the 2018 Farm Bill which gives Montana farmers and ranchers much needed certainty. It provides a strong safety net that guards against the impact of natural disasters and unpredictable, unfair trade practices of other countries. 

The Farm Bill takes care of Montana priorities, including protecting our state’s sugar beet growers and producers, supporting the Agricultural Research Service, assisting rural EMS providers, and improving rural broadband delivery. 

It also improves how we manage our forests by empowering county governments to improve management of neighboring National Forest System lands. Though there is more work to do, the measure provides tools to help improve the health of our forests and reduce the severity of wildfires. 

Nearly 500 ag groups supported the measure, including the Montana Grain Growers Association and the Montana Farm Bureau Federation. 

Since taking office in June 2017, I’ve worked closely with Montana farmers, ranchers, and ag leaders. Together, we put Montana’s fingerprints on the new Farm Bill. 

Learn more about the 2018 Farm Bill HERE.

Supporting EMS in rural Montana 

President Trump also signed into law my bill to help rural EMS providers who are the first line of care for Montanans in more remote areas who face a medical emergency. 

The Supporting and Improving Rural EMS Needs Act, or SIREN Act, which I introduced in April, provides access to resources so that EMS providers in our rural areas have the training and equipment they need to get the job done. The SIREN Act was included in the 2018 Farm Bill. 

I urged Farm Bill negotiators to include the measure, along with other Montana priorities, in the new Farm Bill. 


Learning and coding with Montana’s youngest students 

Montana’s classrooms were full of budding computer engineers recently, as more than 200 classrooms across the state took part in Hour of Code, an educational outreach to demystify computer coding and broaden participation in the field of computer science. 

I visited with students from first through fourth grade at Emily Dickinson School in Bozeman to see what they were working on and to encourage their efforts. Their imagination and creativity were inspiring, and they shared a lot of great ideas.

Spirit of Montana 

I had the honor of recognizing Devin Rich and Kiersten Bare, siblings from Kalispell, who helped in the recovery efforts from the disastrous Woolsey and Camp fires in California. 

Rich helped victims of the Woolsey Fire search through the ash and rubble where their homes stood to salvage items dear to them, and Bare worked to reunite lost pets with their owners

Congress has until Friday to pass spending legislation and avoid a partial government shutdown, but there have been disagreements over certain aspects of the budget, notably funding for a border wall. President Trump has threatened to shut the government down until the border wall is fully funded. Democrat leaders in Congress refuse to support a measure that provides border wall funding, causing a stalemate. 

Would you support a partial federal government shutdown over border wall funding?


A border wall is critically important to our security and so I would support a partial government shutdown to get funding for it. 

A border wall is important but not enough to shut down portions of the federal government. 

I oppose shutting down the federal government for any reason - it's just irresponsible. 

I oppose a border wall and efforts to fund it completely.

Dear Friends, 
 
I want to wish you and your family a Merry Christmas, Happy Kwanzaa and a Happy New Year. I hope everyone had a Happy Hanukkah. May the gift of love, peace and happiness be yours this season.
 
OFFICER’S FUNERAL: This week, I attended the funeral of slain DeKalb County Police Officer Edgar Isidoro Flores, who was shot and killed while making a routine traffic stop in DeKalb County. I was honored to present a U.S. Citizen of Distinction recognition for Officer Flores to his family at the service. Officer Flores would have turned 25 this week. He was engaged to be married and is being remembered as a hero. For more, click HERE. 
 
GOOGLE: Last week, as the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet (IP), I questioned Google CEO Sundar Pichai on the importance of consumers’ digital privacy. For more on my exchange, click HERE. To watch the video, click HERE. 
 
IMMIGRATION: I also had some time to question Kirstjen Nielsen, Secretary of Homeland Security, about the death of Jakelin Caal, a seven-year-old girl who died this month in Customs & Border Patrol custody. I also had some hard-hitting questions on family separation and the administration's failure to properly track the children and reunite them with their families. For more, click HERE.
 
ACA: Since the Affordable Care Act was established in 2010, residents of the great state of Georgia – and America – have benefited from the law. Here’s what it does:
 
•          Provides lifesaving protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions;
•          Prevents insurers from imposing lifetime limits & annual caps on health care; 
•          Women cannot be charged more for health coverage just for being women;
•          It expands Medicaid so it can cover 15 million more people; 
•          Creates marketplace tax credits that help up to 9 million more people;
•          Puts in place tax credits for small businesses to provide health coverage;
•          Children and young adults can remain on their parents' insurance until age 26;
•          It helps seniors pay for prescription drugs;
•          Extends the life of the Medicare Trust Fund; 
•          Insurance companies cannot charge seniors with an unlimited age tax.
 
Despite the latest legal assault on the law, the Affordable Care Act and all of its protections remain the law of the land. When Democrats take the gavel, the House of Representatives will move swiftly to uphold the law and its life-saving protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
 
RUSSIA TARGETS AFRICAN AMERICANS: We know from a new report from the Senate Intelligence Committee that Russia was working hard via social media and other online channels to suppress the African-American vote. Not only are forces within our country and state actively pursuing policies that suppress and depress African-American turnout, but foreign nations are doing it as well. While this next Congress gives both Democrats and Republicans an opportunity to address election security, my colleagues and I call upon the President to take the security of our elections seriously and work with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the FBI to stop foreign election meddling efforts. We would also like to hear directly from Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook, and CEOs of other companies whose platforms were weaponized, about what they knew, and concrete steps they will implement to address future attempts at disinformation campaigns. We cannot allow the deceit and misinformation that characterized the 2016 elections to be repeated in the future. For more, click HERE.
 
OPEN HOUSE: At the beginning of the New Year and new Congress (116th), my Washington, D.C., staff and I are holding an open house so constituents visiting Capitol Hill can stop by. Our office is the people’s office -- it belongs to the people -- so please visit 2240 Rayburn Building on January 3rd from 3-5 p.m. We look forward to seeing you. For more, click HERE.
 
POSSIBLE SHUTDOWN: Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House for the remainder of 2018. They have both the responsibility and the power to keep government open – instead of shutting down the government and hurting people in the middle of the holiday season and a time of great economic uncertainty. But President Trump has declared that he’d be “proud” to shut down the government, saying “I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down” if he cannot force American taxpayers to spend billions of dollars on an immoral, ineffective and expensive wall. If Republicans steer our nation into a Trump Shutdown, however, in January 2019 the House Democratic Majority will swiftly pass the appropriation bills with a CR for Homeland Security to re-open government. For more on what a shutdown might mean, click HERE.
 
SAFETY FIRST: The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) urge everyone to have a safe holiday season. There are about 200 decorating-related injuries each day during the busy holiday season. CPSC estimates that from 2013 to 2015, there was an annual average of about 100 Christmas tree fires, resulting in 10 deaths, 10 injuries, and $12 million in property damage. To avoid fires and other decorating hazards, please click HERE.
 
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to represent you in Congress, and I look forward to seeing you soon. Please have a safe and prosperous New Year.

December 21, 2018
 
 

Dear Friend, 

As I write to you this morning, the federal government inches closer towards a partial shutdown at midnight tonight. The American people want a federal government that does its job and gets things done. Instead, this will be the third time in less than a year that President Trump and the Republicans who control Congress allow funding for the federal government to expire. 

The President says he will keep the government shut down unless Congress gives him the money he wants for his costly, ineffective border wall – a complete waste of money that will do nothing to make our border more secure. Let me be clear, I strongly support smart investments in border security using advancements in technology, drones, satellites, and additional personnel. But no matter how many tantrums he throws on Twitter, the President isn’t going to persuade Congress to waste taxpayer money on a border wall. The reality is that there aren’t even enough Republicans who support it to make that happen.

The good news is that help is on the way. When Democrats take control of the U.S. House in January, we will restore honest, effective government that knows how to get things done for the people it serves. The President needs to work with us, not against us, even if it doesn’t mean he will always get what he wants.

$2 Million for Newport 

On Tuesday, I announced that the Newport County Community Mental Health Center will receive $2,000,000 to meet the needs of 24,500 Rhode Islanders over the next two years. This federal funding will help ensure that even more Rhode Islanders who need care will be able to get it. I was proud to advocate for this funding directly with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and I am pleased that these resources will be put to use here in Rhode Island. Click here to learn more about this announcement.

Secretary Mattis 

We owe Secretary of Defense James Mattis an enormous debt of gratitude for his service to our country. He is a patriot who has always conducted himself with dignity and honor. His resignation yesterday, which came as a direct result of the President abruptly withdrawing from Syria, is bad news for the security of our country and the strength of our alliances. 

Over the past two years, President Trump has made America less safe at home and less respected around the world. It is long past time for Republicans to work with Democrats to conduct real oversight of this administration and the bizarre decisions it is making by the day.

I am very grateful for Secretary Mattis’s devotion to our country, and I am very disappointed that our country will no longer benefit from his wise and experienced service.

As we prepare to enter the holiday season, my office will remain ready to serve you. Send me an email at David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov, or call my Pawtucket office at 729-5600.

Mrs. Lindsey P.   
235 W 102nd Street #11m 
Scottsblue, NE 69361
  
Dear Mrs.  : 
  
Knowing of your interest in issues affecting agriculture, I am writing to update you on recent developments. 
As you may know, every five years the House of Representatives reauthorizes agriculture programs through legislation commonly referred to as the Farm Bill. The Farm Bill covers the federal crop insurance program, provides disaster assistance to livestock producers impacted by severe weather, invests in agriculture research, funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and builds upon conversation efforts already undertaken by landowners across the country.
As the Farm Bill represents one of the most important pieces of legislation for Nebraska, I started this process in 2017 with my Farm Bill Listening Tour: five listening sessions held across the state to hear directly from ag producers about their needs and concerns. Throughout 2017, the House Committee on Agriculture also held hearings both in Washington, DC and across the country to gain the information and farmer feedback needed to draft the Farm Bill. Additionally, on January 24, 2018, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue released the Department of Agriculture’s legislative principles for the 2018 Farm Bill. With my support, the House of Representatives passed its version of the Farm Bill by a vote of 213-211 on June 21, 2018, which was followed by Senate passage of its version one week later.
Due to significant differences between the House and Senate Farm Bills, the House voted unanimously on July 18, 2018, to form a conference committee to resolve these differences. Composed of 47 House Representatives and 9 Senators, this committee negotiated for months to produce a final product which can provide the certainty our producers need for the next five years. In particular, this legislation included the continuation of a strong crop insurance program, and the establishment of a new disease prevention program and vaccine bank for our livestock producers.
With my support, the Farm Bill conference report was adopted by the House of Representatives on December 12, 2018, by a vote of 369-47. I was then proud to join President Trump at White House to witness him sign the legislation in a ceremony on December 20, 2018. While the 2018 Farm Bill will remain in effect through the 2023 crop year, as co-chair of both the Congressional Rural Caucus and the Modern Agriculture Caucus, I remain committed to ensuring opportunity for producers across Nebraska as future legislation is considered in the House.

Catastrophic Climate Report Demands Congressional Response
￼
 
The National Climate Assessment (NCA) released last month reaffirms what 97% of climate scientists have made abundantly clear: climate change poses a real danger to American’s health and economic well-being. The report also explains that the catastrophic damage done by climate change will continue to intensify, and that inaction will be far costlier than confronting the problem now.  
In my view, the President has double-downed on his anti-climate policies by publicly disputing the findings in the NCA. This is disappointing, but not surprising. This year alone, our nation witnessed deadly wildfires, disastrous hurricanes, and debilitating droughts and heat waves that have displaced thousands across the country. Instead of prioritizing solutions that could reverse the effects of climate change, I believe the Administration has pursued policies that expand offshore drilling, weaken clean air and water protections, and dismantle renewable energy programs, all of which I vehemently oppose. The effects of climate change are undeniable, and the American people deserve a Congress that will stand up to the oil industry and fight for real solutions that will preserve our planet for future generations. 
Combating Hate Crimes & Anti-Semitism in Our Communities
According to the New York Police Department, anti-Semitic hate crimes are up 22% compared to last year, and anti-Semitic incidents have constituted half of all hate crimes in New York this year. A recent report by the Anti-Defamation League found a 57% rise in anti-Semitic incidents nationwide since 2016. I am deeply concerned and heartbroken by these crimes, which have cast an unsettling shadow on our community and our country as whole. As a Member of Congress, it is my duty to ensure that this disgusting, hate-fueled behavior does not go unaddressed. Earlier this month, I joined my fellow NYC Members of Congress in pressing the NYPD for answers on how they are combating what appears to be a recent wave of anti-Semitic acts, and I have made this a priority for the House Judiciary Committee next year in the new Congress. Hate crimes and anti-Semitism should have no place in our city or country.

Improving Protections for Victims of Workplace Harassment 
Across workplaces, schools, and communities, our nation is beginning to come to terms with how our laws have failed victims of harassment. This month, Congress passed bipartisan MeToo legislation which helps foster a climate of respect and dignity by fundamentally changing the flawed process Congress had previously used to address sexual harassment claims. While this is an important first step, Congress must not stop it’s work there.  
I am proud to be a lead sponsor of H.R. 6406, the EMPOWER Act, which would lift the veil of secrecy surrounding workplace harassment, and bolster transparency and accountability. Every man and woman deserves a safe, transparent, and fair work environment, and if the women and men who have been victimized, shamed, and abandoned by our laws and society can find the courage to stand up and tell their stories, then Congress must step-up and act in their names and the names of the millions who don’t have the platform to speak out. Time is up for this misconduct to go unpunished.
To read more about the EMPOWER Act, please click here. 
Ending the Unconstitutional War in Yemen 
For over three years, military forces led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -with direct U.S. military participation-have been fighting the Houthis, a Yemeni rebel group that are not covered under any Authorization for Use of Military Force. As a Member of Congress, I have always opposed intervening in international conflicts with military force without congressional approval. That is why I am a cosponsor H.Con.Res. 138, which would stop the unauthorized U.S. military participation in Yemen and help bring an end to this humanitarian crisis. Unfortunately, the Majority prevented this resolution from being voted on, and instead passed legislation that would prevent any vote to limit our military involvement in Yemen for the rest of the year. 

It is essential that the power to decide whether or not to commit the country to war rest with the people, through their representatives in Congress, and I will continue to work to ensure the Administration does not overstep their power. 
Honoring Shirley Chisholm in Prospect Park 
 
￼

Last month, I joined She Built NYC to announce that a monument to Representative Shirley Chisholm, a political trailblazer from Brooklyn who was the first black Congresswoman in the U.S. House of Representatives, will be erected in Prospect Park. Rep. Shirley Chisholm was a model of courage and conviction who worked tirelessly on behalf of women and minorities at a critical time in our nation’s history. For too long, we have not done enough to honor the significant contributions of women in our city and our nation, and this monument is an important step in correcting that omission.

12/21/18 10:05,Congressman Harper's Final Year In Review,"￼ 
PROUD TO SERVE MISSISSIPPI’S THIRD DISTRICT 
Dear Friend,
As this year and the 115th Congress ends, it is a bitter sweet moment knowing that this will be my final newsletter serving as your Congressman. I cannot begin to express my deep and sincere appreciation to you for affording me this great honor. 
Serving as a Member of the United States House of Representatives has been the greatest privilege of my life. The opportunity to serve the people of the Third District, our state, and our country is something that my wife, Sidney, and I will never forget. Last Christmas, my family and I made the very difficult decision to say that 10 years would be long enough. I never intended for this to be a career, and it is now time for Member-elect Michael Guest to represent us. 
I have worked tirelessly over the past 12 months of my term this year, and I want to give you a few highlights.   Thanks to Speaker Paul Ryan, I have been allowed to serve as Chairman of the Committee on House Administration and work to make the institution of the House of Representatives more transparent, accountable, and stronger for America’s future. I have worked hard in a bipartisan manner over the remainder of my term to be a problem solver, including my work on establishing accountability on Capitol Hill for sexual harassment issues in the House and Senate.   I will also miss being Chairman of the Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, where we have continued to work on important issues such as the opioid epidemic and sexual abuse in the U.S. Olympic community. 
 Policy Update  
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
We promised the American people more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks. With the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, we delivered on those promises. Last year, the House passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, giving the American tax payer the relief you deserve. Since this historic legislation was signed into law, our nation's unemployment is at a historic low, job numbers are at record highs, paychecks are growing, and wages are rising with economic optimism. 
This year, the House voted to make them permanent. Tax Reform 2.0 is a package of three bills that locked in the historic reforms of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act to protect middle-class and small business tax cuts, promote family savings, and advance the next generation of entrepreneurs. 
Combatting the Opioid Crisis
We have also made significant investments to combat the opioid crisis, an effort that I have been honored to lead as Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.
In June, the House of Representatives passed the most significant congressional action against a single drug crisis in history. 
H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, is a bipartisan bill that will help in our overall efforts to combat the opioid crisis. This bill advances treatment and recovery initiatives, improves prevention, protects our communities, and bolsters our efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl. 
In October, H.R. 6 was passed by the House and the Senate and sent to President Trump’s desk for signature. This landmark opioid legislation is now law. 
I am proud that members from both chambers and both sides of the aisle were able to come together along President Trump to find tangible solutions to stop this destructive epidemic from continuing to wreck our nation's communities.    Historic Military Funding
Congress understands the significance and importance of our duty to provide for the common defense. For 57 years, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has been the primary way Congress executes this constitutional obligation. 
The Trump Administration has prioritized the military, and this year, we worked together to strengthen and rebuild – something that has been neglected for far too long. 
After key discussions between both chambers of Congress, and hearing from many of the top military officials across all branches, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act with a vote of 359-54 on July 26. This vote count shows a strong bipartisan effort to strengthen our forces and provides a start to building them to the levels of strength this country hasn’t seen in decades. 
Additionally, we fully funded the largest pay raise for our troops in 9 years and reformed the VA to provide better care to our nation's veterans.   Self-Drive Act 
On September 6, 2017, the Energy & Commerce Committee passed the bipartisan SELF DRIVE Act by voice vote, the first-of-its-kind federal framework for the safe and innovative development and deployment of self-driving cars.  Self-driving car technology has the potential to provide new, more reliable modes of transportation which will lead to additional opportunities for the disability community and others who are unable to drive.
After a year of delays, forcing automakers and innovators to develop in a state-by-state patchwork of rules, House leaders on this issue continue to urge the Senate to act to support this critical safety innovation and secure America’s place as a global leader in technology.
America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018
In September, the House unanimously passed the House Amendment to S. 3021, the America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018.  The bill represents a bipartisan agreement between the House and the Senate on comprehensive water resources infrastructure legislation.  In this bill, the House supported language from my bill, the Drinking Water System Improvement Act, that was included in the America’s Water Infrastructure Act. I am grateful for the hard work of the Energy and Commerce committee staff and everyone who had a hand in passing this legislation. Americans and their drinking water infrastructure will benefit greatly.
Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reforms
As Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, Speaker Paul Ryan asked me to lead the House effort in handling sexual harassment, a job I did not take lightly. 
Over the past year, the House has taken a number of steps to ensure a safer and more productive work environment. Those steps include implementing mandatory training for all Members and staff, creating the Office of Employee Advocacy, setting minimum requirements for each office with respect to anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policies, and amending House rules. 
Earlier this month, the House and the Senate came to an agreement which reflects the first set of comprehensive reforms that have been made to the Congressional Accountability Act since 1995. I believe this is a strong step towards creating a new standard in Congress that will set a positive example in our nation, but there is still more work to be done. 
As we celebrate the season and look forward to the New Year, let's remember God's promise in Jeremiah 29:11—“For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans to prosper you and not to harm you; plans to give you a future and a hope.”  Sidney and I want to wish you all the best in this upcoming year and a very Merry Christmas as we remember the Christ child who came to give us peace and forgiveness.  Thank you for the honor of allowing me to serve you in Congress.  
God Bless,

￼

Dear Lindsey,   
  
Since coming to Congress, I have been focused on supporting policies that will create jobs, revitalize America's tax code, strengthen our defense, and reduce the size of the federal government. It has always been my goal to work on the issues that matter most to Michigan families. I still firmly believe America is the greatest country in the world, and it is our duty as citizens to continue to fight for the principles that make our country great. 

Even though we may not agree on every issue, it has been the honor of my life to serve as your representative from Michigan's Eleventh District in the United States House of Representatives. 

From my family to yours, I wish you a safe, healthy, and happy holiday season. May God bless the United States of America.  

Sincerely,

￼
￼

                     President Trump Signs Farm Bill Into Law  Watch this video from Smieja Farm in Belgrade and Trapper Creek Ranch in Melrose on the importance of the Farm Bill:
 ￼
Today President Trump signed the Farm Bill into law. As Montana’s lone voice on the Senate Ag Committee, I fought hard to ensure that critical priorities for Montana’s farmers and ranchers were included. This Farm Bill will go a long way in helping provide more certainty for Montana agriculture and you can find the text of the new Farm Bill here.  A few highlights of the Farm Bill include:  • Protected crop insurance, a critical part of the safety net for Montana farmers to mitigate risks inherent to agriculture.  • Secured funding for land grant universities, including MSU, specialty crops, and agriculture research stations across Montana.  • Secured provisions to expand broadband access in rural Montana, promote precision agriculture, and prioritize funds to areas that are unserved with no access.  • Included an amendment to help the ARC-County program, an important commodity support program, better reflect actual growing conditions in many of Montana’s large counties.  I will closely monitor implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill to ensure it is working for Montana. As always, please feel to visit my website at www.daines.senate.gov to share feedback you might have on this new law or any other federal policy matter. 
Best Wishes,

Congressman Adam Smith’s December Newsletter 
With the year coming to an end, I wanted to take a moment to update you on my recent work both in Washington, D.C and here at home in the 9th District. 
Remembering Councilmember Amina Ahmed
Earlier this month, our community was shocked by the tragic news of SeaTac City Councilmember Amina Ahmed’s death. I join our community in mourning the sudden passing of Councilmember Ahmed. She was an incredible advocate for immigrants and refugees and worked hard to make our community better for everyone. My thoughts and prayers are with her family during this difficult time. 
￼  
Celebrating Veterans’ Service to Our Country 
U.S. Army Veteran 1st Lieutenant Frances Harman was recently inducted to the VA Puget Sound's Wall of Heroes, the first woman to receive this honor. My office had the honor of joining in celebrating this momentous occasion. Lt. Harman’s legacy of service in the Nurse Corps will continue to be an inspiration to our entire community and generations to come! 
￼  
My office attended the VA Puget Sound Wall of Heroes Induction to honor 1st Lt. Frances Harman 
After immigrating to America in 1949, Brendan Moriarty served in the US Air Force. Over Veterans Day weekend, my office had the incredible honor of participating in Mr. Moriarty's “We Honor Veterans” Pinning Ceremony. This ceremony is an opportunity for veterans to be publicly acknowledged for their sacrifices and their willingness to serve our country. Thank you to Mr. Moriarty for sharing your story. Your service is an exemplary model of American values and ideals.

Legislative Update 
Boosting Therapy and Treatment for Veterans 
I have joined Representative Chris Smith (R-NJ) in the introduction of the Outdoor Recreation Therapy for Veterans Act to help expand opportunities for veterans to access the outdoors for medical care and therapy. 
Access to the outdoors is proven to have a positive impact on mental health and physical wellbeing. For our veterans, the healing effects of nature can be especially powerful. In Washington state, we know the incredible benefits that come from spending time in nature, and we owe it to our servicemen and women to open the door to all avenues of recovery when they return home. I look forward to working with Rep. Chris Smith in building support for this bipartisan legislation to help connect our nation’s veterans with the great outdoors. By bringing together stakeholders from the VA and Land Management, we are building a foundation that will ensure that our veterans and their families can experience the restorative power of the public lands their service to our country has protected. 
A 2013 report by the Sierra Club said that of a sample study of veterans who took part in month-long group wilderness recreation programs, participants exhibited “significant improvements in psychological well-being, social functioning, and life outlook.” The Outdoor Recreation Therapy for Veterans Act, would direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish, within 180 days of enactment, an inter-agency task force to be co-chaired by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of the Interior and including the Secretary of HHS, Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Defense as members. The task force would seek to increase the availability of federal lands for use for medical therapy for veterans. 
The task force would also help increase coordination between the Department of Veterans Affairs and public land agencies on using public lands for therapy and medical treatment. 
Global Fragility and Violence Reduction Act Passes House 
On November 28th, the House passed my bipartisan bill, the Global Fragility and Violence Reduction Act. This legislation would improve U.S. engagement in fragile and unstable countries to reduce violence and address the conditions that create safe havens for terrorists, criminal networks, and war lords. Instability across the world continues to lead to the displacement of millions of people. In response to the unprecedented refugee crisis caused by the rise in conflict, famine and disease, the U.S. must be a leader in addressing the root causes of violence and fragility. The Global Fragility and Violence Reduction Act is a significant step in bringing together defense, diplomatic, and development stakeholders to better tackle these complex challenges. 
Learn more about the bill here. 
Fighting Climate Change 
The recently released Fourth National Climate Assessment and the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC) Report have both laid out the devastating effects of our changing climate on the environment, our health and the economy. The United States should be a global leader in the fight against climate change. Trump continues to put the U.S. on the sidelines instead of working with international partners to address this growing crisis. Climate change is a danger to the health and future of the American people, and we are already seeing its detrimental impact on Washington state. The new Democratic House majority will act on climate. 
I’ve joined in sponsoring a resolution that recognizes and reaffirms the IPCC report findings, and together with my colleagues I have also sent a letter to President Trump calling for him to reverse his administration’s attacks on the environment and take climate change seriously. 
Charting a New Course on Nuclear Policy 
Congress must conduct vigorous oversight of the Trump Administration and the Department of Defense. This oversight needs to include taking substantial steps to reduce America’s overreliance on nuclear weapons and greater transparency in national security matters. You can read more about the importance of this oversight in Politico here. 
￼Fixing Our Broken Immigration Detention System 
Our immigration detention system is unacceptable. For years, we've seen this first-hand at the Northwest Detention Center (NWDC). With the tragic death of Mergansana Amar, a Russian asylum seeker detained in the custody of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the NWDC, I've demanded an investigation into his death and conditions at NWDC with Senator Patty Murray, Senator Maria Cantwell, and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. 
This week, the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General opened an independent investigation into Mr. Amar’s death. This is critical to better understanding why this tragedy took place and prevent future similar incidents. 
I'll continue working to reform our immigration detention system. A Democratic majority will conduct oversight and bring desperately needed fairness and integrity to our broken system. 
Honoring Jimi Hendrix 
My bill designating the post office at 4301 NE 4th Street in Renton as the James Marshall “Jimi” Hendrix Post Office passed the Senate by Unanimous Consent following its previous passage in the House of Representatives. The legislation was supported by both Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, as well as each member of the Washington State Delegation in the House. 
I am honored to join in paying tribute to rock and roll icon and Seattle native Jimi Hendrix with the renaming of the Renton Highlands Post Office in honor of Jimi Hendrix. This designation will further celebrate Hendrix’s deep connection to the Puget Sound region and help ensure that his creative legacy will be remembered by our community and inspire future generations. 
Both the Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle and the Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle joined in support of the renaming. 
“Jimi Hendrix is one of the most influential American artists of all time. This Seattle native son, is truly one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. In honor of his memory and service to our country, it is truly fitting that we move forward in naming the United States Postal Service located at 4301 Northeast 4th Street in Renton, Washington, as the James Marshall ‘Jimi’ Hendrix Post Office Building. The Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle strongly supports this effort and applauds Congress for reminding those that patron this facility that his legacy lives on and his memory is etched in the fabric of our country and community,” said Michelle Merriweather, the President and CEO of the Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle. 
“The Northwest African American Museum fully supports the renaming of a local post office to bear the name of Seattle's most recognizable native son, Jimi Hendrix.  His legendary artistic genius chartered new territory within world music.  While his reach was international in scope, his roots trace back to Seattle and we are proud to richly celebrate his legacy as part of his hometown community. This bill, led by U.S. Congressman Adam Smith, will provide a fitting tribute to a Seattle-born global icon whose humility, generosity, musical giftedness, and timeless brilliance will inspire for generations to come,” said LaNesha DeBardelaben, the Director of Northwest African American Museum. 
  
I am incredibly thankful for the opportunity to serve our community. My family and I send our best wishes to you for a happy and healthy 2019. 
Best, 
Adam

My bipartisan bill to control sea lions, save salmon on the Columbia River becomes law
￼
This bipartisan legislation authorizes 
states and tribal members to lethally 
remove sea lions that are predating on
endangered salmon, steelhead and other
native fish species.
￼
California sea lions have killed the most 
spring Chinook salmon and steelhead
this year than any year since 
2011. Fish and wildlife experts estimate
that at the current rate, the Willamette
Winter Steelhead run faces a 90% chance
of extinction if nothing changes 
(fortunately, we now have a powerful tool
to prevent extinction!).

The bipartisan bill I authored with Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-OR) giving tribal members and government fish managers the authority to lethally remove sea lions that are decimating endangered salmon and steelhead runs was signed into law yesterday.

After 12 years of hard work by so many on this legislation, seeing it finally become law today represents a momentous step in the effort to protect our endangered salmon and steelhead runs. Today, we have reason to be optimistic that our fight to prevent the extinction of entire Northwest salmon runs, and the species that depend on them, can succeed. 

￼
I learned a lot by joining members of the 
Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish 
Commission as they operated a sea lion 
hazing boat at the Bonneville Dam 
this spring.
￼
A sea lion tears into a sturgeon near the
dam. Local fishing guides told me 
70-100% of the fish they land show 
visible signs of a struggle with a sea lion.

12/20/18 19:49,Update from Rep. Collins: Victory on prison reform & lower drug pricing,"
￼ 



December 20, 2018 

Dear Friends,
I hope you and your loved ones are enjoying this season of celebration. The end of the year is a great time to reflect on what we've accomplished and of the work the new year and new Congress will bring us. Here's an update on some issues that Northeast Georgians talk to me about regularly.  
￼
￼
  
Making Communities Safer through Prison Reform
On November 14, I stood with President Donald Trump as he endorsed the First Step Act. I introduced this bill in the House last May, and it passed in our chamber by a vote of 360-59. This week, the Senate passed an updated version of the bill, and I then voted with my colleagues in the House to send the bill straight to the president's desk. 
Working with the White House to increase public safety by lowering recidivism has been an incredible opportunity. The First Step Act represents a rare chance to fulfill the demands of justice today while reducing future burdens on the criminal justice system. By putting in place initiatives focused on rehabilitating individual men and women, we are promoting public safety and basic fairness. 
With President Trump's signature, this bill will reunite families, provide meaningful job skills, make our streets safer, and promote the wellbeing of communities. I'm proud to have worked with our president to apply reforms that have been implemented in Georgia at the federal level. This success shows us the president's ability to find common agreement for the common good on key issues. 
￼
￼

Fighting Overreach in a New Role

With Democrats in control of the House beginning in January, it's the responsibility of Republicans to ensure that investigations don't go rogue at a time when we have real governing to do. I'm prepared to help move the conservative agenda forward in the face of opposition across the aisle, and House Republicans recently elected me to lead fellow Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee as Ranking Member. 
Democrats aren't hiding their plans to oppose President Trump through the Judiciary Committee, but America remains a nation of ideas, principles, and laws. Right now, it seems like some Members of Congress want to weaponize taxpayer resources against a president instead of focusing on building the economy and creating more jobs. Conservatives, though, are here to ensure that liberals don't use their majority in the House to chase political vendettas at deep cost—and no benefit—to hardworking Americans. 
I also plan to continue fighting for our Second Amendment rights and to work to strengthen our immigration system in a way that protects America's sovereignty and upholds the rule of law, as these are key issues that fall under the scope of the Judiciary Committee. 
Moving to Lower Prescription Drug Costs
Earlier this year, I introduced the Phair Pricing Act to lower the cost of prescription medications for patients in the Medicare Part D program. Recently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a proposed rule to lower prescription drug costs and increase transparency surrounding Medicare Parts C and D. I'm excited to report that this proposal includes the bulk of the Phair Pricing Act. 
The Phair Pricing Act is necessary because prescription drug middlemen too often use abusive reimbursement schemes to inflate patient prices and unfairly cripple local health care providers. I’ve seen how much this ultimately leaves communities with higher costs and less access to quality care. 
President Trump’s administration is taking a concrete step to ensure that patients at the counter feel the savings that middlemen claim to negotiate on their behalves but have often kept in their own coffers. I look forward to continuing to work with the administration on this front. 
Representing the priorities of Georgia's 9th District remains a humbling responsibility. If you'd like to keep up with the latest news about the policy improvements I support and why they matter to Northeast Georgia, I invite you to sign up for my regular newsletters. You can also follow me on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.

Congress has until Friday to pass spending legislation and avoid a partial government shutdown, but there have been disagreements over certain aspects of the budget, notably funding for a border wall. President Trump has threatened to shut the government down until the border wall is fully funded. Democrat leaders in Congress refuse to support a measure that provides border wall funding, causing a stalemate. 

Would you support a partial federal government shutdown over border wall funding?


A border wall is critically important to our security and so I would support a partial government shutdown to get funding for it. 

A border wall is important but not enough to shut down portions of the federal government. 

I oppose shutting down the federal government for any reason - it's just irresponsible. 

I oppose a border wall and efforts to fund it completely.

Fighting to Protect the Sanctity of Life

SERVING YOU
 ￼￼￼￼￼
Dear Friend,   We have made it through 2018, a year I perceived that – when many of our cherished values were tested – our people and government proved supple and resilient.   Despite the odds, we saw some notable legislative successes and a tremendous number of small victories for our constituents by our District office. Thanks for all your remarkable letters, emails, and phone calls in 2018. I greatly appreciate your feedback and ideas, and hope you will continue connecting with my office in my next Term in office. Meantime, check out this quick recap of some of what we have accomplished this year in Congress.    Legislative Successes   When the President proposed a 20 percent cut in funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in his FY 2018 Budget Request, a bipartisan group of lawmakers – myself included – came together to urge the Appropriations Committees to not only preserve NIH’s funding but increase it. We turned a proposed cut of $5.7 billion to NIH into a $3 billion increase, so that researchers at the NIH can continue working to fight killer diseases like Alzheimer’s, breast cancer, colon cancer, multiple sclerosis and cystic fibrosis. We were able to replicate that bipartisan success for this Fiscal Year as well.   As a cancer survivor and a member of the bipartisan Cancer Survivors Caucus, I was pleased to work with my Republican colleague Rep. Pete Sessions to secure report language in a recent appropriations bill that will encourage the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which is within NIH, to improve patient access to clinical trials. For many cancer patients, ancillary costs associated with participation in clinical trials, such as long-distance travel and lodging expenses, are a significant obstacle to participation.  Not only does this prevent patients from obtaining potentially life-saving clinical trials, a lack of diversity in the patient pool in a study can undermine the safety, efficacy and value of new drugs. We should ensure that every cancer patient, regardless of his or her economic situation, is able to participate in clinical trials of his or her choosing.   Earlier this year, I worked closely with two of my Oversight Committee colleagues - Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy and Democratic Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton - to fight for an increase in pay for people serving on federal juries, from $40 to $50 per day. This modest raise would be the first increase to federal juror pay in 28 years, something significant especially for working people who are self-employed.    Recently, President Trump signed into law the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2018 (FAA Reauthorization Act), which included several airplane noise mitigation provisions that I championed. For example, I coauthored an amendment included in the final bill that requires the FAA to conclude its evaluation of enhanced, alternative airplane noise measurement metrics within the next year, so that progress can be made toward implementing a new and more accurate airplane noise metric that reflects the reality of the level of airplane noise experienced by Montgomery County residents. The bill also contained several other noise mitigation measures advanced by our effective and vigilant community organizations like the Montgomery County Quiet Skies Coalition.   The opioid crisis is taking a heavy toll on our people and requires immediate solutions.  Everyone – Congress, the President,  state and local governments, and our people – must continue to work together to turn the tide. Earlier this year the House considered a bill aimed at curbing the illegal importation and trafficking of synthetic drugs, but some researchers and scientists studying the science and treatment of addiction at the NIH and the National Institute on Drug Addiction (NIDA) had expressed concern that important research could be abruptly halted mid-study until they could clear new and bureaucratic licensing hurdles. Working with NIH and NIDA, my Republican colleague Congressman Morgan Griffith and I offered a successful amendment on the House Floor to ensure that this critical research can continue. Another bipartisan measure that I cosponsored, the INTERDICT Act, recently became law. The bill will help stop the flow of the illicit opioid fentanyl across the U.S. border. CDC data shows that nearly half of opioid overdose deaths in 2016 were linked to synthetic opioids like fentanyl.    Additionally, I teamed up with a Virginia Republican Colleague in the House to introduce and work for passage of legislation to create a nationwide public alert system for missing and endangered adults, similar to the Amber Alert. The Ashanti Alert Act is named after Ashanti Billie, a 19-year-old who grew up in Prince George’s County and was kidnapped and murdered last fall. Although there was evidence that Billie had been kidnapped, no system like an AMBER Alert or Silver Alert for adults over 60 years old existed to notify the public about missing and endangered adults. The Ashanti Alert, like other alert systems, will establish an alert network to help local and regional law enforcement efforts to search for missing adults between the ages of 18-65.    District Office Update   As the Representative for Maryland's 8th District, nothing is more important to me than helping you navigate the twists and turns of federal agencies to receive all the right government benefits and services that are available to you. In the 115th Congress, my hard-working District Office staff resolved more than 3,438 constituent cases and saved or returned more than $1,460,000.00 to constituents.    My District Office, located in Rockville, is open Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. We have also launched mobile office hours across the 8th District, including in Thurmont, Westminster, and Silver Spring. Click here to see times and locations. No appointment is necessary for mobile office hours, but you are encouraged to contact my District Office at 301-354-1000 ahead of your visit to ensure you bring along proper documentation that may expedite service requests.    I was delighted to speak with many of you at events that we hosted around the 8th District this year: the Town Hall Meeting on Medicare and Social Security; first annual ConsumerFest;  Coffee or Cafecito with Your Congressman; second annual Federal Employee Health Benefits Forum; Teach-In Town Hall Meeting; the Election Security Forum; Vietnam War Commemoration Pinning Ceremony; and many of the other terrific community events taking place in our district.    Committee Work   As the Vice Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, I’ve spent much of this year working to defeat efforts to wipe out the 50 states’ concealed carry laws that I believe would allow millions of people to carry loaded concealed weapons nationwide; to work for an end to family separation in the immigration process; and to defend civil rights, civil liberties, public justice and Constitutional values.   As a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, I am defending federal employees against baseless partisan attacks, constant threats of salary and benefit cuts, and scandalous political interference with their work. In September, I led more than 158 House Democrats in urging congressional leadership to oppose President Trump’s effort to rescind a modest 1.9 percent planned pay increase for federal workers. Learn more about that effort by clicking here. The under-funding of important government agencies and continuing efforts to decimate the federal workforce are undermining essential public missions. That’s why I’ve worked to defeat drastic budget cuts and defend the full funding of crucial environmental, water, public health, Chesapeake Bay, and medical and scientific research programs (read more here).    Additionally, I serve on the Committee on House Administration, which oversees the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), the only federal agency charged with making elections more secure, accessible, accurate, and transparent. The EAC is headquartered in the 8th Congressional District, and earlier this year I worked with my colleagues on the Committee to secure $380 million in funding in the omnibus spending deal to help states secure their election systems and replace their most vulnerable voting machines (read more on that here). I also introduced H.R. 6435, the Election Vendor Security Act, after the Federal Bureau of Investigation informed Maryland officials that a Russian oligarch had invested in one of the state’s voting software vendors in 2015 without the state’s knowledge. To learn more about H.R. 6435 click here.   Please note: my committee assignments will likely remain the same in the 116th Congress.     Looking Ahead to 2019   Last month, I was proudly elected to serve as Caucus Leadership Representative for the House Democratic Caucus in the 116th Congress. The Caucus Leadership Representative is the member of the House leadership who represents the five most junior classes of the Democratic Caucus.  I am gratified to have won the support of my 140+ fellow junior colleagues, including the 65 Members of the extraordinary Class of 2018, in this quest. I will be a faithful servant for the policy values, interests and ideas of Junior Members and, as a Member who proudly represents Maryland’s 8th District, I will be working to keep us focused on advancing our positive agenda—quality health care for all, prescription drug price reform, dramatic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to address climate change, investment in infrastructure, gun violence reduction, immigration reform, and more —even as we defend the Constitution and Bill of Rights against attack.    That’s all for now. Stay tuned and stay close!      All Best,   ￼

Dear Friend,
The U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 88, the “Retirement, Savings, and Other Tax Relief Act.”
It is important that we continue to work on legislation that brings relief to hardworking Americans.  Last year, we took a step in reforming our tax code by passing tax reform.  Earlier this year, we passed tax reform 2.0.  Now we are taking a third step to continue to help our economy thrive.  With our progress on tax reform we have seen a lot of growth in our economy, Americans keeping more of the money they earn, and jobs being created.
Some of the highlights of the Amendment include:
	•	Includes special tax relief benefits for individuals and businesses affected by recent natural disasters;
	•	Helps businesses provide retirement plans for their workers and helps families to start saving earlier;
	•	Makes key technical corrections to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act;
	•	Further delays several Obamacare taxes, including the medical device tax and health insurer tax;
	•	Makes the railroad track maintenance credit permanent; and
	•	Updates the IRS and makes taxpayer service the focus of the agency.

I invite you to learn more about this issue and others by visiting my website here. Have a question you would like answered? Please contact me by phone, letter, e-mail, on Facebook, or on Twitter.

As always, I appreciate hearing from you.

Dear Friend, 
Today, the President signed the 2018 Farm Bill into law. I am proud this law strongly supports Hoosier farmers by providing them the relief and resources they deserve as they work hard to produce our food supply and ensure that it is safe, abundant and affordable.
97% of farms in our state are family owned and Indiana’s agriculture economy supports more than 107,000 Hoosier jobs. There are 14.7 million acres of farmland cultivated by Indiana’s nearly 57,000 farming operations. Unfortunately, due to weather and shifts in commodity markets, the agriculture economy nationwide, including in Indiana, has trended downwards over the past several years.
Every five years, Congress must pass the federal government’s primary tool for agriculture and food policy – the Farm Bill – in order to support our farmers and ensure critical agricultural and food programs are updated and reauthorized. 
I want to thank the many farmers from the Fifth District who have shared with me the importance of crop insurance, conservation programs, strong trade deals, and ensuring rural communities have the support they need. I am proud the 2018 Farm Bill has been signed into law because it champions the needs of rural America and provides certainty to Hoosier families and farmers.
The 2018 Farm Bill: 
	•	renews and protects crop insurance, a critically important safety net for Hoosier farmers;
	•	supports and enables significant investment in emerging conservation practices;
	•	reauthorizes crucial commodity programs including corn, soybean and other top commodities produced in Indiana;
	•	repeals the harmful and burdensome Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, providing regulatory certainty and relief;
	•	addresses the predatory trading practices of foreign countries, including retaliatory tariffs leveled by foreign governments like China, and strengthens promotion of U.S. agricultural exports through the Market Access Program (MAP);
	•	provides funding for animal disease prevention and management efforts, including the stockpiling of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccine;
	•	helps rural communities to combat the opioid crisis;
	•	improves the efficiency and execution of federal efforts to expand broadband connectivity;
	•	is part of a comprehensive response to natural disasters, including provisions to support communities still recovering from the devastating impacts of the recent hurricanes and wildfires; and
	•	lays the groundwork for improved Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Policy (SNAP) policy by focusing on improving program integrity;
During this holiday season, I’d like to send a special thank you to every Hoosier farmer who works to feed and fuel Americans across the country. Without their tireless efforts, we would not have the reliable and safe food supply so many of us take for granted. So as you gather for your holiday meal, give thanks to the farmers who provide the food we are blessed to have. 
Again, thank you to all who contacted my office or met with me or my staff about this critical bill – now law – as we worked to get it passed through the House of Representatives and Senate. 
As always, feel free to be in touch with any questions or comments you may have.  
Sincerely, ￼  Congresswoman Susan W. Brooks

12/20/18 18:20,2018 Farm Bill — including provisions to legalize hemp — becomes law,"￼
Dear friend,
 It's official - the 2018 Farm Bill, which included key provisions to legalize hemp, was signed into law today. This comprehensive bipartisan legislation ends the outdated ban on hemp production and allows Virginia farmers to finally grow and sell the plant, creating new business opportunities and jobs in our Commonwealth. 
Read more about the bill here >>
The 2018 Farm Bill also included significant investments to expand Chesapeake Bay clean-up efforts, protect Virginia commodities like dairy and cotton, and maintain funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that Virginia families depend on for food security.
I'm proud we came together and delivered these big wins for Virginia families, farmers, and businesses.
Sincerely,

2018 Farm Bill: ✅
￼

Today, President Trump signed the farm bill into law. The farm bill is one of the single most important pieces of legislation to ensure farmers in the 13th District can continue their family business, support a major component of our state’s economy, and help feed the world. I’ve been honored to serve on the House Agriculture Committee since I came to Congress and I’m proud to say I’ve been able to deliver two long-term farm bills, one in 2014 and now 2018, to provide certainty and help farmers in my district succeed.  Getting a farm bill across the finish line this year for our farmers was always my goal. This bill maintains programs critical for Central Illinois farmers, strengthens agricultural research, and improves protections for organic products.  
 
￼
Agriculture is one of the largest indistries in the 13th district and the state of Illinois and ensuring there is strong agriculture policy in place is vital to our economy.  But the farm bill benefits more than just agriculture. It provides continued funding for rural development grants, like one the hospital in Jerseyville received to help fight the opioid epidemic. Research at universities, like the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, also depend on the farm bill for funding. Additionally, the bill includes reforms that ensure rural communities have access to broadband that meets minimum requirements for today’s technological age.  While this is a strong bill for our farmers, 80 percent of the farm bill is SNAP, or more commonly referred to as food stamps. When I visit employers throughout the district, they’re biggest worry right now is filling their workforce. While there is a slight increase in employment and training in the bill, not every able-bodied adult enrolled in SNAP will have access to this job training program like they would have under the House bill. The House-passed bill strengthened work requirements for the program while investing historic amounts in workforce training. Unfortunately, this issue became much more partisan than it needed to be and we were forced to remove it in order to get a bill that would help our farmers in this difficult farm economy. I believe this is a missed opportunity because if our economy is going to continue grow, we’re going to need to fill the jobs that are open.  I will work with anyone to help end the cycle of poverty and provide more workforce opportunities for millions of Americans. I hope Democrats in the House will set the next election aside and work with Republicans to make this a priority next year.   Click here to learn more about the 2018 farm bill.  


Passing the 2018 Farm Bill in Pictures
The 2018 Farm Bill is the product of years of listening to priorities and concerns from both farmers and agriculture stakeholders and working in a bipartisan way to deliver strong agriculture policy.  
 
￼
I hosted several Tool Shed Talks throughout my district last year to hear directly from farmers what their priorities were for the farm bill. I was able to ensure many of their top concerns were addressed in the final bill, including protecting crop insurance.  
 
￼
In the summer of 2017, I was honored to host a House Agriculture Committee Field Hearing at Richland Community College with Chairman Mike Conaway (R-TX), Ranking Member Colin Peterson (D-MN), and other bipartisan members of the committee. Central Illinois farmers and agriculture stakeholders had the opportunity to ask questions and hear from various committee members on the progress we were making on crafting the 2018 farm bill.
 
￼
After the House and Senate passed their own versions of the bill, I was named to the conference committee to help work out the differences between the two bills.   Click here to watch my remarks at Farm Bill Conference Committee Public Meeting.  
 
￼
This week, I signed the conference report for the 2018 farm bill before it was voted on in both the House and Senate.  
 
￼
I was proud to speak on the House floor in support of the final bill this week. It passed both the House and Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support. Click here to watch my remarks.

It was an honor to attend the farm bill signing today at the White House.

12/20/18 17:41,Trump Republicans Keep Trying to Kill Obamacare,"￼ 
￼
  
Dear Professor  ,
As you may know, on December 14, a U.S. District Court judge in Texas ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional.  However, this fight is far from over.  Legal proceedings in the case are ongoing, the ACA is still the law of the land, and Americans are still able to access the health care benefits they rely on.
This ruling is the latest example in a years-long effort by national Republicans to sabotage the ACA by any possible means.  From their unsuccessful attempts to repeal the law here in Congress, to promoting junk insurance plans that do not cover essential health benefits or pre-existing conditions, Republicans continue to try to gut the key consumer protections that the ACA provides.  In fact, the Trump Administration played a major role in this court ruling by instructing the Department of Justice not to defend the ACA in this case.
Should this ruling stand, 20 million Americans and over 100,000 Rhode Islanders who receive health insurance through the ACA would be without health coverage, and a further 133 million Americans and over 450,000 Rhode Islanders with pre-existing conditions could lose access to affordable health care plans.  I joined all of my Democratic colleagues in the Senate to urge the President to defend the law and condemn the court's decision.  I also joined as an original cosponsor of a resolution that would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the Senate in this case and defend all provisions of the ACA. 
Know that I will continue fighting to preserve the ACA and ensure that all Americans have access to affordable, meaningful health care coverage.
Sincerely,
 
Jack Reed
United States Senator

Dear Friend, 
Congratulations to the University of Texas at San Antonio and Our Lady of the Lake University for receiving $160,000 in federal grants for the humanities. We know the more we invest in our next generation's education, the bigger promise we have for tomorrow. 
Congratulations also to the Daughters of Charity Services for the $1,170,081 they received from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to expanding access to education . We know education is the surest path to success, and this grant will inevitably help build a stronger Infrastructure of Opportunity for a more prosperous tomorrow.  
Justice for Jakelin 
Like all Americans, I was devastated to hear about the death of seven-year-old Jakelin Caal who died in Border Patrol Custody earlier this month. I spoke to Joy Reid on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow show last Friday to discuss this tragedy and how we can and must do better as a nation.  
￼ 
I led a Hispanic Caucus congressional delegation this week to retrace Jakelin’s journey, and investigate the circumstances of her tragic death. You can watch the full readout of our findings here. 
￼ 
You can watch the press conference we held outside Lordsburg Border Patrol Station here.  
You can also read about in the Washington Post, NBC News, Buzzfeed News, and Dallas Morning News. 
I joined Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee Jerrold Nadler, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security Zoe Lofgren, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, and Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security Lucille Roybal-Allard in urging the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General to open an investigation into Jakelin’s death. 
￼￼￼ 
I also joined colleagues from New Mexico and Texas, Senators Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich, and Congressmen Ben Ray Luján, Michelle Lujan Grisham, and Marc Veasey in a letter to the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection demanding an immediate investigation into Jakelin’s death.

New DHS Asylum Policy 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s decision to make migrants wait in Mexico while processing asylum claims is the single biggest assault to date by this Administration on the world’s most vulnerable populations that come to America, legally, and in search of a better life. You can read my full statement here.

Happy holidays, Silicon Valley!
As we close out an eventful 2018, I want to reflect on the privilege it has been to represent you in Congress. I am grateful for each of who took the time to make your voice heard by contacting me with your views and concerns. My Santa Clara and Washington, DC offices received 33,230 calls, e-mails, and letters from CA-17 residents who care deeply about their how the government works for their families and communities. Your passion is inspiring and helps me be a more informed and effective representative.
I would like to highlight some of our work and accomplishments in Washington, DC and here in the Bay Area over the past year that has contributed to progress made towards improving the lives of the people in our region and across the country.
Constituent Service Award Nomination
In January, our district office was informed that we qualified for the semifinals of the Congressional Management Foundation’s Constituent Services award, which is an honor for any first-term member of Congress. With more than 80 percent of our case work related to immigration, our constituents and their families face serious challenges. We are proud of the level to which we have been able to help them solve problems and make government work for them. This year we have completed more than 750 cases for Silicon Valley residents who needed help navigating the federal bureaucracy.
Fighting Airplane Noise in the South Bay
In September, I wrote a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) asking for the disruptive Bay Side Visual flight path to be eliminated. The FAA responded a month later, confirming that our request has been granted, and the route into the San Carlos Airport has been canceled. This is a big victory for all residents in the area who have had to deal with disruptive airplane noise.
Steve Kerr Joins Student Town Hall on Gun Violence
This past March, Warriors Head Coach Steve Kerr joined me at Newark Memorial High School for a discussion with Matt Deitsch, a Stoneman Douglas High School graduate and the Community Outreach Director for March for Our Lives. Coach Kerr, Matt, and I talked with students about what we can do to reduce gun violence and prevent further tragedies. That same month, more than 800 marches from San Jose to Washington, DC showed that America’s youth are driving this conversation and that it is long past time for Congress to respond. 
Addressing Milpitas Landfill Odor
For years, residents of Milpitas have endured an unpleasant odor generated by incoming yard trimmings mixed with food waste waiting to be put on to composting piles at the Newby Island facility. My office worked with Alameda County Supervisor Scott Haggerty to write to the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, asking for a regional odor study to verify the main sources conclusively, and to pay for sensors to be distributed around Milpitas to help with that verification. Our office is also working with state Assemblymember Kansen Chu’s office to pressure the Local Enforcement Authority and CalRecycle to enforce odor standards. 
Pushing to End U.S. Military Involvement in the War in Yemen
I have been working for nearly two years to end U.S. military involvement in the Saudi-coalition-led war in Yemen, which has left more than 14 million Yemeni civilians, many of which are children, at risk of famine and a cholera epidemic. In a major victory, the Senate recently passed its version of the War Powers Resolution that I am leading in the House, yet outgoing Speaker Ryan has refused to allow my resolution to come to the floor for a vote.
I am heartened by the recently-negotiated ceasefire in this Saudi-Iran proxy war that will allow humanitarian aid and supplies to enter the country through the port of Hodeida. Additionally, the Administration recently announced an end to U.S. support for the refueling of Saudi-coalition bombers that has contributed to casualties and widespread suffering of millions of innocent Yemenis. I will continue pushing for peace in 2019 and am pleased that Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi has assured me personally that the House will vote on my War Powers Resolution after I reintroduce it in January in order to take back the Constitutional authority granted to Congress for military intervention overseas.
Modernizing Government Websites
I introduced the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA), which passed both the House and Senate and has been signed by the President. This legislation, which brings government websites into the 21st Century, is the second bill I have introduced that has become law – the most among first-term Democrats. This common-sense solution will help improve how every American interacts with their government online while saving time and taxpayer money by modernizing and streamlining federal forms and the government process. 
Raising Wages for 350,000 Amazon Employees
In September, Senator Bernie Sanders and I introduced the Stop BEZOS Act, legislation taking on corporate welfare and the big companies that rake in massive profits for their shareholders and executives on the backs of severely underpaid workers.  A few weeks later, Amazon bowed to pressure that our legislation had created and was compelled to announce that wages for all employees, including part-time and seasonal workers, will go up to at least $15.00 an hour. It is the responsibility of all corporations, especially those making billions of dollars, to ensure that those who work hard for them are justly compensated and can afford to put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads. 
Protecting Americans Online with the Internet Bill of Rights
Online privacy and the protection of personal data is now a critical priority for American consumers. The government’s response to the Equifax breach, Cambridge Analytica scandal and other serious violations exposed an information gap among members of Congress. I was proud that House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi tasked me, as one of Silicon Valley’s representatives, to outline ten principles which we can use to guide legislation defining clear and concise online protections. 
I am hopeful that my principles will form the basis of an “Internet Bill of Rights” to protect consumer data privacy. In consultation with the founder of the world wide web, Tim Berners-Lee, and other technologists, I proposed these guidelines as explained in a piece in TIME Magazine. As we continue to live more of our lives online, and as technology continues to rapidly advance, it is vital that we establish reasonable and robust protections, just as our forefathers did when laying the foundation of our nation. I am hopeful that the Internet Bill of Rights will be considered next year and will work toward passing it.
Taking on Big Pharma and Excessive Prescription Drug Prices
In November, Sen. Sanders and I announced our bill that will take on Big Pharma’s price-gouging of sick and aging Americans. Big Pharma upcharges us because we don’t have any patient protections, but this bill changes that: If a drug company decides to sell their product for higher than the median price that they sell that same drug to our friends in Canada, Japan, and Europe, then the company loses its government-granted market monopoly, and generic drug producers can enter the market and bring the price down through competition.
One in four Americans reports difficulty paying for their prescription drugs and, overall, Americans pay 40 percent or more for pharmaceuticals than similar countries. That’s just not right. Medicine should not condemn a person to a lifetime of debt. Sick and elderly Americans should not be forced to choose between food and life-saving prescriptions. It is past time for Congress to stand up to the powerful Pharma lobbyists, and Sen. Sanders and I will be leading that fight. 
Putting Americans Back to Work
In July, I introduced the Job Opportunities for All Act, which invests in putting Americans back to work. There are eight million Americans who want to work but cannot find jobs, and another 4.7 million who want full-time jobs but can only find part-time work. In response, my bill builds on the legacy of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Economic Bill of Rights by directing federal funds to grants and programs providing Americans with private and public-sector job opportunities with a focus on economically distressed communities. No one should be denied the opportunity to earn a living in the richest country on Earth.
Monthly Town Hall Meetings
In keeping with my promise to the people of CA-17 when you first sent me to Congress, I have held at least one town hall meeting every month, continuing through 2018. This year, we held two town halls each in Milpitas, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, and San Jose District 4, and one each in Cupertino, Fremont, San Jose District 1, and Newark. An average of 150 constituents have attended this year, and I have been able to answer most of your questions at each town hall. 
Thank you for the privilege of representing you in Congress. I vow to spend 2019 the same way I spent 2018: Fighting for a just economy that benefits all people, a foreign policy that does not rely on war, and a government that listens and works for you. 
Moving forward, it is important for me to hear from my constituents. Whether it’s a quick phone call, writing our office, or asking a question at one of my monthly town halls, I always appreciate hearing from you. Let’s keep up the energy in 2019! 
Best,

Health Care Open Enrollment
There is less than a month left for Californians to get health care coverage for 2019. The ACA open enrollment period ends on January 15. Visit www.CoveredCA.com to be sure that you’re covered. Most people can find plans for between $50 and $100 per month. Even if you were covered before, take a few minutes to look around – you might end up saving money.

HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
Dear Friend,
With 2019 approaching, I want to wish you and your family Happy Holidays and best wishes for the new year. As we celebrate the holiday season with family and friends, I want to make sure we take a moment and remember everyone in our beautiful region.
For me, I’m honored to represent you in Congress. Every day I think about the work you do to make our community better, and it inspires me to work even harder on your behalf.
I’m thinking about the folks who are still struggling to find a good-paying job, feed their kids, pay for healthcare, or even keep a roof over their heads. And we should all remember our brave men and women serving overseas, who won’t get to spend the holidays in the comfort of their own home surrounded by loved ones.
The holidays are a time for all of us to come together as one community, and one nation. As we approach a new year full of exciting opportunities, let’s remember that there is far more that unites us than divides us.
I wish you all a safe, peaceful and joyous holiday – and I look forward to our work together in 2019!
As always, I am here to help you. If you need assistance, please do not hesitate to contact my Bothell office at (425) 485-0085. If you have questions or comments about the topics that matter most to you, I encourage you to contact me through my website. You may also keep up-to-date on what I’m doing by following me on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.
 
Sincerely,
Suzan

12/20/18 13:46,Baldwin to Senate: Pass the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act Now,"Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email


￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Yesterday, Senator Baldwin called on her Senate colleagues to do the right thing and get our veterans the care they need by passing the Blue Water Navy bill immediately. 
""Navy veterans of the Vietnam war have been struggling to afford needed care. I’ve heard from veterans and their families across Wisconsin asking that the Senate do the right thing and pass this bill because they don’t have any more time to wait,” said Senator Baldwin. “The Senate needs to take action and pass the Blue Water Navy bill so our veterans can get the care they need.” 
>>> WATCH Senator Baldwin calls on her Senate colleagues to do the right thing and pass the Blue Water Navy bill now 
￼ 
The Blue Water Navy bill already passed the House unanimously. But the legislation is being blocked in the Senate by just a few Senators due to cost concerns - despite approving a tax bill last year that gave huge tax breaks to the largest corporations and added $1.9 trillion to our nation’s debt. Now, these Senators are opposing this legislation to support our vets. 
“When it comes to doing right by our Vietnam veterans who served this country and are now dying from their illnesses, we don’t have the money to spend to help them get better, or to help give their families a little more time with them?” said Senator Baldwin. 
“These veterans fought for us and are dying from their service. It’s past time to do the right thing for them. We need to pass this bill now and we should not be leaving Washington until it’s done.”
View Senator Baldwin’s full remarks urging her colleagues in the Senate to do the right thing and pass the Blue Water Navy bill immediately.

Friend-
From the worst traffic hot spot in the nation to a strained public transit system to bridges necessitating critical renovations, I know our region suffers from a unique set of infrastructure challenges. As I think about my priorities for the 116th Congress, I know there is room for bipartisan work to advance concrete solutions so folks can spend less time stuck in traffic and businesses can rely on an infrastructure system that will support continued economic growth. 
I believe encouraging private sector investments, prioritizing state and local input, and eliminating the labyrinth of regulations hindering shovel-ready projects will be essential to propelling America’s infrastructure into the 21st-century and securing long-term success as a nation.
That being said, I’d like to know what projects you think are most pressing when it comes to improving transportation and infrastructure in the First District.
[_] Extending I-95 Express Lanes
[_] Lane expansion of Route 301
[_] Addressing I-66 Tolls
[_] Improving the safety and operation of Metro
[_] Improving the Virginia Railway Express (VRE)
[_] Investing in a high-speed rail to Washington D.C.
[_] Resolving the Coleman Bridge Toll
[_] Expanding broadband access to rural areas 
[_] Improvements to Robert O. Norris Bridge
[_] Deepening and widening the Port of Virginia 
[_] Improving Amtrak  [_] Cultivating a skilled workforce to support the transportation industry 
[_] Other 
[_] I don’t know

I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with me. Your opinion helps me shape my thinking as I represent you in Washington.

Dear Neighbors, 
As 2018 comes to a close, it has been an honor to be your voice in the United States Congress. And, while this is my last term in Congress, I am not retiring - I am just leaving Washington. I look forward to spending more time in Texas, especially with my 12 grandkids who have all been born since 2004. Our area has been my home for more than 40 years, and it has been a privilege to advocate for the issues that our community cares about most. I am proud of the work my office has accomplished: giving crime victims a voice, helping to combat human trafficking, and fighting for our constitutional rights and individual liberty, working for our veterans, and keeping America safe. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve as your representative for 14 years. And, that's just the way it is.
GOD and TEXAS,

Cowboy Rides Away 
Over my career I have spoken on the floor of the House of Representatives more than almost any other Member of Congress—more than 2000 times. I always considered it an absolute privilege to stand before the House and my constituents on a variety of issues. Below is a link to my last speech on the House floor discussing some of the issues important to the Second District of Texas. 
 
""Mr. Speaker, it is the final showdown scene, and while there are no swinging doors or clicking of spurs, eerie signs and sounds of silence or dust swirling behind me, I stand here today in the people's House to speak probably for the last time. If they would let me cue the soundtrack, the king of country, George Strait, would sing 'Oh, the last goodbye's the hardest one to say. This is where the cowboy rides away.'""

Giving Crime Victims A Voice 
As a prosecutor and judge for over 30 years in Harris County, I saw every crime imaginable and the impact of crime on the victims. One of my first actions in Congress was to establish the bipartisan Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus with Congressman Jim Costa (D-CA) to advocate on behalf of victims in our nation's capital. We introduced many pieces of legislation including: 
 
Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting (SAFER) Act
	•	Reduces nation-wide rape kit backlog; expedites DNA evidence processing
Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act—signed into law by the president 
	•	Extends medical care coverage by the Peace Corps when volunteers return from service with an illness or injury
	•	Ensures that each overseas medical post is consistent in scope and size with the needs of the post and has well-qualified and capable personnel
	•	Makes the Office of Victim's Advocacy permanent and extending the Sexual Assault Advisory Council, giving it greater access to information and requiring a licensed mental health professional be a member of the Council
Citizens Right to Know 
	•	Requires any state or local pre-trial release program that accepts federal money to report basic information such as who participates in the programs, the criminal records of the participants, their appearance rates at trial and hearings.
The Megan Rondini Act
	•	Requires hospitals to have a SAFE (Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner) available 24 hours a day / 7 days a week, OR to have a plan in place to get that victim to another nearby hospital with a SAFE.
	•	The law honors young Texan, Megan Rondini, who after being raped was failed by law enforcement, the University of Alabama, and the hospital resulting in her suicide. 
Protecting the Victims of Crime Fund
	•	Protects the Crime Victims Fund from being redirected to other uses and thereby threatening to severely reduce services for crime victims of crime
	•	The fund consists solely of criminal fines, forfeitures and other penalties, not federal tax dollars, and has no impact on the national deficit
Justice For All—signed into law by the president
	•	Signed into law December 16th, 2016
	•	Improves the administration of criminal justice and crime victims' programs
	•	Protects the innocent by improving access to post conviction DNA testing
	•	Reduces the rape kit backlog and provides resources for forensic labs



Human Trafficking 
Unfortunately, our hometown of Houston, Texas, is one of the largest hubs for human trafficking in the nation. Much of my legislative work here in Washington concentrates on protecting our children from modern-day slavery. I am proud to have secured the 2017 reauthorization of the Adam Walsh Act to protect children from sexual exploitation and violent crime, prevent child abuse and child pornography, and establish the national sex offender registry, as well as the reauthorization of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. 
 
Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act—signed into law by the president 
	•	Provides additional funding to victims' service programs 
	•	Increases the authority of law enforcement to investigate both the buyer and the seller
	•	Increases awareness and prevention
	•	Empowers victims of modern-day slavery 
Violence against Women Reauthorization Act
	•	Addresses the plight of victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, and dating violence 
	•	Provides funding for investigating and prosecuting violent crimes against women
	•	Provides important protections and services to victims, many of whom are women and children

Securing the Southern Border 
During my time in Congress, I have visited every county along the southern border dozens of times to see what's happening first-hand and to receive updates from the people on the front lines. Everyone has different roles to play, but their message is all the same: we are doing what we can with what we've got…but we need more. I've taken their suggestions back to Washington and crafted several bills and amendments to help address their needs:  
 
Send Equipment for National Defense (SEND) ACT
	•	Makes 10% of eligible returning equipment from Iraq and Afghanistan available to federal and state law enforcement agencies for border security purposes
	•	Eligible equipment includes Humvees, Aerostats, night vision equipment
	•	Elements signed into law through multiple appropriations bills
SMART Border Act
	•	Regains operational control of the border
	•	Creates a robust border protection strategy requiring the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to work with state and local stakeholders to secure the border
	•	Requires a vote by Congress certifying this control no longer than 90 days after DHS reports completion of the goal 
Timely Repatriation Act
	•	Requires countries to take back their foreign nationals deported from the United States without refusal or delay
	•	Withholds diplomatic visas to those countries that refuse or unduly delay repatriating their citizens 
	•	Elements of this policy have been adopted by the Trump administration 
Border Communications Infrastructure Act
	•	Passed in multiple appropriations bills
	•	Created a grant program to pay for communications infrastructure along the US/Mexico border 
	•	This grant program has been funded at $10 million or more since 2011 due to our efforts

Privacy & the Fourth Amendment 
From dial-up internet to the smartphones of today, technology has continuously evolved. While technology may change, the Constitution does not. This is why I co-founded the Fourth Amendment Caucus and introduced key pieces of legislation to protect the privacy and security of Americans in the digital age. It is the duty of government to balance the interests of protecting Americans while respecting their Constitutional rights. The Fourth Amendment Caucus has fought to protect Americans against warrantless searches and seizures, close privacy-violating surveillance loopholes, and champion reform efforts to protect and restore Fourth Amendment rights: 
 
FISA Reform 
	•	Section 702 of FISA allows the National Security Agency and other government entities to incidentally collect large amounts of digital information on American citizens while conducting surveillance on legitimate foreign targets
	•	This data is then often searched for information on American citizens- without a warrant
	•	This search is a violation of the United States Constitution and should be subject to a warrant
End Warrantless Surveillance of American Act
	•	Ends warrantless surveillance - an unconstitutional practice
	•	Variations of this legislation have passed the House as appropriations amendments
The Online Communications and Geolocation Protection Act 
	•	Modernizes the outdated Electronic Communications Privacy Act 
	•	Requires government to obtain a search warrant prior to intercepting or forcing disclosure of electronic communications or geolocation data
	•	Preserves exceptions for emergency situations, foreign intelligence surveillance, individual consent, public information, and emergency assistance
Preserving American Privacy Act 
	•	By 2030, an estimated 30,000 drones could be flying in American skies, this bill aims to prevent warrantless aerial surveillance by drone 
	•	Establishes specific guidelines about when and for what purposes law enforcement agencies and private individuals can use drones to conduct targeted surveillance
	•	Ensures the privacy of American citizens



Veterans
As a veteran and son of a World War II veteran, I believe the United States has the greatest military in the world. We must recognize that our military's contributions - both during service and after our troops come back home - are essential to our country's day-to-day life. We must we must continue our support for active and retired military. I am proud to support legislation and community events for our veterans.
 
Veterans Back to Work Act
	•	Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make permanent the veterans portion of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC)
	•	Allows employers who hire honorably discharged veterans to receive a tax credit equal to the amount of the veteran's pay
Veterans' Religious Freedom Act 
	•	Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure that the family members of each veteran who is buried in a national cemetery or is eligible for certain veterans' burial benefits are informed of all options available for the funeral or memorial service for such veteran, and the director of each national cemetery is a qualified veteran
	•	Prohibits the Secretary from prescribing regulations to censor or otherwise limit the type of religious speech that may be performed by a member of a veteran's service organization at the funeral or memorial service of a veteran, or censoring the type of religious speech of private speakers who have been invited to speak on property of the VA
Veterans Education Disaster Act 
	•	Provides relief to student veterans who are trying to continue their education but are denied assistance based on circumstances outside of their control, like natural disasters
	•	This problem arose in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey at Lone Star College in Kingwood
	•	Ensures that veterans continue to receive housing stipends and supply fee payment waivers when they face extended school closures due to natural disasters
Honor Houston Heroes
	•	Our fifth annual official event honoring past, present, and future servicemen and women was made even more special with the attendance of Vice President Mike Pence

Protecting our Waterways 
Our ports play a vital role in the stabilization and growth of our nation's economy as well as the preservation of our national security. With this belief, I co-founded the Ports Opportunity, Renewal, Trade, and Security (PORTS) Caucus. One of the Caucus' founding principles was to use the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund revenue for its intended purpose - port maintenance. 
 
Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund
	•	Immediately remove the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund from Congress' grasps and ensure that every penny of the fund goes back to ports
	•	Through an annual, step-by-step process, increase Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund funding for ports, finally reaching 100% utilization in 2025  
Water Resources Development Act Amendments
	•	Cosponsored and supported amendments in the Water Resources Development Act reauthorization that would ensure the Army Corps of Engineers expedites already authorized flood mitigation projects in Texas. These amendments passed unanimously.
	•	Secured language in to expedite completion of the Sabine Neches Waterway Chiefs Report for the widening and deepening of the waterway



Foreign Affairs
From a porous southern border to volatile, nuclear-armed rogue nations, our country is under more threats today than ever before. As Chairman of the House Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade Subcommittee, I believe the primary responsibility of our government is to keep Americans safe. During my chairmanship it has been my goal to bring attention to some of the most pressing international threats to our country and global stability. Many of my bills, including legislation that targeted Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran's proxies, the North Korean regime, and incitement taught to kids in Saudi Arabia, have all been in the shared security interests of the United States and our besieged Israeli allies. I have authorized countless pieces of legislation, of which 13 passed the House of Representatives and were sent to the Senate for consideration. 
 
North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation 
	•	Passed the House of Representatives and enacted as part of HR 3364
	•	This rouge nation has conducted 16 ballistic missile tests this year alone 
	•	North Korea has now been called out for what it is: a State Sponsor of Terrorism 
Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act—signed into law by the president 
For over 50 years, the United States has been operating an outdated and wasteful foreign aid system, not knowing what results, if any, our aid is achieving.
	•	Ensures U.S. foreign aid is being used in the most effective and efficient ways
	•	Requires the State Department to make available information about current foreign aid programs on their website to improve transparency
	•	Ensures America is still able to assist where appropriate and where needed, while safeguarding taxpayer dollars
	•	Requires the president to set guidelines for the establishment of goals, performance metrics, and monitoring and evaluation plans for US foreign assistance
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Terrorist Sanctions Act 
(Enacted via Executive Order)
The IRGC is a leading cause of instability in the Middle East through its support of the murderous regime in Syria, its development of ballistic missiles, and its provocative action towards our sailors transiting the region. 
	•	Pursuant to Executive Order 13224, the IRGC has been designated as a terrorist organization, a step that I proposed in my bill H.R. 478 earlier this year
FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act
	•	Includes legislation I proposed that would target two of Iran's most violent proxies that have killed Americans in Iraq, committed atrocities against the Syrian people, and have expressed a desire to attack Israel 
Senator Paul Simon Water for the World Act—signed into law by the president 
	•	Emphasizes the importance of including safe hygiene practices in water and sanitations programming across the world
	•	Mandates a Global Water Coordinator within the State Department to oversee and improve water, sanitation, and hygiene programs
	•	Prioritizes countries of the greatest need by ensuring that they receive the most U.S. government assistance
	•	Requires USAID to produce a Global Water Strategy to create a whole-of-government approach to increasing access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene
Pakistan State Sponsor of Terrorism Act 
	•	Revoke Pakistan's Major Non-NATO Ally status
	•	Requires the President to issue a report within 90 days detailing whether Pakistan has provided support for international terrorism
	•	Requires the Secretary of State to submit a follow-up report 30 days after that, containing either a determination that Pakistan is a state sponsor of terrorism or a justification as to why it does not meet the legal criteria for such designation
Combat Terrorist Use of Social Media Act—language adopted and signed into law 
	•	Requires the president to produce an administration-wide strategy to combat terrorists online
	•	We must first have a strategy before we can effectively defeat this enemy on every battlefield, including the cyber battlefield
￼ 
Congressman Poe spoke about his support for the National Defense Reauthorization Act—which funds our military and military operations—with American soldiers in Iraq. 



Recovering from Hurricane Harvey 
Last year, Hurricane Harvey devastated our community. However, your strength and willingness to lend a hand to a neighbor has been a constant reminder that we will come back stronger than ever. This is Texas, and it's simply how we do things. In the aftermath of the second most costly natural disaster in history, our community received overwhelming support. The Texas Congressional delegation led the charge to pass multiple bills ensuring federal recovery funding.
 
Disaster Relief
	•	Secured $122.9 billion in total funds for disaster mitigation and flood control efforts
	•	Provided $90 million for the Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery Program
	•	Secured $15 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to study and construct improvements to Addicks and Barker reservoirs
 
More than a year later, Texas must concentrate not only on continued recovery efforts, but prevention as well. As the storm subsided, I immediately began working with the state of Texas to obtain an emergency designation for the dredging project of the San Jacinto River and Lake Houston. The Army Corps of Engineers has waived many of the environmental requirements for this project and dredging has begun. This project is just the first step in hardening flood defenses for the area. Additional retention areas to the north, as well as new floodgates on Lake Houston must be completed as soon as possible. I will continue to work with the relevant entities to ensure that the $122.9 billion in funding secured by Congress is used for these purposes.

Having trouble reading this email? Click here to view the plain text.
￼
Congressman Louie Gohmert (TX-01) spoke on the House Floor tonight, along with other members of the House Freedom Caucus, about the need to fund the border wall.
￼
Watch the FULL SPEECH, here.  
He passionately stated on the floor, “Now we need Americans to help remind our Republican leaders, to help our president build the wall like we said. If that doesn't happen, I don't think the Senate can count on being back in the majority. They won't be -- it's that serious.” 
“I’ve heard the feeling in the Senate among Republicans is –nah, let's don't do reconciliation so we'd only have to pass the money for a wall with 50, 51 votes. Let's don’t do -- we don't want to do that. If you don't do that -- get money passed for the wall, you're not coming back in the majority. Maybe enjoy the minority. Get used to it. That's where you're heading in two years.” 
“It doesn't have to be that way. We can still have the White House in 2020. We can still have a majority in the Senate in 2020. We can get the majority back in the House in 2020; but if we drop the ball on this biggest campaign promise, we're not going to have the majority in either House or the White House. And that, to quote my friend from Houston, my fellow former judge, that's the way it is.”

Dear Friend, 
Farmers and rural landowners in North Missouri received several pieces of good news last week. 
President Trump’s EPA announced that the disastrous “Waters of the United States” rule, or WOTUS, is no more and a new Clean Water Rule will replace it.   
With WOTUS, the Obama administration rewrote standing law to extend its authority onto farms and private property. It represented everything people distrust and resent about the federal government because it added more red tape for farmers and property owners who were simply trying to manage their land and make an honest living.
As a sixth-generation farmer, I found this to be a blatant abuse of our private property rights and I was disgusted that farmers and small businesses were forced to comply with overcomplicated regulations put in place by unelected bureaucrats.  
I had the privilege of joining President Trump’s EPA Administrator, Andrew Wheeler, to announce that the new definition of what constitutes “Waters of the United States” is far clearer. 
Most importantly, dry creek beds, most ditches and other bodies of water that only occur when it rains have been excluded from federal regulation. The new rule will also enable private property owners to avoid spending thousands of dollars on engineers to find out if they need a federal permit for a project on their land. 
While reducing onerous regulations will greatly benefit farmers, a piece of legislation that they depend on is finally finished. The Farm Bill has finally been completed, providing farmers the certainty they need to feed the world. This long-term bill preserves crop insurance, which was my number one priority, and makes improvements to commodity support programs, known as Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) and Price Loss Coverage (PLC). It also includes important changes to conservation programs that farmers use to maintain their land. 
The Farm Bill doesn’t just help farmers; it helps everyone in our rural communities. Whether it’s hospitals, water systems or schools, the Farm Bill includes programs to help build critical rural infrastructure projects including connecting rural Missourians with the broadband speed and access they need. The days of no internet availability or average internet speeds being acceptable are over. Everything we do today, from the farm fields to the classroom, requires fast, functioning broadband internet. This bill makes grants and loans available to build out broadband infrastructure to the rural areas and requires those utilizing them to maintain 21st century internet speeds. 
It was a very beneficial week for rural America. I’m pleased that our farmers have been given more certainty when it comes to both farm programs and regulations. Hopefully, this will provide some peace of mind as they continue to feed the world.


Sincerely,
￼ 
Sam Graves

 Dear Friends,  It’s been an honor to represent you in Congress and to attempt to advance the ideals of limited government and personal freedom while there. I’ve tried my very best to do these things, and my team put together what follows as a synopsis of our collective endeavors on your behalf. Indeed, the operative questions of leadership at any inflection point lie in what does it mean and where do we go from here.  This legislative review of my most recent time in Congress is at least a context for answering those questions - and the thousands of hours invested over the last five years in trying to represent the people of the Lowcountry and the principles of limited government. The legislative review is broken down into the five sections that represent the focal points of our efforts.   Debt, Deficit, and Government Spending — This has always represented the bullseye of what I’ve tried to affect in government. I believe it’s been my job to work to protect your pocketbook or wallet from the ever-reaching hand of government. I’ve been devout in these efforts, and was indeed ranked in the top 10 in Congress in efforts to do so. If all my votes had prevailed, government’s weight would collectively be about $4 trillion lighter. This is important because money is a proxy for freedom - and freedom is the hallmark of the American experiment. There will always be a legitimate tension between security and freedom, but the Founding Fathers came down squarely on the side of individual liberty. It’s also vital because I continue to believe that we are sleepwalking our way toward the greatest financial crisis in the history of our nation. If we don’t turn spending around, the financial markets will do it for us, and the process by which they do so will be incredibly destructive.   Expanding Freedom and Protecting Civil Liberty — Once again, there is a legitimate tension between security and freedom - but too often civil liberty is the first casualty of our need for security. I tried to push for balance since large swaths of civil liberty had been forfeited in the name of security in a post-9/11 world.   Preserving Quality of Life in the Lowcountry — If one really believes in federalism, one understands that not all decisions need to be made in Washington. Local jurisdictions and people can come together and determine what works best for themselves and those they love without control from our nation’s capital. This is a good part of what has driven my votes on this front. The rest has been directed based on a long-held belief that we should be proactive about protecting our natural resources and all that makes our state and the Lowcountry special. Conservatism, in my view, extends to more than just financial resources; it includes this Biblical notion of stewardship. We should take care of that with which we’ve been blessed.   Making Our Country More Competitive — Going back to my days as governor, I’ve also long believed that we have to be proactive about doing things that make our state, or in this case, country more competitive relative to other economies around the world. Our ability to pay debts and earn livings is contingent upon good policy on this front.   Upholding the Rule of Law — There are plenty of good ideas out there, but many don’t fit with the idea of a limited federal government as prescribed by the Founding Fathers and the Constitution that they wrote. Upholding limited government, therefore, becomes a daily battle against in many cases well-intended ideas and remedies that would grow government beyond the Founding Fathers’ intent. We fought that battle consistently.   Again, I hope that this overview gives you a context for the above-mentioned endeavors. I’ve worked consistently to try to advance the five ideals above, which were core to the promises I made in running for office. Above all, let me repeat myself: It’s been an honor to have been in the arena on your behalf over these last five years.   Sincerely

￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ 

Dear Lindsey: 
Did you know that right now you can sign up for affordable health insurance for 2019?  Despite a federal judge in Texas recently ruling against the Affordable Care Act, California's open enrollment period is unaffected and accepting new enrollees in health plans for 2019.    From now until January 15, 2019, you and your family can purchase a plan or renew your coverage through Covered California.   All too often, hard-working American families are just one sickness or injury away from bankruptcy. Fortunately, health insurance can protect you from unexpected costs, provide you with financial security, and give you and your family peace of mind should you or a loved one fall ill or get injured.
￼
Coverage may be more affordable than you think. Last year, 8-in-10 people qualified for financial assistance, with premiums as low as $50 to $100 per month. 
If you have any questions about signing up or the plans available, more than 20,000 certified agents and enrollers throughout California stand ready to assist you with free, confidential assistance at http://www.coveredca.com/get-help/local/.

Interview: Obamacare and the Border  
￼
Fox News interview on the Obamacare Texas court ruling and the national border, December 15, 2018.

Service Academy Nominations   On December 1st the Congressman gathered with a group of distinguished military officers who provide him with advice on Service Academy nominations. Using the Placer County Board of Supervisors Chamber, the panel (which continued on December 8th) conducted interviews with Service Academy candidates from the 4th Congressional District. These interviews and the overall judgement of the panel form the basis for the Congressman’s nominations to the Service Academies. A testament to the success of this process is more than 91 cadets, midshipmen, and officers serving in our armed forces!    


Iranian Freedom Movement 
A Congressional Solidarity with a Free Iran event was held in Washington, D.C. on December 11th. The Congressman attended and delivered remarks discussing his legislation, H.Res.1034. The bill, with 103 co-authors, expresses support for the Iranian people’s desire for a democratic, secular and non-nuclear Republic of Iran.

12/19/18 17:16,News from Congresswoman Roybal-Allard,"￼ 
  

Dear Friend,

I'm pleased to share some highlights of my recent work in Congress and our communities.  I hope you find them informative.  And if you haven't followed me yet on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, be sure to do so today.  See the online version of this newsletter here.

I am deeply humbled to fight every day for our 40th District in Congress.  On January 3, 2019, a new chapter in that fight will begin with the swearing-in of a new House Democratic majority that works For The People, so we can secure A Better Deal for all Americans.  It will be my privilege to be part of that majority, and to keep fighting on your behalf to create jobs, increase paychecks, lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs, make a good higher education accessible for everyone, enact comprehensive and humane immigration reform, and clean the air, land, and water in our communities.

I recently delivered the latest Democratic Weekly Address calling for President Trump to keep our government open, rather than forcing a shutdown that hurts American families, businesses, and communities.  President Trump has wanted to squander $5 billion on an immoral, ineffective and expensive border wall – and had publicly declared that he’d be ""proud"" to shut down the government if he cannot force American taxpayers to pay for that wall.  However, as the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, I know we have critical national security needs that cannot be met if we waste money on a Trump wall.

Democrats want to keep the government open.  It’s President Trump’s choice to keep government open, or to shut the government down.  The American people are waiting for his response.


Read the New Edition of My Student Resource Guide:

If you are a high school or college student, or the parent of a student, and are looking for help to pay for college, I encourage you to read the 2018-2019 edition of my Student Resource Guide.  The guide includes information about scholarships, internships, fellowships, and websites to help you meet your college expenses.  Please feel free to circulate it!


Meeting Constituents and Celebrating Our Communities:

￼
Presenting a Certificate of Congressional Recognition to the City of Paramount in honor of its Santa Train's 50th anniversary.

It has been a joy to greet 40th District residents and hear their views at many recent community events.  At the Salazar Park Thanksgiving Lunch in East LA, I wished the crowd a very happy Thanksgiving.  In Paramount, I helped celebrate the 50th anniversary of the city's Santa Train, and climbed aboard the train to help Santa distribute treats to Paramount residents.  In Huntington Park, I congratulated the city on its 68th annual Christmas Parade.  And in Bell Gardens, I offered holiday greetings to those at the Bicycle Hotel & Casino Community Foundation’s “An Incredible Christmas” event.


Promoting Good Health for All Americans:

Last Friday, a judge in Texas ruled against the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  While the ACA remains in place for now, and this legal fight is nowhere near over, the judge's misguided ruling completely fails to reflect Congress's intent to expand access to healthcare and protect those with pre-existing conditions.  I will keep working as part of the coming Democratic House majority to protect the health care of the millions of Americans helped by the ACA.

I’m deeply disappointed that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have delayed efforts to prescribe antibiotics more responsibly in nursing homes.  When people are overprescribed antibiotics, they can develop resistance to the very drugs that can keep themselves healthy.  That’s why I’ve joined Rep. Jan Schakowsky and seven of our colleagues in writing to CMS Administrator Seema Verma asking for an update on these lifesaving programs.


Serving Our Seniors:

￼
Speaking with LA Metro representatives at my ""Seniors Matter"" resource fair in South LA.

I was thrilled to partner with Rep. Karen Bass to co-sponsor “Seniors Matter: A Resource Fair to Help Elders and Those Who Support Them” at Fremont High School in South LA.  Thank you to the 40th and 37th District constituents who attended, and the agency representatives who provided our constituents with valuable informational resources.  My staff and I are always pleased to help residents of our 40th District, including seniors, resolve any issues they may have with federal agencies and programs, including Medicare, the Social Security Administration, the Veterans Administration, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the U.S. Postal Service, and the IRS.  My office provides these services to constituents free of charge.  For more information, please visit my ""Help with Federal Agencies"" webpage at https://roybal-allard.house.gov/constituentservices/casework.

The Trump Administration’s Labor Department has proposed a dangerous rule that would let unsupervised teenagers move vulnerable seniors using power-driven patient lifts.  I’ve joined with Reps. Rosa DeLauro and Mark Takano in leading 29 of our colleagues in opposing this terrible Labor Department proposal.  Read our letter here.


Fighting for the Just and Humane Treatment of Immigrants and Refugees:

America needs comprehensive immigration reform, not the negligent, punitive, and reactionary immigration policies of the Trump Administration.  For example, I've been appalled that the Administration failed to take crucial steps to prevent child abusers from being hired to care for migrant kids at the Tornillo tent city.  These children also face a dangerous shortage of mental health care to help them process their trauma.  We must do all we can to make sure these children are treated humanely and fairly while in our nation's care.  That is why I have called for Tornillo to be shut down NOW in a letter to the Secretaries of Homeland Security (DHS) and Health and Human Services (HHS).  As the top Democrat on the DHS Appropriations Subcommittee, I will keep working tirelessly to conduct oversight into immigration detention and all DHS activities.  We must make sure that we are treating every single immigrant humanely.

DHS's ""public charge"" rule would jeopardize immigrants' green card eligibility if they use certain public benefits, including food and healthcare for mothers and children.  The Trump Administration must NOT put moms and kids at risk.  My letter to DHS urges them to withdraw this inhumane proposal.

As a mother, as a grandmother, and as an American, I am horrified, heartbroken, and infuriated that a 7-year-old little girl died in Customs and Border Protection (CBP) custody.  We must investigate her death FULLY, including CBP’s actions, and make certain that justice is served.  I have joined with fellow House Democrats to write to DHS's Acting Inspector General demanding an investigation of this horrific tragedy, and why CBP failed to meet the requirement of notifying Congress right away. 

I strongly oppose the Trump Administration's asylum ban, and am glad it has been blocked by a judge.  The ban is rooted in anti-immigrant fear, and violates both U.S. law and international law.  America should not be turning its back on women and children fleeing violence and persecution in their countries. That is why I have written to the president urging him to stop this senseless, hateful ban. 

I am also pleased that another court has stopped the president from ending Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).  While I am glad DACA is still in place, I will keep fighting to pass my Dream Act so we can permanently protect Dreamers and help them keep contributing to our country.  Our 40th District is home to the largest number of DACA recipients in America, and I am proud to work each day for a better future for them, for all Dreamers, and for every resident of our district.


Supporting Stronger and Safer Communities:

￼
Greeting LA County firefighters in East LA, alongside Rep. Grace Napolitano.

My friend Rep. Grace Napolitano and I were glad to be in East LA with some of our incredible LA County firefighters!  I am so thankful to our local first responders for their hard work to keep our communities safe and secure.

With transportation infrastructure expected to be a big issue for the new Congress next year, I was glad to meet with LA transportation leaders and advocates during Mobility 21's holiday legislative reception at Union Station Los Angeles.  I shared my support for the West Santa Ana Branch Metro project, and the study of the newly proposed station in South Gate that would offer direct access to the LA River.

It was my honor to take part in the YWCA Greater Los Angeles’ 125th anniversary celebration.  I made a statement in the Congressional Record saluting them for their history of fighting to better our communities and promote peace, justice, freedom, and dignity for all.

I also want to congratulate South LA's A Place Called Home on 25 years of helping 40th District families grow and excel.  Their Founder Debrah Constance and Executive Director Jonathan Zeichner accepted a copy of my Congressional Record statement saluting their organization's amazing work.


Standing Up for Our Youth and Our Schools:

At the request of myself and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has issued a devastating report on child labor in America.  The report finds that child workers, especially in agriculture, often face horrifying working conditions and even death.  The report makes it clear that our nation must enforce policies that uphold the basic well-being of child workers, instead of rolling back child labor protections and lifesaving regulations.  We will not wait for the administration to take the lead.  In the House Democratic Majority, we will conduct vigorous oversight to ensure existing laws are being properly enforced, and push for changes where necessary to keep child workers safe.

At a Bellflower Unified School District school board meeting, I greeted Bellflower Unified Superintendent Tracy McSparren and other district leaders.  I appreciate their hard work to provide a first-class education for all Bellflower Unified students.  I especially want to thank to outgoing Board President Laura Sanchez-Ramirez and outgoing Board Members Hannah Flanagan-Flores and Dr. Sue ElHessen for their tireless efforts.


Supporting Our Veterans and Our National Security:

￼
Honoring our veterans at the City of Downey's Veterans Day Ceremony.

I had the honor of taking part in Veterans Day ceremonies held by the cities of Downey and Bell, Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 1013 at Cinco Puntos, and American Legion Post 804 in East LA.  I also joined the City of Paramount for a Veterans Pancake Breakfast at Paramount Park Community Center.  At each of these events, I joined in thanking our nation’s veterans for their courageous service in defense of our communities, our freedoms, and our values.

On Capitol Hill, I was glad to join the American Red Cross in writing holiday cards to our armed forces overseas.  We are forever grateful to them and their families for their sacrifices on America's behalf.

It was great to be at Berth 95 in San Pedro to celebrate the commissioning of the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Forrest Rednour.  As the top House Democrat overseeing Coast Guard funding, I’m glad that the U.S. has fast response cutters like the Rednour to conduct lifesaving rescues and protect the security of our ports, coasts, and waterways.


Demanding Common Sense Spending Policies:

I have been proud to be a member of the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform, where we have worked to develop recommendations for improving our nation's budgeting.  Congress must spend money responsibly and efficiently, while preserving the strength of the programs on which millions of Americans depend.

During our discussions, I spoke in support of an amendment to repeal unrealistically low budget caps on discretionary spending.  It is tragically clear that these caps are stopping us from making responsible funding decisions that will strengthen America.

A YEAR IN REVIEW: “2018 was one for the books!” 
  
This past year, I’ve worked hard, day-in and day-out, to deliver real solutions to Iowa. 
Among these many different achievements over the last year, I’m particularly pleased to have fought successfully to: secure $117 million for the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project; achieve E15 year-round from the EPA; and, help pass historic opioid legislation in a meaningful and thoughtful way to help those struggling with this crippling epidemic. 
While it’s difficult to narrow a year’s worth of work into a few words, watching the VA MISSION Act—bipartisan legislation that improves veterans’ access to health care services — signed into law was one of my proudest moments as a U.S. Senator.  I’m especially pleased my bipartisan legislation, the VETS Act, was included as part of this bill, which will improve access to health care by expanding telehealth services from the VA. 
￼ 

Additional highlights from 2018 that will have a positive impact in the lives of Iowans include: 
	•	Finding Solutions for Rural America by working hard on the 2018 Farm Bill, redefining “Waters of the U.S.” and securing E15 year round.
  
	•	Making ‘Em Squeal by holding the administration accountable and cancelling Senators’ August recess.
  
	•	Caring for our Veterans and Servicemembers through efforts to improve access to health care and servicemember blast exposure injury prevention.   
	•	Addressing the Mental Health Crisis and Helping People with Disabilities with more mental health support.    
	•	Supporting Families and Defending Life by seeking to defund Planned Parenthood, protecting our most vulnerable, restoring Title X decisions to the states and pushing for paid family leave.   
	•	Fighting Against Sexual Assault and Violence with congressional anti-harassment rules, investigations and introducing critical school safety legislation.    
	•	Protecting America and her Global Interests by strengthening our national security against global threats and preparing the U.S. for advances in artificial intelligence.   
	•	Fighting the Opioid Crisis with historic legislation that includes my bills to increase drug take-back programs and require Medicare Advantage plans and prescription drug plans to provide information on safe disposal of prescription drugs.

99 County Tour - 2018 
	•	53 visits to Iowa companies, schools, facilities, farms;
	•	20 town hall meetings;
	•	7 roundtables;
	•	6 main street tours; and
	•	13 other community outreach events.

2018 was truly a year to remember. I’m tremendously proud to have delivered key wins for Iowans from across our state over the last 12 months. 
As we ring in the New Year, I’m excited to get right back to work fighting for you!

Florida is home to some of our country’s greatest treasures and natural resources.  
That’s why I’m calling on both parties in Congress to permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) before the end of the year. The fund is one of the country’s most important and successful conservation programs.  
Read the article below and let me know if you agree with my support for the LWCF. 
Vern 
￼  Vern Buchanan: Congress Needs to Reauthorize Land and Water Conservation Fund  Kevin Derby 
On Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., called on Congress to move quickly to reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), which expired at the end of summer.  
“This important government program provides states, counties and local governments with critical funding to protect and preserve national parks, water resources, wildlife habitats and historic sites,” Buchanan’s office noted. “In Florida alone, the LWCF has invested more than $1 billion to protect the Everglades, Biscayne National Park, Osceola National Forest, the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge and Caspersen Beach right here in Sarasota County. The Florida National Scenic Trail, one of only eleven National Scenic Trails throughout the U.S., also benefits from this successful program and is currently relying on new LWCF funding to protect shorelines.” 
Buchanan weighed in on Tuesday as to why Congress needed to approve the LWCF, stressing its importance to the Sunshine State and noting that the clock is ticking down until Congress adjourns.  
“This important conservation program will help preserve Florida’s iconic environmental resources for future generations,” Buchanan said. “It’s regrettable that despite broad bipartisan support Congress allowed this vital fund to expire.”
There is not much time left in the 115th Congress as Democrats get ready to assume control of the U.S. House in January. Buchanan, one of the co-chairs of the state delegation, currently sits on the U.S. House Ways and Means and the Budget Committees. 
Buchanan’s office insisted that Florida benefited from the LWCF. 
“Florida’s economy is dependent on this important conservation program, which greatly benefits the state’s $60 billion outdoor recreation industry, supporting nearly half a million jobs and producing roughly $3.5 billion in state and local tax revenue,” the congressman’s office noted.

12/19/18 13:27,2018 Farm Bill ,"￼ 
December 19, 2018

Dear Friend, 

Farm families make up less than three percent of the United States population, but they feed and clothe our nation.  Over the past four years, net farm income has dropped by 50 percent.  Natural disasters and low commodity prices have hurt rural America, especially in Mississippi, where agriculture is the largest source of income.  Led by the House and Senate Agriculture Committees, Congress was able to get the 2018 Farm Bill to President Trump's desk that will help ensure our farmers are protected for the next five years.
    
￼

The 2018 Farm bill is important legislation for Mississippi's farm families who work hard every day to put food on our tables.  Below are a few key elements of the 2018 Farm Bill.

	•	The 2018 Farm Bill will strengthen commodity programs, improve and streamline conservation efforts, and enhances and permanently funds the Foreign Market Development Program. 
	•	The bill addresses the critical need for broadband access - especially in rural areas.  Investments in infrastructure will be made to improve broadband access which will enhance the quality of life on multiple fronts.
	•	This legislation will also improve oversight of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by reducing waste, fraud, and abuse.

To read a summary of the 2018 Farm Bill, please click on the link.

FARMING IN THE FIRST DISTRICT

Every year, our First District farmers work the fields to grow products which takes a great deal of time and money to deliver.  In good times and bad, they persevere and we are grateful for their commitment.  In this newsletter, you will be introduced to some of these hardworking farmers who are among the generations of families living off the land.

Matt and Heather Brignac

￼

Matt and Heather Brignac grow corn, cotton, and soybeans on their farm in Lowndes County.  Nineteen years ago, Matt moved to Columbus to open a crop dusting business which he operates to this day.  When he is not in the air, he tends to their crops.  Despite a few delays caused by the weather, the growing season has been a good one.  Like many other farmers, he has concerns about tariffs.  ""I am concerned with anything that cuts into profit,"" Matt said.  ""I think what is going on with trade is not ideal for right now, but I think it will help later on and that is what we need.  You have to crawl before you walk.  We will benefit in the future.""

Bobby Moody, Buddy and Robin Fulton

￼

Bobby Moody is a 4th and 5th generation farmer from Winston County.  He and his wife, Ann, manage the family farm along with their daughter, Robin, and her husband, Buddy.  They produce soybeans, corn, wheat, cattle, and chickens.  Farming is a tradition in this family and they would not have it any other way.  ""Everything about it reminds you of the people who have passed,"" Robin said.  ""From cows to crops, I just love watching things grow.  It also helps you see the majesty and power of God because you witness it on a daily basis.""

Hugh and Penny Barrier

￼

Hugh and Penny operate a cattle ranch in Noxapater.  Both grew up on farms and plan to keep it that way.  ""I grew up on a dairy farm,"" Penny said.  ""It is all that I have ever known.  Farming is what we have always loved.""  In addition to raising cattle, Hugh operates a stockyard in Philadelphia.  Penny said that the most important role they play is making sure their cattle are healthy.  The 2018 Farm Bill may prove helpful to them.  The bill includes a provision which protects the health of the nation's livestock by establishing an animal disease and preparedness response program.

FIRST DISTRICT MANUFACTURING NEWS

DMC Power

￼

How does an additional 125 jobs coming to DeSoto County sound?  That is what you can expect to see over the next five years at DMC Power in Olive Branch.  The manufacturer of connection systems for transmission, distribution, substation, and industrial projects recently announced plans to convert the 168,000-square-foot Nissan distribution facility to a manufacturing center.  DMC Power is a valuable addition to our industrial development partners and an important contributor to Mississippi's economy.

￼
                                            
Bill Strickland, a Memphis native, was barely 18 years old when he left home for the first time to serve in the 104th Infantry Division K Company 414 Regiment known as ""The Timber Wolves"".  Mr. Strickland said they specialized in night fighting.  ""I was sent to Germany in November 1944, shortly before the Battle of the Bulge,"" Mr. Strickland said.  ""During many hard-fought battles, I saw acts of courage that I will not forget.""  

￼

Following World War II, Mr. Strickland pursued a career in the furniture industry.  In 1992, he married the love of his life, Kitye.  Mr. Strickland divides his time between the Mississippi State Veterans Home and the family home in Oxford.  In August, he celebrated his 93rd birthday.  We appreciate Mr. Strickland's distinguished military service and wish him many more years of good health.

Dear Lindsey,
Remembering Local Heroes
Last week, we recognized two local heroes who gave the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedoms. The life and sacrifice of US Marine Corporal Daniel Baker was remembered on the US House Floor and the US Senate passed legislation to rename a Bloomington-Normal post office in honor of US Army Sergeant Joshua Rodgers. For more on these two heroes, please continue reading.  
Marine Corporal and Tremont native Daniel Baker
I was deeply saddened to learn that the U.S. military announced last week that the recovery operations to find the five missing Marines off the coast of Japan had concluded and that those missing have been pronounced deceased. My prayers continue to be with Daniel Baker and his entire family in this most difficult time. Having spoken to Daniel’s family last week, I was able to share my condolences with them directly and learn even more about the incredible young man and leader that they have raised.  
￼ 
Corporal Baker was aboard a KC-130 Hercules refueling aircraft that collided with a F/A-18 Hornet during a training mission over the sea just south of Japan. Following a search and rescue mission the five Marines missing were pronounced deceased. We are grateful for the sacrifice Daniel and the other four Marines gave on behalf of our freedom and we are forever indebted to his service to our nation. May they rest in peace.  
Stars and Stripes: Family, friends remember Marines killed in KC-130J crash off Japan coast 
￼
￼
On Thursday, I went to the U.S. House of Representatives floor to hold a moment of silence in honor of Corporal Baker.  
Corporal Baker was taken from this world way to early. He embodies every quality we seek to impart upon young men and women in this country and he will be deeply missed by his friends, family, and the Tremont community.  
May we continue to keep Daniel and his family in our thoughts and prayers. We will never forget his selfless sacrifice to our country.  
USMC: In Memoriam 
  
Legislation to Honor US Army Ranger Heads to President's Desk
￼ 
Last week, legislation that I introduced to honor fallen Army Ranger Joshua Rodgers passed the U.S. Senate and will now head to the President's desk. The bill, H.R. 4326, is supported by Senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth and the entire Illinois House delegation and would rename the U.S. Post office at 200 West North Street in Normal, Illinois.
What others are saying: 
“Sergeant Josh Rodgers could not be more deserving of this recognition. At the young age of 22, he became a decorated war hero and continued to put his life on the line to protect our country. For this, we are forever thankful. I am proud to join Representatives LaHood, Davis, and Senator Duckworth to honor the heroism and service of this hometown hero.” -Senator Durbin
“Sergeant Joshua Rodgers is an American hero who gave his life for our country. Dedicating this Post Office in his honor will preserve his memory and serve as a continuous reminder of his sacrifice and love of this nation.” -Senator Tammy Duckworth.   “Sergeant Joshua Rodgers is a hometown hero and renaming this post office will make sure that his name and the sacrifice he made for us is remembered for generations to come. It’s because of men and women like Sergeant Rodgers who risk their lives in service to our country that we remain free. It is a privilege to be able to honor his life and service with this post office and I look forward to seeing the “Sgt. Josh Rodgers Post Office” in Normal soon.” -Congressman Rodney Davis
The Pantagraph: Bill to name Normal post office for Rodgers headed to president
This Christmas Season
As we celebrate the Christmas season in the comfort of our homes we must never forget that we live in the greatest country in the world and it is only because of the sacrifice of brave men like Army Ranger Josh Rodgers and Marine Corporal Daniel Baker that we enjoy the life we have in America. 
We are indebted to their service. 
Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with their families.

District
 
Two years ago, I pledged to stand up for our shared Connecticut values and principles. That meant fighting for healthcare, the environment, women’s rights and trying to raise the level of national discourse. Fighting to protect these priorities has been a struggle for the past two years, but I have never stopped advocating for my constituents in Congress.
One of the small glimmers of hope I saw was the President’s plan to spearhead a $1 trillion infrastructure package.  
As you know, Southwest Connecticut needs serious investment and improvement in our roads, bridges and rail if we are going to maintain our high quality of life and continue to encourage economic development.
As I have traveled our communities talking with people, traffic and congestion are on the top of everyone’s list of concerns.  Families worry about getting to work, getting their kids where they need to go, and spending way too much time each day in traffic.  Businesses have told me that our congested roads are the number one impediment to growing efficiently, attracting skilled workers and moving goods around the country.
Sadly, I don’t believe that Congress or the administration has tried their hardest to push through a substantial investment plan. 
But you don’t want complaints. You want action. 
Just two weeks ago, I was extremely pleased to help secure funding from the Connecticut Department of Transportation in partnership with the federal government, which awarded Stamford $9.1 million to repair and update the Stamford Transportation Center. This will help improve station lighting and restroom facilities, repair escalators and elevators and give conductors better communication tools. Most importantly, we’ll keep commuters moving during the busiest times of day. 
I’m ready to work with the President and the Senate to make transportation investment a reality.  Renewing and rebuilding our country is not a partisan issue and you deserve Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate to work together to get it done for you. That’s why one of my first priorities will be speaking to leadership in both parties and the President to bring us all to the negotiating table.
A robust, 21st Century plan will involve a very substantial federal contribution, strong community and federal leadership, and a vision to guide us for the next 5, 10, even 25 years. We won’t all get exactly what we want, but I truly believe that the best way to lasting change is through compromise and broad consensus.
It’s time for Congress to get off of the sidelines and into the game. Ensuring a better future for Southwest Connecticut requires Congress acting now to secure resources and make the necessary investments. 
Sincerely, Jim

Beatty Blasts Ruling on Republican Lawsuit Against Insuring Pre-Existing Conditions and the Affordable Care Act
Over the weekend, a federal judge in the Northern District of Texas struck down the entire Affordable Care Act (ACA), ruling that the ACA’s individual mandate is unconstitutional, and the entire law cannot stand without it.
The decision, handed down by George W. Bush-appointee Judge Reed O’Connor, was a result of a lawsuit filed this year by a group of Republican governors and state attorneys general—with the support of President Trump and his administration. Reacting to the decision, Trump said it was a “great ruling for our country,” despite the fact that the healthcare of 20 million newly-insured Americans and 129 million individuals with pre-existing conditions is at risk as a result.
“For more than seven years, Congressional Republicans fought tooth and nail to dismantle and destroy the ACA. Now, they finally got their wish, at the expense of millions of Americans, hardworking families, individuals with pre-existing conditions, and young adults under the age of 26,” Beatty said. “However, all hope is not lost.” Beatty continued, “This short-sighted and misguided decision will be appealed, and House Democrats will move swiftly to uphold life-saving protections for those with pre-existing conditions, as well as strengthen the ACA, even more when we assume the majority in the House for the 116th Congress.”
Democratic defendants have indicated that they will appeal the ruling in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans. Ultimately, the lawsuit may end up before the Supreme Court for a final decision.

From the Hill to the Mountains
Sharing Your Blessings This Christmas Season 
As this holiday season arrives, Gayle and I are reminded once again of the importance of family - the source of life’s greatest joys and its deepest bonds. Our families are the foundation of our country as well as the inspirational force in each of our lives.  We are so blessed with the riches of loving families and friends, a beautiful state to call home, and the knowledge that we are truly a statewide community with an unbreakable bond. Not only is this approach good for the soul but it makes West Virginia the best place to work, live, and raise a family. 
It is also a time to remember the brave men and women who have served and continue to serve our country. Their sacrifices allow us to enjoy these blessings this holiday season. Let us keep them and their families in our hearts and prayers, not just during the holidays, but every single day. In fact, when visitors come to West Virginia, I jump at the chance to tell them we have mined the coal and forged the steel that built the guns, ships, and factories that have protected and continue to protect our country to this day. We have always done the heavy lifting and never complained. I am so deeply proud of what West Virginians have accomplished and what they will continue to accomplish to protect the freedoms we hold dear. 
Throughout the year, we are tested as a national community. This holiday season let us pray for peace, safety, and a greater understanding of one another.  I’ve always said ‘if you can count your blessings, you can share your blessings.’ We are all so blessed to enjoy their opportunities of this great nation. That is why, during this holiday season, I encourage every West Virginian to share their blessings and generosity with those who may need a helping hand. May you spend this year’s waning days visiting loved ones, renewing old ties, forging new relationships, and sharing a hope among us all for a happy, healthy, and prosperous New Year.
Scheduling
Senator Manchin and his office representatives participate in events and meetings across the Mountain State throughout the year.  From Skypes with classrooms, to small business ribbon cuttings, job fairs, and Manchin Mobile Mondays -local meetings about the issues that matter in your community- the Senator and his office are honored to receive your invitation.

How May We Help You?
I truly appreciate the opportunity to hear from my fellow West Virginians. As your U.S. Senator, I am proud to be your voice with government agencies during your time of need. My goal is to provide top-notch customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me, or who may need help.  I have a team of caseworkers in each of my four offices to help you with matters of concern. While I have no direct jurisdiction in the administrative matters of any federal, state, or local agency, I welcome the opportunity to assist you with whatever problem you may be experiencing and ask that full consideration be given to your case. 
Recently, Kim Berry, a caseworker in my Fairmont office was able to assist Mr. Lawrence Childers, Navy Veteran, with assistance in getting a much-needed heart transplant evaluation.  The Senator’s Office worked with Mr. Childers’ medical team at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center to share medical information with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.  After reviewing the information, the VA approved for Mr. Childers’s to proceed with the evaluation process for him to obtain the transplant.

Remembering George H.W. Bush  
Cindy and I had the honor of attending the state funeral to celebrate the life and legacy of former President George H.W. Bush at the Washington National Cathedral earlier this month.   
President Bush was an example of servant leadership that we can all learn from. He was a veteran, a diplomat, an Intelligence Chief, a Vice President and a President. In all of these roles, he served with honor and virtue. 
The service for our former president was very touching. I particularly enjoyed George W. Bush's recollection of his father and his wonderful life. I am so grateful for George H.W. Bush's commitment to our American values. He will certainly be missed. 
 

Celebrating the Christmas Spirit at 'Shop With a Cop'  
￼ 
It’s always great to see the wonderful things happening in our community. Christmas is a time of giving -- and this month, I was glad to have been invited to join an event celebrating the the spirit of generosity in Pennsylvania's 16th District.  
Year after year, our local police officers have found a way to give back to needy children in our community through the ""Shop with a Cop"" event. Our police officers shop with these kids as their ""personal assistants"" to help them buy presents for their families, friends and sometimes even themselves.   
Thank you to Trinity Lutheran Church for organizing this event and thank you to the Lancaster County police officers for reminding us the reason for the season.  
And a thank you to all our law enforcement officers for working so hard to keep us safe.   
 

Prioritizing Pennsylvania Farmers  
Our district is the largest agricultural district in the state -- and that means one of my biggest duties in Congress is to fight for our farmers. On Wednesday, the House passed the 2018 Farm Bill, which will help support our farmers who feed America. 
Agriculture is our state's No. 1 industry and it's especially vital for our district. The agriculture industry supports more than 93,000 jobs in our district and contributes more than $16 billion to Pennsylvania's economy.  
Our farmers have fallen on hard times though -- and their incomes are currently at a 12-year low. This year's Farm Bill will help these struggling farmers get through tough times.  
Our district came away with some wins in the Farm Bill. We were able to reduce premiums on our dairy farmers' milk and my request of $75 million to combat the spotted lanternfly -- an invasive species threatening our local crops -- was also included in the final bill. 
Unfortunately, the bill which came back from the Senate eliminated key reforms to our SNAP programs. I hope we will reconsider these ideas. Those are reforms to improve people’s lives and help connect them to good-paying jobs – and those are reforms which will still be needed in the future.

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Farmers and cheese makers, farm groups and agricultural stakeholders are sharing their strong support for Senator Baldwin’s bipartisan reforms that were included in the 2018 Farm Bill that passed Congress last week with overwhelming bipartisan support. 
To ensure the bipartisan 2018 Farm Bill does right by our farmers and works for Wisconsin, Senator Baldwin authored several key reforms that were included in the final legislation: 
Improving Tools for Wisconsin’s Family Dairy Farmers and Cheese Makers 
Senator Baldwin fought to substantially update the dairy tools so that they address the challenges Wisconsin farmers are facing. The Senator worked with her colleagues and secured bipartisan agreement to sunset the Margin Protection Program and replace it with an updated safety net program, Dairy Margin Coverage. This new program will provide higher coverage levels to better reflect the costs farmers face to produce milk, and provide more affordable rates. Farmers who used the Margin Protection Program when it was failing to adequately respond to the downturn in dairy prices will be eligible for a refund or credit for the premiums they paid. Additionally, dairy farmers will be able to utilize multiple risk management tools at the same time, making it possible for them to better adjust to changing market conditions. 
Senator Baldwin’s Dairy Business Innovation Act was also included in the 2018 Farm Bill. This initiative will support dairy product innovation and address oversupply by providing resources to help cheese makers and other dairy businesses get their start, develop new products and expand markets. 
“On behalf of the dairy farmer owners of AMPI I’d like to thank Senator Baldwin for her leadership and for working together with other leaders to come up with a much improved safety net for family dairy farmers in Wisconsin and across rural America. I believe the new policy will provide certainty in very uncertain times and hope for the future of our industry and the rural communities we live in and support,” said Steve Schlangen, Dairy Farmer and Chairman of the Associated Milk Producers, Inc. (AMPI) Board of Directors. 
“Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association is pleased to see the exciting concepts in Senator Baldwin’s Dairy Business Innovation Act in the new 2018 Farm Bill. Dairy farmers and processors believe a consumer focus – innovating delicious products for families – is the sustainable solution to revitalize the dairy industry. Innovation Centers can concentrate dairy expertise and help new ideas flourish in the marketplace,” said John Umhoefer, Executive Director of the Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association. 
 “Senator Baldwin’s efforts were crucial to improving the risk management tools for dairy farmers to reflect the reality of today’s dairy economy. Edge was fortunate to be able to work collaboratively with the Senator on the new Dairy Margin Coverage program and on allowing farmers to use various tools simultaneously. Our dairy farmers need to able to manage risk according to their management style and individual farm’s needs,” said Brody Stapel, President of Green Bay-based Edge Dairy Farmer Cooperative and Dairy Farmer in Cedar Grove, Wisconsin. 
“My family and I know the challenges firsthand of taking on the processing and marketing of our own dairy products. Senator Baldwin’s Dairy Business Innovation Act provides an opportunity for farmers and processors to grow and diversify their businesses to meet customers’ changing tastes,” said Tom Crave, Vice President of the Dairy Business Association in Wisconsin and a dairy farmer and cheese processor in Waterloo, Wisconsin.  
“We are grateful for Senator Baldwin’s bipartisan efforts to protect Wisconsin’s dairy industry in the 2018 Farm Bill. She understands the issues that are critically important to dairy producers across the USA and her support of the Farm Bill shows that she is willing to fight for us. We greatly appreciate the Senator’s advocacy for the entire industry,” said Louie Gentine, CEO of Sargento Foods, Inc. 
“The Dairy Business Innovation Act will help start-ups and existing companies accelerate and enhance their technology, product development, finance, and marketing. I’m delighted that Senator Baldwin is delivering this much-needed boost to the American dairy industry,” said Bob Wills, Wisconsin Master Cheesemaker and President of Cedar Grove Cheese and Clock Shadow Creamery. 
Supporting More Resources for Farmers in Crisis 
Washington has been slow to recognize the challenges that farmers are facing and the daily stressors that they experience during difficult years. Senator Baldwin’s bipartisan FARMERS FIRST Act was included in the 2018 Farm Bill and will provide funding for local mental health resources and expand access to stress reduction strategies and suicide prevention programs for people who work in agriculture. When times are tough, it is critical that farmers and their families know they are not alone, and that people who understand the challenges they are facing can help them work through difficulties.
The Wisconsin Farmers Union, National Rural Health Association, National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, National Young Farmers Coalition and numerous other stakeholder groups all supported Senator Baldwin’s bipartisan reform to provide mental health resources for farmers. 
“The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) appreciates Senator Baldwin’s leadership in ensuring farmer stress and mental health was a priority in the Farm Bill. First and foremost, nothing is more important to American agriculture than the safety and wellness of our farmers. This provision will go a long way to put farmers and ranchers in touch with those who can help them through serious and personal struggles. State departments of agriculture are the closest connection to producers tackling these issues, so NASDA is pleased to see that all state departments of agriculture qualify as recipients and agents to implement this service,” said Dr. Barbara Glenn, Chief Executive Officer of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture. 
""Stress is part of the job, whether you're a farmer, rancher, farmworker, young or old. We all share a responsibility to ensure mental health assistance remains part of the national safety net for farm families. As growers weather this difficult farm economy, we're grateful that Congress has stepped up to include these critical resources in the 2018 Farm Bill. When these challenges are left unspoken, swept under the rug or stigmatized, our entire community is impacted. Inclusion of the FARMERS FIRST Act in the Farm Bill is an important first step,"" said Andrew Bahrenburg, National Policy Director of the National Young Farmers Coalition. 
“Given the challenging times in agriculture, especially for dairy producers, the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill is great news and positions us to compete in the future. I commend Senator Baldwin for her leadership in listening to the needs of her constituents, including producers like me who need better solutions to manage operational risks. In addition, she supported measures to address those struggling with mental health concerns due to financial stress and uncertainty in rural areas. Senator Baldwin championed policy that addressed these concerns, in addition to several others included in this bill, and we are fortunate to have a leader like her in Congress,” said Nic Schoenberger, Land O’Lakes Dairy Producer and Board Director, from Kiel, Wisconsin. 
Standing Up For Organic Farmers and Consumers by Cracking Down On Fraudulent Organic Imports 
Wisconsin is home to over 1,200 organic farms - the second highest number in the country - and our organic farmers work extremely hard to make sure their products meet strict U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) organic standards. Senator Baldwin worked to include her Organic Farmer and Consumer Protection Act to crack down on fraudulent foreign imports that claim to be organic but do not meet the USDA standard, and also ensure that American consumers are getting the high quality, organic food they expect. 
“The National Organic Coalition is grateful to Senator Baldwin for her incredible leadership in the Farm Bill process to strengthen oversight of organic imports by introducing and successfully championing the Organic Farmer and Consumer Protection Act. There has been an urgent need to modernize and strengthen USDA’s infrastructure to prevent fraud,” said Abby Youngblood, Executive Director of the National Organic Coalition. “This farm bill is a huge win on that front, by providing USDA with enhanced authorities and resources to crack down on fraud. These provisions are a boon to farmers, especially those who are harmed by fraudulent imports, as well as consumers, whose trust in the organic seal depends on effective enforcement of clear and consistent standards across the board. NOC will play an active role in working with USDA to fully operationalize these changes to ensure integrity of organic products originating from both international and domestic farms and companies.”
“The Farm Bill contains the largest commitment of resources ever to ensure organic integrity remains strong. It includes better policy and funding for organic fraud prevention, especially in the international trade arena, which was really needed. Modernizing the organic regulations and increasing funding help the National Organic Program be in a position to better weed out fraud,” said Melissa Hughes, Chief Mission Officer and General Counsel of Organic Valley. “A big thanks to our home-state U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin as well as Ranking Member Debbie Stabenow for leading efforts to strengthen organic oversight. They played a key role in making sure the Farm Bill updated the agency's ability to crack down on any suspected fraud no matter where it might originate. The work ahead of the organic industry is to now get these changes operational at the National Organic Program as soon as possible, and at Organic Valley, we are going to keep our foot on the gas pedal until these new provisions are fully realized and implemented.”
“MOSES is excited to tell our farmers and supporters about Farm Bill wins for organic – more funding for organic research and data collection, provisions to address import fraud, and funding for organic certification cost-share,” said John Mesko, Executive Director of the Midwest Organic and Sustainable Education Service (MOSES). “We especially want to extend appreciation to our home-state Senator Tammy Baldwin for her leadership role in strengthening oversight of organic imports. The Senator has met with farmers on this issue and heard loud and clear about the need for a level playing field. We’re thrilled that she and other Congressional champions have succeeded in making sure that the USDA is armed with the resources and authorities to keep organic strong alongside tremendous growth in the organic marketplace.”
""Farmers Union appreciates Sen. Baldwin's efforts to crack down on fraudulent organic imports and her role in bringing forth provisions of the Dairy Business Innovation Act and making sure they were incorporated in the farm bill,” said Darin Von Ruden, President, Wisconsin Farmers Union. ""We also are pleased to see continued support for conservation programs like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP). We are also encouraged by the reauthorization of the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network, a program that is direly needed given the current economic and mental health crises plaguing rural America, and we urge funding of that to be a priority in the next appropriations cycle.”
Investing in Economic Development for Wisconsin’s Rural Communities 
The 2018 Farm Bill includes investments in rural economic development to expand high-speed internet to more rural areas, combat the opioid crisis, support rural emergency medicine, improve rural drinking water and boost rural small businesses. 
Safe drinking water is a priority for every community and is essential to the health and economic vitality of Wisconsin’s rural communities. Senator Baldwin secured language from her Rural Water Infrastructure Improvements Act to support more rural areas and make sure they have access to safe and affordable drinking water and sanitation. The Farm Bill reauthorizes USDA’s water and wastewater loan and grant program and increases the maximum amount of financing available for these infrastructure projects from $100,000 to $200,000. 
Wisconsin’s agricultural leaders commended Senator Baldwin’s efforts and agree her reforms do right by our farmers and agricultural economy: 
“Senator Baldwin has been an outspoken supporter for rural communities and Wisconsin’s struggling dairy industry,” said Wisconsin Farm Bureau President Jim Holte. “Wisconsin Farm Bureau appreciates her vote for the 2018 Farm Bill so Wisconsin farmers will have programs in place to help them during these tough times.” 
“I would like to thank Senator Baldwin for her leadership and support throughout the entire Farm Bill process. Family farms in Wisconsin are facing economic hardships not seen since the 1980’s coupled with unprecedented trade uncertainties. This Farm Bill will help provide stability through these turbulent times to the family farms that are the backbone of this great nation. Senator Baldwin has once again proven that she is an ally for Wisconsin farmers in Washington D.C. and I look forward to working with her and her staff into the future for the betterment of Wisconsin’s family farms,” said Tony Mellenthin, President, Wisconsin Soybean Association. 
“Wisconsin Corn appreciates Senator Baldwin’s support in passing the Farm Bill. It’s no secret that it is a hard time for producers with low prices, trade issues and barriers to ethanol. The passage of the Farm Bill shows our elected officials are listening and we hope this is the first step to a stronger future for Wisconsin corn growers,” said Doug Rebout, President of the Wisconsin Corn Growers Association. 
“The Wisconsin State Cranberry Growers Association appreciates the hard work by and support of Senator Baldwin on the issues of importance to our growers in the Farm Bill. The Senator has been a strong supporter of agricultural research programs important to our growers and export promotion programs that help us as we develop new markets for Wisconsin’s largest fruit crop. Like all of agriculture we face challenges and the Senator has been a partner in taking action on behalf of our family farmers as we work toward continues to develop and implement sustainable practices,” said Tom Lochner, Executive Director of the Wisconsin State Cranberry Growers Association.

Hice in the House
Dear Friends,

I’m glad to be back in Georgia for a few days after a busy week on Capitol Hill. Last Monday, I started the day with a site visit to the Naval Reactors, a joint program between the Department of Energy and the Department of the Navy. I was happy to hear from the Director of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program Admiral Frank Caldwell, USN, about the operation and the importance it holds protecting our Nation. Thanks for having me! 
￼

Later that same afternoon, I spoke on the House Floor in support of my bill, H.R. 6108, the Preserving America’s Battlefields Act of 2018, a measure that reauthorizes the Battlefield Land Acquisition Grants Program. This important National Park Service grant program has a strong record of supporting the preservation of battlefields from the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the Civil War. I’m immensely proud to report that it passed the House on Monday evening by unanimous, bipartisan consent. I’m thankful for House Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah), my fellow colleagues on the Committee, the hardworking Natural Resources committee staff, and the American Battlefield Trust for helping us get this great bill across the finish line. As Chairman Bishop keenly noted, “this bill is about preserving our history, helping us to know and understand and retain the story of who we are as a Nation and also how we arrived there as a Nation. All of that is significant.”
￼
Rep. Hice delivers remarks on H.R. 6108, the Preserving America’s Battlefield Act
On Wednesday afternoon, between committee hearings and meetings, I spoke with WGXA-TV of Macon to discuss the major issues in Washington, including our latest efforts to help those recovering from Hurricane Michael, growing the economy and bringing new businesses to our communities, the details of the Conference Report for the 2018 Farm Bill, and more. I encourage you to watch the segment here. 
￼

￼
On Thursday, I wrote an op-ed for the Washington Examiner highlighting the need to deliver on the border wall. Immigration is a tough issue, but we received a clear directive in 2016 when the people elected President Trump and endorsed his immigration platform out of a wide field of qualified candidates. Hardworking people are tired of our laws being flouted and ignored while our prized tax dollars go to pay for people who don’t follow the rules and skip the line to come to our country. Americans are compassionate, but no one likes it when their compassion is taken for granted or abused. 

Republicans only hold a unified government for two more weeks. Through the upcoming government funding bill, Congress must fund the border wall and end catch-and-release policies that have fueled illegal immigration practices and encouraged hundreds of thousands to try and circumvent our laws every year. Moreover, this must be accomplished before Congress leaves for Christmas. Read more of my thoughts here. 

On Thursday afternoon, I joined Sean Hannity and Congressman Louie Gohmert (R-TX) on Fox News Radio to discuss the border wall, a recent Inspector General report detailing how the Department of Justice was able to recover previously lost text messages between FBI agents who have been entrenched in political bias – Peter Strzok and Lisa Page – among other things. Click here to listen to the segment. 
￼

On Friday morning, I made my way over to the Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia for a tour. While there, I enjoyed talking with Marines, learning about the hardware and software involving the Anduril Lattice Technology, and receiving briefings on the latest from the base. As a proud American and member of the House Armed Services Committee, I am extremely grateful for our men and women in uniform who lay their lives on the line to protect our freedoms. To all members of our Armed Forces past and present, thank you for your service.

Committee Action
Committee work plays an important role in legislative business, and on Tuesday, the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities held a hearing to discuss the Department of Defense’s (DOD) artificial intelligence structure, as well as how the United States is standing up to aggressive actors like China in this realm. Remaining vigilant in the face of constant foreign threats to our technology and intelligence communities is vital to maintaining both governmental and industrial security nationwide. Click here to watch me speak with Dana Deasy, Chief Information Officer at the DOD, and Dr. Lisa Porter, Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering at the DOD. 
￼

Then on Thursday, I participated in two hearings with the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The first was a joint hearing under the Subcommittee on Government Operations, which I serve on as Vice-Chairman, and the Subcommittee on Healthcare, Benefits, and Administrative Rules to examine the use of government-funded fetal tissue research. The horrific and unfortunate reality is that the bodies of unborn babies are used for experimentation at taxpayer expense – and there are even some monetary profits made by middle-man companies during the transportation of these baby parts. Although some efforts to end these repulsive practices are making headway thanks to the Trump Administration, this must be ended once and for all. Click here to watch me question Dr. Tara Sander Lee of the Charlotte Lozier Institute and Dr. David Prentice of the Midwest Stem Cell Therapy Center on the effective alternative research opportunities already available. 
￼

Later that same day, in an OGR Subcommittee on Government Operations hearing, my colleagues and I explored some of the actions of the Clinton Foundation during the 2016 election and whether this “nonprofit” organization was used as a vehicle for pay-to-play transactions. The Inspector General’s report, which was released back in February, raised significant questions on the scope of influence held by the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation and how that influence was used government-wide to protect and profit this organization. It grows clearer with every new piece of information that the Clintons – and their affiliates – were treated differently because of their status. Click here to watch me speak with Tom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch, regarding his findings.

A Message to Our Heroes Overseas
This Christmas season, many members of our military will spend the holidays away from their families and loved ones. Last week, in partnership with the American Red Cross, I wrote cards to our troops stationed overseas to express my continued appreciation for their sacrifices and service. Let’s remember to keep them and their families in our prayers throughout the year. On Thursday, I also wished our National Guard a happy 382 years of “Always Ready, Always There” to those who answer the call from their state and our Nation. Our National Guardsmen are absolutely critical to the success of the U.S. Army on the battlefield.

Hice: Time is up, let's build the wall Covington News – 12/13 Serving in “the people’s house,” my fellow representatives and I have a particularly direct charge: As the closest federal branch to the public, we in particular should reflect the will of the public in our actions. While some important progress has been made in the past two years under the leadership of President Trump and a unified Republican government, like the historic overhaul of our tax system with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we have also dragged our feet, and there’s still a lot to deliver on other key campaign promises.

Greg's Treasure State Update
Recognizing Montana’s outstanding veterans 

Montana veterans are generous and dedicated to a cause larger than themselves. I’m honored to recognize some of our extraordinary veterans with the 2018 Montana Congressional Veteran Commendation. 

I created the annual award in 2017 to recognize outstanding Montana veterans who have honorably served our nation and our communities. The recipients represent the very spirit of Montana – neighbor helping neighbor. On behalf of all Montanans, I thank them for their selfless service to our country and their invaluable contributions to our communities.

Montana nominees to America’s military academies 

One of my greatest honors is to nominate the best and brightest Montana students to compete for an appointment to one of our nation’s military academies. 

Each nominee completed an extensive application process that examined their academic, civic, and physical abilities as well as their commitment to military service. 

I commend these remarkable young people for their dedication to serving our country, and I wish them the best success as they continue in this extremely competitive process.

Little Shell recognition bill passes House 

The Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians Restoration Act, which I introduced in September 2017, recently passed the U.S. House of Representatives. In fact, it was the first time a bill to restore federal recognition to the Little Shell Tribe passed either the House or the Senate. 

The Little Shell Tribe first petitioned the federal government for recognition in the 1930s and 1940s. The Tribe has waited too long for the federal government to recognize it. 

I appreciate the hard work, dedication, and determination of Chairman Gray and the Little Shell people. I’m proud I could help move their efforts forward.

Helena students win Montana Congressional App Challenge 

Helena Capital High students Kyler Nelson and Andrew Stroop are the budding programmers who won the 2018 Congressional App Challenge for Montana. 

The two developed an impressive app that gets two challenging, complex codes to interface, making it easier to run robotic machine tools like a milling machine from their app. Learn more about Kyler and Andrew’s app HERE. 

The Congressional App Challenge is an annual contest to engage student creativity and encourage their participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education fields. Winning apps from each congressional district will be on display in the U.S. Capitol. 

I’m impressed with the creativity and talent of Montana’s young programmers. I thank all the students who entered the competition as well as their teachers and mentors for their guidance.

Spirit of Montana 

I had the honor of recognizing Gib Swan of Great Falls who, for over a decade, knits winter hats and donates them to cancer patients, children, the less fortunate, and many others. 

Gib is known throughout the community as the “Mad Hatter.” He knits hats of all sizes and colors and never accepts payment for his work. Nearly everyone at his senior living community has one of Gib’s hand-knitted stocking caps. 

Anyone may nominate Montanans for the Spirit of Montana award by contacting my office at 202-225-3211 or by email at https://gianforte.house.gov/contact/email.

Congressman Cook's Big Bear Land Exchange Bill Passes House
Congressman Paul Cook announced that his bill HR 5513, the Big Bear Land Exchange Act, passed unanimously in the House of Representatives last week. 

HR 5513 authorizes an exchange of 73 acres of federal land in the San Bernardino National Forest for 71 acres owned by the San Bernardino County located within the forest. The County plans to use the 73 acres to build a timber processing facility in a safe and remote site further away from Big Bear City and closer to where the trees are actually processed. Currently, trees are driven down the mountain through a winding and dangerous pass to a processing facility far away, resulting in increased congestion and multiple traffic accidents. 

The land exchange would also require the relocation of a small portion of the Pacific Crest Trail. Congressman Cook has worked closely with the Pacific Crest Trail Association to ensure that the relocation will occur before the land exchange and will include an environmental review.

Congressman Cook said, “I’m thrilled that the House passed the Big Bear Land Exchange this afternoon. I’ve worked closely with our local governments to ensure this land exchange is done correctly and that all the stakeholders have their concerns resolved. This will alleviate traffic and make mountain roads in the area safer. I look forward to this bill becoming law.” 

IRS issues guidance for determining nondeductible amount of parking fringe expenses and unrelated business taxable income; provides penalty relief to tax-exempt organizations 
WASHINGTON – The Internal Revenue Service issued interim guidance regarding the treatment of qualified transportation fringe benefit expenses paid or incurred after Dec. 31, 2017. The new rules assist taxpayers in determining the amount of parking expenses that are no longer tax deductible. They also help tax-exempt organizations determine how these nondeductible parking expenses create or increase unrelated business taxable income (UBTI). 

The IRS acknowledges that this guidance falls late in the year and taxpayers that own or lease parking facilities may have already adopted reasonable methods in 2018 to determine the amount of their nondeductible parking expenses. Taxpayers may rely on the guidance or, until further guidance is issued, use any reasonable method for determining nondeductible parking expenses related to employer-provided parking.

A key part of this guidance is a special rule, enabling many employers to retroactively reduce the amount of their nondeductible parking expenses. Under this rule, employers will have until March 31, 2019, to change their parking arrangements to reduce or eliminate the number of parking spots they reserve for their employees. By making this change, many churches, schools, hospitals and other tax-exempt organizations may be able to reduce their associated UBTI. In some cases, the organization may avoid having to file a Form 990-T, Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return, altogether. Such a change made in parking arrangements will apply retroactively to Jan. 1, 2018.

The Treasury Department and IRS seek comments for future guidance to clarify the treatment of these qualified transportation fringe expenses.

The IRS also announced today that it will provide estimated tax penalty relief in 2018 to tax-exempt organizations that offer these benefits and were not required to file a Form 990-T last filing season. Additionally, some tax-exempt organizations will not exceed the $1,000 threshold below which an organizations will not exceed the $1,000 threshold below which an organization is not required to file a Form 990-T or pay the unrelated business income tax.

Covered California Extends Deadline for January 1 Coverage Until December 21
￼
In response to a surge of interest in enrollment and to ensure consumers have ample time to enroll amid news of the Texas District Court ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, Covered California will extend to December 21 the deadline for coverage beginning on January 1. Covered California also announced that the court ruling has no impact on the open enrollment period, and reiterated that no one in California should let the ruling discourage them from enrolling in health coverage or be worried about using the health plan they have.

As a result of the deadline extension, consumers will now have until December 21 to select a plan for coverage starting January 1, 2019. As a reminder, California’s open enrollment period runs through January 15, 2019. Consumers who enroll by January 15 will have coverage starting February 1. 

Consumers can easily find out if they are eligible for financial help and see which plans are available in their area by entering their ZIP code, household income and the ages of those who need coverage into Covered California’s Shop and Compare Tool. 

Nearly nine out of 10 Covered California consumers receive financial help. The average Covered California enrollee pays about $5 per day for coverage, but many pay far less. One out of every three Covered California consumers who receive financial help can purchase a Silver plan — which provides the best overall value — for $50 or less per month. Nearly three out of five of these consumers can get a Silver plan for $100 or less per month.

Those interested in learning more about their coverage options should go to www.CoveredCA.com, where they can get help to enroll. They can explore their options and find out if they qualify for financial help by using the Shop and Compare Tool. They can also get free and confidential enrollment assistance by visiting www.coveredca.com/find-help/ and searching among 700 storefronts statewide or 16,000 certified enrollers who can assist consumers in understanding their choices and enrolling, including individuals who can assist in other languages. In addition, consumers can reach the Covered California service center by calling (800) 300-1506.

IRS: Combat Injured Veterans May be Due a Refund
From 1991 through 2016, approximately 130,000 combat injured veterans received disability severance payments that were inadvertently treated as taxable. 

In response to the Combat Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act, in July of 2018 DoD issued a letter to eligible veterans advising that they may be due a refund. On July 11, 2018, IRS issued a news release advising that eligible veterans owed refunds attributable to disability severance payments should file amended returns for the year in which they received the payment to claim tax refunds.

Veterans have one year from the date of the DoD letter (until July 2019), or three years from the due date of the return, whichever is later, to claim the refund. Eligible veterans have two options: 

1. Use a simplified method to claim a standard refund amount. This method doesn’t require them to have the original tax return or contact the IRS to obtain information from the tax return. 
2. Or, veterans can submit a refund claim based on the actual amount of their disability severance payment by completing Form 1040X, carefully following the instructions for Form 1040X.

To help ensure that no combat injured veteran gets left behind, IRS sponsored Volunteer Income Tax Assistance sites can help eligible veterans claim their tax refund using the simplified method during the upcoming filing season.

The simplified method is easy and the standard refund amounts are; 

• $1,750 for tax years 1991 – 2005
• $2,400 for tax years 2006 – 2010
• $3,200 for tax years 2011 – 2016

Some, not all, VITA sites will be able to help eligible veterans claim a refund based on the actual amount of their disability severance payment. Claims based on actual amounts paid may be larger or smaller than the standard refund amounts.

12/18/18 15:25,Bonamici Bulletin Year in Review,"￼ 

Dear Friend, 
As we reflect on 2018 and look ahead to the start of a new Congress in 2019, I’m grateful to everyone across NW Oregon who contacted me about issues of concern. This year my office received and replied to 74,623 letters and phone calls.  I also held 13 town hall meetings across NW Oregon; 12 in person and one by telephone to make it accessible to more people. My office assisted more than 1,000 people with questions and challenges involving federal agencies, including the VA, Social Security, and immigration. One of the cases was for the Nguyen family, who were reunited this fall after being separated for more than 40 years because of our broken immigration system. 
￼
Climate change continues to be a pressing concern for Oregonians as we witness more extreme weather events, catastrophic wildfires, and changes to the ocean’s chemistry. I’ve been raising awareness by sharing climate facts on Twitter, and will continue to work with my colleagues to develop and implement lasting legislative solutions. Another urgent challenge our country faced this year was the Administration’s abhorrent policy of separating parents and children at the border. I visited imprisoned detainees in Oregon, spoke out on their behalf, and called on Secretary Azar to reunite families. Tragically, gun violence also continues to plague our country, taking 17 innocent lives at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, killing 11 worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue, and ending the lives of 90 Americans every day. These are serious challenges that I am committed to addressing when a new Congress convenes in January. 
  ￼ 

Affordable Health Care For All
￼
The year began with yet another misguided attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The thousands of people who spoke out in support the law helped us to defeat the repeal effort, and the Affordable Care Act still stands. There is still much we can do to make sure everyone has access to affordable, quality health care. I am proud to be a member of the Medicare for All Caucus, where we will be debating options for increasing access while reducing costs. One step in the right direction was the passage of my bipartisan bill to address the nursing shortage across the country. Another was the opening of the new Virginia Garcia Health Center in Beaverton, which will make our community stronger and healthier. 
At the beginning of this year I completed an in-depth look at the opioid crisis in NW Oregon and issued a report summarizing my recommendations, including my solution to increase disposal options for unused medications.  As I prepare for a new session of Congress, combating the opioid crisis will continue to be a top priority. 
 ￼ 

Standing Up For Students
￼
 This year I stood firm against the harmful proposals of Education Secretary DeVos and the Trump Administration. When DeVos finally appeared before the Education Committee, I asked serious questions about the importance of public education. I spoke out on behalf of transgender students facing attacks on their civil rights, student loan borrowers who DeVos made more vulnerable to deceptive practices of unscrupulous private lenders, and survivors of campus sexual assault who deserve to be heard and believed. 
Talking with young people is one of the best parts of my job, and this year I heard from students at 24 schools across Oregon. McMinnville High School students shared their fears about gun violence, kindergarteners at Minter Bridge Elementary sang to me in English and Spanish, and students at Banks High School demonstrated their robotics creations. I was thrilled to update the federal career and technical education law to strengthen programs that are helping students stay in school and prepare for college and careers. 
 ￼

Supporting Our Seniors
All seniors deserve to retire with dignity and financial security, but unfortunately too many face financial hardship as they age. As a leader of the Congressional bipartisan Elder Justice Caucus, I am fighting to secure funding for initiatives that help victims of fraud, hold cheaters accountable, and recover stolen money for our seniors. If you’re retired, saving for retirement, or caring for an elderly family member, my office is here to help. I’m also co-sponsoring the Retirement Savings Lost and Found Act to help reunite workers with retirement savings they may have left behind at past jobs. And as your representative, I will always work to protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare. 
 ￼ 

Defending Science and the Environment
￼
The Trump Administration continues to attack laws and regulations designed to protect the environment. At every step I’ve called out the Administration for its failure to protect natural places, clean air, and clean water, and for failing to fulfill the Environmental Protection Agency’s mission of protecting public health and the environment. I’ve called for immediate action to slow greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. As co-chair of the House Oceans Caucus, I was proud to pass the Save Our Seas Act to help get plastics and trash out of the ocean. I also helped secure $105 million for wave energy research, a technology that promises to increase our renewable energy options and help us move toward a clean energy future. 
Priorities for Next Congress
As a diverse and vibrant new majority prepares to govern in the US House, I’m committed to working on the issues that matter most to Oregonians. I’ll strive to increase access to affordable health care for all, lower the cost of prescription drugs, make debt-free higher education a possibility for any college-bound student, and take meaningful action to combat climate change. 
The new majority has also made infrastructure a priority, and it’s one I strongly support. I’m hopeful that the House can pass a robust infrastructure funding package to help rebuild and repair roads, bridges, ports, railways, public buildings, and the electric grid. In that discussion, we must include water infrastructure projects like the Willamette Water Supply System. I was proud to help secure $616 million for this project, which will provide a sustainable source of clean water to thousands of people in Washington County. Investing in infrastructure projects like this is a win-win for our communities. 
Wishing you and your family a peaceful and joyful holiday season,

12/18/18 15:03,The Violence Against Women Act is about to expire,"￼
December 18, 2018
Dear Friend,
The enactment of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in 1994 was an historic acknowledgment of the significance of domestic and sexual violence. Nationwide, the number of domestic violence incidents has been cut in half since the enactment of VAWA, and in New Mexico that number has dropped by 35 percent since 2005. I was proud to play a role in VAWA's last reauthorization in 2013, which expanded on the law's successes. I fought for key provisions to more effectively combat violence against all victims by increasing protections for Native American women, gay and lesbian victims, and battered immigrant women.
But there is still so much that we need to do. One in three women still face domestic violence in New Mexico. That's why I am calling on my Republican colleagues to stand up for victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse and reauthorize and expand on VAWA's success before the law expires this month. I was proud to join the Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women last week in a press teleconference to highlight why this is so important.  I hope you can take a moment to read and share this story in the Gallup Sun about our efforts to reauthorize VAWA.
Our success in addressing the epidemic of domestic violence and sexual abuse depends on a strong reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. We need make this a priority right now.
Sincerely,
￼

Heinrich discusses reauthorization of Violence Against Women Act

By Cody Begaye
Sun Correspondent

Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., hosted a press call Dec. 13 to discuss the importance of reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act.

VAWA was enacted in 1994 under then-President Bill Clinton to fund prosecution of violent crimes against women, impose automatic, mandatory restitution on those convicted and allow civil redress in un-prosecuted cases.

The Act also established the Office on Violence Against Women within the Department of Justice.

VAWA was previously reauthorized in 2000, 2005 and 2013 - the most recent expansion added Native Americans and same-sex ouples, along with increased protection for victims of sex trafficking.

Heinrich was joined in the Dec. 13 call by Deleana Otherbull, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women.

""We need to not only reauthorize (the act), we need to build on it,"" Heinrich said during the call.

Reauthorizing VAWA would help people who face severe levels of opposition, according to Heinrich.

""[The act] will provide victims with safe housing and communities to get them back on their feet,"" he said.

Otherbull said the safety of Native Americans has not been prioritized at the national level as much as it should be. She said Native women are 10 times more likely to be murdered as non-Native women.

She said reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act would bring funding for training staff and prosecution against domestic violence, trafficking and sex crimes, along with more comprehensive victim support services.

When asked if anything would be different in the act with this time around, Heinrich said they would focus on the feedback they have gotten.

""We've listened to law enforcement, advocates, and asked them what can be done to improve this law,"" he said.

As for funding, Heinrich said this version of the act is an extension of the existing legislation with flat funding, and the state would seek out additional financial resources for the programs that Otherbull mentioned.

Heinrich added that reauthorizing this act presents an opportunity for grants that can be used to build judicial capacity in local tribal governments, which can help to ensure successful prosecutions of the perpetrators.

While the Navajo Nation has already made use of this program to some degree, other tribes have not because of a lack of judicial capacity, Heinrich said.

Otherbull said the high number of tribal citizens in the state presents a unique challenge for New Mexico, along with the rural nature of the state.

The state will face these challenges for the benefit of the people, Otherbull said.

""[This program] will provide healing for survivors and their families,"" she said.

Boozman Bulletin: Certainty for Arkansas Agricultural Producers 
I was proud to support the 2018 Farm Bill that Congress sent to President Trump’s desk. 
Our farmers and ranchers have been dealing with low commodity prices, high input costs, volatile weather events and an uncertain trade environment. The last thing they need is continued uncertainty that would only intensify if we failed to see this through to the finish line. That is why we worked hard, in a bipartisan manner, to reach consensus on a final version that will deliver for Arkansans and all those who earn their livelihood in the agricultural economy, protect key risk management tools and maintain strong farm policy for producers of all stripes.
This legislation reauthorizes nearly every program housed under the U.S. Department of Agriculture, including commodity programs; the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; rural development loans and grants, including rural broadband; forestry; trade promotion; international food aid; research; livestock; and horticulture, among others.
￼  
Watch my floor speech about the importance of this bill to Arkansas 
Here are what Arkansas agricultural groups are saying about the Farm Bill: 
Andrew Grobmyer, Executive Vice President of the Agricultural Council of Arkansas: 
“We thank Senator Boozman and Congressmen Rick Crawford and Bruce Westerman for their efforts as farm bill conferees, and we are very pleased to see this measure nearing completion. We cannot stress enough the importance of the farm bill and the need for it among Arkansas farmers. Right now, there is nothing in place as the previous law has expired, and the agriculture economy, especially the row crop segment, is struggling mightily. 
A farm bill with meaningful support is critical in preventing significant harm to Arkansas farms. In addition to the farms, there are many other Arkansas businesses with direct and indirect connections to agriculture that are suffering in this rough ag economy. Simply put, the downturn in prices we've seen in recent years and recent months with trade dispute impacts has cut deeply into the cash flow of many farms and businesses in Arkansas.” 
Randy Veach, President of the Arkansas Farm Bureau: 
“We are pleased that Congress has recognized how important a new farm bill is to the hard-working farmers and ranchers of this country and we are grateful they have come together to pass this critical legislation before the new year. While this bill may not have everything we were hoping for, it will provide much-needed financial protections and allow access to funds for livestock producers. It also has a solid conservation program and will allow us to continue to promote our agricultural products to other countries.”  Jeff Rutledge, Rice Farmer, Newport Arkansas, Chairman, Arkansas Rice Federation: 
“We are extremely pleased to see progress in the final stages of a farm bill that provides some certainty in such a variable agricultural climate. Senator Boozman’s advocacy on behalf of Arkansas producers cannot be overstated and our family farms will continue to benefit from his leadership for years to come.”  Joe Mencer, Rice Farmer, Lake Village Arkansas, Chairman, USA Rice Farmers: 
“We greatly appreciate Senator Boozman going to bat for rice farmers and the entire agriculture industry. Revisions to the definition of actively engaged to help preserve family farms as well as timing of the sequester deduction are certainly beneficial and largely due to his leadership.”
Cody Burkham, Executive Vice President of the Arkansas Cattlemen’s Association: 
“The Arkansas Cattlemen’s Association is thrilled at the recent progression of the 2018 Farm Bill. We are particularly pleased to see authorization for a new Foot-and-Mouth Disease Vaccine (FMD) bank included in the conference report. This FMD bank will provide a critical safety net for cattle producers and rural economies in Arkansas and across the nation should an outbreak occur. We are grateful for Senator Boozman’s leadership on the Senate Agriculture Committee and his support for Arkansas cattle producers.”        
 

Quick Takes: 
	•	Holding VA Accountable: A provision in the Forever GI Bill that Congress passed last year included an increase in housing stipend rates. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has inadequately implemented this provision resulting in missed or underpaid benefits. I’m leading efforts to ensure veterans receive their full housing benefit and called on the VA’s Inspector General to investigate allegations that the department would not reimburse veterans who have been shortchanged. We must hold the VA accountable and provide veterans their full benefits.  
	•	Securing Funding for Arkansas Road Projects: Congress approved, with my support, funding for the Department of Transportation’s Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) grant program which funds nationally and regionally significant projects. I helped secure funding for two Arkansas projects; the Arkansas/Missouri connector and the Hot Springs Bypass extension. These projects will strengthen economic growth and enhance quality of life in the region.  
	•	Supporting our Allies – I recently traveled with a bipartisan, bicameral group of Members of Congress to Canada to participate in the Halifax International Security Forum. We sent a strong message of support for democracies and democratic values around the world as well as our continued commitment to NATO and our allies. The need for a strong NATO continues to be important.  
	•	Recognizing Arkansas Veterans: The ‘Salute to Veterans’ series honors the service and sacrifice of Arkansas veterans who served our nation in uniform. In the latest edition, I recognized Vietnam veteran Kenneth Ziemer. He served as a pharmacy specialist in Nha Trang, Vietnam as a member of the 523rd Field Hospital. One of his favorite things to do while off-duty was to visit the local orphanage. He was passionate about continuing to help the children and missionaries in the area so he took Vietnamese lessons in hopes of returning to work with them after his service was complete. His interview will be submitted to the Veterans History Project.   
	•	Connect on Social Media: Stay up to date with what I’m doing for Arkansans via social media. You can find me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Come and Read It Report
Dear Texans,   
It's one of our favorite times of the year - high school football playoffs! In Texas, we know that means early morning practices, decking out in school colors, and braving the cold to watch our players leave it all out on the field for a shot at the state title.    
Last weekend, our very own Grandview High School Zebras defeated the Yoakum Bulldogs, 28-14, and are now headed to the State Championship! The game will take place this Thursday, December 20, at 7pm CT at AT&T Stadium in Arlington. While I cannot be there due to votes taking place in Washington, I will be cheering for the Zebras that day!

12/18/18 10:38,Fixing the Broken System,"News from Representative Tom Emmer
￼
Dear Friend, 
Last week, a federal judge in Texas struck down the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as unconstitutional. Specifically, Judge Reed O’Connor ruled for about 20 state plaintiffs that the ACA’s individual mandate is no longer legal because Congress repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This move has injected fear and uncertainty back into the market. 
Republicans and Democrats may not agree on every detail when it comes to health care, but all Americans agree on two things: The current system under the ACA is broken, and health care is too expensive. 
If you receive coverage through the ACA, you may ask, “What is going to happen to my health care?” I want to make sure you know a few things: 
	•	This opinion does not immediately repeal the ACA. 
	•	Your coverage will continue as normal as the case proceeds.
	•	I will continue to fight for you and your family to fix the broken system, including supporting coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.
I encourage you to visit Minnesota’s Department of Human Services online for more information regarding deadlines, renewal dates, answers to frequently asked questions and more. 
While I do not agree with government-funded health care, the safety of you and your family is my top priority as your representative in Congress. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give my office a call. 
Sincerely,

Rep. Cuellar: Supports Strong Border Security Without a 14th Century Wall
Advocates for more technology, personnel, equipment, ports of entry infrastructure, and more
WASHINGTON— As a member of the U.S. House Appropriations Committee, Congressman Henry Cuellar (TX-28) understands the importance of keeping the federal government funded. Congress has passed five of twelve spending bills in FY19, which leaves seven bills, which are set to expire at midnight on December 21. These bills include funding for the Department of Homeland Security, the federal agency at the center of the debate regarding President Trump’s border wall.
Last January, Congressman Cuellar spoke with President Trump during a bipartisan meeting at the White House, explaining why a border wall is not an effective policy and enumerating a variety of security measures that would help strengthen operations at the U.S.-Mexico border. A year later, he still stands behind his remarks. He stated the following:
“Last week, President Trump boasted that he would be ‘proud’ to shut down the government. Let me be clear: We cannot afford a senseless government shutdown. The last major government shutdown in 2013 cost the American economy 120,000 jobs and $24 billion. A shutdown is a wasteful disservice to the American taxpayer, who has a right to expect the government to operate uninterrupted and at full capacity.
“As I have indicated to President Trump in the past, we need effective border security. As a lifelong border resident, I speak with constituents, landowners, and law enforcement professionals regularly, and they agree that a massively expensive barrier is nothing more than a 14th Century solution to a 21st Century challenge. Congress should allocate funding towards technology, equipment, border personnel, ports of entry infrastructure, as well as security and economic development in Central America and Southern Mexico, in order to secure our border in a sensible, cost-efficient manner.
“We need to focus on solutions that work. I strongly encourage the President to reconsider funding for the wall, and keep the government open.”

Jim Baird and I had a wonderful time meeting with Hoosiers at Flapjacks in Brownsburg.  I am confident that as our next Congressman, Jim will work hard for all of us.
￼
Thanks to Deb Avegrinos for hosting Jim Baird and me.  We enjoyed the chance to speak with constituents at her restaurant Flapjacks.
￼
I had a lot of fun joining my friends at the Indy Defenders of Liberty-West at their annual Christmas party.  Thank you for your work to help Keep the Republic.

Farm Bill Fights for Hoosier Farms
I will always stand with and fight for rural America, especially the 8,000 farms in Indiana's 4th Congressional District.  What farmers need is certainty and that is what we have given them with the passage of the Farm Bill.
The new Farm Bill strengthens the farm safety net, improves conservation initiatives, makes needed reforms to enhance the integrity of our nutrition programs, and expands exports.  The legislation improves the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) at the state level to cut down on inaccurate payments and requires more support to SNAP recipients in work-training programs.  The bill offers some relief to producers who are suffering losses as a result of Chinese tariffs and expands program that seek to connect farmers with new export markets.
While more reforms could and should have been made, it is important to get this done so that Hoosier farmers can have certainty in the next growing season and to send this bill to President Trump's desk before Nancy Pelosi is Speaker.  The bill passed both the House and Senate and President Trump has indicated his support.
Fox Business Update on Government Spending and Building the Wall
When President Trump met with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer he made clear that the American people want the border wall built.  While many agencies and departments are funded for the entire fiscal year, the authorization for some expires next week.  President Trump has made it clear that he promised the American people to build the wall and Democrats need to stop stalling.  I was recently on Fox Business with Trish Regan to express my support for the border wall.
￼
It is ridiculous that Democrats continue to oppose construction of the border wall.  Doing so puts American lives at risk.  It is time that we as a nation start putting the people of this country ahead of illegal aliens.  We need to enforce the borders to keep criminal illegal aliens out and keep Americans safe from contraband that is being smuggled in every day.
Fred Fehsenfeld Made Indiana Better
I loved Fred Fehsenfeld because of dedication and leadership that spawned innovation throughout Indiana.  It was an honor to work closely with him throughout my years in Congress, and he will sorely be missed.  Indiana and America are a better place because of Fred Fehsenfeld.  My deepest condolences go out to his family and loved ones.
￼
I loved Fred because of his dedication and leadership that spawned innovation throughout Indiana.
Fred's legacy is secured through his contributions to our state.  In October 2017, Governor Holcomb announced that he had named Interstate 865 after Fehsenfeld ""in recognition of his service and contributions to the State of Indiana and the nation.""  Fehsenfeld expanded and developed his family company into The Heritage Group (THG).  The companies of THG are also involved in highway construction, aggregate production, chemical production, oil refining, and petroleum marketing, as well as crude oil and natural gas production.

Moving forward responsibly
A year ago, a train traveling on a new route between Seattle and Portland crossed over I-5 near DuPont at a sharp curve and careened off the tracks onto the roadway below. As images of the terrible scene shot around the world, many of us did a double take. That train collapsed onto the lanes we all take to and from work, or to and from school, or to and from visiting family.
The National Transportation Safety Board is still conducting their careful review of what happened, but they did issue an investigative update this past January and conducted an investigative hearing in Washington, D.C. in July. 
While we await the NTSB's final report, I've spent the past year finding ways that we can improve rail travel and prevent any future accidents like this from occurring. I don't want our district, nor any other Congressional district for that matter, to ever go through the pain and fear our community felt on that day and in the aftermath.
On January 10, I joined a letter to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao concerning Amtrak's compliance with U.S. Department of Transportation regulations requiring railroads to develop safety action plans for ""high hazard curves."" Later that same month, I joined Rep. Derek Kilmer and Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell in sending a request to the leadership of the Federal Railroad Administration regarding the status of full positive train control implementation nationwide. Congressman Kilmer and I also sent correspondence to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee requesting a hearing on the accident and the status of positive train control implementation.
The committee accepted our request and on February 15, the Railroads, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee held a hearing on the issue. I was able to testify and talk more about what happened and what we can do to improve rail safety in wake of this tragedy. 
￼  On February 15, I testified before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, whose jurisdiction includes railroads and rail travel.  
In addition, I have added my support to the Positive Train Control Implementation and Financing Act. This bill would repeal a loophole that allowed railroads to operate trains without positive train control beyond the Congressionally-mandated deadline of the end of this year. The legislation also allows DOT to provide grants to intercity and commuter railroads to help them afford positive train control system implementation. We can't accept any more delays or excuses. This needs to get done.
The lead sponsor of that bill is my colleague and friend, Rep. Peter DeFazio from Oregon. He's poised to take the Chairmanship of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee at the start of this upcoming Congress, and that greatly improves our chances of making progress on this. 
Even as we await the final NTSB report, we will do all we can to move the needle on positive train control to prevent future derailments. We owe it to the families of Jim Hamre, Zach Willhoite, and Benjamin Gran who perished in this tragedy, and the survivors whose recovery continues, as well as all of us who rely on safe rail and vehicle travel.
Sincerely, 
￼
Denny Heck

Dear Friends,  
As we approach the start of the 116th Congress, I am looking forward to the beginning of my new role as the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.  
I am honored to be selected by my colleagues to lead our conference on foreign policy and thank my good friend, Ed Royce, for his leadership over the past six years. In this new role it will be my mission to partner with Secretary of State Pompeo and my fellow colleagues to advance a foreign policy that promotes American leadership on the world stage.

Farm Bill Passed 
I was proud to join my colleagues in passing the 2018 Farm Bill. This farm bill delivers the much-needed resources and support for our farmers who provide our nation with safe, abundant, and affordable food. With net farm income dropping nearly 50% over the past 5 years, we are delivering the vital stability America’s farmers and ranchers desperately need. Our farmers work day in and day out to put food on the table for the American people, and Congress stands beside them.

Bill Signing at the White House 
I joined President Trump and fellow lawmakers in the Oval Office as he signed the Iraq and Syria Genocide Relief and Accountability Act of 2018. This bill authorizes the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to support entities that are assisting threatened members of minority groups in Iraq or Syria and entities that are seeking legal accountability for certain crimes in those countries.
￼ 
Chinese Corporate Espionage Has Metastasized   I have consistently pointed out the need for the U.S. to be tougher in our stance against blatant intellectual property theft by Beijing. We cannot and will not allow China to build an autocratic society with the fruits of our free-market ingenuity.

Urging China to Maintain Ban on Rhino and Tiger Parts 
I introduced a resolution last week urging China to maintain its ban on rhinoceros and tiger parts. China’s consideration of allowing the sale of rhino horns and tiger bones would undeniably increase the $20 billion in annual illegal profits already made by wildlife trafficking. Worst of all, these profits are often reaped by transnational criminal organizations and foreign terrorist groups to fund their own malevolent ambitions. This resolution strongly encourages China to maintain a permanent prohibition on the sale of rhino and tiger parts, while continuing to support ongoing efforts at the Department of State and other agencies to combat poaching and international trafficking.

Legislative Update 
Last week, the House voted on a number of important bills. Here are a few I want to highlight for you: 
	•	H.R. 7217 – the IMPROVE Act. The legislation, among other things, allows states to provide coordinated care through Medicaid for children with complex medical conditions. As founder of the Childhood Cancer Caucus, I understand well of the needs of children who need extra attention for their care, and am proud to support this bill. 
	•	House Amendment to S. 2248: The measure would authorize $847.4 million to construct or renovate Veterans Affairs Department medical facilities, reauthorize programs for homeless veterans, and require the VA to provide Congress with more information on a new electronic health record system.
	•	H.Res 1035 – Expressing opposition to the completion of Nord Stream II. The Nord Stream II is an underwater gas pipeline that would transport natural gas from Russia through the Baltic Sea to Germany, further increasing Europe’s reliance on Russia for energy. The resolution would urge U.S. actions in support of European energy diversification.
	•	Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 2 – the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018. This Farm Bill authorizes and modifies the Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs that address a number areas including commodity support, rural development, and crop insurance. 
This Week, the House is expected to convene on Wednesday at 6:30 for votes of legislation considered under suspension of the rules. 
 As always, I encourage you to visit my website, mccaul.house.gov, for more information on constituent services and legislative updates. Also, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to get the latest updates on my work in Washington and the 10th District of Texas. It continues to be a great honor to represent you in the United States House of Representatives.

December 17, 2018
Hello friends,   Happy Holidays! I’m excited to report that I’m nearly done with my Christmas shopping (I’ve got to find one or two more things for the girls!).   Unfortunately, as I write this, the holiday spirit is not exactly flourishing in Washington, DC.   As you may have seen from the news of the past week, there are still disagreements in our nation’s capital regarding government spending for the next year.  President Trump has said he will refuse to sign both of the agreements on the table, and that he would be “proud to shut down the government.”     As a consequence, while Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate have largely agreed on the broad brushstrokes of a spending agreement (including more than $1 billion in funding for border security), once again our nation faces the prospect of a government shutdown.      I’m against shutting down the government. I know how bad shutdowns our for families in our region and the economy, especially at this time of year.    I’ve worked on ideas to end government shutdowns once and for all. As some of you may remember, I served on a special bipartisan committee focused on reform of the budget and appropriations process. And, while the end product of our work was defeated by partisanship, I am going to make a push in the New Year to introduce some of the ideas we came up with in hopes that some will pass, and DC can get out of this wasteful--and frankly idiotic--cycle of shutdowns. My colleague, Jodey Arrington from Texas, and I recently laid out some bipartisan thoughts on this in Roll Call.   I’ll post regular updates on this throughout the week on my Facebook and Twitter pages. Know that I’m doing my best as a member of groups like the Bipartisan Working Group to push folks in DC to do their jobs.   Ensuring Americans Have Access to Health Care   On Friday night, a federal judge in Texas made a ruling that potentially jeopardizes health care for millions of Americans. The judge ruled that, following Congress’s passage of the tax bill last year, the Affordable Care Act is no longer constitutional.  
Typically, the executive branch defends existing laws in court. In this case, though, the Trump Administration chose not to defend any of the law -- not protections for people with pre-existing conditions, not provisions to allow young people to stay on their parents’ insurance until their 26th birthday, not even the closing of the prescription-drug donut hole for seniors.   It is expected that this ruling will be repealed. In the meantime, though, this decision creates real fear for the 800,000 families in Washington who have health insurance because of The Affordable Care Act. I’ve met with so many people over the years who don’t want the rug to be pulled out from under them. Please know that I’ll keep fighting for the notion that--in the greatest country on the planet--you shouldn’t go broke if you get sick or injured. If you have a pre-existing condition, you shouldn’t be denied coverage or face discrimination.   Speaking of health care …    I’m also continuing the fight to protect rural medical providers like Olympic Medical Center that are facing the prospect of significant reimbursement cuts. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has announced plans to reduce reimbursements by 60% at off-site clinics. I believe their rationale is flawed – and in violation of two laws passed by Congress.The Peninsula Daily News recently wrote about the issue and my efforts to go to bat for patients in our region here.   Growing New Opportunities in the Timber Industry   One thing that didn’t get a lot of attention is that last week is the fact that Congress passed a bipartisan Farm Bill, which is a big package of policies that invests in farmers and helps families nationwide who are struggling to afford food.    That’s a big deal for a bunch of reasons, but the thing I’m most excited about is that this year’s Farm Bill includes key parts of something I worked really hard on called the Timber Innovation Act.    Why is that a big deal? I’m glad you asked…   Scientists, conservationists, engineers and the folks who harvest timber for a living teamed up to develop a way to sustainably harvest smaller-diameter trees and turn them into innovative wood products like Cross Laminated Timber (CLT). This is a win-win. First, harvesting wood for CLT has the potential to make our forests healthier because it enables larger species of trees to thrive. 
Beyond that, CLT can be used in buildings that are traditionally made from concrete, which means new developments can have smaller carbon footprints. And, best of all for us, using CLT makes buildings more earthquake resistant than concrete.    Pretty soon, our communities will be able to build really-cool structures out of CLT and employ the folks on the Olympic Peninsula who create it.    The technology to build with CLT is getting there. In fact, buildings made from CLT are starting to go up all over the world. The Timber Innovation Act will help America develop the technology to build skyscrapers and larger projects like apartment buildings. Components of the Timber Innovation Act in the Farm Bill include establishing a new performance driven-research and development program advancing tall wood building construction. Also included are federal grants to support state, local, tribal, university and private sector education, outreach, and research and development to accelerate the use of wood in tall buildings.
￼ 
This cycle of making our forests healthier by sustainably harvesting small-diameter wood, milling that wood and turning it into CLT, and using CLT in new development projects is what I like to call Timber 2.0—an economic vision where folks throughout our state from Forks to Tacoma have great new jobs, the buildings we build are more sustainable, and our forests are healthier.    Getting there is going to take a team effort, and passing The Timber Innovation Act is a huge leap forward.    Applying new science and technology that leads to healthier forest and more jobs is exactly what the Olympic Forest Collaborative is doing. I had the chance to check in with this group earlier this year. Here’s more on how their work helps the environment and the economy. 
Working For You 
Connecting With Our Tribes 
I had a great meeting with Chairman Pickernell of the Chehalis Tribe. I enjoyed catching up on the economic development projects that the tribe is working on.
￼ 
Promoting a Healthy Community 
A couple weeks ago, I toured the nearly-completed Summit Pacific Medical Center’s new Wellness Center. It was great meeting with Summit Pacific’s CEO Josh Martin about how they are changing the way we think about health and wellness in our community. 
￼ 
Supporting Veteran-Owned Businesses 
I had a great tour of Old Soldier Distillery, a veteran-owned distillery in Tacoma. Thanks for doing business in our neck of the woods! 
￼ 
Building a Door! 
I recently had the chance to build a door at the Simpson Door Company, one of Grays Harbor’s longest-running local employers. Simpson Door Company is a national leader and an innovator in their industry. For example, Simpson Door Co. made doors for the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios Orlando (which my magical daughters and their muggle father find pretty awesome). 
￼ 
That’s all for this week...I wish everyone the best this holiday and going into the new year. As always, don’t hesitate to reach out if I can ever be of assistance. I’m honored to represent you.   --Derek

Friends, 
Great news for our farmers - Congress sent the 2018 farm bill to the White House last week after both the House and Senate passed the legislation. It provides certainty to the American families who provide the sustenance we depend on. I was proud to support this legislation on behalf of the farmers I represent in our district, and I'm eager to see President Trump sign it into law.
Read more about the bill via Yellowhammer News. 
GOOGLE CEO TESTIFIES BEFORE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
￼ 
Last week, the CEO of Google Sundar Pichai testified before the House Judiciary Committee on the company’s data collection and filtering practices. I had the chance to ask him about Google’s privacy policies and advertising data. I appreciate his time and and thoughtful response. Our full exchange is available here. 
F-35 SIMULATOR EVENT IN WASHINGTON 
￼ 
I stopped by the F-35 Industry Team’s cockpit demonstrator event last Thursday where I had the opportunity to learn about the program firsthand from an F-35 test pilot. 
It’s so incredibly exciting that soon these next generation fighters will be flown by the 187th Fighter Wing at Dannelly Field in Montgomery. 
USDA BOOSTS RURAL BROADBAND 
Last week, USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue announced that the Department is offering up to $600 million in loans and grants to help build broadband infrastructure in rural America.
Telecommunications companies, rural electric cooperatives and utilities, internet service providers, and municipalities may apply for the funding through USDA’s new ReConnect Program to connect rural areas that have insufficient broadband service. 
I am proud of these efforts to help rural communities access reliable broadband. Find more information including application deadlines here. 
CONGRESS RECONVENES IN WASHINGTON 
This week, the House is back in session and is scheduled to vote on a number of bills to wrap up last minute work before the new 116th Congress is seated in January. On Thursday, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security will testify before the House Judiciary Committee, on which I sit. I am looking forward to hearing from her on a range of topics, particularly our efforts to enhance border security. You can read more about my work in Congress on your behalf on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.          
It is an honor to serve you in Congress. Please never hesitate to let me know if there is a way my office can be of assistance. 
 Sincerely, 
￼  Martha Roby

Kansas Common Sense  December 17, 2018
Hello,
 
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
Introducing Legislation to Make Orally Administered Cancer Drugs More Accessible This week, I introduced the Cancer Drug Parity Act along with Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) to make orally administered cancer drugs covered in the same way as traditional (IV) chemotherapy drugs for Americans battling cancer. This bill, cosponsored by Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), is necessary to make certain health insurance coverage keeps pace with advances in cancer medications. 
As the number of oral cancer drugs increase each year, patients ought to be able to immediately benefit from these medical advancements. This sensible legislation would also build on laws already implemented in 43 states, including Kansas, and expand cancer coverage for oral drugs for over 100 million individuals covered through group and individual health plans. I’m proud to have the support of The University of Kansas Cancer Center, Susan G. Komen, American Cancer Society, and a host of other organizations and institutions. 
I am a strong supporter of medical research to find new treatments, therapies and cures, and I will work to make certain these exciting new treatments can reach cancer patients and ultimately save lives. To read more on this legislation and its widespread support, click here. 
Passing the 2018 Farm Bill On Tuesday, I voted in favor of the 2018 Farm Bill. Times have been tough in ag communities – the weather has not been our friend this year, and commodity prices are down. Escalating trade tensions have also caused a strain on Kansas’ ag economy. This Farm Bill, which protects crop insurance, will be helpful to ag producers by strengthening the farm safety net and encouraging responsible land stewardship through conservation programs. Kansas farmers and ranchers need this certainty of a five-year Farm Bill.  
I am also pleased the Conference Report included my Emergency Conservation Program provisions to increase the amount of assistance in times of disaster and allow payments for fences to be made in advance. In addition, the bill supports key rural development initiatives, including a pilot program within USDA to bolster broadband deployment. On Wednesday, the House passed the Farm Bill, and I encourage the President to sign this legislation into law. 
Referring Former U.S. Olympic Committee CEO to DOJ Last week, my Senate Commerce Subcommittee referred former U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) CEO Scott Blackmun to the Department of Justice for potentially lying to Congress following claims he made to my subcommittee surrounding his lack of intervention and awareness of the abuse of athletes by Larry Nassar. 
My Subcommittee takes its oversight role seriously, and Mr. Blackmun’s potential false claims may have misled our Subcommittee – harming the investigation and our ability to develop policy. Just as importantly, survivors of abuse have had to wait longer for the truth and longer for systemic changes to help prevent others from similar injury. To read more on this referral and on my Subcommittee’s work, click here. 
￼ 
Voting to End U.S. Involvement in the War in Yemen
On Thursday, I voted to end America’s involvement in the war in Yemen, and I’m pleased the Senate took decisive and thoughtful action to reassert Congress’s constitutional authority in an effort to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen.
I previously voted for this same resolution in March of this year, and I joined letters to the Administration expressing concern regarding the humanitarian impact of the siege of Hudaydah, Yemen, as well as questioning the certification of Saudi compliance with American law as it relates to recipients of American support. I am certain this will be a matter of debate early in the next Congress, and I will continue to support promoting peace and security on the Arabian Peninsula.
Passing Legislation to Improve Nation-Wide Alzheimer's Infrastructure Degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and dementia not only pose a financial burden to our nation and health system, but, more importantly, these diseases threaten families with significant financial and emotional ramifications. I’m pleased that the Senate unanimously passed the BOLD Act last week, a positive step toward improving our ability to combat these diseases and legislation of which I am a cosponsor. The BOLD Act would create an Alzheimer’s public health infrastructure at the direction of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and through partnerships with state and local public health agencies. 
These partnerships would also establish Alzheimer’s Centers for Excellence across the country, award funding to public health departments to increase early detection and diagnosis, and increase data collection, analysis and reporting through cooperative agreements with public and nonprofit entities. As an early cosponsor of the BOLD Act, I'll continue to encourage my colleagues in the House of Representatives to pass this legislation, and look forward to it getting on the President's desk. 
A Proposed WOTUS Rule That Gives Power Back to the State On Tuesday, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers proposed a change to the “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS) rule that impacts the way many Kansas producers do business. The proposed WOTUS rule aims to promote clean water, while providing clarity to stakeholders on EPA’s jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. This is a welcome change from the overreaching Obama-era WOTUS rule by providing a sensible, clear definition that will result in better utilization of resources and cut red tape for Kansas producers. 
I have long advocated for a common sense rule to be drafted to replace the Obama administration’s overreaching 2015 WOTUS rule. I cosponsored the Federal Water Quality Protection Act to direct the EPA and Corps to issue a revised WOTUS rule that protects navigable water from water pollution, while also protecting farmers, ranchers and private landowners. I also had the opportunity to question then-EPA Administrator nominee Scott Pruitt about the administration's plans to withdraw and replace the 2015 WOTUS rule with a new rule. I look forward to working with the administration to make certain the new rule’s implementation works for farmers, ranchers and other stakeholders. 
Attending the Retirement Ceremony for General Vincent Brooks On Wednesday, I had the honor of attending the retirement ceremony for my friend General Vincent Brooks. I’m grateful for Gen. Brooks and his dedicated years of service to our nation, especially while commanding soldiers of the Big Red One at Fort Riley, and most recently his leadership as the commander of United States Forces Korea. Robba and I are wishing him and his wife Carol all the best in this next adventure.
 ￼
Sponsoring Legislation to Fix VA’s Incorrect Payments Last week, I joined my Senate colleagues in introducing the Forever GI Bill Housing Payment Fulfillment Act. This legislation would make certain the Department of Veterans Affairs reimburses veterans for missed or underpaid Forever GI Bill housing benefits. The VA must make every effort to restore confidence with veterans by delivering the care and benefits they have earned. The significant problems with the implementation of the Forever GI Bill must be resolved immediately, and further delay is unacceptable and will burden those veterans impacted. This legislation will make certain the VA is working to earn back GI Bill beneficiaries’ trust. Click here to read more on this legislation. 
Honoring Army Fellow Captain Mark Bedrin On Thursday, I spoke on the Senate floor in recognition of the contributions of a member of my staff, U.S. Army Captain Mark Bedrin, who has spent the last year working in my office as part of the Army’s Congressional Fellowship Program. Since my first conversation with Mark, I have been impressed by his determination and tenacity, and he has proven himself to be an asset to my team. Though I am sad he will be leaving our office at the end of the month, I know he will serve the Army well next year in the Budget Liaison Office, where I am confident he will be a highly effective ambassador to Congress and for the Army. 
Mark’s assignments have taken him, his wife, Katie, and children, Elizabeth and Patrick, around the world in service to our country. Mark has completed two combat deployments, encompassing more than 22 months in the Kandahar Province of Afghanistan as both a rifle platoon leader and as regimental battle captain. Additionally, he completed a peacekeeping deployment to the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, where he commanded a rifle company supporting the Multinational Force and Observers maintaining the Treaty of Peace between Egypt and Israel. Mark planned and completed multiple missions supporting Operation Atlantic Resolve in central and Eastern Europe, as well. 
Mark is one of the most impressive military officers I have had the honor of knowing, and I hold him in the highest regard – personally and professionally. Mark represents the best that the Army has to offer, and I know he will continue to benefit the future of our nation. He has been a model for selfless service and leadership, and I know he will continue to do great things throughout his Army career and his life of service, wherever that path may lead. 
￼ 
Meeting with ATF Officials in Kansas City Early last week before heading to Washington, D.C., I visited the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ (ATF) Kansas City office to meet with leadership and employees. As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee with oversight and funding responsibility for the Department of Justice and ATF, this visit was informative and helps me better understand the resource needs of the bureau. During my meetings with employees, I heard updates on their work in the region and their use of partnerships across the community and state. I appreciated the opportunity to visit with various ATF employees and am grateful for the work they do across our country to solve and reduce violent crimes.
 ￼ 

Watching the Jayhawks Take On Villanova On Saturday, Robba and I were at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence to watch the Jayhawks take on Villanova. Following the game, it was great to meet KU’s center, Udoka ‘Doke’ Azubuike. Last March, prior to the Final Four, my office helped Doke’s mom obtain a visa in time to travel from Nigeria to San Antonio, to watch her son play and reuniting them for the first time in six years. It was a great non-conference win for the Jayhawks! 
 ￼

Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

NEWS FROM WASHINGTON AND ACROSS WEST TEXAS
Dear Friend, 
The Farm Bill conference report has been signed by the conference committee, has passed both the House and Senate, and is ready for the President to sign it into law - just in time before the close of the 115th Congress. ‪I commend my friend and fellow West Texan, House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway, for spearheading this legislation – it’s a home run for our farmers and ranchers, ensuring they have the safety net they need to produce our food and fiber.  
2018 Farm Bill 
Nothing has been more important to our district than getting a strong and reliable Farm Bill passed. After two years of hearings and meetings, as well as months of negotiations on the conference committee, I am excited to be sending a great Farm Bill to the President’s desk.
￼ 
I am pleased that much of the House bill is reflected in our final legislation. We significantly improved the agriculture safety net and made much needed investments in rural infrastructure, which will provide struggling producers with certainty, strengthen rural communities, and ensure America can provide a safe and affordable food supply.
While we were not able to implement all of the bold welfare-to-work reforms led by House Republicans, 18 of the 21 House-passed reforms to the Food Stamp program are reflected in the final report. These reforms will strengthen the program’s integrity, provide needed oversight, and reduce waste, fraud, and abuse.
￼ 
Additionally, the final bill includes two amendments I introduced on behalf of the good people of West Texas to strengthen access to healthcare for rural communities and allow universities like Texas Tech to compete for more agriculture-related research funding. 
By getting the Farm Bill done now, we provide immediate certainty to agriculture producers and also, avoid Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats rewriting the bill next Congress.
￼ 
Agriculture and traditional American values go hand-in-hand. Farmers and ranchers represent more than food and fiber – they symbolize a culture of faith, hard work, and independence, which has always been at the heart of America’s greatness. The 2018 Farm Bill will not only support our producers and families living in rural America, but also it will provide security and peace of mind to all Americans by maintaining our ability as a nation to feed our own people independent of foreign countries. 
￼ 
Right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness
Aside from the Farm Bill, recently, efforts were made to fight federally funded fetal tissue research - I joined 74 of my colleagues in the House urging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to issue a department wide moratorium on the practice. The letter reads: “Exploiting even one unborn child in this way is repulsive and should stop, regardless of the outcome hoped for by researchers.” 
I will continue to fight for the unborn, ensuring that ALL have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Read the full letter here. 
Wreaths Across America  
The freedoms and opportunities we enjoy as Americans are only possible because of the service of our men and women in the Armed Forces. We all must do our part to ensure we pass down to our children a culture of honor and respect for those who wore the uniform – they’ve earned it! 
It was a great honor to be with the Abilene community Saturday to remember and reflect on the sacrifice of our fallen soldiers at the Wreaths Across America ceremony at the Texas State Veterans Cemetery. 
￼ 
Wreaths Across America is yet another testament to the patriotism and charitable spirit that has always reflected the true character of our country. What started as a simple act of kindness from one family in Maine has grown into a powerful annual tradition where families and fellow Americans throughout our nation come to remember our fallen heroes and to celebrate the freedoms and the American ideals they fought to defend. 
Affordable, Patient-Centered Healthcare 
Obamacare has been an abject failure in big government, socialized-style medicine that has only made healthcare more expensive for millions of working families. 
In light of the Texas judge's ruling that Obamacare is unconstitutional, I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to develop solutions that achieve what Obamacare promised but failed to deliver: access to affordable, patient-centered healthcare. We desperately need a system that provides more choice at a lower cost. Read Fox News' coverage on the ruling here.  
Energy Dominance 
Not only are we on track for energy independence, but also we are on a trajectory for energy dominance. With our region being the energy basin, greater oil exports positively impact the economy and the people of West Texas. Read about the progress we’ve made in the oil industry here. 
Wreck ‘em, Tech
I am proud to have so many bright Texas Tech University interns on Capitol Hill spending their fall semester serving West Texans and our country. Their hard work has made a lasting impact in the district and throughout the great state of Texas. Wreck ‘em! 
￼ 
Please know, it is an honor to be your Representative. Feel free to reach out to my office and let me know how I can best serve you.

12/17/18 19:10,What the Farm Bill means for New Mexico,"￼
December 17, 2018
Dear Friend,
I grew up helping my parents run a small cattle operation, which is where I learned to truly value the hard work farmers and ranchers do each and every day to produce the food we eat. In New Mexico, our farmers, dairy producers, and ranchers help drive the state's economy and are an integral part of our history. That's why I worked so hard to pass the 2018 bipartisan Farm Bill this month. 
The Farm Bill will deliver agricultural funding and set our nation's food policy for the next five years. It provides certainty for New Mexico's farmers so they can continue producing and contributing to our economy. The bill has far reaching impacts that include expanded opportunities for veterans and socially disadvantaged farmers, protections for our land and water, investments in high-speed internet access in rural and tribal communities, and support for important food and nutrition programs.
In an era of severe drought, extreme fires, and climate disruption, we must take steps to promote long-term sustainable use of New Mexico's land and water. That's why I'm especially pleased the Farm Bill includes my provisions to improve the health and resiliency of New Mexico's forests and watersheds and reduce the risks of costly catastrophic wildfires. My measures will provide New Mexico communities with substantial resources and the best available science so we can complete large, landscape-scale forest restoration projects and sustainably use our limited water resources.
We must also do more to ensure no child is hungry and that all of our kids have the opportunity to live a healthy and productive life.  That's why I'm proud that we successfully fought back against efforts to impose harmful eligibility requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) into the Farm Bill. SNAP provides affordable food for New Mexico families in need. We should be working to find solutions that help level the playing field for hard-working families instead of pulling the rug out from under those who are struggling.
I'm proud of the wins were able to secure for New Mexico in the 2018 Farm Bill. I won't stop working to advance policies that support job creation and opportunity, and help families benefit from our growing economy. 
Sincerely,
￼

The Webster Wire
Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends: 
After several months of conferencing between the House and Senate, last week, Congress passed the conference report for the Farm Bill (H.R. 2) last week. I was disappointed the job training and workforce changes were not included, but the bill provides a five-year authorization for key programs that impact our farming and ranching communities. Additionally, it includes provisions that improve market stability and help protect producers from droughts and natural disasters. It also ensures that vital tools for trade promotion, market development, and a safety net are available for American producers hurt by unfair trade deals. 
Agriculture is one of the three pillars of Florida’s economy. Farmers and ranchers all over Florida grow and raise the food that ends up on kitchen tables around the world. It is important we give our Florida farmers the stability they need to continue their hard work. For these reasons, I voted to pass this bill last Wednesday. 
￼ 
______________ 
Friday, a Judge in Texas released an initial ruling in Texas v. Azar, the state’s lawsuit against Obamacare. His decision declares the individual mandate is unconstitutional and the rest of the Affordable Care Act (ACA/Obamacare) is invalid since it cannot work without the individual mandate.  However, the decision did not include an injunction nor a timeline for implementation.  Thus, health insurance exchanges and other elements of Obamacare law are not immediately impacted.  This likely just the first step of many judicial proceedings on the decision and its implementation. 
￼ 
_______________ 
On Tuesday, I attended Holiday Mail for Our Heroes, hosted by the American Red Cross. I had the opportunity to write several letters to members of our military who will be spending the Christmas season away from their families while they are stationed in Iraq and Kuwait. I am extremely grateful for their sacrifice. Sending our servicemen and women Christmas cards of thanks is a small expression of our gratitude for their service. 
￼ 
_______________ 
Earlier this year, the Trump Administration created the Postal Task Force to do research on the postal industry and come up with potential solutions for the future of the United States Postal Service (USPS). After months of meeting with industry leaders, postal workers, Members of Congress, and other analysts, the Postal Task Force published their report this month, which offers many proposals to improve the postal service – none of which include privatization. 
It is important that we do everything we can to maintain the level of service USPS provides to families, individuals, and small businesses across the country, regardless of income, location or status. This Congress, I cosponsored legislation opposing the privatization of USPS; continuing 6-day delivery service; and maintaining 2012 mail standards to avoid further consolidation of post offices, shorter working hours, longer delivery waits, and individual mailboxes being replaced by communal service boxes further away from people’s homes. I am committed to working alongside the Trump Administration to find commonsense, practical solutions to improve USPS without compromising the current level of service Americans enjoy.
￼ 
_______________ 
Last week, the House passed with my support H.R. 7217, the IMPROVE Act. This bill allows states using Medicaid Home Health models to provide coordinated care for children with complex medical conditions. Under current Medicaid law, states are unable to target and customize plans. However, being able to modify plans and specialize care models to suit the needs of children with chronic health conditions is useful in ensuring children get the care they need. H.R. 7217 remedies this problem and gives states the flexibility they need. The Trump Administration identified this legal barrier and I was pleased that the House acted to resolve it.
_______________ 
The House also passed H.R. 1318 and S.3029. These bills improve research and care for infants, and mothers. H.R. 1318 reauthorizes programs for safe motherhood including support for States and tribes with their maternal mortality review committees. The committees will be tasked with identifying the trends and risk factors that contribute to the death of new or expectant mothers. They will also develop recommendations to reduce maternal deaths in the future. S.3029 amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research and education activities, as well as recommendations for existing programs, regarding preterm labor and delivery, and infant mortality. 
_______________ 
This weekend, I enjoyed joining the Lake County Sheriff’s Department as they participated in the annual Howey-in-the-Hills Christmas parade.  It was great to see so many friends and neighbors out celebrating this holiday season. 
￼ 
_______________ 
Saturday, I was honored to speak at the Lone Oak Cemetery’s Wreath Across America ceremony honoring veterans. As we celebrate this holiday season, we must also remember that freedom, and the blessings it brings, often exact the ultimate sacrifice. It was important to me to take time to honor and pay respect to our veterans.  As I laid my wreath, I said a prayer of thanks for the life that was lived in defense of our country, and a prayer of thanks for those – and their loved ones - living today defending our country.

Constituent Corner
A constituent and veteran from Inverness recently contacted our office for help. He had several Notices of Disagreement with the VA and we began following them on his behalf, calling every two months to monitor the progress. At the DRO review, it was suggested he get a second opinion, which he did. Once this was submitted, it appeared a form was missing from the file and time was running out to meet a deadline for eligibility. We confirmed this was true and followed up with his lawyer to get the information returned within the window. Everything was completed and submitted, and the rating decision was completed, resulting in a retroactive payment of over $150,000.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.  
District Update
This past week Cindy Brown and Pam Jones from my district office had attended events within our district. On Tuesday Cindy Brown attended a ceremony at Harbour View Elementary School in Summerfield, that dedicated a parking spot to Purple Heart Veterans. And on Wednesday Pam Jones congratulated recipients of the Leesburg Chamber Awards at the 82nd annual Installation Awards Gala.

Legislative Update
On Wednesday, I supported the passage of H.Res. 1165, a resolution by the House of Representatives that condemns the Assad regime and its backers for their support of war crimes and against innocent civilians in Syria. As long as Syria is forcefully controlled by the Assad regime, Iran will remain entrenched in the nation. The resolution calls for a strategy to achieve a political transition in Syria and for the expulsion of foreign fighters, including Iranian-backed militias. The resolution also notes that Russia has not been a reliable partner in removing these violent forces. It also calls for the Secretary of State to investigate foreign fighters for their role in crimes against humanity in Syria.

12/17/18 17:44,Big win for Hoosier farmers,"A message from US Senator Todd Young
￼ 


Big Win for Hoosier Farmers 
Last week’s passage of the Farm Bill in the Senate was important to farmers in Indiana and across the country. This Farm Bill will improve risk management tools for farmers, strengthen food security while eliminating wasteful practices, and ensure Hoosiers can continue innovative conservation efforts that increase yield and prioritize soil health. 
I’m grateful that my biotechnology legislation was included in this package, and I will continue working on behalf of Indiana’s farming community to ensure that this important industry remains strong. I look forward to the Farm Bill making it to the President’s desk and being signed into law.
Randy Kron, Indiana Farm Bureau President said, “It’s essential that we continue to provide our farmers with the opportunity to compete in a global market. The inclusion of the Growing American Food Exports Acts in the new farm bill is a step in the right direction. Farmers are an innovative group with a good grasp on modern technology. Better access to trading partners for agriculture’s biotechnology products can create new opportunities for our rural farming communities and should spur innovation.” 
More from Indiana supporters, here. 
￼ 
Returning $3 Million to Hoosiers 
This year, my office was able to help return more than $3 million owed to Hoosiers by various federal agencies. We worked hard to resolve 865 cases, resulting in $3,054,173 returned to Hoosiers. One veteran, who first made a Veterans Administration claim in 2005, received a payment of nearly $350,000 this year after contacting my office. 
Navigating the federal bureaucracy can often be frustrating and discouraging. I’m very proud of my staff for working tirelessly to help veterans, seniors and all Hoosiers receive what the government owes them. WNDU 16 covers the story, here.

￼ 
Leadership in Genocide and Atrocity Prevention 
America’s moral principles and national security interests require us to take proactive steps to prevent acts of genocide and other mass atrocities. Last week, my bipartisan legislation to help support that important objective passed the Senate. The phrase “Never Again” must be more than just a phrase. I look forward to the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act being signed into law. 
Progress in Yemen 
I appeared on Fox News’ America’s Newsroom on Wednesday prior to the Senate’s vote on Yemen. I spoke about the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia, funding for border security, and ending the civil war in Yemen, where approximately fourteen million people are at risk of starvation. Click here to watch.  
On Wednesday, I also introduced my bipartisan Yemen amendment (4080), which I spoke about  on the Senate floor. On Thursday, the Senate voted to pass my amendment to prevent the resumption of U.S. air refueling of Saudi coalition aircraft in Yemen. Read more about the amendment here. Also, on Thursday, I joined the Executive Director of the World Food Programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies to discuss the humanitarian and national security crisis in Yemen.  You can view the video of the event here. 
￼ 
Congenital Heart Defect Research 
Gaining a better understanding of congenital heart defects (CHD) is critical to the nearly 1 in 100 babies born with CHD and the millions of survivors living with this disease. That’s why I helped lead the Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act with Senator Durbin, to increase research funding and awareness for congenital heart defects. I’m proud this bipartisan legislation has passed the Senate on Thursday and is now one step closer to saving lives.

Dear friend,   Because of paperwork issues at the Department of Education, a public school teacher was unfairly ordered to pay twenty-four *thousand* dollars after signing up for a program that was supposed to help aspiring teachers pay for their higher education in return for committing to teach at a high-need school.   And she's not alone: many teachers' grants were turned into loans - all because of paperwork problems. That's unacceptable, and I joined my colleagues in pressing Secretary DeVos to resolve this issue.    Read our letter to Secretary DeVos here >>  I'm glad to report the Department of Education has now announced they will fix this problem, but this needs to be the start, not the end, of efforts to improve the program.  I hope you'll help spread the word that affected teachers should monitor https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/teach for updates on applying for reconsideration.
Sincerely,

2018 Farm Bill 
We have the highest quality, lowest cost food supply thanks to the hard work of our nation’s farmers and ranchers. That’s why, as a member of the farm bill conference committee, I worked to ensure that the final 2018 Farm Bill provides our producers with the tools they need to succeed. Good farm policy benefits every American, every day – and this farm bill is good, strong policy, which is why the Senate approved it 87-13.   The final bill builds on strengths from both the Senate-passed bill and the House-passed bill to provide producers with the best possible farm bill. Importantly, it maintains strong crop insurance, which is the primary risk management tool for many producers.   At the same time, it improves the counter-cyclical safety-net. The final bill includes a proposal I included in the Senate version that will help reduce disparities from county to county under the Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) program. It also includes an increase to the plug yield in ARC and uses trend adjusted yields under ARC. The bill updates the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program to allow reference prices to increase if commodity prices rise significantly over the years and permits nationwide yield updates. Additionally, farmers will be allowed to make a new election between ARC and PLC in 2019, again in 2021 and annually in the following years.  While the bill strengthens risk management tools, it also ensures that producers have access to the capital they need to run their operations. The final bill includes a modified version of my Capital for Farmers and Ranchers Act. It increases Farm Service Agency’s (FSA) Guaranteed Operation and Ownership Loans from $1.399 million to $1.75 million, Direct Operating Loans from $300,000 to $400,000 and Direct Ownership Loans from $300,000 to $600,000. This increased credit is especially helpful to young producers and will help encourage a new generation to begin farming.   Additionally, the final bill provides strong support for agriculture research – like the innovative work being done at North Dakota State University and the North Dakota Extension Service. This will help ensure that our producers have the tools they need to protect crops from pest and disease, while also improving yields.   Additionally, as a member of the conference committee, I worked to ensure that the final farm bill:   
	•	Makes conservation programs more farmer friendly.
	◦	The final bill defends private property rights of farmers and ranchers by rejecting a proposal to authorize permanent easements.
	◦	Improves the quality of the wetland appeals process by requiring the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to conduct a site visit with participants after an appeal has been filed.
	◦	Directs the NRCS to report the number of wetland acres in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Iowa that have been delineated and are less than one acre. 
	•	Maintains strong sugar policy.
	•	Supports agricultural trade by consolidating and providing strong funding for the Market Access, Foreign Market Development, Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops and the Emerging Market Programs. 
	•	Maintains authorization for the Water Bank Program.
	•	Includes key provisions from the CROPS for Indian Country Act to promote agribusiness in Indian Country and strengthen Tribal self-governance for USDA programs.
	•	Provides a competitive grant program to help rural communities to combat opioid abuse. 
Bringing this bill across the finish line before Christmas is an important achievement, and I worked hard to do just that, because our farmers and ranchers deserve the certainty that comes with a long-term farm bill.

Dear Friends, 
While the year is winding down, much remains on the agenda in Congress, including passing critical funding before current funding lapses on Friday, December 21. This is among the most basic responsibilities of Congress. President Trump last week expressed he was willing to shut down the government over a border wall. This would be extremely irresponsible, putting undue burdens on countless working families right before Christmas, and would likely hurt our economy and the work of our federal agencies. I’ll be actively working this week in the hope that cooler heads will prevail. 
In addition to keeping the government open, Congress needs to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and has the opportunity to pass major Criminal Justice Reform.  I will keep you posted. Please continue reading for an update on new climate legislation I introduced last week. I’ll also be in Mt. Prospect tomorrow morning (Tuesday) during our Neighborhood Office Hours. Drop by and say hello if you can!
  
FIGHTING FOR AMERICAN LEADERSHIP ON CLIMATE 
Last week, world leaders gathered in Poland for the UN Climate Change Summit (COP24). Due to the Trump Administration's reckless decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, American leadership at the summit was notably lacking. 
I introduced legislation with my colleague Rep. Don McEachin to highlight this disconnect. Our bill makes clear Congress is concerned about consequences of climate inaction outlined in the National Climate Assessment, and also requires the Secretary of State to regularly publish a public assessment that highlights the consequences of the Trump Administration’s decision to unilaterally withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement.
Tackling climate change is a global problem, urgently requiring the countries of the world to work together in big, bold ways.  Significantly lowering carbon emissions and other major actions will require American leadership. It’s therefore imperative for the United States to re-engage with the international community on this pressing threat. This issue will be one of my key priorities in the new 116th Congress. 
Learn more about our legislation. 
  
NEIGHBORHOOD OFFICE HOURS – JOIN ME IN MT. PROSPECT

NEED ASSISTANCE WITH STUDENT LOANS? 
The Department of Education was recently ordered by a federal court to cancel more than $150 million in student debt to individuals who attended schools that closed while students were enrolled. If you received a notice from the Department of Education or believe you are affected, our office may be able to help. Give us a call at (847) 383-4870 
  
WEEKLY WRAP-UP 
￼ 
  
Thank you to everyone who turned in cards for military servicemembers at our district office as part of our Holiday Cards for Heroes program. We collected nearly 400, which we’ll be distributing with help from USO to Americans serving our country far from home this holiday season.
  
￼ 
  
While we were collecting cards in the district, the American Red Cross was collecting cards on Capitol Hill. I was glad to participate to express my thanks to the men and women in uniform and let them know we are all thinking of them this time of year.
  
￼
￼
I spoke on the House floor to share the priorities of our district from our recent constituent survey. In the coming Congress, we have a new opportunity for progress. We need to listen and prioritize the issues that matter to the communities we represent.
  
￼ 
  
I joined other elected leaders at a press event in Chicago to urge everyone to sign-up for health insurance on heathcare.gov before Open Enrollment ended on Saturday, December 15.
Thanks for reading!

12/17/18 13:59,News from Nita: 💵$4.1M Grant for Westchester — Leadership on Reproductive Rights - Securing Social Security Benefits for a Constituent,"￼
ABOUT NITA           CONSTITUENT SERVICES           NEWSROOM           LEGISLATIVE ISSUES           17th DISTRICT           CONTACT ME 
Dear Friend:
Here are some of the ways in which I'm fighting hard to keep Lower Hudson Valley communities safe, healthy, and secure:  
	•	Announcing $4.1 Million Federal Grant to Address Lead Hazards in Westchester Housing  
	•	Introducing Legislation to Maintain U.S. Leadership on Reproductive Rights  
	•	Announcing $30K Federal Grant for Historic Hudson Valley  
	•	Securing Social Security Benefits for a Rockland Constituent
Announcing $4.1 Million Federal Grant to Address Lead Hazards in Westchester Housing  
￼ 
A federal  grant of $4.1 million will go to the County of Westchester to address lead hazards in 240 housing units for low- and very low-income families with children, and to perform healthy homes assessments. 
	•	Every person, regardless of their economic circumstance, deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment.  
	•	With this federal funding, Westchester can improve the quality of life for families with children by tackling dangerous, potentially life-threatening lead hazards and conducting healthy homes assessments in hundreds of local housing units.  
	•	As Ranking Member on the House Appropriations Committee, I will continue working in Congress to secure vital resources for Westchester and the larger Lower Hudson Valley.
Introducing Legislation to Maintain U.S. Leadership on Reproductive Rights 
￼ 
The Reproductive Rights are Human Rights Act-legislation I introduced this week with Reps. Katherine Clark, Eliot Engel, Barbara Lee, and Lois Frankel-would require the U.S. State Department to include reproductive rights in its annual human rights report after the State Department deleted all subsections without warning or justification in 2017.
	•	The U.S. cannot turn its back on the countless women around the world who are deprived of basic reproductive rights.  
	•	I'm proud to support legislation that would restore reproductive rights to the State Department's annual human rights report, maintaining U.S. leadership on behalf of the world's women across administrations.  
	•	Reproductive health care is a fundamental right for women-one I will continue to defend in Congress. 
Announcing $30K Federal Grant for Historic Hudson Valley 
￼ 
I'm pleased to announce that the non-profit cultural organization Historic Hudson Valley (HHV) in Sleepy Hollow has been awarded a $30,000 National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) grant to share the history of slavery in the north through digital storytelling.
	•	The legacy of slavery is still felt today, and accurately teaching its history is critically important to improving understanding of issues of race and racism in hopes of creating a more civil and equitable society.  
	•	As the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, I secured nearly $153 million for the NEH in the Fiscal Year 2018 omnibus spending bill, an increase of $3 million over the previous year's funding level, despite President Trump's efforts to end the Endowment. I will continue to defend funding for this important agency.
Securing Social Security Benefits for a Rockland Constituent  
An Airmont resident contacted me regarding his disability benefits from the Social Security Administration (SSA). He started receiving monthly payments but had yet to receive his retroactive payment. I contacted SSA asking the agency to expedite the processing of the check. Soon after, the resident confirmed receiving the $12,253 he was owed.

Dear Lindsey, 
St. Louis has been home to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for over 70 years, and our city’s wonderful talent has kept America safe again and again. A huge moment that was years in the making, the land transfer for the NGA West campus officially took place last week. I’ve been working with my colleagues in Congress to keep and grow NGA’s new campus in St. Louis and provide funding for its acquisition and construction. This project secures thousands of jobs for our region. St. Louis has tremendous assets, resources, and knowledge, and I’m excited for this opportunity to enhance our contributions to America’s critical national security and intelligence missions. My friends in St. Louis City, NGA, and the Air Force have been working just as hard to realize this groundbreaking property transfer. Thank you to everyone involved in this truly regional effort—I look forward to construction getting underway!

Throughout the past year, we have seen immense progress in relations between the United States and our African partners. The Foreign Affairs Committee met this week to hear testimony regarding China’s increasing control over the global cobalt market and the unspeakable acts of violence that terrorist organization Boko Haram is committing to gain international notoriety. I was appalled to learn last February that Boko Haram had abducted 112 schoolgirls from a town in Nigeria. While most were released a month later, one brave girl, 15-year-old Leah Sharibu, remains in captivity because she refused to abandon her Christian faith. The U.S. must continue to fight for her release and stand against these senseless acts of violence.

It was a pleasure to have the National Association of Chemical Distributors stop by my office on Capitol Hill last week. Joining them was Kurt Hettinga, President of Superior Solvents and Chemicals located right in Arnold. We discussed the importance of reauthorizing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) to keep our communities safe. These standards ensure that Missouri facilities that use, manufacture, store, and handle certain high-risk chemicals are protected and secure. We need to keep these chemicals out of the wrong hands, and the reauthorization reduces the risk of terrorists using chemicals in attacks against our nation.

On Tuesday, Congress overwhelmingly passed legislation to combat the maternal mortality crisis in our nation, as well as renew our efforts to prevent premature births. According to the CDC, 60% of maternal deaths are preventable, and the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act supports state-level research to stop these tragedies from ever taking place. The PREEMIE Reauthorization Act provides crucial funding to continue research and support community initiatives that protect our unborn children. These bills are very near and dear to me, and I’m proud to support our families.

Wicker Glad to See Farm Bill Pass Final Hurdle
Positive Senate Outcome Followed Months of Negotiations
The Senate has passed the “Agriculture Improvement Act,” sending to President Trump a bill that empowers our farmers to continue feeding and clothing our nation and the world.  This comprehensive legislation, commonly known as the Farm Bill, reauthorizes $867 billion over the next five years to support critical programs for our farmers, low-income Americans, and rural communities. 
Although the bill’s negotiations were tough, the outcome was the right one for Mississippi farmers.  It was imperative for lawmakers to pass this bill before the end of the year and the start of a new Congress.  In the end, the bill earned overwhelming support in the Senate and the House of Representatives.
U.S. Farmers & Food Security
The value of the American farmer cannot be overstated.  According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, one farm can feed 165 people every year.  Multiply this number by more than two million – the number of farms in America – and our farmers’ impact on the well-being of humanity becomes clear.  Our state alone has more than 36,000 farms contributing to the production of the healthy food and fiber that sustain our families and our communities.  
With so many lives relying on our agricultural growers and producers, Congress has a responsibility to enact policies encouraging their success.  This Farm Bill does that by recognizing the risks our farmers face, such as hazardous weather and the volatility of global markets, both of which we have seen this year.  It mitigates those challenges by strengthening the programs that give our farmers peace of mind when times get tough.  This certainty is as important to the daily operations of a farm as it is to the overall food security of our nation.  The Farm Bill also champions the long-term safety and vitality of our agricultural resources through responsible conservation practices.
Wins for Rural Broadband, Timber Innovation
Tying together the goals of predictability and stewardship is a provision I authored to promote rural broadband development.  Included in the Farm Bill was my “Precision Agriculture Connectivity Act,” which aims to equip our farmers and ranchers with the connectivity they need.  This technology can enable our farmers to be more competitive by producing more crops on less land for fewer dollars. 
I was also pleased to see provisions from the “Timber Innovation Act” in the final version of the bill.  These provisions are designed to advance cutting-edge research on timber and timber products.  Our local universities are already finding new ways to use local timber – one of Mississippi’s most abundant natural resources – and expand market opportunities for our state’s foresters.
This multiyear reauthorization of the Farm Bill is a win for America’s heartland, giving the Department of Agriculture and the President the resources necessary to safeguard our farmers’ livelihoods amid often extreme and difficult circumstances.

Tennessee Democrats, health care activists decry ACA ruling  Chattanooga Times Free Press NASHVILLE — State Democrats and health care activists are denouncing a federal judge's ruling that strikes down the Affordable Care Act, warning of ""cruel"" consequences for nearly 1.7 million Tennesseans with pre-existing health problems, as well as a quarter million people who obtain insurance coverage through the ACA.  Federal court rules Obamacare unconstitutional — but the law stands for now  Vox The lawsuit — backed by the Trump administration — threatens to overturn Obamacare’s ban on preexisting conditions.   New report on Russian disinformation, prepared for the Senate, shows the operation’s scale and sweep  The Washington Post The report, a draft of which was obtained by The Washington Post, is the first to analyze the millions of posts provided by major technology firms to the Senate Intelligence Committee.  10M tweets, 61K FB posts show Russia's role in swaying voters  CNN Russians sought to recruit 'assets' through social media, Senate told.  Trump Names Mick Mulvaney Acting Chief of Staff  The New York Times WASHINGTON — President Trump announced on Friday that he had selected Mick Mulvaney, his budget director, to serve as acting White House chief of staff, putting a halt — at least for now — to his consideration of a parade of possible candidates, including several who turned him down, to take over one of the most important positions in the federal government.  Interior Secretary Zinke resigns amid investigations  The Washington Post Interior Department Secretary Ryan Zinke submitted his resignation to the White House on Saturday, facing intense pressure to step down because of multiple probes tied to his real estate dealings in his home state of Montana and his conduct in office.  Shutdown Showdown  TIME The White House is insisting that Congress provide $5 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Rep. Paul Gosar: The GOP's last chance to keep our border wall promise
 
Published by: Washington Examiner 
By: Representative Paul Gosar, D.D.S.
 Thousands of economic migrants are currently sitting on the U.S. border after traveling as a political group together through Mexico. The “caravan” is just the most visible example of Hondurans, Guatemalans, and El Salvadorans trying in record numbers to illegally enter the U.S., waving Honduran and Guatemalan flags, while they claim a “right” to invade our country. Our failure to secure our southern border has very real, concerning implications for our nation’s security.
To begin, we know MS-13 gang members are there. Regardless of whether this particular caravan of economic migrants contains a terrorist contingent, it still highlights to those who are interested in hurting the U.S. that our laws can be flaunted and that illegal entry into the U.S. is easy. It’s clear this message is spreading: As rumors of possible amnesty spread this past fall, Border Patrol reported a surge in illegal crossings. It’s clear that our border policies are encouraging lawbreaking. From 2009-2016, the number of aliens claiming credible fear skyrocketed from 5,000 to 94,000 in 2016, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
This highlights another important fact: Every illegal immigrant who aspires to become an American is making lawbreaking their first act on U.S. soil. This disqualifies them. This also undermines our Constitution and insults the Americans and immigrants who have waited in line and worked hard to immigrate the right way.  
Sadly, the supposed immigration champions, the Democrats, are exacerbating the problem instead of working with Republicans to solve it. Their solution is open borders — a “borderless hemisphere” as Hillary Clinton put it. Potential House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., calls border security “immoral,” and she advocates for illegal immigrants. But blind acceptance of any and all migrants who show up at the U.S.-Mexican border ignores the very real problems occurring in South and Central American countries and fails to deal with our own.
Instead, we need to work together to address the issues that we face: anywhere between 11 and 22 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. already (more than 3 percent of our population), and a porous border that encourages more lawbreaking instead of encouraging law-abiding immigrants to go through a proper orderly process.
Before the end of the 115th Congress, we must send a bill to President Trump’s desk that finally secures our border with a wall and by ending “catch and release” and chain migration policies that encourage illegal immigration. We must attach this legislation to a must-pass funding bill, to ensure that it gets through both the House and Senate and to President Trump so he can sign it into law.
Republicans have been trying to do this all year, and have been far from intransigent on this issue. Open-border Democrats are putting illegal immigrants’ priorities ahead of law-abiding citizens. Instead of acknowledging that Republicans are putting American priorities first, they are allowing humanitarian crises like caravans and smuggling rings to operate with impunity. Too many in the press, rather than acknowledging the good faith efforts of Republicans and the entrenchment of Democrats, have continued to blame Trump’s rhetoric for the immigration issues we face. This must change.
President Trump has tried to force that change, and I applaud his efforts. He has warned Central American countries that he might withhold humanitarian aid from countries that won’t block the caravan. This refocuses the issue where it belongs: On our foreign policy and the countries who are aiding U.S. lawbreakers and failing to address their own economic problems.
We need first to secure our border, and then we can address the millions of illegal immigrants already here in a realistic way. But while our border problem exacerbates the issue and encourages thousands to migrate illegally, we can’t have that conversation. That’s why Congress must act now to finally secure our southern border, before we gavel out of session and hand the House of Representatives to open-borders Democrats.

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 12.17.18
Monday, December 17, 2018 –                                 
Big Stone Wall
C. Bascom Slemp
President Trump recently named Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney as his acting Chief of Staff. Having worked with Mick when he represented South Carolina in the House of Representatives, I think the President has made a good choice.
Earlier in the search process, attention focused on a current colleague of mine and another Freedom Caucus member, Congressman Mark Meadows (R-NC). At a Freedom Caucus meeting, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) observed that if Meadows was selected, he would be the most conservative White House Chief of Staff since the Coolidge Administration of 1923-29.
This remark drew my interest, for as I noted to Senator Lee, the Chief of Staff’s equivalent under President Calvin Coolidge was an earlier representative of Virginia’s Fighting Ninth, C. Bascom Slemp.
Slemp was born in Turkey Cove in Lee County in 1870. His father was active in politics, and at the age of eleven Slemp served as a page in the House of Delegates. He later attended the Virginia Military Institute and studied law at the University of Virginia, eventually practicing in Big Stone Gap.
In 1907, Slemp’s father, by then representing the Ninth District in Congress, died, and he won the race for the vacant seat. He served several terms in Congress before retiring in 1923. As it happened, that year Calvin Coolidge ascended to the presidency upon the death of Warren Harding, and he needed a private secretary to assist in his dealings with Congress and the 1924 presidential election.
President Coolidge recalled in his autobiography, “I was especially fortunate in securing C. Bascom Slemp as my Secretary, who had . . . a wide acquaintance with public men and the workings of legislative machinery. His advice was most helpful.”
Slemp aided Coolidge as he finished Harding’s term and won a resounding victory to the Presidency in his own right. Slemp resigned in 1925 and returned to practicing law in Big Stone Gap (where the federal building is named after him) and Washington. When he died in 1943, Slemp was buried in the family plot in Turkey Cove.
The Need for Border Security
It is often noted that America has a government of laws, not of men.
The current immigration system seems to be an exception. Illegal immigration to our country occurs frequently without consequence, while aspiring legal immigrants are left to navigate for years through a maze of red tape.
The process for those who want to come here the right way, legally, should be simpler and easier. You shouldn’t have to wait a lifetime to get citizenship if you came here legally in the first place. We want people to share in the American dream. Congress must act, which is why I supported several reform measures this year.
The focus right now, however, is on illegal immigration and border security, and this situation will not get better on its own. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, an astounding 3,029 people were apprehended attempting to cross the southern border illegally in a single day, December 3.
Lack of border security also facilitates trafficking in people and illegal substances. For example, methamphetamine use has surged as Mexican cartels move the product across the border, contributing to a surge in nationwide overdose deaths involving meth from 1,887 in 2011 to 6,762 in 2016.
More border security is necessary to deter illegal immigration and to crack down on trafficking.
President Trump wants a “wall” to guard the southern border. I support the President on this issue. Building a “wall,” in some places a physical wall, but in others smart fences and other technology, will help reduce human trafficking and the flow of illegal aliens and illicit drugs that now cross the border with relative ease.
I have previously voted for wall funding, including almost $25 billion twice in separate bills in June. President Trump has asked for $5 billion in “wall” funding to be included in legislation funding the government for the 2019 fiscal year, and I support him in this request.
I have also signed on as an original cosponsor of a bill by Congressman Andy Harris (R-MD) to allow the Treasury to sell bonds raising money for wall construction. If private citizens want their money to support border security, they ought to have that right.
I believe it is important to protect our borders, making it more difficult for illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings and illicit drugs.
I am committed to working with my colleagues and President Trump to get this done.

Opportunity Zones and Ohio 
Congressman Warren Davidson was in Washington, D.C. last week as Congress was in Session.  
On Wednesday, Congressman Davidson applauded President Trump’s executive order creating the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council. In April, Congressman Davidson submitted a list of census tracts in Ohio to the IRS in which he recommended for designation as Opportunity Zones. You can read the release here.  
On Friday, in Ohio, Congressman Davidson toured the Garst Museum in Greenville. You can read more about his visit to the museum here. Later in the day he spoke with students at Versailles High School. 
While in Greenville, Congressman Davidson stopped by the Early Bird newspaper to share his thoughts on current issues. Read the article here.

Davidson Pens Op-Ed Pushing Reforms to Food-Stamp Policy
In an op-ed for the National Review, Congressman Warren Davidson writes that the farm bill Congress passed last Thursday should have included more reforms to benefit farmers and welfare recipients. He explains that approximately 80 percent of the farm bill will be spent on food stamps, with only 20 percent directed to the farm economy.
Congressman Davidson introduced a bill last year to consolidate more than 90 welfare programs which cost taxpayers almost $1 trillion a year.
Every year Congressman Davidson hosts Farm Forum in Piqua, Ohio. The event, which was started by former Congressman John Boehner, gives those involved in farming the opportunity to hear industry experts share updates in agriculture from across the state as well as nationally.

It’s Time to Reform Food-Stamp Policy 
With no work requirements, the farm bill offers more of the same 
A strong farming industry is vital to America’s economy and national security. With the ongoing tariff battle, there is no question that some federal assistance can help protect America’s farm economy. However, the farm bill passed yesterday by Congress undermines the interests of America’s taxpayers. 
During the Great Depression, farm subsidies were created to keep family farms afloat and ensure a stable national food supply. Today, the farm bill has less to do with helping family farms than with maintaining the status quo and administering a plethora of food-assistance poverty programs as if the economy were still in crisis. 
According to the Congressional Budget Office, total farm-bill spending from 2018 to 2028 is estimated to be $867 billion. Approximately 80 percent of that will be spent on food stamps, with only 20 percent directed to the farm economy...

For the past two years, I haven’t been afraid of joining the fray and standing up to leadership demanding accountability. I’m here to tell you that this won’t change under Democratic leadership. I plan on doing the same thing in the 116th Congress as I have done since I was first elected to the House, fight for the people of Arizona’s 4th Congressional district. 

￼
Build the Wall
Walls have proven to be a successful tool at decreasing illegal immigration. After a wall was built in 2005 in Yuma, Arizona illegal traffic dropped 90 percent over 15 years. This week, I joined my House Freedom Caucus colleagues in taking a strong stance on the upcoming spending bill. I will not support any end of year spending bill unless it properly funds a wall on our southern border. It’s time for Congress to keep its promise and build the wall to secure our border.

Telephone Town Hall
I enjoyed hearing from many of you this week during my Telephone Town Hall. When I’m in Washington I want to make sure the people of Arizona’s 4th Congressional district are able to talk directly to me about their concerns. I’m always encouraged by the number of great ideas and questions that come from these events. It was no surprise that our border wall was one of the leading topics of the night. As I mentioned on the phone call, I will continue to fight to ensure we secure our southern border. I look forward to continuing the conversation whether it’s on the phone, in person or even via email.  Please keep the ideas coming!

Unwinding Land Grabs
Environmental stewardship is not stewardship without the input of state and local communities. The BLM’s Environmental Impact Statement and related plan amendments recently released are another step towards unwinding one of the largest land grabs in our nation’s history. Thanks to the strong leadership of President Trump and Secretary Zinke, we are more closely aligning with the vision of our Founding Fathers and preventing further encroachment on private lands by the federal government. Hopefully, the Forest Service will catch up and follow DOI and BLM’s efforts.

Reversing WOTUS
Like a villain in Scooby Doo, the past Administration almost got away with an unparalleled expansion of Federal power. The WOTUS land and water-grab rule proposed by the Obama Administration was one of the greatest regulatory threats to the West and rural communities. Fortunately, this legally-dubious effort was unmasked for what it was by the Supreme Court and this Administration. I’m happy to see some sanity restored to Clean Water Act implementation. Thanks to Acting Administrator Wheeler and President Trump for taking the lead and crafting a definition that adheres to the original law, promotes extremely clean and safe waterways, and remains Federalist in its nature.

Week in Review
Wreaths Across America 
￼

This Saturday, I joined the Wreaths Across America ceremony in Scottsdale. This event invites individuals to lay a wreath upon a Veteran's grave site honoring their sacrifice and heroism while protecting these United States. It was a very beautiful ceremony to honor our veterans, may God bless each of them and their families this holiday season. 
Health IT Now
￼ 
Thank you to Health IT Now for selecting me as a recipient of the 2018 Health IT Pioneer Award. I look forward to continuing to advocate for innovation and interoperability in healthcare in the 116th congress!
Social Security Administration Advisory
This week, our office received awareness of telephone impersonation schemes that are exploiting the Social Security Administration's (SSA) reputation and authority. 

The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has received reports from across the country in relation to these fraudulent phone calls from people who are claiming to work for the SSA. This is a scam and it is advised that you should not engage with these calls or provide any personal information. 

See the full advisory at the OIG website. 
Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce Conference
￼

Thank you to the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce for inviting me to speak at your annual conference. The Chamber has done a great job working to keep the Taiwanese and United States relationship strong. It was an honor to be invited to speak at such a great event. 
 Meeting Ambassador Abraham Chu
￼

Prior to the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce Conference, I had the pleasure of sitting down for a meeting with Ambassador Abraham Chu, Director General of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office. We had great conversation and I look forward to continuing a friendship with him. 
Chart of the Week
The Joint Economic Committee prepared a chart detailing the creation of jobs and the unemployment rate in November 2018. These numbers show the economy is on the right path to stay strong and jobs are continuing to be created.

New Addition to Team Schweikert
We are very excited to introduce Victoria Okula as a new addition to the Schweikert Team! While studying at ASU, Victoria interned with our office and this December after graduation she will be joining us full time as a Staff Assistant.   Congratulations Victoria, we are so excited for you to continue working with Team Schweikert!

More Jobs and a Booming Economy
We are quickly approaching the one year anniversary of historic tax reform being signed into law. In that time, we've seen numerous examples of positive change directly attributable to reforming our outdated tax code. From a lower tax burden for millions of families, to rising wages for workers and companies reinvesting in their businesses and employees, the effects of tax reform are being felt by everyone.
One recent example is General Carbide, a tooling manufacturer in Westmoreland County. While I was visiting their facility this week, General Carbide announced it is adding 100 jobs, financing a $14 million expansion, and awarding $250,000 in employee bonuses.
General Carbide's CEO credited tax reform and our booming economy as the reason the company is experiencing its best year ever!
Across Pennsylvania, employers like General Carbide are investing more in their workers and operations. This is just the beginning, and I look forward to seeing how tax reform will continue to create positive change in the lives of Pennsylvanians.  
You can read about my visit to General Carbide in the Tribune-Review here.

Hearing from You
This week, I held my 57th telephone town hall to hear more about the issues that matter to Pennsylvanians. Over 7,500 constituents joined me on the call to discuss border security, tax reform, criminal justice reform, bipartisanship, and many other topics.
I've now completed 80 constituent forums across the state since being elected to the Senate - in person, on social media, and over the phone. Telephone town halls are an especially helpful way to keep in touch with constituents when I am in Washington.
I appreciate every opportunity I get to hear directly from you, answer questions, and share my perspective on some of the most important issues of the day. I look forward to hosting more forums like this in the future. You can also follow me on Facebook and Twitter where I provide advanced notice of upcoming opportunities to participate in town halls.

Fighting for Victims of Child Pornography
Sexual exploitation of a child is amongst the most abhorrent of crimes. For too long, victims of child pornography have not had access to full and fair restitution for the crimes committed against them. But this week, the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victim Assistance Act was signed into law. While nothing can erase the pain victims and their families have endured, this legislation guarantees victims access to the restitution they deserve.
I have been fighting for victims of child pornography since 2014, when I introduced the Justice for Amy Act. Since then, a bipartisan group of senators came together to tackle this problem and stand up for victims. You can read more and see what Amy said about this legislation here.

Farm Bill: A Wasted Opportunity
The Farm Bill, which passed Congress this week, was a wasted opportunity to rein in excessive spending and end corporate welfare. I opposed this legislation because it made no attempt to curb taxpayer-funded handouts or reform the broken sugar program that forces American consumers to pay twice as much for sugar as the rest of the world. Further, efforts to establish a reasonable work requirement for adult, able-bodied food stamp recipients with no dependents, were abandoned. American farmers, consumers, and taxpayers deserved better.

Updated Farm Bill Protects SNAP Benefits
I was proud to support the updated Farm Bill, which passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program serves as our nation’s most effective anti-hunger program. The updated measure ensures that the thousands of families, including our community’s children, seniors, and veterans, maintain the support they need to raise themselves out of poverty. In addition, this bill reauthorizes much-needed assistance programs for our local farmers and producers. 
The approved a 5-year Farm Bill agreement protects thousands of families in our community and charts a better path for America’s farmers and ranchers, rural communities, small businesses, and consumers across the country.

Suspend Redevelopment of Rockhill Quarry
￼  
While I appreciate the immediate moratorium of all mining, rock crushing and sizing, and all other activities related to the Rockhill Quarry after asbestos was found, the seriousness of this test result cannot be overstated. As such, I've requested that Governor Tom Wolf suspend redevelopment of Rockhill Quarry until a more thorough environmental review of the site can be conducted, and the concerns of the community are addressed.

Croydon gets mobile postal office

After complaints from area residents and business owners in Croydon, I contacted U.S. Postmaster General Megan Brennan demanding answers as to the future of the post office. I'm pleased that the USPS has announced it will open a temporary mobile unit outside the Croydon mailing center the retail mobile unit will offer full postal services, stamps, mailing packages and money orders. 
While the closure of the Croydon Post Office has temporarily disrupted service for local residents and small businesses, I am hopeful that this temporary facility will mitigate further interruption, especially with the holiday season upon us.

December 16, 2018
Dear Friend,
 The spirit of the holiday season unites us in several ways. Like many Nevadans, my family has an annual tradition of coming together to reflect on everything we’re thankful for. This year, I’d like to carry that same tradition over to the work my office and I do each day. So as 2018 comes to a close, let’s take a look at some positives.  
The 115th Congress made significant investments to: combat the opioid crisis, end human trafficking, target dangerous criminals, and make schools safer. We continued to honor and support our brave men and women in uniform by increasing funding for military training and readiness programs, equipment, and quality-of-life programs for our troops and their families. We’ve also continued to show gratitude to our nation’s heroes by making significant reforms to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA), authorizing the largest amount of funding in the history of the VA to improve quality of care for vets.  
Finally, we promised you a better economy. After years of struggling to get ahead, I’m pleased to report Americans are finally seeing jobs, opportunities, and consumer confidence come roaring back as a direct result of Congress passing tax reform. Here in CD-2, unemployment is at historic lows and residents have seen a median increase in income of 5.2%.  
In addition to being thankful for these accomplishments, I’m equally thankful for the opportunity to serve you – the people of Nevada’s Second Congressional District. When it comes to constituent services, Team Amodei’s priorities will always be accessibility and responsiveness.  
If you’re ever unable to get the answers you need, or if you have been treated unfairly, our job is to intervene on your behalf. From resolving issues with federal agencies, to coordinating visits to our nation’s capital, my office helped Nevadans with several matters in 2018, and I’d like to take a moment to reflect on some of those highlights below.  
This year, I traveled more than 157,000 miles meeting with nearly 600 groups and organizations throughout our district and in Washington, D.C. In addition to answering 84,755 constituent letters, my office helped 361 Nevadans with cases involving a federal agency, returning $136,921 to constituents in unpaid benefits withheld by the federal government.  
￼
 I’m grateful for the continued opportunity to serve you folks. We have achieved a lot together over these last seven years, and I look forward to working with you in the 116th Congress as we continue making a difference for Nevada.  
Washington, D.C. Wrap-up  
With only a few working days left in the 115th Congress, the House took critical action last week to pass a five-year Farm Bill. This legislation will ensure our farmers, ranchers, and foresters have the tools, resources, and certainty they need to remain competitive in the 21st century. I commend my colleagues for coming together to pass legislation before the new year that will strengthen our rural communities and look forward to seeing the President sign this bill into law. 
 
Click here to learn more about the priorities included in the bill.
 
Looking Ahead  
As you may know, to avoid a partial government shutdown, Congress must pass a spending bill by December 21. One of the issues on which Congress must agree with President Trump is his requested amount of funding for border security.  
In case you missed it, in April, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations bill which allocated $47.7 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). When discussing border security, it’s important to realize the current state and scale of our southern border and how the omnibus bill responsibly addresses its needs. Our current border has a concentrated combination of various types of infrastructure such as wall, fence, all-weather roads, lighting, enforcement cameras, ground sensors, and other related technology. Additionally, about 1,300 miles of the Southwest border have no barriers established by the government.  
The omnibus greatly strengthened our borders by providing billions of dollars in funding for Customs and Border Protections, personnel, physical barrier assets, and infrastructure, in addition to more than 90 miles of border wall systems – going beyond the Administration’s original request for 74 miles.  
In the coming weeks, my staff and I will be sure to keep you informed of any updates surrounding funding for border security and a short-term spending bill.    
As you and your family begin making plans to gather with loved ones, please travel safe, share what you can with others, and stay warm. I extend my best wishes for a happy and healthy holiday season and a happy new year.   
As always, thank you for subscribing to the Amodei Report. I look forward to keeping you updated on the issues you care about most. For additional information, please visit my website at amodei.house.gov or call my Washington office: (202) 225-6155, Reno office: (775) 686-5760 or Elko office: (775) 777-7705.

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend,

We had a busy week, with the passing of the 2018 Farm Bill and the reopening of Tyndall Air Force Base. Please read about my week below: 

Farm Bill
This week, we sent the 2018 Farm Bill to President Trump's desk. While not perfect, the 2018 Farm Bill gives certainty to our farmers, foresters, and ranchers at a time when many producers are struggling. Under the compromise legislation, we were able to strengthen the farm safety net, improve conservation programs, and make changes to the SNAP program. Our farmers need to know we have their backs and I look forward to this important legislation being signed into law.

Reopening of Tyndall
￼ 
[Click the photo to view Dr. Dunn's remarks]
This week, Tyndall Air Force Base reopened - a crucial step in the rebuilding process after Hurricane Michael devastated the base. I salute the tremendous efforts of the Tyndall community and the surrounding civilian communities, which have supported recovery efforts from Hurricane Michael.

￼ 
I was also able to join my friend Congressman Joe Wilson in learning about the new planes that will be based out of Tyndall in the future. Lockheed Martin brought F-35 simulators to Washington to showcase the top-of-the-line technology our war planes at Tyndall will have in a few short years.

Military Service Academy Appointments 
Year after year, our district has managed to garner a disproportionate share of appointments to the military academies and the Merchant Marine Academy. This is a tribute to the quality of student citizens that we nominate and the preparation they receive from our Academy Prep Board. I was privileged and moved  that we had 23 excellent candidates that earned nominations this year and it was a special experience for me to speak to all of these students and share the good news of their nominations with them and their families this week.

Walker Weekly Report
In this season of giving, we must also remember and honor the work of our local churches and charities. That’s why it has been my goal to make sure our policies are empowering these organizations in their work, rather than hindering their service with burdensome regulations. We have introduced the LIFT for Charities Act to remove strenuous compliance measures and other legislation to establish a universal charitable deduction for individuals and married couples who do not itemize, in addition to the standard deduction.
Without the passage of this legislation, these organizations will spend millions collectively on IRS compliance, further diminishing the resources they are able to spend on serving communities. I am proud of our churches and charitable organizations in the Sixth District, and the services they bring to our neighbors of all walks of life. I will continue to fight for effective policies that protect their important work and those they serve.
We are hopeful that the LIFT for Charities Act will come up for a vote next week. There is also important legislation headed to the floor to reform our criminal justice system.
This week, we honored Guilford County Sheriff BJ Barnes on the House floor and named our Community Hero of the Month. 
Keep reading for the full update. Have a blessed week.
Sincerely, ￼ Mark Walker

HIGHLIGHTS
￼
Honoring the Service of Guilford County Sheriff BJ Barnes on the House Floor
This week, I had the privilege of honoring the decades of service to Guilford County by Sheriff BJ Barnes on the U.S. House floor.
His service forever changed our community, and we along with his peers throughout the state and the country will always remember his relentless dedication, his integrity and his compassion. Heroes like Sheriff Barnes are the fabric of our community and I am blessed to call him a friend and mentor.  Sheriff Barnes leaves his position as the longest-serving sheriff in Guilford County history.

UPDATE: Senate Will Move My Co-Sponsored Criminal Justice Reform Bill Before the End of the Year
This week, we received encouraging news as the Senate struck a deal with House to move the FIRST STEP Act – my co-sponsored criminal justice reform bill – before the end of the year. On Thursday, I joined Reps. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) and Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), as well as Senate Judiciary Chairman Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) in introducing the updated FIRST STEP Act in both the House and Senate as support for the reform effort continues to expand. The package has been pledged to be taken up before the end of the year.
Communities and families across the country and from every background will benefit from the reforms included in the FIRST STEP Act. As this Congress comes to a close, passing this bill would leave a legacy of hope and redemption.
Last week, I joined MSNBC's Morning Joe to talk about the importance of this legislation. See the video below.

Our Community Hero of the Month: Dori Goebel of Greensboro
Every month, I am moved by the selfless devotion seen in our community as we honor our local heroes. Most recently, we had the privilege of recognizing Dori Goebel as our Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for December 2018. In an extraordinary act of service, Dori volunteered to be a living organ donor for Cindy Mondello, the founder and Executive Director of Restoration Place Counseling. Dori’s act of heroism gave Cindy an opportunity to continue helping those in need.
Both Dori and Cindy had successful surgeries on December 4. I am honored to represent people like Dori and Cindy and feel very blessed to have them as a part of our community. Living organ donation is an important lifesaving measure for so many and this story is an inspiration to us all.

Dear Friends,

This week, I met with future Arkansas leaders, honored President George H.W. Bush on the House floor, supported the farm bill that brings much needed security and support to hardworking Arkansas farm families, and more. Thank you for taking the time to follow my work in central Arkansas and Washington. Here are the highlights from this week.

Supporting Arkansas Farmers
￼
Rep. Hill visited the Bearskin and Isbell farms in September 2018. 

Agriculture is Arkansas’s number one economic industry, and this year’s comprehensive farm bill brings much needed security and support to hardworking Arkansas farm families. Farmers benefit from programs funded through this bill including commodity, conservation, and research programs. We take pride in what we produce in our state, and I will continue supporting our farmers and ranchers who produce agricultural products that are second to none. Read more here.

Taking the First Step
￼
This past spring, I was pleased to support the passage of the House’s criminal justice reform package, the FIRST STEP Act, which helps to reduce recidivism rates and adds needed workers to the workforce. I was grateful for the chance to discuss the impacts of this important bill with Sheriff-Elect Eric Higgins from Pulaski County, Paul Chapman with Restore Hope, and Ruby Welch with #Cut50. There is more work to be done, but we are working hard to reform and improve our criminal justice system in Arkansas and across the nation.

Giving Our Sickest Children a Fighting Chance
￼
Rep. Hill visited the NICU at Arkansas Children's Hospital in August 2018.

Our nation’s children with severe, chronic medical challenges deserve quality, comprehensive approaches to health care. This week, we passed a bill in the House that helps America’s children with complex medical conditions receive the care they need. As a father and former board member of Arkansas Children's Hospital, I’m pleased to support this piece of legislation that gives our most vulnerable children the attention and care they deserve. Read more here. 

Meeting with Future Leaders
￼
I had a wonderful time with my Future Leaders Council, and we had a special guest speaker join us from North Little Rock, Arkansas State Rep. Doug House. We discussed federalism, voting, and elections. Afterwards, everyone made their own campaign poster. Each one of these young people is ready to help shape our country, and I couldn’t be more proud.

Honoring President George H.W. Bush
￼
I had the privilege of honoring the life and legacy of my friend and former boss, President George H.W. Bush, on the House floor this week. He was an excellent sportsman, a man of warm and goofy humor, and a man who, in every instance, put himself in the position of serving others. Martha and I will miss him dearly. Watch my tribute on the House floor as I recount a life well lived, and a man of exceptional distinction here. 

Securing Our Borders
￼
Rep. Hill talking with border patrol during his visit to the Southern Border in March of 2018.

The American and Arkansan people want adequate border security. House Republicans have proposed concrete security initiatives and voted on them. I've visited the southern border four times, and I brought back these key takeaways: we need more manpower, proper technology, judges, and an effective set of barriers (depending on the terrain/topography) including a wall, fencing, sophisticated technology, and other means to protect the citizens of our country. I am committed to ensuring that our borders remain secure.

Relocating Offices
￼
We moved our D.C. office to 1533 Longworth House Office Building. Please stop by when you visit our nation’s capital. We are always happy to see fellow Arkansans in D.C. We would also love the chance to show you our nation's historic U.S. Capitol building when you do come. Schedule a tour here: hill.house.gov/forms/tourrequest.
 
Thank you for taking time to keep up with the work I'm doing on your behalf. If I can be of any assistance to you or your family, please reach out to my office at (501) 324-5941 or Hill.House.Gov. 

Sincerely,
￼

ISSUES AND LEGISLATION 
December 16, 2018 
Passage of the Farm Bill:
On Wednesday, I was proud to have joined my colleagues in the House of Representatives and the Senate in passing the 2018 Farm Bill. As the legislation is sent to President Trump’s desk for his signature, I was relieved to see Congress come together to reach such an important win for America’s farmers and ranchers, for our rural communities, for small businesses, and for consumers across the country at the grocery store. 
 
The Farm Bill conference report strengthens critical farm safety net policies, including Price Loss Coverage, Agriculture Risk Coverage, Livestock Disaster Programs, and Crop Insurance, providing our farmers with flexibility and peace of mind as they fight so many unpredictable variables. The bill also invests in critical cost-share programs to help farm families improve natural resources, permanently funds the Foreign Market Development program and other trade initiatives to promote America’s agricultural exports. In keeping with our country’s global stewardship, the 2018 Farm Bill maintains U.S. food aid to provide emergency feeding and development assistance around the world. It will also make improvements to the SNAP program by increasing program integrity and incentivizing work in order to fill the employment opportunities that have increased with our thriving economy. 
 
If there is one thing I have learned during my time representing Kansas in Congress, it is that the Farm Bill is essential to the success of our farmers and agriculture industry. I am very pleased this bill passed before the conclusion of the 115th session of Congress and I look forward to watching our innovative Kansans flourish in the coming years.

News from Representative Bradley Byrne
  
￼
ABOUT BRADLEY | HOW CAN I HELP | CONTACT BRADLEY | WANT TO RECEIVE MY UPDATES?
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
That sound you are hearing is the D.C. swamp draining. 
Last week, Congress passed landmark, bipartisan legislation to reform our sexual harassment policies in Washington, and I was proud to write the reform bill and help push it through Congress. 
The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act holds Members of Congress personally accountable to the people for their actions, rather than using taxpayer funds to pay for their misdeeds. It will bring transparency and accountability to the halls of Congress.  
No longer will taxpayers be asked to foot the bill for anonymous sexual harassment settlements committed by Members of Congress. Thanks to our bill, the Congressional ""hush fund"" that you may have heard about is no more. Also, no longer will Members of Congress being able to keep these sexual harassment settlements private.
It was important for the Congress to make this statement for several reasons.  
First, we did the right thing. By doing the right thing, we not only do right by the people who work around us and for us, but we do right by the American people.  
We should always keep that first and foremost in our mind.  
We also did right because we are setting an example. It is important for the leaders of the country to set an example, and this legislation does just that. 
It shows that we cannot tolerate such actions by our elected officials, and most importantly, it should not come at the expense of the American taxpayer. Washington will be a little less swampy thanks to these long overdue reforms.
Passed: 2018 Farm Bill 
￼
On Wednesday, Congress passed the Conference Report to accompany H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act, also known as the 2018 Farm Bill. The bill represents the final product negotiated by members of the House and the Senate after both chambers passed separate versions of the bill earlier this year. The bill will now be signed into law by President Trump.
Our farmers and foresters are our future. I was proud support this bipartisan legislation to better support our farmers in Alabama and throughout the country. 
The 2018 Farm Bill will allow for improved crop protections and loan options for farmers, incentivize rural development, support animal disease prevention and management, and will continue our nation’s commitment to agriculture and farmers.
I was especially pleased to see the substantial resources provided to improve rural broadband access to communities. Providing Internet access to people in rural Alabama is absolutely critical to economic development and the success of these communities in the 21st Century. 
The 2018 Farm Bill is supported by various groups including the Alabama Farmers Federation (ALFA), American Farm Bureau Federation, National Cotton Council, National Association of Conservation Districts, National Pork Producers Council, National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, National Alliance of Forest Owners, and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. 
Click here to learn more about the bill’s many important provisions.  
Protecting Local Businesses 
Our local businesses must be unburdened from unclear and unnecessary government regulations in order to succeed.  
Just this week I sent a letter on this very issue to the National Labor Relations Board signed by 83 of my colleagues in the House encouraging action.  
In a move to restore a commonsense understanding of the joint employer standard, in November of last year, the House passed my bill, the Save Local Business Act, meant to update both the National Labor Relations Act and Fair Labor Standards Act to provide clarity for local businesses on what it means to be a joint employer.  
The legislation remains stalled in the U.S. Senate, reinforcing the need for the NLRB to engage in joint employer rulemaking.
We must act to save our Main Street businesses, and I hope that both the NLRB and my colleagues in the Senate will make the right decision for the American people. 
Birthday Celebrations
￼ 
On Thursday, the National Guard celebrated their 382nd birthday! 
Right here in Alabama and all around the country, the service provided by the fine men and women of the National Guard is immeasurable. Thank you for all you do for our state and nation.
*        *        * 
￼ 
On Friday, the State of Alabama celebrated our 199th birthday and kicked off the countdown to our bicentennial celebration!
From Huntsville to Mobile, Florence to Dothan, the people of Alabama are unlike any others in the United States.  
Our great state holds the heart of the country. Nowhere else are the neighbors as nice, the food as good, or the community as uplifting as here in Alabama. 
We not only celebrated 199 years as a state, but we are celebrating the people of Alabama. I am proud to call Alabama my home, but most importantly, I am proud to call all Alabamians my neighbor. 
USS Mobile 
￼ 
You may remember that last year we learned the 26th Littoral Combat Ship, which will be built by Austal USA, will be named the USS Mobile. Well, on Friday we held the keel laying ceremony for the USS Mobile. The keel laying serves as the formal recognition of the start of a ship's construction.
The USS Mobile is especially notable for our family because my wife, Rebecca, was selected to serve as the ship's sponsor. Rebecca embodies the spirit of Mobile, and I know she is truly honored to have this special role. 
I look forward to more celebrations in the months to come as we mark the construction of the USS Mobile! 
Congressional App Challenge Winners 
￼ 
On Friday, I visited Fairhope Middle School to announce the winners of the 2018 Congressional App Challenge.  
Kaleigh Chambers, Alex Etheridge, and Logan Lanicek of Fairhope Middle School won the Congressional App Challenge for their application entitled “Student Shuffle.” The students’ app will be displayed in the United States Capitol and will be featured on the House of Representatives’ website. 
Congratulations to Kaleigh, Alex, and Logan on winning the Congressional App Challenge. Understanding and being proficient in technology is critically important in the 21st Century economy, so I applaud all students who take an interest in coding. I also want to thank the teachers and administration at Fairhope Middle School for encouraging students to take part in the Congressional App Challenge and for expanding interest in coding and technology.

Thanks to Ms. Sigler's 1st grade class at St. Paul's Episcopal School for these fantastic ornaments to hang on my Christmas tree in Washington! Always excited to see the creativity of our local students.  
What's Ahead  
Congress will be back in Washington this upcoming week to finish out a few more year-end tasks. This is expected to be the last week of legislative business in the House this year, but that could change depending how things go.
The big priority is to secure funding for the rest of the federal government. The deadline to pass a new funding bill is December 21st. Thankfully, we have passed funding for almost 75% of the federal government already, including critical funding for our military, farmers, and infrastructure projects. 
The focus now is on ensuring our borders are protected, and that means including money in the funding bill for President Trump's border wall. That is a priority for me, so I will be working hard to see our border secured. We cannot allow Democrats to block our efforts to keep the American people safe and secure our borders.

December 16, 2018
Greetings,
This week, the House of Representatives passed two of my bipartisan bills addressing the national security interests of the United States. The NICA Act imposes targeted sanctions and establishes conditions for U.S. approval of international loans to the Government of Nicaragua, ensuring the Ortega regime will be held accountable for its systemic corruption, human rights violations, and assault on democratic order. I had the pleasure of participating in a Facebook Live discussion with Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) where we urged President Trump to sign our bill into law, and talked about our shared hope for a free Nicaragua.
I am also pleased the House passed my bipartisan bill to impose sanctions on Iran-backed groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis for their use of civilians as human shields. For years, the international community has failed to hold these groups accountable. By passing this bill, the United States is sending a message that it will not turn a blind eye to terrorist war crimes, that those who use civilians as human shields are the ones responsible for endangering civilians, and that they will be held accountable.
In the weeks after Hurricane Harvey made landfall, Congress passed the Cruz-Cornyn-Rubio bill, which among other items, eliminated the tax penalty for hurricane survivors who wanted to withdraw from retirement accounts to pay for the costs of repairs from storm damages. Retirement account withdrawals must be made by December 31, 2018 – a deadline that is quickly approaching. If you are still in the process of rebuilding and recovering from the ravages of Harvey, I strongly urge you to contact your tax advisor or for more information go to the IRS website at irs.gov. I am encouraged by the progress we have seen in the Texas communities affected by Hurricane Harvey, and will continue working each day to ensure Texas rebuilds stronger than before.
Please read below for an update from this last week.

After nearly five years of meetings, hearings, roundtables and site visits, and I am very glad to share that Congress has passed and sent to President Trump a new Farm Bill.
I was very honored to once again serve on the Conference Committee for the 2018 Farm Bill which was charged with handling final negotiations between the different House and Senate versions of the bill. On Monday this past week, we reached an agreement and discharged the Conference Report back to the House and the Senate for one final vote.  
￼ 
Signing and discharging the Conference Committee's final negotiations and sending them back to the House and Senate for one final vote of approval. 
  
I believe the 2018 Farm Bill delivers on our promise to support America’s farmers and rural communities, and I am confident that this bill delivers the necessary policy our farmers desperately need to keep our producers and communities growing and innovating for the 21st century.
Included in the final negations were provisions concerning crop insurance, rural development, rural heath care, specialty crops, and research, extension and education programs, among many other things. 
The 2018 Farm Bill also contains a handful of provisions to further protect our natural resources. As a life-long avid sportsman and a member of the House Agriculture Committee, I was very happy to see a fully-funded conservation title included in the final version of the 2018 Farm Bill. Farmers, ranchers, and sportsmen are dedicated to the conservation of our wildlife and natural resources, and as a Co-Chair of the Sportsmen’s Caucus in the upcoming Congress, I look forward to continuing to find areas where we can advance bipartisan conservation policy. 
Additionally, I was very pleased that two amendments I authored to bring more highspeed internet investment to rural America were included in the final legislation. Bridging the digital divide is something I have been fighting for for years now, and I look forward to seeing growth in network service and infrastructure development through the provisions in this bill. You can click here to read more on the 2018 Farm Bill and our rural broadband initiatives. 
￼ 
The 2018 Farm Bill delivers on many of our key promises to rural America. 
  
In this Conference Report, we also found common ground to make revisions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to improve program integrity and incentivize work, while also laying the groundwork for better policy by this Administration and future Farm Bill negotiations. There was certainly more we could do in my opinion to regain the public’s trust in the integrity of SNAP, but I am proud of the reforms we were able to accomplish. I will continue to push for further reforms to the SNAP program to ensure we are providing our fellow Americans will tools and training to lead themselves to financial independence. 
Shortly before the final vote, I spoke on the House Floor stressing the importance of our nation's agriculture industry and urging my colleagues to support our farmers and rural communities by passing the 2018 Farm Bill. You can click here to watch my short remarks.

Bipartisan Farm Bill Passes The House
 
This year, Republicans and Democrats on the Agriculture Committee have been hard at work writing the Farm Bill, an important bipartisan effort to direct and manage our nation’s federal agriculture, crop insurance, nutrition assistance, and conservation programs.
￼ 
American farmers have faced several years of a difficult agriculture economy with depressed crop prices. This bill helps America continue to grow and raise the world’s safest, most abundant food supply. It also maintains the agricultural safety net without adding any new spending. Additionally, some improvements were made to the SNAP program, including initiatives to assist beneficiaries find work. I also worked to ensure provisions to prevent abuse of SNAP were included. These measures include shortening the length of time SNAP benefits are frozen for lack of use and reducing from twelve to nine months the amount of time before unused SNAP benefits are removed from an account.
I was also able to include a provision to promote responsible fertilizer application modeled after Ohio’s successful 4R program, protecting water quality. This Farm Bill was not perfect, but included key reforms while preserving nutrition assistance and insurance support. I am glad to see this strong bipartisan effort pass the House 369 to 47. It now goes to the President's desk for signing.
New WOTUS Rule Proposed
 
Last week, I was able to attend the announcement by EPA’s Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler of the new Waters of the United States Rule, which replaces the Obama-era rule that treated state agencies and our agriculture community as adversaries. It is clear that enforcement of the Clean Water Act must be a collaborative effort between the federal and state governments. This is an issue I’ve been fighting for several years, working to make sure our agriculture community, homebuilders, private property advocates, and local governments are given a clear set of jurisdictional rules. We can protect the environment, encourage economic growth, and safeguard private property rights without unnecessarily expanding federal jurisdiction. This proposed WOTUS rule does that while providing the certainty our nation’s farmers and ranchers need.
￼ 
Remembering George HW Bush
 
￼ 
Earlier this month, I was honored to attend the funeral of former President George HW Bush to mourn his passing and celebrate his life. It was a touching ceremony highlighting not just his public service, but his faith, his kindness, and his love for his family. May he rest in peace.

Meet Richard | How Can I Help You? | Issues | Media Center | Contact Me





Friends, 
 
We all have our different nighttime routines. Mine looks a little like this: eat dinner. Watch the evening news. Give my three year old son, Lane, a bath, read him a bedtime story, say our prayers and put him to bed. Put Lane back to bed when he gets up for the third time. Make sure the doors are locked and the house is secure. And finally, brush my teeth, tell my wife goodnight and go to sleep. I’d bet your routine looks similar and we have at least one thing in common: locking our doors.
 
As someone once put it, we lock our doors “because we love the people inside, not because we hate the people outside.” 
 
Why should we operate our sovereign nation’s borders any other way?
 
Right now, a caravan of immigrants is attempting to illegally cross our southern border. While many illegal immigrants are innocent people seeking safety and a better life, the truth is criminals and terrorists are exploiting serious vulnerabilities along our border. As a reporter on MSNBC said on live TV from the U.S.-Mexican border recently, “the majority are actually men and some of these men have not articulated that need for asylum.” In fact, more than 90% of the individuals who are part of the caravan are not qualified to enter under the asylum program and there are over 600 known felons traveling with the group. 
 
The previous administration’s policies and Washington’s inability to secure our border make these immigrants believe that once they reach our soil, they will be able to stay here. This has only encouraged other families in Central America to make the dangerous journey and put their children at risk. 
 
￼
I have visited our southern border to assess secuirty and meet with Border Patrol Agents.
 
The southern border also serves as an entryway for illegal drugs to enter our country. In his book, Dreamland: The True Tale of America’s Opiate Epidemic, investigative journalist Sam Quinones lays out how black tar heroin is smuggled from Southwestern Mexico across our border into the United States. Fentanyl, which was just named the deadliest drug in America with over 18,000 deaths in 2016, is also pouring across our border.
 
On a typical day in 2017, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officials intercepted 1,607 individuals with national security concerns, seized 5,863 pounds of narcotics, and apprehended 851 wanted criminals. This was just one day. So far in 2018, CBP has apprehended 728 gang members on the southern border, and according to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, we block 10 known or suspected terrorists a day from traveling or attempting to enter the United States.
 
The House of Representatives has been on the forefront of efforts to secure our borders, crack down on drug trafficking and stop illegal immigration. President Donald Trump signed into law H.R. 6, legislation I led to combat the opioid epidemic and to stop the flow of foreign shipments of fentanyl. In addition, the House has passed numerous bills to secure our border and fix our broken immigration system; however Senate Democrats have blocked these bills from being considered and getting to President Trump’s desk.
 
As your representative, I’ve made a promise to each of you to fight for common sense border security. 
 
Rest assured, I will not give up on that promise. 
 
We have a crisis at our southern border, and I will stand with President Trump to secure the funds he needs to deal with this crisis.  
 
 
Until next week,
￼
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress

A Win For American Farmers



On Wednesday, the House fulfilled its promise to American farmers by sending the farm bill to President Trump’s desk. This bill is an important win for U.S. farmers and all Americans who rely on the goods farmers deliver to our tables every day. This bill also helps our rural communities combat the devastating opioid crisis and helps ensure broadband services for the most unserved in our country. It will also help many of our nation’s most vulnerable with reforms to nutrition assistance programs like SNAP so they are administered in the most efficient and effective way possible.

Celebrating the Bill of Rights


On December 15, 1971 the Bill of Rights was ratified by Congress. The Bill of Rights established some of the important freedoms that define us as Americans to this day. I’m thankful for the wisdom and vision of our founding fathers to establish the first ten amendments to our Constitution to ensure we continue to enjoy these unalienable rights.

Celebrating Christmas with the US Capitol Police



While the official United States Capitol tree gets most of the attention, the unofficial United States Capitol Police tree at the House barricade is just as important. Thanks to the men and women of the US Capitol Police for inviting me to the ceremonial lighting of this year’s tree and for all the work they do each day keeping members, staff, and the public safe.

Next Stop for the Farm Bill: President Trump's Desk
 
 
Good news for South Carolina’s farmers: the 2018 Farm Bill is on the way to President Trump’s desk! This legislation strengthens the farm safety net by expanding crop insurance, providing certainty for producers in the face of dropping farm income and natural disasters. 
South Carolina farmers have dealt with more than their fair share of devastation, having to overcome three natural disasters in the last four years. After Hurricane Florence, I joined farmers across our district to survey crop damage and saw first-hand the challenges they face after such a catastrophic event. The Farm Bill is a critical component of disaster recovery and will provide peace of mind as our farmers continue to work, grow, and produce despite tough circumstances and unforeseen challenges.
 

￼
 
 
Disaster Relief Update
 
 
In the Seventh District, we are still facing a long recovery from Hurricane Florence and my team will be here for you every step of the way. If you applied for federal assistance, you can get updates about your registration, learn about the appeals process, and check the status of your appeal online at DisasterAssistance.gov.     This week, I received a letter from Governor McMaster requesting additional CDBG-DR funding. These additional funds will allow us to help as many people as possible rebuild their homes and lives. He also requested that the South Carolina delegation find a way to fund I-73 as an adequate evacuation route. Improving outdated infrastructure is a critical component of disaster mitigation and preparedness. I will continue to work at the federal, state, and local level to ensure a complete and strong recovery!  Read More »
 

 
Putting Taxpayers First
 
 
I had the opportunity to meet with IRS Commissioner Rettig this week. As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, it is an important part of my job to hold the IRS accountable and ensure they are effectively serving taxpayers. Unfortunately, the agency has fallen short of this goal largely because of their antiquated IT infrastructure. We had a productive meeting and discussed ways to return the agency to their taxpayer first mission. I look forward to working with Commissioner Rettig to achieve this goal!
 

￼
 
 
Reversing A Regulatory Regime: Waters of the United States
 
 
President Obama’s regulatory-happy EPA expanded the federal government’s regulatory authority from “main waterways” to all bodies of water including streams, ditches, ponds, and private property. Farmers and landowners were rightly outraged at this unconstitutional land grab. At the time, I heard from many concerned Seventh District landowners whose fears unfortunately turned into reality across the country. Farmers were no longer able to plow their own land or became tied up in jurisdictional disputes that took years and hundreds of thousands of dollars to resolve. 
I’m happy to report that the Trump Administration has tackled this issue head on. The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers proposed a new WOTUS definition this week. Their straightforward approach will provide much needed certainty, return authority to state and local entities, and promote responsible management of our nation’s land and water in accordance with the Clean Water Act. This will empower hardworking people in the Seventh District to grow, build, and invest in our community.

Always Ready, Always There
 
 
The United States National Guard turned 382 this week! That’s 382 years of The Guard being always ready and always there to serve our country when we need them most. After Hurricane Florence, more than 3,400 South Carolina National Guard Soldiers and Airmen were activated in response to the storm. This is just one of many times they have answered the call of duty and I am so grateful for their service!

Click here if you have trouble viewing this email
￼
Babin Comments on Passage of Five-Year Farm Bill
I’m glad the House and Senate were able to come together to pass a compromise farm bill. The certainty this bill provides our farmers will enable them to plan for multiple crop cycles in the coming years. That certainty is necessary both for the livelihood of our farmers and to secure a dependable supply of food, fiber, and feed for our nation. I am particularly pleased this bill has improvements which will benefit Texas rice and soybean farmers and timber growers.

While I am pleased with the commodity, crop insurance, and conservation titles in the farm bill, which will be welcomed by farmers in Southeast Texas, Congress must show a renewed commitment towards ensuring that taxpayer dollars go to those who truly need them and our country’s safety net is not abused at the expense of our agricultural programs. I am disappointed that Congress missed the best opportunity in decades to make significant reforms to a bill that allocates more than 80 percent of its funding to food stamps. Without the commonsense reforms included in the original version of the House-passed farm bill, funds that could go towards securing our agricultural safety net will continue to go to the SNAP program, which has ballooned in recent years even as our economy has markedly improved. Fortunately, the Administration and USDA will have authority to enact some limited safeguards to strengthen the integrity of our SNAP program.
New WOTUS Rule
I applaud the EPA’s decision to repeal the Obama-era Waters of the US (WOTUS) rule. The Obama WOTUS rule was a pure power grab that placed overburdensome regulations on our farmers, ranchers, and land owners. This rule vastly expanded federal regulatory authority by qualifying almost every puddle of water in the country, even seasonal ponds and ditches, as “navigable waters”. By following the law as intended, the Trump-proposed replacement rule will lift bureaucratic red tape, return power to the American people, and clarify the government’s role in managing our nation’s waters.

 ACA Ruled Unconstitutional
 The ruling that the so-called Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional is a major blow to this disastrous law. I will work with my colleagues to replace Obamacare with a free market approach that keep premiums low while protecting preexisting conditions. And as a health care provider, I will prioritize reforms which strengthen doctor-patient relationships.

Friends,
It is important that during this holiday season we emphasize the spirit of giving. Whether it's spending quality time with family and friends or volunteering for a local charity, every act of kindness is always worthwhile. 
I was honored to send a Christmas card to a very special young lady from Ashtabula, Oliviah Hall, whose compassion and strength continues to inspire us all. Oliviah's wish this Christmas is to receive as many cards as her home can hold. If you'd like to help Oliviah's wish come true you can send a card to the following address:
Team Oliviah P.O. Box 2655 Ashtabula, OH 44005

This week, I also joined the American Red Cross for their annual Holiday Mail for Heroes event to send holiday cards to our service members overseas. I am especially thankful for our men and women in uniform for their sacrifice and service during this holiday season.

Great Lakes Advisory Board
On Thursday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the re-establishment of the Great Lakes Advisory Board (Board). The Board was created to ensure transparent, credible and diverse views in guiding the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative's (GLRI) investments. 
The Board's charter expired in June of 2018. Given the importance of the Board, I led a bipartisan letter to former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt earlier this year in support of the continuation of the Board. I also conveyed the importance of the Board to former EPA Administrator Pruitt during a House Appropriations Committee hearing in the Spring. 
I applaud the EPA's decision to re-establish the Board. I am proud that after working with my colleagues and local stakeholders, the Board will continue to guide Great Lakes Restoration Initiative protection and restoration efforts in the region. The Great Lakes are a national treasure and the Board plays an important role in our ability to protect them for future generations. 
￼
Andover Post Office
As you may know, many members of the Andover community have been without mail delivery service. Residents of certain streets have to go to the Andover Post Office to retrieve their mail and packages. After working with Councilman Matt DiBell, Mayor Raymond French and the United States Postal Service, we are closer to establishing rural delivery service for these residents. 
I am thankful to Councilman DiBell for bringing this important issue to my attention and pleased with the progress we are making. I will continue to work with him, Mayor French and the rest of the Village of Andover to provide better mail service for its residents. 
IMPROVE Act 
This week, my colleagues and I passed the Improving Medicaid Programs and Opportunities for Eligible Beneficiaries (IMPROVE) Act to penalize drugmakers that knowingly misclassify outpatient drugs to avoid paying higher Medicaid rebates. This is about transparency and affordability and it is the right thing to do for the American people. This bill also improves access to medical assistance for children with medically complex conditions, such as HIV/AIDS and cerebral palsy; it would also include life-limiting illnesses or rare pediatric diseases. I'm proud to support this progress in addressing the challenges children with these conditions are facing.
Congressional App Challenge
Congratulations to our 2018 Congressional App Challenge winners! All of the contestants should be very proud of their hard work and I'm certain that they have promising futures ahead of them. Help me in congratulating our winners:

December 16, 2018   Dear  @gmail.com,  In the coming weeks, Congress must pass a year-end spending bill to fund certain departments and agencies. This must-pass bill will include priorities of both Republicans and Democrats, so it's no surprise that President Trump is insisting that the bill address one of his top priorities: the border wall.  
I've voted in support of increased border security — including the construction of a physical wall — on several occasions. While we do have to reform our immigration system and address the DACA issue, I believe that first and foremost we must secure our borders.  
What do you think? 
Should Congress appropriate funds in the year-end spending bill to construct a wall along our southern border?

Yes

No

THE BOST BULLETIN
Friend:  
We were back at it this week in Washington. Right now, I am focused on getting the Farm Bill over the finish line and signed into law. We also received an update in the House Veterans Affairs Committee from the VA on how my legislation to reform the VA appeals process is going. Additionally, the House passed legislation that I support which will reduce maternal deaths and save lives. 
Farm Bill Update 
￼ 
On Wednesday, I voted for the House-Senate compromise Agriculture Improvement Act (H.R.2), commonly known as the Farm Bill. The legislation, which authorizes agricultural and nutrition policy for the next five years, includes provisions I introduced to aid beginning farmers in growing their operations and help existing farmers enhance their nutrient management practices. The bill now moves to President Trump’s desk to be signed into law.
Protecting our agricultural economy is essential to the sustainability of our rural areas. Illinois’ 12th Congressional District is the most diverse in terms of agriculture in the entire state. I made it a priority to listen to the over 10,000 producers in my district, so I knew what they needed most. I’m proud of the provisions I fought to have included in this Farm Bill.
More information about the Farm Bill and the provisions I fought for is available HERE. 

House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs Hearing 
￼ 
Too many veterans faced intolerable delays during VA’s benefits claims appeal process. That’s why I introduced bipartisan legislation that was signed into law to modernize the system and ensure our veterans get the help they need in a more efficient and effective manner. But our work isn’t done. We need to make certain that VA properly implements the law. That's what this week’s hearing was about. America’s heroes and their families deserve nothing less.

Preventing Maternal Deaths Act 
The U.S. has the highest rate of maternal mortality in the developed world. That’s simply unacceptable and why I'm a cosponsor of H.R.1318, the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act, which would establish and support Maternal Mortality Review Committees (MMRCs). These committees identify trends and risk factors, and develop recommendations to reduce maternal deaths. This bipartisan legislation can prevent future families from suffering the profound loss of a mother. It passed the House and Senate this week and now awaits President Trump’s signature. 
Local news coverage of H.R. 1318 HERE. 
That’s a quick update on what I’ve been up to. I hope you have a great week ahead!

Supporting Mississippi in Congress
 
 
This week, the House passed the Commercial Engagement through Ocean Technology Act (CENOTE) which will benefit many of south Mississippi's industries related to marine research and development. 

The CENOTE bill, that I introduced with Senator Roger Wicker in March, establishes a framework for NOAA and allows public and private defense and non-defense industries to come together. With this collaboration, we will expand the usage of unmanned maritime systems and provide more support for Mississippi's Blue Economy. 

The legislation is bicameral, bipartisan, and bicoastal and directs that the data collected by NOAA on unmanned missions be made accessible to the public, benefiting our commercial, academic, and national security interests. 

I believe that uniting these industries to expand unmanned maritime systems will have a long-lasting positive impact on our Mississippi Gulf Coast. This is a great victory for south Mississippi and I was glad to see Congress advance our legislation. 

If you're interested in a summary of the legislation, that can be found here.

2018 Farm Bill
As a member of the Subcommittee on Agriculture for House Appropriations, I was pleased to provide my support for the 2018 Farm Bill which provides certainty and stability to our farmers and ranchers. 

The Farm Bill passed through Congress this week and will now head to the President to be signed into law. This bill promotes smart and sustainable land conservation efforts and works to protect crucial safety net programs such as affordable crop insurance and disaster recovery programs. 

Specifically, South Mississippi is a leading producer of timber, peanuts  and a variety of specialty crops such as watermelons and blueberries. I was glad to see that our south Mississippi timber producers, specialty crop farmers, cattlemen and ranchers are supported through this legislation.

Week in Review
￼
Had a productive meeting this week with Dennis Alvord, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Regional Affairs for the Economic Development Administration, whose goal is to assist economically distressed areas and rural areas.
As a member of the Commerce, Justice, and Science Subcommittee, I was glad we had the opportunity to discuss how EDA grants have positively impacted south Mississippi and ways we will continue working together.
￼

It was my pleasure to meet with Suzette Kent, the Chief Information Officer for the Office of Management and Budget in my Washington, D.C. office.  

￼
It was a beautiful evening to welcome the Ole Miss students of the Mississippi Excellence in Teaching Program to the steps of the Capitol. Terrific group of students with bright futures ahead!

As always, I'd like to remind you to connect with me on social media so you can receive frequent updates on the work I am doing in Congress through Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 

In your service,
￼
Steven

I never imagined that as a farm kid from Yoder, Kansas I would ever have the privilege of serving in the United States Congress. I have many people to thank for helping me along the way, including my family, friends, and most of all you - the constituents of the Third District. Thank you for giving me the opportunity of a lifetime to be your voice in Washington, DC.

Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts Ushers 5-Year Farm Bill Reauthorization to President's Desk
￼ Click here to read more about the Farm Bill in the Kansas City Star.
As farm kid who was blessed with the opportunity to serve six years on the House Agriculture Appropriations Committee, I was proud to cast one of my final votes in the House for the 2018 Farm Bill. The bill provides long-term stability and certainty for farmers and ranchers in Kansas and across the US and makes important reforms to safety net programs aiming to pull people out of poverty and into the workforce. I’m also thankful to Senator Pat Roberts for leading the negotiations to prioritize the needs of Kansas farmers - many of whom have been left behind in our economy and seen their income slashed in half over the last half decade - so they can continue to feed America and the world.

Yoder Helps Secure $13.8M DOT Grant for Turner Diagonal Interchange

I’m thrilled the Department of Transportation has recognized the need for this project in Wyandotte County. The new interchange will open the door for major economic development in the area for years to come. I’ve been pushing for this grant for years, and personally discussed the need for the new interchange with Secretary Chao in the Third District this year. I want to applaud Mayor David Alvey for his steadfast leadership at the UG and thank the DOT for recognizing this critical need. This is a massive win for KCK, and will continue to build on the already amazing economic development we have seen over the last decade.

THE SCALISE CAPITOL REPORT
Reforming SNAP, Protecting Farmers and Ranchers
This week, the House and Senate overwhelmingly voted to pass the 2018 Farm Bill. This Farm Bill is a win for hard-working taxpayers, as well as America’s farmers and ranchers, and will provide the certainty and economic stability our farmers need to continue leading the world in food production. Our farmers and ranchers not only put food on the tables of American families, but also serve as the bread basket of the world. 

This bill also includes key reforms to the food stamp program that will help millions of Americans move from government dependence to work and self-sufficiency. With a strong economy, and more job openings than there are Americans looking for work, there has never been a better time to help unemployed Americans get back into the workforce so they can support their families and achieve the American dream.

Lastly, the conference agreement includes the House bill’s provision that I fought hard to include that creates additional research opportunities for Roseau cane. This research is vital to Louisiana’s First Congressional District and our efforts to combat coastal erosion. I look forward to President Trump signing this reform bill into law.

Working to Fund Border Security
This week we continued negotiations trying to get a bill to the President’s desk giving him the tools he needs to safely secure our border. Right now, there are about 8,000 people in the migrant caravan trying to enter our country illegally, and the Department of Homeland Security has confirmed that more than 600 convicted criminals are part of this caravan. The reason for strong border security has never been more clear.

President Trump has requested $5 billion over the next year for border security, including funding to continue building a wall, as well as technology and equipment to help our border patrol officers do their jobs more safely and effectively. 

Negotiations are still ongoing, but if Democrats in Congress, led by Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, refuse to support this, then they need to come up with an alternative that addresses this crisis at the border while keeping America safe and secure. They can’t come and say they want to shut the government down because they don’t want to secure America’s border. 

I discussed our plan to strengthen border security on Fox News Channel's America's Newsroom this week. Click here to watch the interview. 

Meeting with Louisiana Restaurant Association
This week, I enjoyed meeting with representatives from Louisiana’s restaurant industry. Louisiana restaurants and cuisine are second to none, and across our state, Louisiana restaurants employ over 200,000 people. It was great to catch up on issues that impact Louisiana’s restaurants and the thousands of hard-working Louisianans they employ.

From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:
Good Afternoon,
This week in Congress,I joined 368 of my colleagues in supporting the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill.
Setting America’s Farmers, Ranchers, and Consumers up for Success 
I am proud to support a Farm Bill that will prioritize the needs of Pennsylvania’s farmers, ranchers, consumers, and rural communities.The conference report to H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act extends major federal farm, nutrition assistance, rural development, and other USDA programs.
￼
This bill gives agricultural producers, especially those in the dairy industry, the safety net to mitigate risks associated with a changing market and inclement weather, highlights the careful conservation of America’s natural resources, solidifies key animal protections, and expands agricultural research and rural development to keep up with 21st century technology. Additionally, this bill makes many changes to the nation’s nutrition programs that ensure the neediest have food on the table while also preparing participants with the skills, certifications, and education to build better futures for themselves and their families. I believe this bill will provide the certainty and flexibility our farmers and ranchers need to produce food and fiber for Americans and the world.
Disaster Assistance Available for Pennsylvanians
The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) approved Governor Tom Wolf's request to declare a disaster in Bradford, Columbia, Delaware, Northumberland, Schuylkill and Susquehanna counties after significant flood damage to homes and businesses was sustained from severe storms between Aug. 10 – 15, 2018.
Homeowners, renters and businesses impacted by the storms in Bradford, Columbia, Delaware, Northumberland, Schuylkill and Susquehanna, as well as neighboring counties Berks, Carbon, Chester, Dauphin, Juniata, Lackawanna, Lebanon, Lehigh, Luzerne, Lycoming, Montgomery, Montour, Perry, Philadelphia, Snyder, Sullivan, Tioga, Union, Wayne and Wyoming may be eligible for low-interest disaster loans through the SBA Disaster Loan Programs.
Low-interest loans of up to $200,000 are available to homeowners to repair or replace damaged or destroyed real estate. SBA regulations permit loans up to $40,000 to repair or replace personal property. Businesses and nonprofits can borrow up to $2 million to restore damaged or destroyed buildings, inventory, equipment and assets. Loan amounts and terms are set by the SBA and are based on each applicant’s financial qualifications.
The SBA will establish a Disaster Loan Outreach Centers (DLOC) to assist anyone who wishes to apply for a loan. Applicants from any eligible county may report to any DLOC location in order to get help. The DLOCs will be open at the following locations and times:

Google CEO Testifies Before House Judiciary Committee
Google chief executive Sundar Pichai testified before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. The hearing revolved around Google’s business practices and behavior, focusing heavily on the company's data collection practices on its users and claims of political bias in search results. Mr. Pichai answered a series of questions regarding Google’s algorithms and technical features.
￼
While I appreciated the testimony of Mr. Pichai, I remain concerned about the company’s long-term plans in China, specifically regarding the protection of user data. Tech companies like Google have an enormous responsibility to ensure that the user information that is entrusted to them is not abused.
Ensuring Competition and a Healthy Marketplace 
As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial, and Antitrust Law, I had the opportunity to hear from the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice about current competition enforcement activities and policy priorities. It is important to ensure our agencies are promoting policies that enforce a competitive marketplace and are in the best interest of American businesses and consumers.
Combat Injured Veterans May be Due a Refund
From 1991 through 2016, approximately 130,000 combat injured veterans received disability severance payments that were inadvertently treated as taxable.
In response to the Combat Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act, in July of 2018 the Department of Defense issued a letter to eligible veterans advising that they may be due a refund. On July 11, 2018, IRS issued a news release advising that eligible veterans owed refunds attributable to disability severance payments should file amended returns for the year in which they received the payment to claim tax refunds.
Veterans have one year from the date of the DoD letter (until July 2019), or three years from the due date of the return, whichever is later, to claim the refund.
Some, not all, VITA sites will be able to help eligible veterans claim a refund based on the actual amount of their disability severance payment. Claims based on actual amounts paid may be larger or smaller than the standard refund amounts. To find a VITA site, click here.
Lake Ariel Office Closing
Due to the recent redistricting of Pennsylvania, I will represent PA-12 beginning in the 116th Congress. It is important to note that PA-12 no longer covers much of its northeastern tier, including Wayne, Lackawanna, Pike, and Monroe Counties. Potter, Clinton, and parts of Centre and Tioga will be added. Because of these changes, my Lake Ariel office will be closing on December 21, 2018.
The official start of PA-12 is January 3, 2019. At that time, you can click here If you have any questions about who represents you in the 116th Congress.
As always…
Please never hesitate to contact me at my offices in the district or in Washington, D.C.  I want to hear from you and learn what is most important to serve you in the best possible way.

December 16, 2018
Dear Friend,  
Last week was quite active in Washington, D.C. There was a great deal of discussion around the remaining seven appropriations bills that must be passed by this Friday, with much of the debate focused on the amount of money that will be allocated to the Department of Homeland Security for various public safety initiatives, including how much will be spent to build a wall along our southern border.  National security is too important to be used as a political football.  Border security is essential to national security and we need to fund the Department of Homeland Security at a level necessary to protect all Americans. Negotiations are ongoing and I will continue to advocate for protecting our national security throughout the process.
 Continue reading for a brief summary of my work on your behalf last week! 
Improving the Quality and Delivery of Healthcare 
I am proud that the IMPROVE ACT passed the House last week.  This bill included the Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids Act (ACE Kids Act) which I’ve been advocating for with my colleague, Congresswoman Kathy Castor, because it is very important to families who are served in local children’s hospitals, such as All Children’s Hospital and St. Joseph’s Children’s Hospital.  The bill improves care coordination within Medicaid for children with complex medical conditions.   Click here to watch me discuss this bill on the House Floor. 
 Also, in last week’s Health Subcommittee we received an update on the adoption and use of electronic health records facilitated through 21st Century Cures legislation. Electronic health information is facilitating better patient care coordination, and will ultimately help reduce costs by making care faster and less duplicative.  
 ￼ 
Supporting Common Sense Regulation and Infrastructure Needed to Improve Public Safety 
ICYMI- A recent story highlighted my quest for answers and improvement in safety procedures that could have prevented a fire on a local casino boat that claimed the life of a young mother in Pasco County. Last week’s report issued by the National Transportation Safety Board identified several mistakes that contributed to the fire and contained recommendations for strengthening public safety. Nothing can bring back my constituent, Carrie Dempsey, who died in this tragedy—but we can, and must, work together to address gaps in safety precautions and prevent future loss of life.  I will not rest until we do.   
Also, during last week’s Communications and Technology Subcommittee hearing, we discussed the already emerging benefits from the recently enacted RAY BAUM’S Act, which improves public safety and spurs deployment of 5G Internet networks. I highlighted how Florida was just deemed the best state for broadband deployment and examined how this law is improving communications for those in a natural disaster area.

Fighting for our Nation’s Heroes 
I am proud that my bill, the SIT-REP Act, passed the House as part of S. 2248 last week.  This legislation, which ensures our Veterans are not adversely impacted when bureaucratic red tape causes GI Bill payments to be delayed, is very timely given the recent delays by the VA in processing payments.  I am continuing to closely monitor that situation, and have been assured that all Veterans will receive the full amount they are due.  However, my bill will guarantee, moving forward, that Veterans will not lose access to education or be charged with additional fees from the schools.  Click here  to watch me discuss this bill on the House Floor. 
 ￼ 
ICYMI-There was a local article discussing the possibility of the Cohen Network opening a facility in Tampa Bay.  To be clear, I do not support privatizing or replacing the VA in any way. I was heavily involved with enacting the VA MISSION Act so that local VA entities can partner alongside community providers to best meet the needs of Veterans.  Veterans should have the choice to access private care if the VA cannot meet their needs in a timely manner.  I want Veterans to have the option to choose their care in a patient-centered manner, and MISSION helps do that. Any entity serving the Veteran community (whether private or within the VA) should be held accountable for meeting the highest standard of care.  If the Cohen Network helps meet an unmet need by providing mental health services in the Tampa area, that could potentially be a good option for some Veterans. However, my hope is that it (like any other community provider) would be working in unison with the VA via the Community Care Program and held to an unwavering standard of excellence. Our Veterans deserve no less!
Additionally, in last week’s VA Committee hearing we discussed progress that is being made on modernizing the benefit appeal process.  Veterans are still waiting too long to receive the benefits they’ve earned and that has to change! 
Serving as a Good Steward of Your Tax Dollars and Ensuring a Level Playing Field for American Businesses 
It is always wonderful to have constituents up in D.C.  Last week, I was privileged to host members of the Pasco County Sheriff’s office.  They were in town to meet with me and several federal agencies about the possibility of utilizing Pasco’s new state-of-the-art training facility that will be located in Land O’ Lakes (pictured below).  Partnerships between federal and local governments are in the best interests of tax payers, and I was happy to facilitate the dialogue.  
￼ 
I was pleased by President Trump’s directive to federal agencies last week that will result in greater spending in economically distressed areas, known as opportunity zones, throughout the country.  This is part of an overall strategy to build upon the economic relief provided to middle class Americans and small businesses through tax reform, by focusing on a broader effort to combat poverty and geographic inequality.  There are Opportunity Zones designated in parts of Pasco, Pinellas and Hillsborough counties.  For a complete listing, click here. 
Also, I applaud the recent action by Canada to arrest Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Huawei, a company that is well known for violating international law and stealing intellectual property.  In order for American businesses to have a level playing field, bad actors must be held accountable for breaking the law.  
 And, a special congratulations to my constituent, Catherine Tomasello, creator of an award winning video designed to raise awareness about the need to protect intellectual property through the patent process.  Her video is both engaging and educational.  While in D.C. to accept her award, she stopped by to discuss ways we can help to secure intellectual property (pictured below).
 ￼ 
Recognizing Contributions Made to our Nation  
Normally, I do not comment publicly on the naming of buildings. However, last week the President signed into law a bill (S. 3389) we recently passed which designates a facility at NASA as the Katherine Johnson Independent Verification and Validation Facility. You may recognize Katherine (pictured below) from the popular movie, “Hidden Figures.” The invaluable contributions made through her work and the work of many of her female contemporaries went unrecognized for far too long.
 ￼ 
Defending Basic Human Rights  
As co-Chairman of the International Freedom Caucus and an original co-sponsor of this bill, I was glad to see President Trump sign the Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability Act into law last week.  Protecting religious minorities in those countries from persecution, which this bill will help to do, is a matter of ensuring basic human rights around the globe.    
Constituent Corner 
My staff has been working with a homeless Veteran who resides in Pasco County since earlier this year when he first contacted my office.  He has severe physical and mental health issues which have prevented him from being able to work. Though he applied for Social Security Disability benefits many years ago, he had been previously denied and his appeal was tied up in the system.  We were able to advocate on his behalf and have appeal review expedited.  His disability was approved last week.  Even one homeless Veteran is too many, in mind.  I was happy to help get this Veteran the help he needs. 
This is just one example of the work we do each and every day.  Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.  
Highlights from Around the District 
I have a great team, both locally and in Washington, D.C.  When I am in Washington, members of my team are working each and every day to provide excellent constituent service and to be my eyes and ears on the ground as they attend community events.  Here are just a few highlights of their efforts this week.
My Deputy Chief of Staff, Summer, attended the Alliance for Substance Abuse Prevention’s annual brunch which was attended by over 200 people in Pasco County.  Patients in recovery from substance abuse shared their inspirational stories about the work that is being done in our community utilizing the recent influx of federal dollars to assist those who are addicted on their journey to sobriety. 
￼ 
Dan, my District Aide, attended the North Tampa Bay Chamber of Commerce’s Economic Briefing in which county officials discussed the progress being made on the Ridge Road Extension Project.  I have been working closely with county staff and the leadership of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to expedite approval of the permit, as this project is vital to public safety.  
￼ 
Rob, my Outreach Director and Veterans' Liaison, attended the Community Service Council's annual event in New Port Richey to honor students who have demonstrated a strong commitment to the community while achieving academic excellence.  
￼ 
Bob, a member of my outreach team, attended the Sunrise Domestic Violence and Pasco County Housing Authority’s annual luncheon to discuss efforts to ensure federal dollars are used to ensure housing opportunities for victims of domestic violence.

  Hi, 
In August of 2015, Coloradans across the southwest part of our state experienced both shock and anger as the Animas River turned yellow, the result of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accidentally releasing millions of gallons of toxic mining waste from the abandoned Gold King Mine. The impact of this spill was widespread downstream. The EPA promised to make the individuals, businesses and communities impacted by the spill whole, and I have continued to work to ensure the agency fulfills this promise. 
The Gold King Mine spill was a catastrophic reminder of the risks that abandoned mines pose across the entire western United States. Across the West, there are more than 50,000 mines that were abandoned before the era of modern regulations, 23,000 of which are located in Colorado. Much like the Gold King Mine, many of these abandoned mines were never sufficiently cleaned-up, have no current responsible party, and release pollution into surrounding watersheds.
Since these abandoned sites were opened long before the enactment of the nation’s environmental and land management laws and have no existing responsible party, it has fallen to the federal government to perform remediation. In 1997, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service (FS) started to remediate the abandoned mines located on federal lands, often in conjunction with state and local municipalities. While progress has been made, a tremendous amount of work remains and the price tag to remediate every abandoned mine in the U.S. is estimated to be a whopping $50 billion. Federal agencies estimate that $80-85 million is already spent annually on mine remediation, so if this process continues as is, it will not just be slow, it will also be an extraordinary burden at the federal, state and local levels for years to come. 
If we have learned anything from the Gold King Mine spill, it is that the status quo is unacceptable when it comes to cleaning-up abandoned mine sites. There are many Good Samaritan Groups – sportsmen’s and environment groups, as well as mining organizations – that have the technical expertise, financial ability, and desire to conduct successful remediation at abandoned mines. Unfortunately, Good Samaritan groups are often discouraged from taking on these important projects because of federal clean water and liability regulations.
Abandoned mines threaten water quality and the environment in Colorado, so Senator Cory Gardner and I have been working for several years to develop legislation that would create a Good Samaritan pilot project to remove hurdles that have prevented Good Samaritan groups from taking on abandoned mine remediation projects. We introduced the latest version of the bill, the Good Samaritan Remediation of Orphan Hardrock Mines Act of 2018 (H.R. 7226), on December 6, 2018. This bill would authorize the EPA to establish a 7-year Good Samaritan pilot program, under which the EPA will administer up to 15 Good Samaritan permits to carry out projects to remediate historic mine residue at orphan mine sites. 
H.R. 7226 includes strong permitting requirements to ensure potential Good Samaritan groups have the expertise and financial ability needed to responsibly take on remediation projects. Additionally, before any application can be granted, the Good Samaritan group must make earnest efforts to identify if there are existing responsible parties for the mine, and if one is identified, the permit would be denied. The Good Samaritan group must also provide detailed plans for the project, including a work schedule, a health and safety plan and a specific contingency plan if downstream waters are impacted by an unplanned discharge of hazardous substances. Should the Good Samaritan group break any of the terms of its permit, it will face all liability under current law.
I am confident in the progress that has been made towards finding a solution to help cleanup abandoned mines across the West and look forward to continued work on this bill in the 116th Congress. 
Sincerely, 
￼

Remembering George H.W. Bush  
Cindy and I had the honor of attending the state funeral to celebrate the life and legacy of former President George H.W. Bush at the Washington National Cathedral earlier this month.   
President Bush was an example of servant leadership that we can all learn from. He was a veteran, a diplomat, an Intelligence Chief, a Vice President and a President. In all of these roles, he served with honor and virtue. 
The service for our former president was very touching. I particularly enjoyed George W. Bush's recollection of his father and his wonderful life. I am so grateful for George H.W. Bush's commitment to our American values. He will certainly be missed. 
 

Celebrating the Christmas Spirit at 'Shop With a Cop'  
￼ 
It’s always great to see the wonderful things happening in our community. Christmas is a time of giving -- and this month, I was glad to have been invited to join an event celebrating the the spirit of generosity in Pennsylvania's 16th District.  
Year after year, our local police officers have found a way to give back to needy children in our community through the ""Shop with a Cop"" event. Our police officers shop with these kids as their ""personal assistants"" to help them buy presents for their families, friends and sometimes even themselves.   
Thank you to Trinity Lutheran Church for organizing this event and thank you to the Lancaster County police officers for reminding us the reason for the season.  
And a thank you to all our law enforcement officers for working so hard to keep us safe.   
 

Prioritizing Pennsylvania Farmers  
Our district is the largest agricultural district in the state -- and that means one of my biggest duties in Congress is to fight for our farmers. On Wednesday, the House passed the 2018 Farm Bill, which will help support our farmers who feed America. 
Agriculture is our state's No. 1 industry and it's especially vital for our district. The agriculture industry supports more than 93,000 jobs in our district and contributes more than $16 billion to Pennsylvania's economy.  
Our farmers have fallen on hard times though -- and their incomes are currently at a 12-year low. This year's Farm Bill will help these struggling farmers get through tough times.  
Our district came away with some wins in the Farm Bill. We were able to reduce premiums on our dairy farmers' milk and my request of $75 million to combat the spotted lanternfly -- an invasive species threatening our local crops -- was also included in the final bill. 
Unfortunately, the bill which came back from the Senate eliminated key reforms to our SNAP programs. I hope we will reconsider these ideas. Those are reforms to improve people’s lives and help connect them to good-paying jobs – and those are reforms which will still be needed in the future.

HEADING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DESK

This week, the United States Senate unanimously passed my legislation to protect American veterans from military service deposit errors. It is now on the way to President Trump to be signed into law.  

My legislation, the Correcting Miscalculations in Veterans' Pensions Act, authorizes federal agencies that make a mistake in calculating military service deposits and pensions to pay the incorrectly accrued interest on behalf of veteran employees.

Currently, veterans working at a federal agency are required to pay a military service deposit in order to receive their military service pension while working for the federal agency. Due to a misclassification in the type of the employee’s status, the federal agency will therefore charge different interest rates on those military service deposits, often leading to miscalculations. 

Once the federal agency becomes aware of the miscalculation, they will contact the veteran and notify them of the need to pay back the balance with accrued interest. In some cases, I heard from veterans that the interest can be tens of thousands of dollars that the veteran would be required to pay. 

Without this legislation, there is no recourse for veterans to mediate that payment and there is no authority for the federal agency to wipe away the incorrectly accrued interest.

My legislation authorizes agencies that make a mistake in calculating military service deposits and pensions to pay the incorrectly accrued interest on behalf of the veterans.

Our veterans deserve better and I am thrilled this legislation is heading to President Trump to be signed into law. 

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CXC

Monday, December 10, 2018:  After unexpectedly being out of session last week due to the death of our 41st President, George H. W. Bush, I arrived back in Washington last night and this morning my first meeting is our weekly staff briefing.  As I reported a few weeks ago, we are in the process of moving offices which is no easy task.  Boxes are everywhere, pictures still need to be hung and, plain and simple, the place is a mess.  However, we are happy with our new location as we are in a bigger office that is closer to the House Chamber as well as our committee meeting rooms, and, most importantly to me, closer to the member’s gym.  We also welcome a new staff member to our team today as Jay Gulshen takes over the important role of our Legislative Health Care Assistant.  Jay brings a wealth of experience as he previously served on the Energy and Commerce (E&C) Health Subcommittee that I am a member of.  After our staff meeting, I head to the House Chamber where I deliver a series of tributes including one to Mr. Bill Brown of Brunswick who recently celebrated his 100th birthday.  I also recognized one of my former pharmacy professors who recently passed, Dr. Henry Cobb, Officer John White, one of the first African American police officers in the City of Savannah and crew members of the Brunswick bar pilots who recently helped rescue a drowning man near the St. Simons Pier.  A link to these tributes can be found here, here and here.  Later in the afternoon, I head to our weekly Whip Team meeting where we hear from the Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX), about the conference report on the Farm Bill that we will be voting on later this week.  For the past six months, I have been lobbying Chairman Conaway as well as Appropriations Committee members and leadership for disaster funds for our blueberry farmers who have suffered two straight years of devastating losses due to late freezes.  Afterwards, I head to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the week. 
Tuesday, December 11, 2018:  This morning we have a Doctor’s Caucus meeting where we hear from representatives from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) to gain their perspective on proposals to lower prescription drug prices.  Next, I head to our weekly GOP Conference before heading to an E&C Environment Subcommittee hearing on “21st Century Transportation Fuels.”  A link to my questions can be found here.  Afterwards, I head to the Red Cross Holiday Mail for Heroes Card Signing where I have the opportunity to sign and send out holiday cards to our troops serving overseas. 
￼
Rep. Carter writing letters with American Red Cross Holiday Mail for Heroes
Next, I head to an E&C Health Subcommittee hearing on “Implementing the 21st Century Cures Act” as we hear from the office of the National Coordinator.  A link to my questions can be found here.  Afterwards, I head to a meeting with representatives from Microsoft to learn how artificial intelligence can be used to solve global challenges and then head to the House Chamber where I speak on legislation from the E&C Committee that is being considered today.  Next, I head back to my office where I have an on camera interview with Gray TV to discuss the Farm Bill before having a phone interview with WTOC TV in Savannah to discuss offshore energy exploration followed by another phone interview with Southeast AgNet to discuss the Farm bill.  After a meeting with my good friend, John McCallum, who is up visiting from St. Simons Island, I head to the House Chamber for our first and only vote series of the day and then head back to my office to record a video.  
Wednesday, December 12, 2018:  After an early morning meeting with Jay Greissing with BioMarin Pharmaceuticals, I head to an E&C Oversight and Investigations (O&I) hearing on “Examining the Availability of SAFE kits at Hospitals in the United States.”  A link to my questions can be found here.  Afterwards, I have an on camera interview with WSB TV in Atlanta to discuss the hearing before heading to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the day.  Later, I head back to my office where I have a meeting with John O’Brien with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to discuss priorities for Medicare Parts B and D.  John is one of the many fine staff members at HHS who, under the leadership of HHS Secretary Alex Azar, is working hard to bring about positive changes to our health care system particularly in the area of prescription drug pricing.

Afterwards, I head back to the House Chamber for our second vote series of the day and then return to my office for a meeting with Endeavors, a company that provides disaster case management and emergency services.
￼
Rep. Carter meeting with Endeavors
My final event of the day is a tele town hall meeting where we hear from constituents throughout the district.
Thursday, December 13, 2018:  I begin this morning with a classified member’s only briefing where we hear from Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the ongoing situation in Yemen.  Afterwards, I head to an E&C Health Subcommittee member-CDC roundtable on Acute Flaccid Myelitis (AFM), a rare, but serious condition affecting the nervous system, especially in children.  Next, I head to the House Chamber for our first and only vote series of the day before returning to my office for a meeting with my good friend, Becky Ryles with the National Association of Community Health Centers, a group that plays a vital role in providing care for underserved populations across the country.
￼
Rep. Carter meeting with the National Association of Community Health Centers
Next, I head to the airport for my return trip home and, once I’ve landed head straight to Richmond Hill for a meeting with the Development Authority of Bryan County.
Friday, December 14, 2018:  I’m on St. Simons Island this morning as I take part in the Brunswick-Golden Isles Chamber of Commerce Grits and Issues breakfast and answer questions from this great group of community leaders.
￼
Rep. Carter speaking at the Brunswick-Golden Isles Chamber of Commerce Grits & Issues Breakfast
This year’s event will be the last for long time BGI COC Executive Director Woody Woodside, who will be retiring next spring and will be dearly missed.  Afterwards, I head to Ludowici in Long County where I meet with Sherriff Craig Nobles before heading to City Hall where I present a copy of the tribute that I entered into the House journal in memory of Ludowici Police Chief Frank McClelland to his wife Cindy and other family members.  Chief McClelland, a stalwart of the community, was killed in the line of duty and is deeply missed.  Next, I head to our Savannah district office where I meet with Charlie Loomis regarding barriers for veterans to use their earned education benefits to pay for flight training.  Afterwards, I have a delightful visit with my good friend, Donna Camacho with the Alzheimer’s Association before meeting with Alicia Roberts from Hinesville to discuss women’s heart disease and the importance of cardiac rehab and heart health prevention.

My bipartisan bill to prevent maternal deaths passes Congress, heads to president's desk
￼
I had the privilege of testifying on the U.S. House
floor this week in support of my bill to make 
pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum safer for all moms.
Click here to learn how we are combating the rise of maternal
mortality.

My bipartisan bill to prevent maternal deaths passed out of Congress and is now heading to the president's desk to be signed into law. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-CO) joined me in this effort, which marks the strongest step Congress has taken to date to reverse the growing maternal mortality rate in the U.S. H.R. 1318, the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act, would establish and support state Maternal Mortality Review Committees to review every pregnancy-related or pregnancy-associated death, and based on those findings, develop recommendations for how to prevent future mothers’ deaths. 

As a mom and a lawmaker, this is personal to me, and it was an honor to join with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to lead this life-saving measure successfully through the House. We must improve our understanding of why mothers are dying in pregnancy, during childbirth and postpartum so we can then unleash every possible resource to protect women in this critical season of life. 

The rise of maternal mortality in the U.S.:
• The U.S. has the highest rate of maternal mortality in the developed world, and the rate continues to rise. Between 700-900 women die in the U.S. every year from pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated deaths.
• According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 60% of maternal deaths are preventable.

ACE Kids Act, my bill that improves care for low-income, medically-complex kids, passes U.S. House
￼
I spoke in support of the ACE Kids Act on the House floor
this week. This bill ensures that medically-complex kids of 
families who rely on Medicaid won't be restricted from
accessing life-saving care simply because of their
zip code. You can watch my full remarks here.
We took an important step Tuesday by passing my bill, the ACE Kids Act, which removes barriers families face when trying to get care for their medically-complex children.   I’ve been in the NICU and met families who were faced with the reality of having a sick child, and also have hit hard times economically. I can put too many faces and names to the reality that little kiddos often can’t get the care they need. With passage of this bill, we are doing right by our kids – regardless of their zip codes, they’ll be able to get specialized medical treatment that can often be life-saving.   Importance of improving care for low-income, medically-complex children:  • One in 25 children in the U.S. is “medically complex” with diagnoses like cancer, congenital heart disease, Down syndrome, or others that require consistent care and medical expertise. Of the several million medically-complex children, roughly two million rely on Medicaid. Children who have complex medical conditions represent a small percentage of kids in Medicaid, but account for a large portion of the costs.   • In order to enhance the critical care for these two million children, the ACE Kids Act creates networks anchored by children’s hospitals to help coordinate care. States would choose to opt into this network, allowing families to seamlessly pursue the best doctors and facilities — even if it takes them to another state, which Medicaid often wouldn’t allow. Passage of this bill works to remove that barrier so all kids can receive the treatment they need.

Continuing Our Work in Washington 
Dear Friend:
I appreciate you taking the time to read this brief update. It remains an honor for me to serve as your United States Representative in Washington, D.C.  We spent another busy week back in our nation’s capital and the most significant action of the week was, unfortunately, one I was unable to support. Specifically, on Wednesday, the House gave final approval to the once-every-five-year reauthorization of the “Farm Bill.” This bill includes 12 titles covering a wide array of agricultural issues, but the most important element is the section that covers the “SNAP” program, otherwise known as food stamps. This program represents about 80% of all spending within the Farm Bill.  I voted for the initial version of this bill, which passed the House of Representatives back in June, largely because it included some significant and important reforms to the food stamp program. Specifically, it required able-bodied, working-aged individuals who are not the primary caregiver for minor dependent children, either to find some work (part-time or full-time), participate in a job training program, or volunteer with an approved non-profit to remain eligible for SNAP assistance. Requiring work or job training is the best way to lift someone out of poverty and, more importantly, it provides them with the dignity and improved self-esteem that comes from work and financial independence.  When the bill returned to the House from the Senate, however, these reasonable work requirement provisions were gone and without these important reforms, I had to withdraw my support for the bill.  The other big topic of discussion right now, of course, is the status of the remaining appropriation bills we need to pass. Currently, about 25% of the federal government is operating on a Continuing Resolution, which will expire on December 21st. As most of you probably know from the news, the President and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate met to discuss finding a compromise agreement to finish the appropriations process. The primary sticking point is the amount to appropriate to the Department of Homeland Security to construct additional fencing and other security measures on our southern border. The President is asking Congress for about $5 billion and my Democratic colleagues are currently only willing to fund this program with about $1.6 billion. At present, it appears that no agreement is in sight, so I expect that we will now return to Washington next week to see if we can reach an agreement and vote on keeping these parts of the government open before the current continuing resolution expires. I am sure I will have more to say about this in next week’s message to you.  I also want to note that I participated in an important hearing held by the House Veterans' Affairs Committee on Wednesday. The hearing was to evaluate the VA’s readiness to implement the Veteran’s Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. The hearing’s focus was on whether the Secretary was prepared to certify in January 2019 that VA’s IT systems and resources were ready to implement the act by its February 2019 effective date. The bill’s focus is on implementing an improved appeals process for veterans filing claims for benefits. VA stated that it was confident the implementation will occur on schedule and that the reformed processes would go live February 2019. The VA’s optimism was due to its success with its pilot programs, which have reduced appeals processing times from the current 3-7 years to an average of about 120 days to one year. The VA stated it is prepared to move from the pilot programs to full implementation by February of next year. Clearly, this is very good news for our veterans.  At the end of the hearing, the Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman, Rep. Phil Roe, and the Acting Ranking Member, Rep. Mark Takano, made a few comments on my impending departure from the Committee and the U.S. House of Representatives. I have included those clips below.

Dear Friend,  American security is bigger than petty politics. In a televised Oval Office meeting with President Trump this week, both Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer admitted that the country needs stronger border security. So why are they fighting him on one-tenth of one-percent of government spending for border security? Terrorists, drug smugglers, human traffickers, and criminal gang members don’t target their victims based on political party...KEEP READING HERE


WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH

￼
THANK YOU to everyone who came out to support our local veterans in Mountain Grove. The snow postponed the original event on Veterans Day, but 1,500 people showed up this Friday to show their appreciation! It was an amazing celebration put on by the students of Mountain Grove, and we broke ground on the new Wright County Veterans Memorial Wall.  
￼  This week I met with representatives from regional hospitals to discuss ways we can increase the quality of care for rural patients. One way is the bill I introduced this week that allows doctors to spend more time with their patients and less time filling out paperwork for Washington bureaucrats.

THIS WEEK IN DC
￼

I recommended southeast Missouri native R.D. James to head the Army Corps of Engineers because as a farmer himself, he understands that when Washington overreaches it causes headaches for farmers across the country. I was proud to stand with him this week as he issued a new definition of ""Waters of the United States"" to reclaim private water and private property rights for Missourians.

￼

Missouri taxpayers paying the already wealthy to own electric vehicles isn't right and isn't fair. This week I introduced the Fairness for Every Driver Act to end this wasteful tax subsidy and to make sure rural America isn't footing the bill for the electric vehicles the wealthy can already afford without a government handout.

￼
Now's your chance to tell Congress - what are YOUR priorities for 2019?

Mueller Rejects Flynn’s Attempt to Portray Himself as Victim of the F.B.I.
By Adam Goldman, The New York Times
￼
WASHINGTON — The special counsel’s office rejected on Friday a suggestion from Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, that he had been tricked into lying last year to F.B.I. agents investigating Russia’s election interference and ties to Trump associates.
Prosecutors laid out a pattern of lies by Mr. Flynn to Vice President Mike Pence, senior White House aides, federal investigators and the news media in the weeks before and after the presidential inauguration as he scrambled to obscure the truth about his communications during the presidential transition with Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States at the time.
Neither his lawyers nor Mr. Flynn, the former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, have explained why he lied to the F.B.I., a felony that he pleaded guilty to a year ago. But in a memo this week seeking leniency, his lawyers revealed details from the interview that stoked an unfounded theory that Mr. Flynn’s demeanor during questioning indicated that he did not understand that he was being formally investigated. They also blamed the F.B.I. for not informing Mr. Flynn ahead of time that lying to agents is illegal — an argument that prosecutors repudiated. 
“A sitting national security adviser, former head of an intelligence agency, retired lieutenant general and 33-year veteran of the armed forces knows he should not lie to federal agents,” prosecutors for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, wrote in court papers. “He does not need to be warned it is a crime to lie to federal agents to know the importance of telling them the truth.”

How WhatsApp Fuels Fake News and Violence in India
￼
By the time police arrived in the hamlet of Rainpada on July 1, 2018, the village council office was the scene of a massacre.
By Timothy McLaughlin, Wired
The bright blue shutters on the windows were splintered and the door was kicked in. Inside, files were strewn across the floor and the light green walls were splashed with blood. Five men were dead, beaten to death with fists, feet, sticks, and office furniture wielded by a raging mob. 
The dead men—four in their late forties and one whose age remains unknown—had arrived in Rainpada earlier that day, at around 9 am, on a bus from Solapur, some 300 miles south, to attend a Sunday market. According to their families and police, all of them were members of a Nath Panthi Davari Gosavi tribe, a nomadic group that roams India’s western Maharashtra state, surviving mostly on alms. The men sat under a tree not far from where they had gotten off the bus and, as they ate, handed a biscuit to a young girl. 
Six weeks later, Hemant Patil, the assistant police inspector for Dhule district, in which Rainpada is located, explains how this seemingly innocuous gesture had enormous consequences. For about a week before the men arrived, rumors circulated on the messaging system WhatsApp warning of bands of kidnappers roving the area and infiltrating villages to snatch young children. In one particularly grim version of the rumor, the children’s organs—kidneys and hearts—were harvested and sold.

Congress sends Trump bill to make lawmakers liable for harassment settlements
By Elise Viebeck, The Washington Post
Congress backed legislation on Thursday that would make lawmakers financially liable for sexual harassment settlements and eliminate unnecessary barriers to reporting workplace misconduct on Capitol Hill. 
The swift passage of a compromise bill by the House and Senate revealed overwhelming bipartisan support for changing policies on Capitol Hill in response to the #MeToo movement after nearly seven months of negotiations. Last fall, Congress’s system for addressing lawmaker misconduct, including employee settlements funded by taxpayers, was criticized as unfairly protective of members of Congress over their aides. 
The bill — passed less than 24 hours after a deal was announced — now goes to the White House for President Trump’s signature.

Wisconsin’s Scott Walker Signs Bills Stripping Powers From Incoming Governor
By Mitch Smith and Monica Davey, The New York Times
FOX CROSSING, Wis. — Gov. Scott Walker made a national name for himself in the Republican Party by cutting the power of public sector unions eight years ago, only weeks after he swept into office in Wisconsin. On Friday, he signed legislation to cut the power of the Democrat who defeated him, a final act of a tumultuous tenure that moved Wisconsin firmly to the right. 
The response from Democrats was swift and furious. 
Tony Evers, the Democrat who beat Mr. Walker in a hard-fought election last month, said the departing governor “chose to ignore and override the will of the people.” Liberal groups, including one led by Eric H. Holder Jr., a former United States attorney general, pledged to sue. Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin sent her Democratic supporters an email calling the move “a craven partisan attack on democracy” and soliciting donations to her “Vote ’Em Out Fund.” 
The tactic by Mr. Walker and his allies came as part of an increasingly fractious struggle over power in the states, following a model set in North Carolina, where Republicans in 2016 tried to restrict the power of the governor after a Democrat was elected.

Dear Friends, 
This week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 6118, which I authored, directing the Department of Interior to designate one city per year as a nationally recognized “American World War II City.”  Additionally, the U.S. House passed the conference report to accompany H.R. 2 – Agriculture Improvement Act sending the five-year Farm Bill to the President’s desk for his signature. 
HOUSE PASSES ROUZER BILL TO DESIGNATE AMERICAN WWII CITY 
H.R. 6118 directs the Secretary of the Interior to designate at least one city in the United States each year with this illustrious title.  These cities will be designated based on their significant contributions to the war effort and their work preserving the history of WWII. 
Due to the hard work and dedication of Wilmington native Captain Wilbur D. Jones, Jr., USNR (Ret.), who is a distinguished author and veteran active in the community, the idea of honoring Wilmington as the Nation’s first World War II City is one step closer to being achieved.  Our state and country is fortunate to have Captain Wilbur D. Jones, Jr. advocating to recognize Wilmington and other cities for their significant contributions during World War II.  As many from the Greatest Generation know, the City of Wilmington was a major contributor to a nationwide effort during World War II to assist with the many components of war production such as defense manufacturing, the production of food and consumer items, and much more.  Passage of this bill brings Wilmington one step closer to receiving the recognition it so rightfully deserves. 
￼  Congressman Rouzer and Captain Wilbur D. Jones after a House Committee on Natural Resources hearing examining H.R. 6118. 
HOUSE PASSES FARM BILL CONFERENCE REPORT, HEADS TO POTUS FOR SIGNATURE
The agriculture industry contributes $87 billion to North Carolina’s economy making it the state's number one industry employing 17 percent of the state's workforce.  Passage of the 2018 Farm Bill is critically important to America’s farm families, especially those in eastern North Carolina where Hurricane Florence dealt a devastating blow.  The 2018 Farm Bill conference report is the result of an agreement reached between both chambers of Congress that will strengthen the farm safety net, incentivize work and make critical investments to support rural communities, farm families, and American consumers. 
I am very pleased that we were able to reach a compromise agreement with the Senate that delivers a stronger safety net for North Carolina's farm families.  In addition to enhancing crop insurance and other farm programs, the conference agreement increases the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s capacity to combat the opioid crisis, expands quality broadband access, and makes significant investments in animal disease preparedness critically important to North Carolina and the nation.  The agreement also makes more than 30 improvements to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) while enabling additional immediate improvements to be made by the Administration. 
￼ 
As our state continues to recover from Hurricane Florence, our four offices in Bolivia, Wilmington, Four Oaks and Washington, D.C. stand ready to assist you.  Please call us if you have any questions or concerns.  You can reach our Bolivia office by calling (910) 253-6111; our Wilmington office at (910) 395-0202; our Four Oaks office at (919) 938-3040 and Washington, D.C. office at (202) 225-2731.

Dear Lindsey, 
The past couple of weeks have proven to be very busy, but I wanted to take the time to give you all an update on the recent work in Washington, D.C. and the 15th District of Texas. 
It is an honor to serve as your congressman.
Recently, I announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue approved a Secretarial disaster designation for the following counties in the 15th District of Texas: Duval, primary; Brooks, contiguous; Jim Hogg, contiguous; and Live Oak, contiguous. With this designation, those affected qualify to be considered for Farm Service Agency (FSA) loans.
The farming and agriculture industries in the 15th District of Texas are key components of our region’s economic success. I thank Secretary Purdue for making this assistance available to those who incurred losses from this summer’s flooding. I encourage all eligible applicants to apply for these funds as we continue to rebuild and strengthen Texas agriculture.
Prospective applicants can contact their respective FSA offices by clicking here. 
For more information, visit FSA’s informational website by clicking here. Watch more by clicking the picture below.
￼ 
On Saturday, December 1, 2018, I had the honor of joining an official congressional delegation (pictured below) to attend the inauguration of Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador in Mexico City, Mexico. This was a new day, and a new beginning, for Mexico and the entire Western Hemisphere. I congratulate President López Obrador and look forward to working with him to chart a new path forward in U.S. – Mexico relations. Central and South Texans can expect both governments to take concrete steps to increase border security, stabilize Central America, shorten wait times at our international bridges, raise food safety standards, reduce non-tariff trade barriers, improve supply chain security, and lower costs for consumers while ensuring trade that is equitable and just for all North Americans.
￼ 
On Monday, December 3, 2018, I had the honor of participating in the arrival ceremony of the late former President George H.W. Bush in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. President Bush was a true American statesman. I was graciously humbled to partake in the celebration of this patriot’s legacy and honor a life of public service. As a public servant and a decorated service member, President Bush, Sr. set a high bar for decency and civility. May he soon reunite with his friends; loved ones; and his beloved wife, Barbara. 
￼ 
On Tuesday, December 4, 2018, I announced that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has issued a proposed rule that lowers prescription drug costs and increases transparency surrounding Medicare Parts C and D. In May 2018, I joined Congressman Doug Collins (GA-09) to introduce the bipartisan H.R. 5958, the PHAIR Pricing Act of 2018, to lower drug costs to Medicare recipients at the point of sale. The new rule includes language from this bill. Our prescription drug system is in dire need of reform - I commend the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for taking this important step.
￼ 
On Thursday, December 6, 2018, I joined Congressman Will Hurd (TX-23) and Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) to introduce the Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains Act of 2018, a bill to help local jurisdictions improve the recording and reporting of missing persons and unidentified remains found in South Texas. 
Our nation has a chance to put more resources into helping identify the remains of missing persons, and to bring closure to families who know not whether to grieve, or continue the search. This piece of legislation would provide much-needed resources directed at finding answers for families across the U.S. Southwest Border. Passing this bill will help our ranchers and farmers, our counties, and our local sheriffs. I thank Congressman Hurd and Senators Cornyn and Cruz for coming together to craft this bipartisan and bicameral piece of legislation. Read more by clicking here. 
My opposition to funding a physical barrier along the U.S.-Mexico Border remains firm. Recently, I joined Congressman Henry Cuellar in a letter to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, urging the senator to not lose face in the Senate. On Friday, December 7, 2018, I joined Congressman Filemon Vela to ask the same of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. We need all hands on deck for this. No more funding than what has already been agreed to – plain and simple. Read more by clicking here. 
On Tuesday, December 11, 2018, I issued the following statement after learning of the death of deported Vietnam War Army Veteran, Carlos Torres. 
“Carlos Torres served this country, and in return, this country failed him. After serving in the U.S. Army, on the front lines in the Vietnam War, Mr. Torres was denied a path to citizenship and deported. He fought for a home that turned him away, and in the end, he never saw that home again. There is no excuse for this. No military service member should die in vain. The Repatriate Our Patriots Act must be enacted into law so that this never happens again.” 
Prior to deportation, Mr. Torres resided in the Rio Grande Valley. In 2017, Congressman Gonzalez introduced H.R. 3429, the Repatriate Our Patriots Act, that would create a pathway to citizenship for deported veterans who held a clean record prior to military service. 
It is my honor to announce Alaina Garza (pictured below) as the winner of the 2018 Congressional App Challenge with her submission – Brain Tame. Ms. Garza, inspired by her own struggle with anxiety, created the application to help users combat stress through a series of questions and visual catharsis. “I want users to live life stress free,” Ms. Garza said. The Elsa, Texas native, 17, is a student at South Texas High School for Health Professions in Mercedes, Texas. After high school, she plans on attending college and pursuing a major in English with a minor in psychology. I thank Alaina for finding ways to utilize technology to help her peers through hard times and congratulate her on winning this year’s App Challenge! Way to go, Alaina!

HAPPENING IN THE HOUSE
This week, the House passed the 2018 Farm Bill. The bill maintains several vital provisions to provide crop insurance, manage risk, increase loan rates, and cut burdensome red tape for our farmers and ranchers. Most importantly, the Farm Bill brings reassurance in times of need to the 2.1 million American farms that feed our country and the world. For Oklahoma’s farmers and ranchers, I am glad to see provisions that will help rural areas, such as improving rural broadband delivery and increasing funding for rural health projects that aim to combat the opioid epidemic. I was proud to support the passage of the Farm Bill on the House floor.
However, I am disappointed that Congress did not do more to reform the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by implementing commonsense work requirements. At a time when the job market has 7.1 million openings, there is no better time than now for Americans to find meaningful work. Read more via the McCarville Report here.
The House also considered and passed several bills out of the committee I sit on, the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The IMPROVE Act (H.R. 7217) provides states with the option under Medicaid of providing coordinated care for children with complex medical conditions through a health home. The IMPROVE Act also funds the Money Follows the Program, which is a Medicaid program to help individuals with disabilities transition from an institutional care setting back into their community. Additionally, we passed the Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2018 (S. 2465), the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act of 2018 (S. 3029), and the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2018 (H.R. 1318).
 GOVERNMENT FUNDING A number of government agencies will run out of funding on December 21st, unless Congress can reach an agreement. The president has requested $5 billion in border security for our southern border, but it isn’t clear if that will pass both chambers of Congress. If Congress does not reach an agreement before Friday, there will be a partial government shutdown.
Congress has already passed a number of funding bills, so the entire government will not shutdown. Roughly 75% of the government has already been funded. Left unfunded are the programs within Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury, United States Postal Service, Department of Homeland Security, Department of the Interior, EPA, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Transportation. If you have questions about how a partial shutdown might impact you, please reach out to one of my offices. 
PORT OF MUSKOGEE RECEIVES GRANT It’s great to see the Port of Muskogee receive a BUILD Grant to bring modern rail access for manifest and unit train service to the Port. A part of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System (MKARNS), the Port of Muskogee is a major driver of industrial and economic development in Muskogee and across the state of Oklahoma. I am proud to have worked alongside Senator Jim Inhofe to ensure the Port receives the assistance it needs to continue bringing quality jobs and new industry to the area.

INTERN SPOTLIGHT Sarah Ferrell from Tahlequah leaves our Washington, D.C. office this week after serving as an intern during the fall semester. She’s headed back to Northeastern State University to finish up her degree in health care administration and business administration. A big thank you to Sarah for all of her help this semester!  
￼
Are you interested in a congressional internship? My Washington, D.C. office is currently accepting applications for the spring 2019 semester. Interns will have the opportunity to see the inner workings of Congress firsthand, assist legislative staff in policy research, work alongside my team to provide constituent services to Oklahomans in the Second District, and much more. For more information, contact my D.C. office at 202-225-2701 and ask to speak with the intern coordinator. Interested applicants can apply on my website at this link. 
WOTUS REPLACEMENT RULE The Waters of the United States (WOTUS) Rule has been detrimental to our country’s farmers and ranchers since the day it was put in place by the Obama Administration. The federal government has no business regulating every creek, ditch, and stream. This proposed replacement rule from the Trump Administration gives farmers, ranchers, and small business owners the power to take care of their backyards without the unnecessary red tape they face now. I applaud the Trump Administration for the proposed rule. Read more on the Western Caucus’s website here.
 WEEKLY WRAP-UP Above all, our country’s number one priority should be the safety and security of Americans. As your representative, I do not take lightly the responsibility to ensure our national security is strong. Watch the weekly wrap-up on my Facebook or YouTube page.

The Washington Rundown 
TODAY, December 15, is the deadline to enroll in affordable, quality health insurance for 2019 under the Affordable Care Act.  North Carolinians seeking health insurance for themselves or their families are encouraged to visit HealthCare.Gov to compare plans and benefits, find the best prices, and sign up for coverage.  Despite a looming partial government shutdown, Republican House leadership has delayed a potential vote on a funding bill until the end of next week.  Lawmakers will return to Washington on Wednesday facing an end-of-the-week deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown, while they work to wrap up remaining legislative business to close out the 115th Congress.  Should Congress fail to reach an agreement by midnight on December 21, operations for roughly 25 percent of the government will shut down.  President Trump's demand for $5 billion to fund his border wall is still the sticking point for an agreement to keep the entire government open.  At the same time President Trump is arguing for the border wall, a 7-year-old girl from Guatemala died from dehydration and shock while in U.S. Border Patrol Custody last week. The deadline for North Carolinians who suffered damage during Hurricane Florence to apply for federal help has now been extended to Wednesday, December 19.  Individuals and businesses with uninsured losses from Hurricane Florence can register with FEMA online at DisasterAssistance.gov OR by calling the disaster assistance helpline at 1-800-621-3362 from 7am to 11pm ET. 
Absentee Ballot Fraud Probe Continues in NC's 9th District 
The North Carolina General Assembly on Wednesday approved a bill requiring new primary elections if the State Board of Elections calls for a new general election.  This bill follows allegations of absentee ballot fraud in North Carolina's Ninth Congressional District that have called the results of that race into question.   
Congressman Butterfield was joined by Reps. David Price (NC-04) and Alma Adams (NC-12) to release the following statement on the NC-09 developments: 

￼
Remember: Today is the Deadline to Enroll in 2019 Health Coverage 
The deadline to enroll in health coverage is today, December 15 – if you, your family, or someone you know needs health insurance for 2019, now is the time to act. 
Visit HealthCare.gov today to create an account and enroll in 2019 coverage.

In The News 
The News & Observer: Everyone is readying for new election in NC’s 9th, but parties are sparring over primary  North Carolina’s state board of elections hasn’t yet ordered a new election in the state’s disputed 9th Congressional District, but Republicans and Democrats are already fighting over the rules governing a new vote. [...]
Said Price, Rep. G.K. Butterfield of Wilson, and Rep. Alma Adams of Charlotte issued a joint statement: “The Republican super majority in the General Assembly must understand that changing the law after the election, to require a new primary, is likely unconstitutional. This newly enacted legislation discredits North Carolina once again in the eyes of the Nation.” 
Atlanta Daily World: Sickle Cell Treatment Act of 2018 Passed in Congress, Now Awaits President’s Signature  On December 10, 2018, S.2465 – The Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2018  – was passed by the Congress and now moves forward for the President to sign into law. [...] Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, Inc. thanks Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) and Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) for their leadership and for introducing the bill on February 28, 2018, and we thank the bill’s co-sponsors Senator Doug Jones (D-AL), Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). SCDAA also thanks Congressman Danny Davis (D-IL), a long-time champion for the sickle cell community; Congressman Michael Burgess (R-TX); and Congressman G.K. Butterfield (D-NC) for supporting this bill in the U.S. House of Representatives. In addition, we are grateful to the members of the Sickle Cell Caucus and to our key partners such as theAmerican Society of Hematology(ASH), Sick Cells,Sickle Cell 101, theSickleCellForum,#BoldLipsforSickleCell and theEveryLife Foundation.

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
There is no doubt that global climate change is real and poses a growing threat to our planet, our country, our Great Lakes and Wisconsin. 
This summer, our southwestern counties faced devastating flooding, and severe rainstorms like the ones experienced this year are only predicted to happen more frequently in Wisconsin as climate change intensifies.  
Recently, an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report concluded that unless the current path of climate change is slowed, massive impacts - such as limited fresh water availability, sea-ice free Arctic summers, mass die-offs of coral reefs, and intense and unprecedented heat waves - will become reality as soon as 2040. 
The National Climate Assessment published this year echoes this alarming report, demonstrating evidence that the U.S. is already feeling the effects of climate change - concluding that our nation will suffer thousands of deaths and over $500 billion per year in crop damage, lost labor, and extreme weather damages by 2100. 
It is clear the consequences of climate change cannot be ignored. We have a moral obligation to accept these recent findings, take immediate steps to address the challenge of climate change and reaffirm our commitment to future generations to pass on a world better than we found it. 
That is why I joined my colleagues in sponsoring a Senate Resolution calling for bold action to combat climate change. 
Here in Wisconsin, climate change is already affecting both the Great Lakes ecosystem and our economy. Climate change has expanded the range of invasive species like Asian carp and zebra mussels, which pose a major threat to the ecology and economy of the Great Lakes by devastating the food chain and causing major damage to our ports, pipes and water infrastructure. With our natural resources supporting over $5 billion of activity in Wisconsin’s economy alone, acting now to combat climate change is not only an environmental imperative - it is also an economic necessity.
I refuse to sit on the sidelines, and it’s now up to all of us to embrace the moral responsibility and proud Wisconsin tradition of conservation we all share. While the threat of climate change may be daunting, we cannot let this challenge overwhelm us into inaction. Doing nothing is simply not an option and the longer we wait, the more costly climate change will be. 
I’m not giving up, so I hope you will join me in calling for bold action to combat climate change. Let’s continue our work together to confront this challenge and keep our promise to leave the next generation a safer, healthier world. 
Sincerely, 
￼ 
U.S. Senator for Wisconsin

Congressman Smith's E-news: December 15, 2018   ￼  I was proud to speak in support of the 2018 Farm Bill Conference Report before the House of Representatives passed it by a vote of 369-47. 
Continuing the Fight Against WOTUS 
Our nation’s natural resources have no better friend than farmers and ranchers whose livelihood depends on them. From growing crops to raising livestock, their long term success is dependent upon sustainable practices. This is why President Obama’s oppressive Clean Water Rule, also known as Waters of the United States (WOTUS), was unwelcome and even offensive to people throughout the Midwest.   WOTUS sought to greatly increase the EPA’s authority to regulate “ephemeral streams” - those which flow only when it rains or snow melts – by expanding the definition of navigable waterways under the Clean Water Act. However, a vast array of legal scholars, state officials, and federal judges have agreed this Obama-era regulation is both outside the will of Congress and downright unconstitutional.   It’s not at all difficult to imagine the ways in which an activist administration might use these expanded powers to issue a litany of burdensome and unnecessary regulations surrounding everything from irrigation ditches to water puddles. As a result of the EPA’s actions, I introduced a joint resolution to repeal WOTUS under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which allows Congress to overrule any new regulations. The resolution easily passed both the House and Senate, but was vetoed by President Obama.   When President Trump took office, he attempted to roll back the rule almost immediately. Unfortunately, the courts intervened saying the current rule would have to be replaced with a completely new one, rather than rolled back. Much to the relief of farmers and ranchers across the country, the EPA announced a replacement rule this week which both honors past court decisions and includes a more appropriate definition of navigable waterways.  Under the new rule, the EPA will continue to do its job while respecting the rights of farmers and ranchers to steward our natural resources as they have for generations. I appreciate President Trump for his efforts to shield our agricultural producers from burdensome regulations and I’m proud to have played a part in bringing the Obama administration’s overreach to light. I look forward to this rule being finalized for the benefit of our rural economy.

CONDEMNING SYRIA, RUSSIA AND IRAN
￼ 
Lindsey - 
After seven years of war and the deaths of more than half of a million people, the atrocities of the Assad regime are still ongoing with the help of Russia and Iran. The United States must push for an end to the violence and suffering in Syria and hold the perpetrators accountable. 
That's why the House of Representatives just passed my bill condemning the Assad regime and its backers, including Russia and Iran, for their continued support of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria. 
The resolution also calls upon the President and Secretary of State to work towards a sustainable political transition in Syria and a strategy to prevent a permanent Iranian presence in the region, while condemning Russia for their continued support of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria. 
Getting this bill passed is progress, and we must continue to work with our partners to condemn the Assad regime’s horrific abuses against the Syrian people and counter Iran and Russia’s malign influence in the region.

Weekly Review




December 11

""Present"" Votes: I did something I usually don’t do as I voted present on two votes last night.
Yet, I believe these were the right votes because they both fit into the wisdom my parents gave me in asking that I remember that there’s a time and place for all things and that there’s a value in moderation…in not putting all your eggs in one basket.
Let me explain….
The first vote was in place to urge the Secretary of the Interior to include the site of the plane crash that killed Roberto Clemente in the National Register of Historic Places. This bill passed, 385-1, with myself and Tom Rice, of Myrtle Beach, voting “present”.
For those of you who don’t know Roberto Clemente’s life and legacy, it’s none other than remarkable. It’s certainly worth celebrating, remembering, and emulating... Click here to read more.

Procedural Vote for the Farm Bill: Today the House voted on the rule for H.R. 2, the 2018 Farm bill. I voted against it, and it passed narrowly 206 to 203.
The rule is the mechanism by which the majority party controls debate on the floor. As such, it’s considered a procedural vote, and one typically votes with one’s party in support of procedural measures. In short, it’s a no-no to vote against the rule, and I rarely do.
But this rule breached a larger constitutional protocol that I think required me in this instance to vote as I did.
In a vote that was to proscribe the debate process for the farm bill, leadership quietly included a provision that would prevent a vote on Yemen. Let me say that again: on a vote setting up the debate for the farm bill, they included a provision that would prevent debate on Yemen.
I love Christmas and certainly love Christmas trees, but these sort of ornaments attached to what ought to be a straightforward bill are something that I have fought against consistently as a matter of principle. Click here to read more.

 Farm Bill Vote: Yesterday, the House voted on the conference report for H.R. 2, better known as the Farm Bill. I voted against it and it passed 369-47. The bill will cost about $85 billion a year for the next five years, and as a conservative, it should be telling that save for three Democrats, Democratic House members supported the bill unanimously. I believe it was a missed opportunity for reform, but with regard to farm bills, this seems to be a consistent refrain.
In fact, in my time in politics, farm bills have been interesting for the way they have been repetitive. They seem as certain as the tides in the Lowcountry. The tides come in and they go out. The temperatures may change around them. Sun or clouds may change. Rain or even snow may blanket these tides, but they stay unchanged in the way that they come in and they go out.
So it is with the farm bills. There is always much talk of things that will change and the way that we can move to a more market-based system in agricultural subsidies, and even require work requirements for able-bodied welfare recipients. But the farm bills and the programs it protects have proven to be remarkably resilient in political terms.
The farm bills’ political construction also needs to be remembered. Click here to read more.

December 14  House Passes the IMPROVE Act: Earlier this week, I cast a “yes” vote that’s worth noting on H.R. 7217, the IMPROVE Act. It would extend and fund the Medicaid “money follows the patient” program, which assists both elderly and child patients in making the transition from institutional settings to home or group care more conducive to healing.
The bill did what we need to do more of in government: Help people that actually need help. We live in a civilized society and there is a value to giving care where it is most needed. This is in strong contrast to what we saw last week in the farm bill where aid is provided to people perfectly capable of working and helping themselves.
The bill contained a number of intelligent cost-saving provisions that fully offset its cost, and it passed 400-11. Click here to read more.

Health care innovation  



Friend,
Welcome to your weekly update. As always, you can learn more about these and other legislative issue at my website: upton.house.gov. 
Health care innovation
On Thursday, my partner in health care innovation - U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colorado - and I marked the second anniversary of the 21st Century Cures Act being signed into law by President Obama.
21st Century Cures began with the spark of hope and continues today – pushing health care and medical research in new and innovative ways. 
We’re seeing the results in action already: The Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot is working to accelerate progress in cancer prevention and screening, the All of Us Research Program has more than 100,000 people signed up to help advance precision medicine and develop more effective ways to treat disease, the BRAIN Initiative is revolutionizing how we understand the human brain, and the Regenerative Medicine Innovation Project is supporting clinical research on adult stem cells. 
21st Century Cures is also making needed reforms to our mental health system and at the FDA. We’re now able to get drugs and devices to market more efficiently – helping to address drug prices. Finally, 21st Century Cures has played a pivotal role in addressing the opioid epidemic by funding the fight at the state level – with more than $1 billion in grants to states in need.
21st Century Cures was truly a bipartisan effort from start to finish. Today we can reflect on how far we have come, but also it is a reminder of all the work that remains. Patients and families are counting on us.

Bipartisan Farm Bill advances 
On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to advance the Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 2, the Agriculture Improvement Act.
As I’ve listened to our local farmers, they want support and certainty and the bipartisan 2018 Farm Bill delivers that. But the Farm Bill is not just for our farmers and ranchers, it is truly for all Americans as our agriculture industry plays a vital role in ensuring we have access to a safe and affordable food supply. It’s also good to see that provisions cutting school lunch assistance program did not make the final version. Those provisions would have hurt Southwest Michigan kids and families. 
As our farmer friends continue to face challenges, it’s imperative we give them the tools they need to survive and thrive. Learn more here.
Have a great weekend and God bless, 
-Fred

GOOD NEWS FOR HOOSIER FARMERS
￼
Family farmers are the backbone of America, and their hard work keeps safe, nutritious, and affordable food on our tables.
We took a big step this week to give farmers the protections and certainty they need: Congress sent the Farm Bill to the president’s desk.
That’s good news for Hoosier farmers and rural communities, and it’s good news for our economy.
The bipartisan, five-year Farm Bill strengthens critical protections for Hoosier farmers, promotes ag exports, and provides certainty so local farm operations can grow and thrive. 
Once signed into law, the Farm Bill will help Hoosier farmers by:
	•	Protecting crop insurance;
	•	Reducing regulatory hurdles;
	•	Promoting agriculture exports;
	•	Supporting voluntary conservation efforts;
	•	Preparing for disease outbreaks; and
	•	Investing in rural broadband.
It also takes steps to improve SNAP so those who fall on hard times can build a bridge out of poverty, and it strengthens the program by allowing the administration to rein in states that abuse the waiver process. 
This legislation will give farmers the long-term certainty they need and help give Hoosiers a better chance to live the American Dream.
HELP FOR GROWING FAMILIES
￼
Roughly 1 in 10 babies born in the U.S. are born preterm. And more American women are dying of pregnancy-related complications than in any other developed country.
I believe every life is precious, and giving every child a healthy chance from the start is key to success later in life. That’s why I supported two important bills this week as Congress took bipartisan action to ensure safer and healthier outcomes for growing families.
The Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early (PREEMIE) Reauthorization Act (S. 3029) will increase research and education on premature births. It will also promote screenings and treatment for expectant mothers with substance use disorders.
The Preventing Maternal Deaths Act (H.R. 1318) will also help Hoosier families by collecting data, conducting research, and finding tools to improve maternal health.
These two measures now head to the president’s desk for his signature. They will help communities, health providers, and government agencies work together to save lives. 
I look forward to continuing to find commonsense solutions to promote healthy families.
As always, it is a privilege to represent 2nd District Hoosiers in Congress.

Farm Bill Passage Brings Certainty to Rural America
I am very proud one of the House Republicans’ final actions this Congress will be to ensure long-term certainty for rural America with today’s passage of the conference report for H.R. 2, the Farm Bill. I support this bipartisan agreement, which passed the House today by a vote of 369 to 47, because I will never apologize for taking care of our farmers. America wouldn’t be as strong as we are today without our agriculture community. With a decline in net farming income of 52 percent over the past five years and the average age of farmers drastically rising, we need to ensure our farmers have an adequate safety net to continue producing for generations to come. This bill contains wins for America’s farmers, ranchers, rural communities and consumers, and provides farmers with five years of much needed stability.   
This legislation includes critical provisions needed to maintain a strong safety net for the agriculture community. Specifically, it reauthorizes and improves critical crop insurance programs, expands trade promotion initiatives such as the Market Access Program to sell American goods abroad; and it ensures small family farms have access to research and agriculture extension programs to increase their crop yields. These programs all give our local farmers in East Tennessee the ability to access and compete in markets around the world.  
In recent years, our farmers have faced depressed market prices, drought and other natural disasters forcing our farmers to rely on a safety net to keep their businesses operating in lean years. This bill expands insurance by providing coverage for forage producers and makes improvements to whole farm revenue coverage for specialty crop producers. This legislation also enhances protections for dairy farmers, including those in East Tennessee, by ensuring our dairy safety net is accessible to producers of all sizes. Programs like Price Loss Coverage, Agriculture Risk Coverage, Commodity Loans, Dairy Margin Coverage, Livestock Disaster Programs and Crop Insurance all have been maintained or strengthened. It also includes vital funding for animal disease prevention and management initiatives to keep livestock – and consumers – healthy. This ensures public safety is our highest priority, and includes the stockpiling of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines should they ever be needed. 
Finally, I am pleased this bill includes the Tennessee Wilderness Act, a bill that I introduced in the House and worked with Senators Alexander and Corker to protect land in East Tennessee. This legislation will include wilderness protection for Big Laurel Branch in Carter and Johnson Counties and Sampson Mountain in Washington and Unicoi Counties, among other areas. This land was already part of Cherokee National Forest, but this wilderness designation will ensure the area remains protected for future generations.  
While I believe we should have done more with respect to work requirements for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients in the final bill, I was pleased the bill made some changes to the SNAP program integrity that will ensure current work requirements are harder to waive entirely. It seems to me that we should be encouraging all Americans to work who are able instead of simply providing unconditional assistance, particularly at a time where jobs are readily available.  
Still, the 2018 Farm Bill does include provisions that I believe will help East Tennessee’s farmers for the next 5 years. Over the past four years, I’ve held numerous meetings across the district with farmers and other local agriculture stakeholders, and I am hopeful this legislation will meet the needs of our area. It will now head to President Trump’s desk for signature.   

Feel free to contact my office if I can be of assistance to you or your family.

12/15/18 9:52,Three Things You May Have Missed This Week,"￼  


Friends,  A lot happened this week in the Senate. From passing legislation supporting farmers and ranchers to securing important resources to repair damaged roadways in West Virginia and so much more, the Senate was focused on a whole range of issues. Among the top issues was border security. Securing our borders should be a no-brainer, which is why I’ve been working hard to deliver the Department of Homeland Security and law enforcement the resources they need to keep Americans safe.  Click here or the image below for more, and keep scrolling for additional updates. 
￼ 
Connecting Rural America  Connectivity is essential for individuals, families, students, businesses, and communities to succeed. Without access to reliable and affordable high-speed internet, rural communities and rural states like West Virginia are being left behind—especially when it comes to education, health care, job creation and retention, and overall economic potential. Earlier this week, I joined Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue in announcing a new rural broadband program, known as the ReConnect Program, which will help encourage high-speed internet e-connectivity in rural communities. Programs like this one and other efforts I’ve been working to promote through my Capito Connect initiative can help us close the digital divide, improve the lives of those living in our rural communities, and grow and diversify our economy. That’s exactly why I worked hard to ensure funding for the ReConnect Program was included in the FY2018 funding agreement and will continue to push for similar resources.  How it works: USDA will offer up to $600 million in loans and grants to help build broadband infrastructure in rural America.  Who can apply: Telecommunications companies, rural electric cooperatives and utilities, internet service providers and municipalities may apply to USDA’s new program for funding to connect rural areas that currently have insufficient broadband service.  Click here to learn more about the program, application requirements and deadlines, and additional USDA resources to help potential applicants.  Revitalizing West Virginia Communities  You’ve probably heard me talk about Opportunity Zones and how they can be a game changer for West Virginia. I really do believe this a way to drive economic growth in the parts of our state that need it most. Just this week, I joined Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and several of my colleagues to discuss Opportunity Zones and the positive impact they can have on our state and local economies. 
￼ 
[Graphic from The White House’s official Twitter account.] 
President Donald Trump has also been a strong proponent of this provision and has taken several steps to make sure we seize this opportunity. Just this week, the president created the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, which will help maximize revitalization of and coordination for needy communities in West Virginia and throughout America. I’m proud President Trump has prioritized economic development and is encouraging innovative solutions like Opportunity Zones, and I’ll continue working with the administration, as well as local and state leaders, to grow the economy and create more jobs and opportunity throughout our state. Click here to learn more.  Securing Our Borders  Protecting and securing our borders is something I have long been committed to. As head of the subcommittee that determines funding for the Department of Homeland Security, I’ve worked hard to make sure they have the resources they need to accomplish that; and the government funding bill I authored this year provides significant funding—the amount the administration had requested—to support our national security priorities. Failure to better secure our border will have consequences for all American communities, including West Virginia. I spoke about this on the Senate floor earlier this week and outlined exactly what the problem is, how it’s impacting communities in West Virginia and across America, and why a border wall system works. Click here to watch the speech and click here or the image below to hear what I had to say about the issue on FOX News.

Farm Bill 2018 
Given the importance of agriculture to Arkansas’s economy, I am pleased that both the House and Senate have passed the farm bill and that it now awaits the President’s signature. Farmers will have certainty for the next 5 years knowing they have a food security system that maintains reference prices and risk management programs for challenging economic times. While a strong safety net helps our farmers get through challenging times, the best way to improve prices is to open up new markets to sell surplus goods. I applaud the provision which allows trade promotion programs to be used towards improving our trade outlook with Cuba.  This is a step in the right direction for our nation’s relationship with Cuba, and I look forward to building on this progress in the 116th Congress. This farm bill eliminates burdensome SAM/DUNS requirements across several USDA agencies. It also reflects the realities of Arkansas farming families by ensuring cousins, nieces, and nephews actively engaged in a family farming operation are eligible for USDA programs. 
The farm bill is important for those engaged in production agriculture but also includes key provisions that address issues facing our rural communities such as the opioid crisis and food deserts. While the opioid crisis needs a multi-pronged solution, the farm bill takes an important first step by setting aside funds for rural areas that face unique addiction challenges. To address food deserts, I worked with the House Agriculture Committee Chairman to create a food access liaison at USDA. The liaison will be tasked with coordinating USDA programs aimed at improving Americans’ access to quality food and providing technical assistance to community leaders who work to improve the lives of those living in food deserts.
For too long, rural America has been left behind as the rest of the Nation moves forward. I’m proud to have voted “Yes” on this farm bill, because it signals to our farmers, ranchers, and rural constituencies that we recognize their potential to achieve economic prosperity too. 
FAQ (What folks have been calling/texting my office about this week)
Q: Where do you stand with the upcoming border wall funding vote?  A: Securing our borders provides an unparalleled return on investment in terms of national security and we cannot have true immigration reform without a border wall. If we continue to grant amnesty and even citizenship to large groups of people without first securing our borders then we will continue to have this issue every several years. It is unfortunate that this issue has reached the point where further delay could cause a partial government shutdown but now is the time for my colleagues to come to the table and get the job done.

Boost for AR Agriculture with Congress Passage of Farm Bill

First District Rep. Rick Crawford issued this statement on the Farm Bill's passage:
“Given the importance of agriculture to Arkansas’ economy, I’m pleased to see the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill. This farm bill provides important updates to our food security system, delivers a robust crop insurance system, removes burdensome SAM/DUNs requirements for farm programs, invests in the vitality of our rural communities, and makes progress in our efforts to allow agriculture commodities to be exported to Cuba. Food security is a matter of national security, and a nation that cannot feed itself is a nation in trouble. This Farm bill ensures American farmers and ranchers will continue to produce a safe, affordable food and fiber supply for all Americans.”
Rep. Crawford is a member of the House Committee on Agriculture as well as the Chairman of Subcommittee General Farm Commodities and Risk Management. He also served as a Conferee for the 2018 Farm Bill.

Trump administration rolls back Clean Water Act rules, environmental groups condemn action

U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Jonesboro, earlier in June 2017 told Talk Business & Politics he was pleased with the decision to change the WOTUS rules, saying the Obama administration overreached with water rules to the detriment of rural communities.
“I think we have to dispel the myth that WOTUS was about clean water. We all want clean water, and characterizing opposition to WOTUS as being against clean water is an incredible oversimplification. The fact is, WOTUS was vague, poorly written, and an unprecedented expansion of federal regulation that didn’t take into consideration the livelihoods of many folks living in rural America,” Crawford said.
“WOTUS would have subjected producers and landowners to jurisdictional challenges and unprecedented levels of compliance costs. It’s a relief to all of us that the new administration is listening to affected stakeholders and will be scrapping the rule,” added the Northeast Arkansas congressman.

Republican Congress Working on Solutions for Tennesseans:
	•	Good news for Tennessee’s 340,000 farmers: This week, Congress passed the Farm bill, which will support the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agriculture, rural development, and conservation programs that benefit farmers across Tennessee, as well as agricultural research at Tennessee’s universities to help farmers find better ways to grow their crops.
	•	The legislation also includes the Tennessee Wilderness Act, which will protect 20,000 acres of federal land in the Cherokee National Forest as “wilderness,” where Tennesseans can roam and enjoy nature. This designation will not only better protect ecosystems and watersheds, but also benefit the diverse recreational value of these areas, which is a crucial part of East Tennessee’s economy.
Important news from this past week:
	•	In Tennessee, about 11 percent of babies are born preterm. This week, the U.S. House of Representatives reauthorized legislation I introduced that will help reduce infant deaths and improve the health of infants by continuing research and education programs aimed at preventing preterm births.
	•	Spring Hill received a $25 million federal grant of for a new I-65 interchange to reduce heavy traffic congestion. It’s not a secret, traffic congestion in and around the Nashville area is a headache -- right now, if you take I-65 from Spring Hill to Nashville, you’re probably late to work because you’re sitting in at least an hour of traffic.This grant will help create a new avenue for Middle Tennesseans to get to work more quickly.  
Up to half of America’s health care spending is unnecessary 
This week, I asked leading health care experts, economists, doctors, nurses, patients, hospital administrators, state regulators and legislators, governors, employers, insurers, and innovators to identify specific ideas about how to reduce health care costs for taxpayers, employers, and families.
Last July, at the second in a series of five hearings I chaired on reducing health care costs, Dr. Brent James, a member of the National Academy of Medicine, testified that 30 percent, and probably as much as 50 percent of all the money spent on health care is unnecessary. That startled me. While this problem can’t be solved in Washington alone, my top focus as chairman of the Senate health committee for the next two years will be to reduce the cost of health care in the United States. I have asked these experts to send as many specific legislative, regulatory, or sub-regulatory solutions as possible, in priority order and in writing, by March 1, 2019. The federal government is not going to lower the cost of health care overnight, but I believe there are steps we can take that would make a real difference to American families. That might be two or three big steps, or a dozen smaller ones, but we shouldn’t let this opportunity to make progress pass us by.
 
￼
 
 
I sat down with Mike Allen of Axios Media to discuss health care costs and the important role Congress can play in reducing the price of care for American families. Watch our discussion here.
 
 
Celebrating the grand opening of DENSO’s new manufacturing facility in Maryville
￼
This week, I attended the grand opening ceremony of a new DENSO manufacturing facility in Maryville. In 1917, Alcoa came from Pittsburgh and built a big aluminum smelting plant in Blount County. The residents were so upset they tarred and feathered the mayor and ran him out of town. But, it wasn’t long before Blount Countians realized Alcoa was good for the community – the company brought good-paying jobs to East Tennessee and suddenly families found themselves making good wages. Just as Alcoa did in the last century, in this century DENSO has provided better jobs that mean stronger families, better schools, stronger communities and safer neighborhoods—something for which every single Blount Countian can be grateful. This week’s grand opening is just one more accomplishment to add to DENSO’s long history of success – a success story I know will last for generations to come.
 
￼
 
 
It was good to meet with Senator-elect Marsha Blackburn Wednesday ahead of her swearing-in ceremony to the U.S. Senate in January. We will be a great team for Tennessee, and I look forward to working together!
 
 
Farm bill is good news for Tennessee’s 340,000 farmers 
Agriculture is one of Tennessee’s most important industries, with more than 66,000 farms contributing approximately $74 billion each year to our state’s economy. This week, I voted for the Farm bill, which is good news for Tennessee’s 340,000 farmers. This legislation supports U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agriculture, rural development, and conservation programs that benefit farmers across Tennessee as well as agricultural research at Tennessee’s universities to help farmers find better ways to grow their crops.This legislation will help provide much-needed certainty to farmers in Tennessee and across the country, which is one of the reasons it is supported by the Tennessee agriculture community, including the Tennessee Farm Bureau, Tennessee Soybean Association, Tennessee Cattleman’s Association, Tennessee Farmer’s Cooperative and other agriculture and conservation groups. I look forward to President Trump signing it into law. 
 
Tennessee Wilderness Act on track to become law
Included in the Farm bill that passed this week was the Tennessee Wilderness Act, and the legislation is on track to become law. The legislation will protect 20,000 acres of federal land in the Cherokee National Forest as “wilderness,” where Tennesseans can roam and enjoy nature. This is land in East Tennessee that's already managed as wilderness, but not made a part of the wilderness law. Designation as wilderness will not only better protect ecosystems and watersheds, but also benefit the diverse recreational value of these areas, which is a crucial part of East Tennessee’s economy. I thank Senator Corker, Congressman Roe and the many Tennesseans who’ve gotten in touch with us about making the Tennessee Wilderness Act law.
 
￼
 
 
 
It was great to have Governor-elect Bill Lee and his wife, Maria, come to my office while he is in town to meet with President Trump. Bill struck a chord with Tennesseans, and I look forward to working with him to continue Governor Haslam’s excellent leadership of our state.

The Trump Administration’s new proposed Waters of the U.S. rule is good news for Tennessee farmers as it would end Washington’s excessive regulation on waters, streams and wetlands. I’ve been fighting the Obama Administration regulation since it was announced in 2015 because it gave the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers the ability to regulate nearly all of the water in the country down to a farmer’s mud puddle. It also raised costs for Tennessee families, farmers and businesses. I’m glad President Trump has changed this regulation, and I know farmers in Tennessee and across the country are too.
 
Reducing infant deaths and improving infant health
The U.S. House of Representatives this week passed legislation I sponsored to reduce infant deaths and improve infant health by continuing research and education programs aimed at preventing preterm births. In Tennessee, about 11 percent of babies are born preterm. Since this legislation was first signed into law in 2006, this legislation has helped improve our understanding of premature births and support health care professionals caring for these infants. Now that the House has passed this vital legislation, I look forward to President Trump signing it into law soon so we can continue to give more babies the chance at long and healthy lives.

Steel Plant To Employ 1,000 People In Valley
The recently refired steel mill in Mingo Junction plans to employ 1,000 people in the New Year.  The company that bought it earlier this year will pump $500 million into the plant. As of now, the electric arc furnace at the facility is operating and there are plans to resume running the caster. While the mill will rely on the experience of retired steelworkers, I look forward to getting the plant going and bringing a new generation of steelworkers to the area.

House Passes Medicaid Package Along With Five Bipartisan Bills 
This week the House Passed the IMPROVE Act (H.R. 7217), which will improve Medicaid programs and opportunities for eligible beneficiaries, along with several other bipartisan healthcare bills. This is an important package of bills to improve and bolster the Medicaid and Medicare programs for millions of Americans. Two pieces of legislation now head to the President’s desk to be signed into law: 
	•	The Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2018 (S. 2465)-Reauthorizes the sickle cell disease prevention and treatment demonstration program
	•	The PREEMIE Reauthorization Act (S. 3029)- Continues research and education programs aimed at preventing preterm births to reduce infant deaths and improve infant health
While this is a meaningful stride to boost our public health efforts, there is still more work to be done.

Grassley Direct
On my weekly ""Capitol Hill Report,"" I spoke with Erin Sommers of the Pocahontas Record-Democrat about criminal justice reform, the Farm Bill and the Senate Finance Committee chairmanship.
Q&A: New Farm Bill
Q. Why did you vote against the 2018 Farm Bill? Q. Do you support other provisions included in the Farm Bill? 
Quick Links
When the Senate set out to reform our criminal justice system, we sought the expertise from a broad range of stakeholders and advocates. The Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association of Chiefs of Police and National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives played a formative role in the updated text we released of the First Step Act. Their continued leadership has cut a path forward on a chance to improve American justice. With President Trump’s continued leadership, the wealth of input from voices across the political spectrum, and Senator McConnell’s work in bringing this up for a vote, I look forward to getting this bill signed into law. The Senate will vote on the First Step Act next week. 
After Iowans raised their concerns about EpiPen, I looked into the issue and was stunned to learn that the price of the drug had increased more than 400 percent between 2006 and 2016. That was the catalyst for my years-long oversight effort to get to the bottom of EpiPen’s extreme price hike. As a result of my oversight and in light of the defects discovered in current law, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and I introduced the Right Rebate Act of 2018. The legislation enacts reforms to plug the loopholes that have allowed pharmaceutical companies to game the system and keep drug prices artificially high at the expense of consumers and taxpayers. Read more about this effort in my op-ed here.  
For years, the top 10 percent of farmers have received over 70 percent of the subsidies from the government. That’s only one of the many reasons it’s so hard for young and beginning farmers to get started. Unfortunately, the 2018 Farm Bill didn't include another critical reform that would help young and beginning farmers – my payment limitations amendment. To say I’m disappointed the bill makes more subsidies available to the wealthiest farmers and many non-farmers is a severe understatement. Especially when the impact of large farmers being allowed to manipulate the system is that young and beginning farmers face even larger hurdles. Because of this, I could not vote for this Farm Bill.
In December of 2017, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the most comprehensive reforms to the nation’s tax laws in more than three decades. For years, both sides of the aisle talked about the need for tax reform that would provide tax simplification, tax fairness and increase America’s economic competiveness. With the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we finally made that a reality. As we look forward to a new year in 2019, with a new Congress and a new majority in the House, it’s my hope that we can work in a bipartisan way to build upon this economic success. I’ll be doing my part as the incoming chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. 
Kids in our juvenile justice system need safety, fairness and treatment that encourages respect for the law. So I’m happy to report that the United States Senate unanimously passed bipartisan legislation called the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization Act of 2018, which I led, to secure new protections for minors in the justice system. This bill improves accountability measures in the federal juvenile justice grant program by ensuring that states aren’t rewarded for failing to provide the minimum standard of protections for minors.

U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s eNewsletter - - Week of December 10, 2018

Senator McConnell's Hemp Provision Passed Congress, Will Become Law
McConnell signed Farm Bill using his Kentucky hemp pen 
 ￼ 
This week, Congress passed the Farm Bill which included U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's legislation to legalize the production of industrial hemp. When President Trump signs the bill into law, Kentucky's farmers can continue to lead the nation in the growing, processing and manufacturing of industrial hemp.
Serving Kentucky as a senior member of the Agriculture Committee and as Senate Majority Leader, Senator McConnell penned a column for Kentucky newspapers about his efforts over the years to legalize industrial hemp:
""In early 2013, Kentucky farmers and then-Agriculture Commissioner Jamie Comer brought to my attention just how wrongheaded the federal ban on hemp was. The demand for tobacco had fallen from its all-time high, the tobacco buyout I secured years earlier was winding down and Kentucky farmers needed a new cash crop. While customers could already find hemp products on store shelves, the hemp used had to be imported from other countries.    ""Kentucky has a proven track record for favorable growing conditions for hemp and there was no legitimate reason why our farmers shouldn’t be allowed to grow the crop and capitalize on this growing market. That’s why I secured an initiative in the 2014 Farm Bill paving the way for state hemp pilot programs that would give farmers in Kentucky the opportunity to grow and research hemp and demonstrate its potential.    ""Since the pilot programs began, Kentucky’s success has surpassed all of my expectations. Hemp can be found in food and clothing, in home insulation and your car dashboard, and in many other Kentucky Proud products. Last year alone, hemp surpassed more than $16 million in product sales and attracted more than $25 million in investments to the Commonwealth. Given this remarkable progress, I feel confident that hemp’s economic contributions will keep growing with full legalization.    ""Earlier this year, I introduced my 'Hemp Farming Act of 2018' to revitalize the crop in Kentucky by making it a legal commodity. Working with organizations like the Kentucky Farm Bureau, we built support for my legislation throughout the Commonwealth and in the Senate. As a senior member of the Agriculture Committee, I successfully included it in the 2018 Farm Bill, which passed the Senate overwhelmingly.    ""Then, as Majority Leader, I appointed myself to the Conference Committee responsible for negotiating the final Farm Bill text to ensure my hemp provision made it in the final version. With my fellow conferee, Congressman Jamie Comer, we worked tirelessly to protect hemp and other measures important to Kentucky’s farm economy. After months of intense negotiations, Congress recently passed the final Farm Bill and sent it to President Trump to become law."" Click HERE to read the entire column published by the Nelson County Gazette. 
In The Media Across The Commonwealth
￼
The Messenger-Inquirer in Owensboro reported: ""Signed in the Senate by Sen. Mitch McConnell's own hemp-based pen after an 87-13 vote on Tuesday, provisions added by Kentucky's senior senator over the summer would remove hemp from the list of scheduled substances, allow state agriculture authorities to regulate its growth and give hemp farmers the right to apply for crop insurance. The bill passed the House on Wednesday afternoon and awaits a signature from President Donald Trump.""
￼
The Lexington Herald-Leader Editorial read: ""Kudos to McConnell on hemp bill - You have to give Sen. Mitch McConnell credit: When he is committed to something, he knows how to get it done...McConnell’s diligence on hemp is an example of using his clout to look out for Kentucky. Well done.""
￼

In northern Kentucky, The Enquirer Editorial Board gave Senator McConnall a ""thumbs up"": ""Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scored a big win for Kentucky's economy by passing a Farm Bill in the U.S. Senate containing a provision that decriminalizes hemp and classifies it as an agricultural crop rather than a drug related to marijuana. The bill also gives states, not the federal government, regulatory control of the industry. A hemp pilot program in Kentucky last year netted $16 million in product sales. For a state that has been searching for ways to generate new revenue to jump-start its economy, McConnell might have just provided the jumper cables.""
￼
The Glasgow Daily Times reported: ""Hemp, hemp, hooray: Local producers excited over farm bill - The passage of the farm bill by Congress this week could mean big things for rural Kentucky in regard to industrial hemp...U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Louisville, spoke about the pro-hemp provision in the bill on Thursday on the Senate floor. 'The boost this bill delivers couldn’t come soon enough. It’s no secret that these are tough times for farm country. Falling prices and volatile markets make it harder to make ends meet. Net farm income continues to decline. The threat of natural disasters is a constant fear for even the most skilled and prepared farmers,' he said in a press release, adding that Kentucky farm families are all too familiar with those challenges.""
￼
WTVQ-TV ABC 36 News in Lexington reported: ""The farm bill now just awaits President Trump’s signature. It passed Wednesday in the House of Representatives. When the Senate passed it Tuesday, Majority leader Mitch McConnell used a hemp pen to sign it. He’s been a strong supporter of a provision in the bill that would legalize hemp for industrial purposes.""

 Supporting Our Texas Farmers



This week, the Senate passed the final Farm Bill, which includes a number of priorities Texas farmers and ranchers have shared with me.
￼
From making sure one bad harvest doesn’t bankrupt a family-owned farm to supporting our cotton industry after Hurricane Harvey, this legislation will keep Texas agriculture strong while ensuring food prices remain affordable.
This Farm Bill reflects countless conversations with those who know Texas agriculture best, including provisions to strengthen crop insurance, maintain cotton eligibility for the Farm Bill safety net, and promote animal health by countering livestock diseases.
However, the Farm Bill isn’t just for farmers. This bill will safeguard our nation’s food supply, promote environmental conservation, support research partnerships at Texas universities, and help modernize American textile mills.
The success of agriculture in Texas affects us all. I'm proud to see this final package head to the president's desk and look forward to all the good it will do for our farmers and small businesses in Texas.
View the full list of Texas priorities in the Farm Bill here.

Dear Friend, 
This week the House and Senate passed a new Farm Bill with a very strong bipartisan vote.  For a lot of Americans, it’s easy to overlook this accomplishment.  Our grocery bills are the lowest in the world, food is readily available, and our safety net is well considered.  It comes down to this: The vastness of our land, the quality of our soil, and the gritty ingenuity of our farmers are the foundation that have given America prosperity, stability, and economic vitality. 
The Farm Bill provides risk-management tools to maximize this natural gift, allowing farmers and ranchers to provide food security for our country.  Its nutrition programs, as well as food assistance to millions of others around the world, protect those in vulnerable circumstances.  The bill fosters conservation practices that enhance soil protection and wildlife habitat; and I am pleased by the increases in the number of acres in the Conservation Reserve Program.  The bill ensures that America continues to lead the world in agricultural innovation, food safety, and renewable fuels. 
Beginning farmers and local food producers are big winners in the Farm Bill.  I am encouraged by the growing interest our young people see in agricultural opportunity.  We are witnessing a food culture awakening with local chefs, farmers markets, and a keen interest in eating local.  This Farm Bill helps these next-generation farmers and food entrepreneurs through new resources and training.  The expanded Local Agriculture Market Program (LAMP) accelerates the “farm-to-fork” movement across America, connecting local farmers with consumers and restaurants.  This offers a big opportunity for Nebraska.
I am happy that my provisions to enhance the Farmer to Farmer program made it into the final package.  For over thirty years, the Farmer to Farmer program has connected volunteer American farmers, agriculture extension experts, and others with deep knowledge of the ag industry with farmers abroad.  From dairy production to seed selection, entomology, irrigation, crop yield improvement, and farm credit, America’s farmers help others around the globe.  The sharing of America’s ag expertise dramatically enhances the capacity of peoples elsewhere to grow their own food—contributing to worldwide food security, community well-being, and human flourishing. 
We worked very hard to address a major problem—the high cost of health insurance for farmers.  The Rural Health Insurance Act passed the House but did not make it through the Senate.  We hear frequently from our farmers that some pay upwards of $30,000 or more annually for health insurance. These high costs have deeply affected farm families.  We will continue to seek opportunities in the next Congress to address the thorny problem of broken insurance markets.
In Nebraska, agriculture is central to our economic well-being, our way of life, our culture.  Our land grant universities help ensure that we maintain our tremendous productivity in the agriculture sector.  The Farm Bill is a once-every-five-year piece of legislation.  The birth of such legislation is neither easy nor smooth.  But it is finally done. 
For Nebraskans, the Farm Bill is not just another bill out of Washington.  Like the rhythms of planting and sowing, it is an expected rite of legislative passage essential to who we are as a people.  
   Sincerely, ￼  Congressman Jeff Fortenberry

A Year of Accomplishments
This year has been an eventful one in the United States Senate. We’ve gotten a lot done for North Carolina, which weathered devastating natural disasters, including Hurricane Florence. We’ve worked to strengthen our national defenses and fought for our men and women in uniform. And as a nation, we honored the legacies of some incredible American leaders we lost this year.
Forefront in most folk’s minds are the natural disasters that tore through our state. Hurricanes Florence and Michael, and tornadoes in Guilford and Rockingham counties, left untold damage in their wake. They cost many their livelihoods, and some their loved ones. Senator Tillis and I, along with our colleagues in the House and Governor Cooper, have been hard at work securing vital recovery funding to help families, individuals, and businesses get back on their feet as soon as possible. Rest assured we will continue our work until the job is done. 
I’m proud to have worked on several fronts this year to ensure America has an effective national defense and intelligence community. In January, Congress reauthorized essential intelligence tools to keep Americans safe. In May, we confirmed the first female head of the CIA, Gina Haspel. In June, the president signed the 2019 defense spending bill into law, securing nearly $370 million for North Carolina installations like Fort Bragg, Camp Lejeune, Cherry Point, and others.
America and North Carolina also experienced its fair share of loss. We said goodbye to great Americans in North Carolina and America’s pastor, Reverend Billy Graham, Navy war hero, POW, and Arizona Senator John McCain, and the 41st President of the United States, George H.W. Bush. The world came to know all of these leaders for their kindness, generosity of spirit, and devotion to causes bigger than themselves. We could all stand to learn from their shining examples, and we are forever in their debt.
As we move into a new year, I am confident that Congress will continue fighting on behalf of the American people. I’m lucky to have such a great partner in the Senate in Thom Tillis and in the North Carolina delegation in the House of Representatives. It’s truly an honor to serve our great state in Congress. Thank you and God bless.

Farm Bill Heading to the President, Includes Nearly 20 Thune-Authored Provisions
 
In a 1982 radio address to the nation, President Ronald Reagan had a simple yet poignant message for U.S. farmers. He said, “I’ve always thought that when we Americans get up in the morning, when we see bacon, eggs, toast, and milk on our breakfast table, we should give thanks that our farmers are survivors. You are the real miracle workers of the modern world – keepers of an incredible system based on faith, freedom, hard work, productivity, and profit.”
 
Reagan’s edict to the American people was as true then as it is today: farming and ranching is no easy business. In fact, if you ask most farmers and ranchers today, they’d tell you it’s less of a business and more of a way of life. They’d tell you that you’re born with it in your blood – the willingness to climb out of bed before the sun breaks in the east and, without a complaint or dragging feet, work until Mother Nature turns out the lights in the west. 
 
Farmers and ranchers care about what they do and how they do it nearly as much as they care about their family, friends, and the Lord above who knows there’s a uniqueness about them – a toughness that, despite the hardest times, will never break their faith. These are the people I’m proud to represent in Washington, and they’re why I left it all on the field when it came to writing and passing the 2018 farm bill.

Dear  , 
Here with my weekly update on a few important issues from this week. 
A Visit to SUBASE New London 
Last Friday I stopped by Naval Submarine Base New London to catch up with Captain Paul Whitescarver, commanding officer of the base, to discuss ongoing investment at the base, as well as projects lined up for the coming years. 
During my visit, Captain Whitescarver and I greeted the graduates of the submarine culinary program at the base. Congratulations and best of luck to all of the graduates, and thank you for the wonderful lunch!

A Farm Bill that Works for Eastern Connecticut 
Wednesday, the House passed the 2018 Farm Bill, a five-year authorization of critical agriculture and nutrition programs that included several provisions I advocated for on behalf of eastern Connecticut’s agriculture industry. The Farm Bill continues to provide support for established crops and farm commodities in eastern Connecticut, while also breaking down barriers that hindered growth.
One of the most exciting areas of opportunity afforded by this measure is the expansion of industrial hemp production, which I have long seen as a tremendous opportunity for growth in our state’s agricultural sector. This bill now also maintains the status quo for nutrition assistance programs like SNAP that faced deep cuts in its original version, prioritizes substance use recovery programs within the Rural Development title, and expands land conservation programs. All in all, this Farm Bill delivers a strong package for eastern Connecticut, and I look forward to the new opportunities ahead for our region.

Understanding the Importance of the Good Friday Peace Accords
The Good Friday Peace Accords, which have the active and supportive involvement of the US government and Congress, will go down in history as one of the greatest diplomatic successes of our time. This week’s comments by British Prime Minister Theresa May suggesting changes to her government’s Brexit deal that could undermine the hard-won peace should be found troubling by all members of this Congress. Watch my full remarks on this issue below.

Honoring 12/14  
Six years ago today, the lives of 20 children and 6 educators were stolen in an act of senseless violence that has irrevocably altered the Newtown community, our state, and our country. Our nation grieves for the families, friends, neighbors, educators, and children who experienced this unfathomable loss, and we are reminded again of the tragic reality that is gun violence in our country. 
As we take the day to honor the 26 precious lives lost 6 years ago, it is critical that we also renew our commitment to action that will save lives. Since the devastating school shooting in Parkland this past February, state legislatures have passed 69 gun violence prevention measures, more than any other year since the tragedy in Newtown in 2012. At the same time, however, no action has been taken in Congress. Over 90% of Americans support universal background checks and other common-sense gun reforms, and I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to make a safer America a reality for all of our children.

Open Enrollment Ends Tomorrow 
Tomorrow is the last day in this year’s Access Health CT open enrollment period. It’s imperative that you, your family and small business understand your health coverage options. More than 85% of Americans who enrolled during last year’s enrollment period received financial help to cover costs.

Foxx Report
 
More than 1 million children are currently involved in the juvenile justice system, and many more youth are at risk of entering the system because of difficult circumstances such as poverty, broken families, and homelessness. As Chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, it has been my priority this Congress to reform our more than 15-years-old law to ensure that state and local leaders have the tools they need to develop effective juvenile justice systems. Yesterday, the House completed this important work by passing the Juvenile Justice Reform Act. This bipartisan bill will now become law to improve state juvenile justice systems with a focus on education and rehabilitation.

Exploring Alternatives to Fetal Tissue Research
We know that this year the National Institutes of Health will provide approximately $100 million for federal research grants that involve the use of human fetal tissue. We also know that for years doctors and scientists have been using alternative research methods that affirm the dignity of human life. This week, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing to evaluate these life-affirming research methods and discuss the ethics at the heart of the life issue. Click here to listen to my questions.

￼￼￼  ￼ 
Friends, 
  
This week the House and Senate answered farmers and ranchers call to action and passed the 2018 Farm Bill. Having the opportunity to see this bill from start to finish has been a surreal experience. What we put forth is a great bill that looks at agriculture from all angles. The final bill strengthens our safety net, prioritizes trade promotion, fully protects crop insurance, improves the dairy program, invests in broadband and rural health, and so much more. I couldn’t be more proud of the hard work that has been done on this bill, and I hope that producers back at home know that we listened! 
￼ 
￼
This Bill Delivers! 
Ahead of the 2018 Farm Bill vote, I addressed the members of the House to advocate for its passage. Kansans sent me to Congress to get a Farm Bill done. And I’m proud to say we’ve delivered for Kansans. Our bill delivers a stronger safety net for all of rural America – preserves crop insurance to help producers manage risk, makes research investments to fuel the ag economy of tomorrow, includes tele-health coordination at USDA and refinancing for rural hospitals to ensure we have healthcare available, $350 billion in a broadband loan and grant program to expand the reach of high-speed internet that is so critical to doing business in the world today, reprioritizes conservation programs so that our working lands will be productive for generations to come, and we’ve made new investments in our overseas marketing programs to ensure our producers can take advantage of every market available to them.

Plugging In
On Wednesday, the Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously to provide appropriate support to recipients of the Universal Service Fund’s high-cost program. The USF high-cost program is a critical part of closing the digital divide in rural America, as it helps providers expand broadband service in areas where the cost of deployment is high. Access to broadband helps create jobs; increases opportunities for education, healthcare, and agriculture; and boosts local economies. As our country becomes increasingly connected, we must continue to work to establish the same internet capabilities in rural communities that are readily available in urban centers. Every Kansan should have access to a reliable high-speed Internet connection, and the FCC’s action yesterday will ensure that our broadband providers are better able to meet the needs of communities across the district.
  
￼
ReConnecting   
On Thursday, I was honored to join Agriculture Secretary Perdue as he launched a new broadband pilot program called ReConnect. The program will offer a combination of loans and grants to assist with broadband expansion in the most underserved rural areas, and looks at factors such as population density and network speeds when considering applications. Telecommunications companies along with rural electric companies, utilities, municipalities, and non-profits will be able to apply for funding, and the application process will open in February 2019. I think this is another great tool to help connect rural America, and applaud Secretary Perdue for his commitment to ensuring that everyone has access to reliable broadband no matter where they live.        
￼
Responsibility.org
Leadership Award
I was honored to accept Responsibility.org's Leadership Award. Every year, the award is bestowed upon legislators who show leadership in the fight to eliminate impaired driving and underage drinking. Impaired driving claims the lives of far too many Americans each year, and must continue to be addressed.
￼
Bill of Rights Day
On December 15th  we celebrate one of the most important documents ever created in human history, the Bill of Rights. It not only laid the foundations for the essential rights and civil liberties we enjoy today, but it also set a shining example for the rest of the world to follow. Freedom of speech, press, and religion is the fundamental bedrock of our Constitutional Republic, and it should never be taken for granted. I pledged when I joined the Army to support and defend these values from enemies foreign and domestic, and I will uphold that pledge to the best of my ability while serving Kansas' 1st District in Congress.  
  
  
 
￼ 
I am so proud to report that this new Farm Bill strengthens our safety net, prioritizes trade promotion, fully protects crop insurance, improves the dairy program, and expands rural broadband and health coverage. The battle to pass this bill was fierce, but, thanks to the confidence and trust of our farmers, agricultural markets will now enjoy more stability for the next five years.

Roll Call Vote 434
 
Dear Friends,
 
This week, the Farm Bill Conference Report was approved by the House and Senate with strong bipartisan support. After months of negotiations, I am proud of the work that was done to get this legislation through Congress and onto the President’s desk. I urge President Trump to act quickly and sign this bill into law without delay. On Tuesday, the Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. visited my office to discuss the status of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Leaders of the Minnesota Farm Bureau were in Washington this week and met with me on Thursday to talk about the passage of the Farm Bill and new members who have an interest in serving on the Agriculture Committee next year. Next week, Congress must enact a funding plan to avoid a government shutdown before the holidays. 
 
Sincerely,

Farm Bill Conference Report Passes House and Senate
￼
Speaking in support of the Farm Bill on the House Floor on Wednesday
 
The Farm Bill Conference Report was approved by both the House and Senate with significant bipartisan support this week. A vote of 369-47 in the House and 87-13 in the Senate makes the 2018 Farm Bill the most widely supported farm bill in history. Rural America is facing many challenges right now, and this bill goes a long way to provide certainty to farmers and ranchers. It reforms and reauthorizes many USDA programs, allowing them to provide better support for producers during this difficult time. The reforms to dairy programs that expand coverage options and increases flexibility for dairy farmers are some of the most important provisions included in this bill. While the road to get here was rough, I am proud of the work that was done to make this bill a success. I encourage President Trump to sign the Farm Bill into law quickly.

New Staff Serving the 7th
￼
 
Grant Herfindahl recently became part of my staff in Willmar. Grant has been active in community affairs and local politics for many years and brings with him a wealth of knowledge and experience. He was elected Clerk of the Benson Township Board in 1980 and continues to serve in that position today. He also served as a County President and on the state policy committee of Minnesota Farmers. In 1989, he was elected to the Swift County ASCS County Committee until he entered a USDA training program to become a County Executive Director (CED). He went on to serve as a CED for nearly 20 years in counties throughout the 7th District. In 2015, Grant received a Presidential appointment to be the State Director of the Farm Service Agency in Minnesota. Welcome to the team, Grant!
 
Minnesota Premium Security Program
This week, I joined my colleagues in urging the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in opposition to a proposed $100 million cut to Minnesota’s reinsurance program, the Minnesota Premium Security Program (MPSP). This decision contradicts an agreement reached last year by the state and the federal government to help stabilize Minnesota’s individual health insurance market. The Minnesota Department of Commerce estimates that MPSP, which I organized federal support for in 2017, reduced premium rates by 20% for 2019 coverage. I will continue to fight the proposed cut. 
 
Rural Broadband Development
This week, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted in favor of an order to help address the budget shortfall in the High-Cost Universal Service Fund (USF). This action, which I requested in two bipartisan letters to the FCC, will provide hundreds of millions of dollars to small, rural operators every year as they work to develop broadband in rural communities. The vote was an important step toward providing rural communities with comparable broadband services for comparable rates, and I will continue to advocate for future investment in the USF.

Trade Aid Held Up by Office of Management and Budget
USDA was expected to announce the second round of trade relief payments during the first week of December, but the approval process has been delayed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue and OMB Director Mick Mulvaney met with President Trump on December 14th to discuss the second half of payments and to determine if additional payments will be made. 
 
USDA “ReConnect” Broadband Program
This week, USDA announced a new rural broadband initiative called “ReConnect.” The $600 million loan and grant program, which was authorized by Congress in March, will prioritize projects designed to deliver high-speed connections to rural homes, businesses, and farms. More information about the program, its eligibility requirements, and application deadlines can be found here.
 
Forest Service Report
As a co-chair of the Congressional Working Forests Caucus, I am a strong supporter of sustainable timber harvests that benefit our National Forests and businesses. Today, the Forest Service announced that the agency sold 3.2 billion board feet this fiscal year, which is 10% more than last year. Due to smart forest management, this is the first time in 20 years that the Forest Service has sold more than 3 billion board feet.
 
This Week in American History

On December 12th, 1928, the newly built Foshay Tower in Minneapolis was lit up for the holidays. After a visit to Washington, D.C., businessman Wilbur B. Foshay came to Minnesota with the hope to create a tower inspired by the Washington Monument. The construction of this building began in the 1920s. It remained the tallest building in the city for almost fifty years. In the 1970s, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Today, the Tower is a museum that pays homage to the city of Minneapolis and the building’s observation deck offers a spectacular view of the city.
 
What’s the Story?

This year, the 2018 United States Congressional Holiday Ornament features a miniature version of a stained-glass window found in the United States’ Capitol. This window was the work of the J. & G. Gibson Company of Philadelphia and was completed in 1859. It displays a symbol of patriotism, the American Bald Eagle. Underneath the eagle is our nation’s motto, “E Pluribus Unum,” Out of many, one. During the holiday season, I have a few of these ornaments in my Washington office.

Dear Friend,
As another federal spending deadline looms, I remain committed to supporting a budget that upholds our western values, and that means continuing to oppose funding for the Trump Administration’s senseless border wall. Here’s an update on more of what happened in Washington this week. 
While the partisan battles in this Congress have been contentious, I’m pleased that Republicans and Democrats came together to support my bill, the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act (H.R. 1318), which passed the House and the Senate unanimously. I expect it will be signed into law by the President soon. Too many American women are dying often preventable deaths resulting from pregnancy and childbirth, and those numbers are rising. My bipartisan legislation helps to reverse this troubling trend by empowering states to develop policy solutions that save lives. Thanks to Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-WA) and Senators Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) for joining me in this effort, which helps ensure healthier families. 
￼ 
This week also brought welcome news for the diabetes community. On Tuesday, the FDA announced it was finalizing guidance treating insulin as a biologic product, which is a big step in tackling the dramatic increase in the price of this life-saving drug. As co-chair of the Congressional Diabetes Caucus, I conducted a year-long investigation into this problem and sent a letter to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb urging the agency to provide an approval pathway for biosimilar insulin makers. I commend him for following through, and I will continue working to ensure everyone living with diabetes can afford the medicine they need. 
I also worked to push back on Trump’s proposed expansion of the public charge rule, sending three letters -- with fellow Colorado congressional Democrats, the Pro-Choice Caucus and the House Judiciary Committee -- to administration officials condemning this possible change. If implemented, immigrants who use programs such as SNAP or Medicare Part D could put their immigration cases in jeopardy. Immigrants in Colorado and across America should not have to choose between seeking help for their families and risking their chance to live in this country. We must remain united against this draconian policy.
￼ 
Wednesday was the third anniversary of the adoption of the Paris Climate Agreement, which represented a monumental step in the global fight against climate change. Though President Trump foolishly removed the United States from this initiative, I will continue fighting for policies, here in America and around the world, that protect our environment for future generations. 
Thursday marked two years since 21st Century Cures, the landmark biomedical research bill I shepherded through Congress with Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI), was signed into law by President Obama. What began as a spark of hope is now living up to its promise to save lives and improve public health. While we reflected on its incredible progress this week, we also must recommit ourselves to the work that still remains.

Happy Friday -  
Christmas and New Year's are coming fast. Where has the year gone? Not only the year, where has the 115th Congress gone? I'm continuing to push my colleagues to include sufficient border wall funding in the year-end spending bill; the deadline is a week from tonight. Next week should be interesting - stay tuned.... 
Thank You, Senator Kyl 
￼ 
Today, Senator Jon Kyl announced that he would be resigning his U.S. Senate appointment on December 31, 2018. Senator Kyl is a distinguished public servant, who has worked extremely hard for decades on behalf of Arizonans and Americans. His presence in Washington, D.C. will (again) be missed. 
What's the BIGGS Idea? (Featuring Senator Kyl) 
￼ 
Today's podcast features an interview with Senator Jon Kyl. I hope you will listen to our discussion to glean insights from Senator Kyl's wisdom and experience as a longtime Arizona leader. Click this link or the logo above to listen. 
Build the Wall 
￼ 
As I mentioned above, the 115th Congress might be ending soon, but we still have a little over two weeks remaining to finish the work we promised the American people. Foremost on that list is our commitment to fund and build the border wall. I'm encouraging my colleagues to include $25 Billion of funding for this endeavor in the year-end spending package. Read my latest op-ed for more of my thoughts on this vital issue. 
Christmas Cards 
￼ 
Many members of our Armed Forces are preparing to spend another Christmas away from their families. This week, I joined the American Red Cross to write some cards to our deployed heroes. Be safe and know that we are praying for your safe returns.
Talking to Arizona's Fifth Congressional District 
￼ 
Earlier this week, I had the privilege of hosting a telephone town hall to talk to my constituents. This was the final town hall of the year, but don't worry: I'm planning many more for the 116th Congress. We will announce these events beforehand on our social media platforms.
Looking Back at the 115th Congress
￼ 
We've had bills signed into law. We've helped constituents. We've interacted with thousands of people. There's so much to reflect on as we conclude the 115th Congress. Each day, on my social media platforms this December, I am publishing memories to look back at what we accomplished over the past two years. Follow my Facebook for more of these memories.

Another Senseless Shutdown 
Republicans still control the House, the Senate and the White House. They have both the responsibility and the power to keep government open – instead of shutting down the government and hurting people in the middle of the holiday season and a time of great economic uncertainty.  
This week, before the eyes of the American people, President Trump declared that he would be proud to shut down the government if he cannot force American taxpayers to spend billions of dollars on an immoral, ineffective and expensive wall. 
￼

Democrats presented the President with two clear options to keep the government open: either pass the six bipartisan appropriations bills along with a one-year continuing resolution for Homeland Security bill, or pass a one-year continuing resolution for all seven remaining appropriations bills.  It is President Trump’s choice to accept one of those options or shut the government down. 
If Republicans steer our nation into a Trump Shutdown, in January the House Democratic Majority will swiftly pass the appropriation bills with a CR for Homeland Security to re-open government. 
￼ 
Passing of Bill Newsom 
Paul and I were heartbroken to learn of the passing of our dear friend, Bill Newsom.  All who were privileged to know Bill knew him as a gentleman of deep principles, great modesty and exceptional generosity.  His cherished friendship, long public service and dedication to the arts leave a beautiful and lasting legacy for America. 
The passing of Bill Newsom is a great personal and official loss for all who were fortunate enough to call him friend.  May it be a comfort to Bill’s children, Hilary and Governor-Elect Gavin Newsom, and his loved ones that so many grieve with and pray for them at this sad time.

Dear Lindsey,  
Investing in Agriculture and Rural Development 
On Monday, I joined my colleagues on the House Farm Bill Conference Committee in signing the Farm Bill, which includes critical investments for agriculture and rural development in New Hampshire. I was proud to help secure provisions in the final Farm Bill that the Senate and the House passed this week that will strengthen the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC) and expand the reach of the program. The NBRC has a proven track record of supporting rural development projects that are having a positive impact in northern parts of New Hampshire. This bill will provide long-term certainty for New Hampshire farmers and support communities throughout the Granite State, and I look forward to it being signed into law. 
￼
Signing the Conference Committee Farm Bill 
Leading by Example to Combat Sexual Violence 
I’m pleased the House and Senate were able to come together and enact long-overdue reforms to sexual harassment policies in Congress. In the #MeToo era, Democrats and Republicans alike are committed to advancing legislation that addresses the scourge of sexual violence and harassment across our nation. In order to do so effectively, we must lead by example and be an institution and workplace where survivors’ allegations are taken seriously and promptly adjudicated. This bill is an important first step in reaching that goal, but much more work remains. I look forward to continuing to tackle these issues head-on when the new Congress convenes in January.
Ending U.S. Involvement in Yemen 
On Wednesday, I voted against a measure to prevent the House of Representatives from taking up legislation to address U.S. involvement in the civil war in Yemen. The heartbreaking situation in the country is a stain on the conscience of the world. Yemen is a humanitarian disaster and Congress should speak in one voice to condemn efforts that are killing countless Yemenis and dooming millions more to famine. I’m outraged that House Republicans voted to prevent Congress from taking steps to end this crisis, but I’m pleased the Senate did the opposite and said loudly and clearly that the U.S. should end its military support for Saudi military operations in the war. It is a step in the right direction, and I will keep working to help end this atrocity once and for all. 
Restoring Confidence in the Business Community 
Last Friday, I brought together Democrats and Republicans to call on House leadership to institute a one-year moratorium on the implementation of an online sales tax for small businesses, which was put forth in the South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. Supreme Court decision in June. An online sales tax would subject New Hampshire small businesses to more than 9,000 separate tax jurisdictions across the country, and a one-year moratorium on collections would ensure that small business owners and workers will have time to fully comply with the law and remove uncertainty within the business community. 
Here to Serve You  
As your Representative, my most important responsibility is assisting Granite Staters when they need help with federal agencies. I was contacted by Mark Quinlan of Amherst, who had an issue of concern regarding his Medicare coverage. My staff worked with the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and the Social Security Administration and helped resolve Mark’s situation. If my office may help with a problem you are experiencing, please reach out to my staff at 603-226-1002 so we can learn how we may help.
I encourage you to continue reaching out to my office with any questions, concerns or ideas you have. I love hearing from you! Thank you for all your wonderful contributions to our great state, and I hope you enjoy your weekend. 
Sincerely,

WEEK IN REVIEW
￼
To start off this week's From the Front... I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nation’s capital, including Austin Roesch and Cristina Quinn of Rogers.
This week, the House considered and passed on suspension the following bills: the Big Bear Land Exchange Act (H.R. 5513), Preserving America’s Battlefields Act (H.R. 6108), George W. Bush Childhood Home Study Act (H.R. 3008), a bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to annually designate at least one city in the United States as an ""American World War II Heritage City"" (H.R. 6118), Offshore Wind for Territories Act (H.R. 6665), a bill urging the Secretary of the Interior to recognize the historical significance of Roberto Clemente's place of death near Piñones in Loíza, Puerto Rico (H.Res. 792), Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-Determination Act Amendments of 2017 (S. 245), Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium Land Transfer Act of 2017 (S. 825), CENOTE Act of 2018 (S. 2511), Secret Service Overtime Pay Extension Act (H.R. 6893), Veterans Benefit and Transition Act of 2018 (House Amendment to S. 2248), Johnson-O'Malley Supplemental Indian Education Program Modernization Act (S. 943), Advanced Nuclear Fuel Availability Act (H.R. 6140), IMPROVE Act (H.R. 7217), Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act (S. 2465), PREEMIE Reauthorization Act of 2018 (S. 3029), Traumatic Brain Injury Program Reauthorization Act (H.R. 6615), Preventing Maternal Deaths Act (H.R. 1318),  a bill calling on the Government of Burma to release Burmese journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo sentenced to seven years imprisonment after investigating attacks against civilians by Burma’s military and security forces (H.Res. 1091), a bill recognizing that the United States-Republic of Korea alliance serves as a linchpin of regional stability and bilateral security (H.Res. 1149), a bill reaffirming the strong commitment of the United States to the countries and territories of the Pacific Islands region (H.Res. 1157), a bill condemning the Assad regime and its backers for their continued support of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria (H.Res. 1165), a bill expressing opposition to the completion of Nord Stream II (H.Res. 1035), a bill expressing the sense of the House of Representatives with respect to Ukraine (H.Res. 1162), Department of Homeland Security Data Framework Act (Concurring in the Senate Amendment to H.R. 2454), and Asia Reassurance Initiative Act (S. 2736). 
￼
Gathering around the dinner table, running to the grocery store to pick up some milk, or stopping by a farmers market for fresh produce are commonplace in most people’s routines from week to week. We can’t forget who makes this possible: the farmers, ranchers, and dairy producers who feed and fuel American citizens and our economy. That’s why I am thrilled to announce that Congress passed the 2018 Farm Bill this week. This bill makes critical investments to support Arkansas farmers, ranchers, producers, and rural communities. 
Farmers and ranchers from Arkansas’s Third Congressional District feed and fuel our economy and families across the globe. Our agriculture policies must create certainty for hardworking producers and advance a vibrant farm economy – this Farm Bill delivers on those priorities. From enhancing insurance and risk management programs for dairy and livestock farmers, to investing in rural development and preventing SNAP fraud, this legislation makes sound reforms that support the strength of our food supply, producers, and American families.
￼
Importantly, the bill also creates a National Animal Health Vaccine Bank to better protect livestock and prevent animal disease – which was a priority for Arkansas producers. Supporters of the 2018 Farm Bill include the Arkansas Farm Bureau, Agricultural Council of Arkansas, Arkansas Cattlemen’s Association, and Arkansas Rice Federation. 
Its passage ensures that farmers and ranchers in Arkansas and across America have the resources they need as they work every day to feed the nation. I look forward to seeing President Trump sign the legislation into law. Learn more about the bill here. 
I also had the opportunity to help unveil former Budget Committee Chair Diane Black’s official portrait. Rep. Black was the first female chair of the Committee, and it was wonderful to recognize her work and accomplishments. The portrait will hang on the walls of the great institution she honorably served. Additionally, I took time to preside over debate on the House floor and had great meetings with the Arkansas Farm Bureau, Acxiom, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety and Walmart, and newly elected and current congressional members. 
￼
Next week, I will be back in Washington as Congress works to strike a deal to finish appropriations bills for the year. It’s Congress’s constitutional duty to fund the government, and it’s necessary that we stop the constant cycle of continuing resolutions and short-term fixes. That’s why I recently introduced the Bipartisan Budget and Appropriations Process Reform Act of 2018, bipartisan legislation developed by the Joint Select Committee to improve the federal funding process.
Remember to keep an eye on my website or check out my Twitter and Instagram pages to stay up-to-date with the latest news from the Third District and Washington.

Holiday greetings to our troops. Our brave service men and women overseas are always on my mind, especially during the holidays. This week, at the American Red Cross Holiday Mail for Heroes event I wrote cards for our troops stationed in Kuwait and Iraq. I thanked these heroes for their sacrifices and wished them a safe and joyous holiday season. 
 
 
 

$10.1M for water, sewer projects

The Commonwealth Utilities Corporation got $10.1 million for water and sewer infrastructure this week. The money is especially useful now as CUC works to restore water service after Super Typhoon Yutu. As of June, CUC was supplying 96 percent of Saipan with 24-hour water, a welcome change from my first year in Congress, when only 25 percent of households had water around the clock. I was able to change the funding formula for the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Funds, so that beginning in 2010 the average grant to the Marianas went from $1 million per year to over $6 million. In fact, this year's total is $7.1 million, plus another $3 million in carryover that was re-obligated back to CUC. All together, that is an increase of $3.8 million over 2017 for Marianas water infrastructure and $73 million in total since the formula change went into effect. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the water grant funds, also awarded $2.1 million to the CNMI Bureau of Environmental and Coastal Quality. Congratulations, CUC and BECQ! 
 

Marianas micro-grants in farm bill

A proposal by Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) to provide micro-grants in Alaska, the Marianas, and other non-continental areas was included in the farm bill passed by the House and Senate this week. The grants are meant to increase local gardening and animal husbandry in areas that import much food. Grants can be up to $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a food bank, Head Start program, school, or similar entities. $250,000 will be available in the Marianas in 2019. The Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, which President Trump has yet to sign, also prohibits the slaughter of dogs and cats for human consumption and extends the national ban on animal fighting to include the U.S. territories. The representatives from Guam, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and I all opposed the animal fighting ban because of its effect on cockfighting. The provision had too much bipartisan support, however. Perhaps, if the Commonwealth Legislature had acted on Rep. Ed Propst’s Animal Protection Act, H.B. 20-24, last year we could have used it to help defeat the ban. Now it is too late. 
 
 
 

Typhoon Yutu relief updates

Power
The Commonwealth Utilities Corporation estimates 63 percent of Saipan customers have grid power. On Tinian, about 20 percent of electricity has been restored.
 
Water
Saipan has 95 percent of its wells producing water. Tinian has all of its water service restored.

Tents
1,344 emergency tents have been installed on Saipan. Friday, December 14 was the last day to submit right of entry forms. The TETRIS program has closed on Tinian, with 202 tents installed.

Schools
Classes have started for all public school students, including online courses for the PSS Distance Education Program. Northern Marianas College classes have resumed at Saipan Southern High School in Koblerville.
 
 
 

NOAA: Marianas coral reefs ‘fair’ 

The coral reefs around our islands are in only “fair” condition and continue to be threatened by climate change, unsustainable fishing, pollution, and overuse, according to a new report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program assessment of the Northern Marianas Islands coral reefs covers the period 2012-2017. Coral reefs are critical to the people of the Marianas for cultural and economic reasons. They are a source of food for both subsistence and commercial use, provide opportunities for recreational tourism, and protect our islands from storms. The report highlights improvements made by 3 Conservation Action Plans focusing on stormwater management in Garapan, erosion and sedimentation at Laolao Bay, and reforestation on Rota. Individually, we can also all do more by fishing responsibly, keeping household chemicals out of the water, avoiding physical damage to reefs, and reducing our carbon footprint. Let’s make sure our grandchildren can enjoy the coral reef.
 
 

Interparliamentary visitors. Chairman Wu Yuliang and other members of the Supervisory and Judicial Affairs Committee of China’s National People’s Congress met with me on Thursday. During its visit to the United States, the group has been particularly interested in learning how our nation manages corrections facilities. We also discussed China’s activities in the South China Sea, trade issues, and the importance of maintaining good relations between our two countries. 
 
 

His Excellency Akillino H. Susaia (center), Ambassador of the Federated States of Micronesia to the United States, met with me on Wednesday. We discussed the 2023 expiration of the U.S.-Micronesia Compact and pledged to work together on the issues confronting our Pacific region. The new ambassador was accompanied by his Deputy Chief of Mission, Jackson Soram. Thank you, Ambassador Susaia, for your visit.
 

DHS rule threatens child nutrition

Non-U.S. citizen families should not have to choose between providing healthy food for their children and protecting their immigration status. That is why I joined 16 of my fellow Democrats in the House Committee on Education and the Workforce in a letter opposing the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed changes to the definition of “public charge.” The new proposal would allow DHS to deny status to immigrants based on their use of certain public benefits such as food stamps, Medicaid, or Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) benefits. The rule threatens many children’s access to needed benefits at home and at school. And the rule makes it tougher for schools to use the community eligibility provision, which streamlines the process for allowing all children in high-poverty schools and communities to receive free meals.
 

Protecting our child workers from harm

The Trump administration wants to take away protections for teenagers working in hazardous industries, such as health care, a move I joined over 30 of my colleagues this week in opposing. The Fair Labor Standards Act prohibits 16 and 17-year-olds from certain jobs deemed dangerous by the evidence-based research of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The Trump administration wants to ignore that evidence. See our letter to Labor Secretary Alex Acosta disagreeing with the proposal to alter child labor laws in a way that puts teenagers at risk.

In the News: A spouse’s love lives through Alzheimer’s advocacy
 
 
From Cherokee Tribune & Ledger-News: 

When Ruthellyn Kupsky suffered a stroke in 2001, her husband Fritz said she recovered fairly well. Her recovery from knee surgery in 2005 was different, Kupsky said. “Ruthellyn’s rehabilitation was difficult. She became uncommunicative. You’d have to classify it as dementia,” he said. “She loved to read and she became severely depressed. It was a struggle for me to keep her up for more than six hours.”

Ruthellyn Kupsky lost the use of one hand and used a wheelchair to get around. During that time Kupsky sought help from the Cherokee County Caregiver’s Assistance Network group (offered through Cherokee County Senior Services), and to get someone to stay with his wife while he attended caregiver meetings.

12/14/18 17:45,Rep. Grothman Newsletter - Backdoor Spending,"￼ 
  

Backdoor Spending
This week at an Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing, I questioned experts on “backdoor spending”, which is federal agency spending that occurs outside of the federal appropriations process. This means that federal bureaucrats are deciding how tax dollars are being spent with no Congressional oversight. Due to prior Congresses ceding power to bureaucrats, “backdoor spending” has increased by 88 percent since 1994.
I strongly believe that all spending should have Congressional oversight in order to stay accountable to you, the voter. Backdoor spending is a serious issue and must be curbed. We cannot allow federal bureaucrats to determine where and how tax dollars are being spent without approval or oversight from Congress. It is not fair to hardworking taxpayers. I will be sure to continue the dialogue on backdoor spending and urge the Committee to further investigate how we can put an end to this. For more on my line of questioning and full remarks click here.

Veterans Tax Fairness Act
This past July, over 130,000 veterans throughout the country were informed that they were eligible for a refund from a lump-sum disability severance payment that was inadvertently taxed. This refund is made possible by The Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act. This act provides tax relief to veterans through a refund of taxes paid on disability severance payments.

Military service members eligible for the tax refund under the Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act include any veteran who discontinued military service after January 17, 1991 and received a one-time disability severance payment, which, at the time, was included as income on their tax return. I support this tax refund for military service members as it provides well-deserved tax relief to soldiers who have served our country and its people.

The Department of Defense is in the process of administering those letters to the veterans eligible for the tax relief and the IRS has released information on how to ensure ones disability severance pay refund will be distributed to them. Click here for full information including a complete set of instructions on how to help veterans obtain their disability severance pay refund. 

Farm Bill Passage
This week, Congress passed the Farm Bill and it now heads to President Trump's desk for approval. The 2018 farm bill supports farmers, protects crop insurance and conservation programs, invests in efforts to expand foreign markets, and prioritizes agricultural research and rural development. 

This bill is critical to providing all stakeholders, including farmers, ranchers and consumers, as well as the sectors and industries that rely on them, with a consistent playing field over the next five years. Not only does it provide farmers with stability and support, but it also addresses the needs of the modern farming industry. 

One of the changes made to dairy policy in the new Farm Bill requires the USDA to establish regionally located dairy innovation centers to assist dairy farmers with diversifying their products to appeal to the modern market. Additionally, the new Farm Bill legalized and provided crop insurance for industrial hemp, a commodity that I have been fighting for, and will boost Wisconsin's agricultural outputs. Overall, the Farm Bill addresses many of the contemporary concerns of the agriculture industry and provides stability to farmers across the country.

Dear Neighbor,
I recently had a call with Michael Carey, whose son with autism was smothered to death by a state employee.
During the call, I was made aware how Governor Cuomo’s Justice Center swept crimes like murder and the abuse of people with disabilities by state employees under the rug.
In fact, nearly 1,400 allegations related to staff abuses, patient neglect, sexual assaults and patient deaths have been reported to the New York State Justice Center. 
Yet the Justice Center investigated less than 2.5 percent of these cases.
These victims matter and they deserve justice. Also, those who depend daily on state care need someone to stand up for them. This is why I took action and have requested the Department of Justice investigate the lack of prosecutions, referrals and due process violations that have been alleged and recommend a course of action.
What is happening now is not acceptable.
Our hope is to shine a bright light on these unreported crimes so our friends and neighbors who have suffered at the hands of the Justice Center receive closure and future crimes can be prevented.
As always, if our office can ever be of assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out. We are here to listen, take action and help. 
Until next time,
￼
Tom

12/14/18 17:29,Davis Announces the Gregg and Livingston Harper Congressional Internship Program for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities ,"￼ 
PROUD TO SERVE MISSISSIPPI’S THIRD DISTRICT 
Dear Friend,

On Tuesday, my friend and colleague, Congressman Rodney Davis formally renamed the Congressional Internship Program for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (CIPIID) to the Gregg and Livingston Harper Congressional Internship Program for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities. 

My son, Livingston Harper, has served as the inspiration for me during my time in Congress to focus on improving the lives of those with Intellectual Disabilities (ID). When I came to Congress and realized there was no internship program for individuals with ID, I worked with the Committee on House Administration to begin a program back in 2010. I and many others on Capitol Hill have been positively impacted by the influence and hard work of these interns. I am grateful to the Committee’s future Ranking Member, Rodney Davis, for seeing that the program will continue under his leadership.

I wanted to take this time to share with you some highlights in photographs: 

￼

Congressman Glenn Thompson, Livingston Harper, Congressman Rodney Davis, and Congressman Gregg Harper discuss the announcement for the Gregg and Livingston Harper Congressional Internship Program for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities. 

￼

Congressman Thompson, Congressman Harper, and Congressman Davis hear about the experiences of the interns from Mason Life for the end of the year event. 

￼

Congressman Davis expresses his gratitude to Congressman Harper for his leadership over the past ten years. 

￼

Congressman Harper recognizes his first CIPIID intern, Ryan, for helping pave the way for all the Mason Life interns who have served on Capitol Hill.  

God Bless,

￼

Gregg Harper

Protecting Our Dams 
￼ 
This week, Governor Inslee proposed $750,000 in the state budget to support a task force to study breaching the Lower Snake River dams. Rep. McMorris Rodgers and I released the following statement in response:  
""The people of Eastern Washington whose livelihoods depend on these dams should not be collateral damage for anyone's presidential ambitions. The Governor does not have the authority to breach our federal dams on the Lower Snake River, and allocating state taxpayers' funds to consider breaching them would be wasteful. Congress has the sole authority to authorize breaching our federal dams, and as representatives of Eastern Washington communities that depend on the many benefits they provide, breaching them is out of the question. We commit to do everything in our power to save our dams.""  
The Federal Columbia River Power System provides irreplaceable benefits for our local communities and economies from clean, affordable energy to transportation of goods and irrigation. We have spent billions of dollars to ensure that dams and salmon can co-exist. Congress is taking steps to boost salmon recovery, and just this week, we sent the Endangered Salmon Predation Prevention Act to the President's desk to protect our salmon from non-native, predatory sea lions.  
A New Farm Bill 
￼ 
I am proud to announce that, this week, Congress approved the 2018 Farm Bill. I voted earlier this year to support the previous House version of a Farm Bill, but now both the House and the Senate have agreed on this bill that will give farmers certainty and relief for the next 5 years. As a third-generation Yakima Valley farmer, I know the Farm Bill plays an enormously important role in Central Washington's agriculture economy by delivering a secure safety net for farmers and providing for research that keeps us on the cutting edge of innovation. 
￼ 
Click here to watch me speak in support of the Farm Bill. 
Earlier this year, I traveled across Central Washington on a Farm Bill Tour to hear first-hand from farmers and ranchers from every county in the 4th Congressional District about their priorities for the legislation. I am pleased to be able to deliver a strengthened market access program to improve exports across the globe, improved crop insurance and coverage for specialty crop producers, an increase in funding for agricultural research, and an improved dairy safety net for dairies of all sizes. 
While I would have preferred to include stronger provisions to improve nutrition programs and forestry management, farmers needed action sooner rather than later. Click here to learn more. 
Thank You, Sheriff Turner

Walla Walla County Sheriff John Turner honorably served the public in his role for eight years, and he dedicated himself to working to make his community safer. He sought to provide 24/7 patrol coverage, re-establish the K9 program, address gang activity in the county, and proactively address other public safety concerns. I am grateful for Sheriff Turner's tremendous service to the people of Walla Walla County and Washington state.  
Holiday Mail for Heroes

I joined the American Red Cross to write letters of thanks to troops who will spend the holidays away from home and family. The men and women of our Armed Forces sacrifice so much to defend our freedoms, and our nation is grateful.

I remained optimistic that Congress would approve a Farm Bill, and in September, the House Agriculture Committee featured me in their Farm Bill Friday series.

Dear friends,  On Tuesday, I was pleased the Senate passed the bipartisan Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, known as the Farm Bill. The legislation will help strengthen our agricultural economy in Georgia and the United States over the next five years. After being passed by both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives this week, it now moves to the president’s desk to be signed into law.  The 2018 Farm Bill will provide certainty and predictability to farmers and ranchers by improving crop insurance coverage and reauthorizing farm and conservation programs. It also provides assistance to rural communities through expansion of broadband, opioid addiction treatment programs, and support for agriculture programs for veterans.  As the senior senator from the state of Georgia where agriculture is our leading industry, I was proud to support the Farm Bill to help our farmers today and in the long term. Our nation’s farmers face near-constant uncertainty in their day-to-day operations as they work to feed the world. This bill anticipates future challenges and helps ensure that our policies reflect the needs of our farmers.  More Help for Georgia Farmers  On Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers signed a revised “Waters of the United States” rule, which would provide much-needed clarity to Georgia farmers and landowners and prevent overreaching federal regulation of private and state waters under the rule previously implemented by the Obama administration.   I have long argued that the previous administration’s overreaching rule allowed the federal government to regulate nearly all private and state waters in the United States, including thousands of streams, creeks, wetlands, ponds and ditches.  This action by the Trump administration is a relief to Georgia’s farmers and our agriculture industry. This new commonsense definition will restore state and private property rights while preserving the appropriate role of the federal government in protecting waterways that cross state lines.  In Other News
	•	Last week, the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced that Georgia’s highway system will receive a federal grant to assist with an interchange project in Barrow County, Ga. The Georgia Department of Transportation will receive an award of $24,821,050 for a project at the intersection of State Route 316 (SR 316)/U.S. Route 29 and State Route 11 (SR 11) to improve traffic flow and accommodate future widening of SR 316. I was glad to help support this project, and I appreciate the attention and leadership shown by Secretary Chao and President Trump to prioritize Americans’ needs through investments in our infrastructure that will help hardworking families and our economy.
	•	This week, we introduced and passed a Senate joint resolution holding Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and columnist for the Washington Post. The resolution condemns the killing and insists on accountability for those involved in his death.
	•	I was very proud the Senate passed a resolution on Tuesday night that I introduced with Senator David Perdue to recognize the 40th anniversary of Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, located in Camden Co., Ga. 
	•	Both chambers of Congress have now passed a bill I introduced along with Sen. Perdue and Reps. Sanford Bishop and Drew Ferguson to rename a Columbus, Ga., post office the “Richard W. Williams, Jr., Chapter of the Triple Nickles (555th P.I.A.) Post Office” in honor of Columbus-area veterans who served in military units that originated from the Army’s first all-black parachute unit, which was activated at Fort Benning in December 1943. The measure now moves to the president’s desk to become law.
	•	Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch will be retiring at the end of the year after seven terms in the U.S. Senate. The longest-serving Republican in the Senate, Senator Hatch has been a great chairman, friend and example for our country. I thanked him for his years of service, mentorship and friendship during our committee hearing on Tuesday.
￼
	•	I am also going to miss U.S. Senators Joe Donnelly and Heidi Heitkamp in the Senate. I spoke on the Senate floor on Tuesday to wish them the very best as they conclude their terms and begin their next steps. 
￼
	•	Senator Dean Heller is one of a kind and someone I am very proud to have served with on the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. On Wednesday, I delivered remarks on the Senate floor to pay tribute to him as he departs the Senate at the end of his term. He will be greatly missed, but I wish him all the best in his next endeavor.
￼
	•	I appreciate America’s Essential Hospitals for presenting me with the Congressional Leader Award for my work on behalf of hospitals, including upholding the current level of Medicaid funding for disproportionate share hospitals. 
￼
	•	It’s an honor to have earned the 2018 Champion of Aid Reform from the Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network along with such leaders as Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Senator Bob Corker and Senator Chris Coons for our work to improve the effectiveness of U.S. foreign assistance. 
￼
What’s on Tap?
The Senate continues to work on funding for seven of 12 areas of government funding for 2019.

Dear Friend,  

This week, I announced that my bill to name the post office on Autumn Avenue for Judge Russell B. Sugarmon has been signed into law. I also questioned Google’s CEO about protecting free speech; voted to pass a Farm Bill which protects important food assistance, animal protection and conservation programs; expressed my concern about developments in the Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigation; visited with students at Hamilton High School's pre-K program, welcomed new American citizens, noted that open enrollment for HealthCare.gov policies ends this Saturday, December 15; remembered Shelby County Election Commissioner O.C. Pleasant Jr., offered Capitol Historical Society 2019 calendars and made a health tip about preparing for wintry cold snaps. Keep reading to learn more about my week and follow me on Twitter and Facebook to see more updates as they happen.

On Tuesday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified before the House Judiciary Committee on which I serve and took questions about baseless claims of bias against conservatives in its search functionand concerns about privacy and tracking people’s physical locations. I asked Pichai to make it easier for people to understand and adjust privacy settings on their smart phones and asked him what Google is doing to limit the effectiveness of bots that use algorithms to stifle the free speech of humanitarian and democratic activists in authoritarian countries. See that exchange here.    The hearing and my questioning drew a lot of commentary on Twitter, including this post by journalist Eli Lake:

Protecting Food Assistance 
￼  
On Wednesday, I voted for and the House passed a five-year Farm Bill that  protects food assistance, conservation and animal welfare policies that are priorities for residents of the 9th Congressional District. We successfully blocked efforts by the Majority to impose punishing work requirements for food stamp recipients and preserved the Conservation Stewardship Program, which encourages farmers to strengthen conservation efforts on their farms.I am also pleased that two bills I cosponsored to protect animals, the Pet and Women Safety (PAWS) Act (H.R. 909) and the Dog and Cat Meat Trade Prohibition Act (H.R. 1406), were included in the final bill. The Farm Bill also provides permanent funding for programs promoting local farmers markets and organic farming.  
Expressing Concerns About Developments in the Mueller Probe 
All week, I have been concerned about mounting evidence in support of allegations that the President directed his lawyer to violate campaign finance laws with illicit hush-money payments to two women during the 2016 campaign and what impact that might have on the future of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in our elections. I talked to MSNBC’s Alex Witt about those concerns on Sunday. The day before, I talked with MSNBC’s Jonathan Capehart on “AM Joy” and with the network’s Richard Liu. And last Friday night, I spoke to Lawrence O’Donnell on the network’s “The Last Word.”In print press interviews, I’ve suggested tying legislation protecting the integrity of Mueller’s probe to spending bills whose deadlines are looming. I am a cosponsor of the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act (H.R. 5476) which I hope we can pass before the 115th Congress ends later this month. 
I am scheduled to talk with MSNBC’s the Reverend Al Sharpton on Saturday at about 4:30 p.m. 
Visiting with Hamilton High School Pre-K Students 
￼  
On Friday morning, I visited the Hamilton High School Pre-Kindergarten program for a holiday party and to deliver and read a book to encourage literacy. I talked to the students, staff and parents about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (SNAP, or food stamps) program reauthorized in the Farm Bill and about my support for early childhood education and Head Start. I told the kids to make good grades, stay in school and to enjoy being kids. 
While at Hamilton, I was pleased and surprised to meet football coach Cedrick Wilson, the former Melrose High School quarterback and University of Tennessee and NFL wide receiver. He is an iconic football player who will both teach and inspire. 
Welcoming New American Citizens in Memphis 
On Monday, members of my staff attended the naturalization ceremony for 59 new American citizens from 32 foreign countries, including Yemen, Mauritania, Congo, Mexico, India, China, South Korea, Venezuela, Syria, Ethiopia and Peru and Ukraine. Federal District Judge Sheryl Lipman administered the oath and shared a story about her family which originated in Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire. Her family fled the anti-Jewish pogroms at the end of the 19th century and settled in Memphis. It was a struggle but there was much hope because America offered religious freedom, had separation of church and state, and had a democratic form of government that offered opportunity to all. On Sunday night, her family celebrated Chanukah as they have for a hundred years here in Memphis. I’m proud to have recommended Judge Lipman to President Obama, who made her the first federal Jewish judge in Tennessee history. These naturalization ceremonies are always a moving experience as many of these new Americans have waited years to become citizens. It’s a good reminder that we are a nation of immigrants.

Remembering O.C. Pleasant Jr. 
I was saddened this week to note the passing of my old friend O.C. Pleasant Jr., the longest-serving member of the Shelby County Election Commission. O.C. and I became friends when we were elected as delegates to the 1977 Tennessee State Constitutional Convention. We got to know each other well during the five months of the convention and we maintained that friendship over the next 40 years. He was a stand-up member of the County Election Commission who served with great distinction and heroism, and was noted for speaking truth to power. I extend my sincere condolences to his wife Barbara, his children and his many friends. He was a good man and his was a life well lived.

Dear Friend, 
Please read to the end of my newsletter this week for some personal news from me.  
We Have a Farm Bill
￼ 
After months of working with fellow conferees on behalf of rural America, I was pleased to sign the 2018 Farm Bill that provides much needed certainty for producers and consumers both in Missouri and across our nation. 
We have a Farm Bill! On Wednesday the House passed a finalized conference report, which I have worked on for over the last four months, that will provide our farmers and ranchers with much needed economic certainty. The bill ensures consumers continue to enjoy the safest, most abundant food supply in the world by improving public/private risk management programs and supporting local, national, and international efforts vital to protect and promote American agriculture. Significant investments in rural broadband, trade promotion, research and development, and conservation initiatives will positively impact rural America for years to come.
While we did not achieve all that we wanted in the final version of the bill, this legislation is a good bill for farmers, ranchers, conservationists, and consumers. I am pleased to see many of my priorities for MO-04 included in the legislation. The Farm Bill does the following things, which are items on which I specifically worked:
	•	Expands access for guaranteed loans under the Community Facilities Program to communities with populations of 50,000 or less.
	•	Includes language I authored to increase minimum speed requirements for rural broadband and recognizes the importance of expanding rural broadband. 
	•	Maintains crop insurance and improves insurance options for dairy producers, while also strengthening and providing flexibility for Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage programs.  
	•	Invests and streamlines conservation initiatives for farm families to continue to improve and protect our natural resources and includes language I authored to allow grazing on CRP lands.  
	•	Enhances integrity of the SNAP program by improving education and training programs at the state level, reducing monthly work requirement exemptions from 15 to 12 percent, eliminating the ability for participants to receive benefits in multiple states. 
	•	Includes language I authored to increase private investment in rural broadband, modifying Rural Utilities Service (RUS) broadband programs to include loan guarantees in addition to existing direct loans.  
	•	Promotes American exports by enhancing and permanently funding trade promotion programs necessary for producers to secure additional markets.  
	•	Improves clarity and consistency for small meat processors by including language I authored requiring the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to report on the effectiveness of existing regulations for small meat processors. 
  
The Farm Bill 2018 is good for rural America.  The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 also: 
	•	Prioritizes funding for opioid prevention, treatment and recovery facilities in rural communities. 
	•	Ensures agriculture is on the cutting edge of technology and innovation by investing over $600 million in funding for agriculture research, extension and education.  
	•	Establishes new programs and funding to protect the health of our nation’s livestock while also creating a feral swine eradication pilot program. 
	•	Improves assistance for specialty crops and reduces fraud in organic imports.  
	•	Helps beginning farmers and ranchers establish themselves in agriculture and provides support for youth to get engaged in agricultural careers. 
	•	Recognizes the hardship currently facing farm families by reestablishing the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network to help combat farmer suicides.  
	•	
  
The President is expected to sign the 2018 Farm Bill into law next week.
 
Commemorating a MO-04 Hero
￼ 
I am pleased to share good news: the President has signed into law my bill to name the downtown Columbia post office in honor of Army Specialist Sterling Wyatt, who was killed in action in July of 2011 in Kandahar, Afghanistan. 
Specialist Wyatt was born and raised in Columbia and graduated from Rock Bridge High School in 2009. As a youngster and teenager, he earned the rank of Eagle Scout, a first-degree black belt in taekwondo, and certification as a Certified Nurse Attendant. His military awards and decorations include the National Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, and Combat Infantryman Badge.
I initially introduced the bill to name the Columbia post office in his honor after receiving letters from Columbia constituents asking me to do so and after meeting Sterling’s parents, Randy and Sherry. There will be a formal ceremony in Columbia to dedicate the downtown post office to Spc. Wyatt on a future date to be announced.
Having Sterling’s name on the Columbia Post Office will inspire future generations and commemorate his patriotism forever. 
 
On Track in Sedalia
￼
Last week I had the privilege of announcing a $10.09 million grant the U.S. Department of Transportation awarded to the City of Sedalia to extend its existing railroad tracks to the new Sedalia Rail Industrial Park. This grant funding will help keep the Sedalia Rail Industrial Park on track to become the largest, exclusive rail-served industrial park in the Midwest. It will also expand the current network of railroad tracks to the site of Nucor Steel’s new steel rebar micro-mil facility that is estimated to bring 250 new jobs to Sedalia. 
The city has worked hard alongside the Sedalia-Pettis County Community Service Corporation, whose Executive Director Jessica Craig applied for the grant, Pettis County, Senator Blunt, and my office to obtain the funding. The project will create even more good-paying jobs for hardworking Missourians in the Fourth District, and I’m pleased Sedalia received this important grant.
  
Meet the Interns
￼ 
The Hartzler Office interns, from L-R, clockwise: Jaclyn McLean, Austin Bruce, and Max Beckert. 
Behind every well-functioning Congressional office is a group of helpful and chipper interns, helping operations run smoothly. The Hartzler Office is no different. As such, I would like to introduce you to the great group of interns who are currently helping out in my offices: Max Beckert, Jaclyn McLean, and Austin Bruce.
Our interns answer phones, run errands, research legislation, attend hearings and briefings, draft responses to constituent letters, help with casework, and support staffers on various projects. In the process, they learn about the legislative system, the state of Missouri, and the many other functions of a Congressional office.
Max Beckert came all the way from New Zealand to intern with us, so if you call into the Washington office and are greeted by a friendly voice with a New Zealand accent, you’ll know who you are talking to!  He is finishing his Bachelor of Laws and Commerce degrees, and he learned of the Washington internship through his networks with the New Zealand Embassy and the NZ-US Council. Max is an athlete and avid sports fan, and he has competed in cycling competitions domestically and internationally. He also enjoys hiking, hunting, skiing, and surfing.
Jaclyn is from Arlington, Texas, and she has been with my D.C. office since August. She found out about this internship through her sister, who works on Capitol Hill, and she is working to complete her degree in American Sign Language Interpreting and Global Studies. Jaclyn is a college softball athlete and enjoys adventures in the outdoors, working with her hands, and design and construction projects.
Austin Bruce, who interns in my Columbia office, hails from the small farming community of Unionville. He learned of our internship through the Handshake platform at the University of Missouri, where he is studying psychology. Austin enjoys traveling, attending live music events, reading, studying other cultures, and hiking in Columbia’s parks with his dog. He hopes that his experience here will help him positively impact his community and his future career.
If you would like to apply for an internship, you can visit my website at hartzler.house.gov, hover over “Serving You,” and select “Internships.” You will then be required to answer various questions about your academic history and submit a cover letter and resume. My staff will review your submission, and depending on the volume of applications they receive, they may call you to conduct a follow-up phone interview to determine if our office would be a good fit for you.
  
Supporting Our Veterans and Servicemembers
￼ 
This week I was pleased to support a bill the House passed to improve the way we serve our veterans and servicemembers. The bill includes many provisions from stand-alone legislation the House passed earlier this year. 
Specifically, S. 2248, the Veterans Benefit and Transition Act of 2018, would ensure that students using their GI Bill benefits to go to college are not penalized if the Veterans Administration is late making payments to their school. The bill would also allow service members who are deployed or relocated to cancel their television and internet contracts without being penalized by local providers. Additionally, the legislation would authorize the VA through 2024 to allow the burial of spouses and dependents of veterans in national cemeteries.
I’m pleased to see common-sense reforms for our nation’s veterans move forward. This legislation makes practical changes to strengthen the way we care for those who have served and those who still serve our country today. It is expected to be voted on by the Senate before the year’s end and be sent to the President to become law.
  
Weekly Dose of Good News
A $3.5 million grant is headed to Katy Trail Community Health, a local health program with clinics in several Missouri communities, including Sedalia, Versailles, and Warsaw. I was pleased to support this grant, which Congress authorized in the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act. The money will allow Katy Trail’s Community Health Centers to continue providing health care services to Missouri communities, especially those with increased poverty and fewer physicians. Their clinics are cost-effective, saving the national health care system an estimated $24 billion a year by reducing emergency, hospital, and specialty care - all of which are very costly. Katy Trail Community Health, which employs 126 people, will continue to provide high quality care to improve the health of many of the most vulnerable people in central Missouri thanks to this grant.

Some Personal News
￼ 
On Tuesday, my Daddy, Ted Zellmer, went to heaven after suffering a massive stroke a week ago. It was a shock, as he was only recently out chopping wood and running the combine during corn harvest. He spent his life raising livestock, crops, a church, and two daughters who love God, love others, and love our country. He served his country in the U.S. Army Reserves and was a leader in his church. He lived his life to honor God and was a good neighbor. He made a difference and his legacy lives on through the many lives he impacted. 
This time has been bittersweet - filled with sadness over losing him but also with gratitude to God for allowing me to be his daughter. My sister and I feel truly blessed to have had such a wonderful father for so many years, and I was thankful I got to spend his last days with him. What a gift.  
I also appreciate the many condolences my family and I have received since his passing. Thank you. It’s a blessing to not only represent this district in Congress, but to also experience the love and goodness of the people who call MO-4 home. May God bless each of you and may we all be inspired to live our lives with as much meaning and heart as my father.

 
Yours in service,

Staatsburg Marine Dies in Training Accident
This past week, Maj. James M. Brophy of Staatsburg died in an accident off the coast of Japan during a training exercise. Maj. Brophy and his fellow Marines were on a refueling aircraft when it collided with a fighter jet. My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and community as the nation struggles with another tragic loss of life during a military training exercise.

Congress Sends the Farm Bill to President's Desk
This week, the House and Senate passed the conference report for H.R. 2 – the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, more commonly known as the Farm Bill. Since joining the Agriculture Committee in January 2017, it has been a top priority of mine to construct a Farm Bill that helps reverse the troubling economic headwinds farmers have faced the past five years - an unfortunate reality known all too well in Upstate.
H.R. 2 has gained support from the New York Farm Bureau, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Milk Producers Federation, the Organic Trade Association, and the Specialty Crop Farm Bill Alliance, among others.
This bill is the result of thousands of hours of farm visits, discussions with producers, and negotiations among members of the Committee and the Senate. I am proud of the bill we’ve produced and the bipartisan manner in which we came to this agreement. The bill includes changes to help Upstate dairy farmers, improves the nutrition title to put people on a path toward self-sufficiency, and strengthens incentives and protections for important Upstate agriculture industries, including specialty crops and organics.
A full breakdown of my priorities for the bill is available on a fact sheet here: https://faso.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2018_farm_bill_detailed_summary.pdf.

Closing Loopholes in Limousine Safeguards
In October, a limousine crash in Schoharie County, New York killed a total of twenty people. The deadliest accident in nearly a decade, this devastating incident is currently under investigation by authorities to determine what happened and how we can increase the safety of travelers on our roads. Representatives Paul Tonko (D-NY), Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and I have come together to identify legislative changes we can make in Washington to prevent another crash like this from happening.
We identified a loophole that allows retrofitted limousines to skirt requirements as re-sold vehicles and to avoid compliance with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regulation. Currently, vehicles that are purchased and then lengthened to increase capacity are not subject to the same safety regulations as other new vehicles that are offered for sale, such as seat belt and egress point requirements.
It’s vital that vehicles which are significantly modified undergo a strict amount of scrutiny - Congress must move to close this loophole and enact stricter rules on modified vehicles. While there were certainly other factors surrounding this crash, which are subject to federal and state investigation as well as a criminal prosecution, making sure modified vehicles are safer is a critical step.
Read more about the legislation here: https://faso.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1406.

Final Speech on the House Floor
This week, I gave my farewell address on the Floor of the House of Representatives. The last two years have been one of the greatest honors of my lifetime, and I’m thankful for the opportunity to have served the 19th district.
I’m proud of the work we’ve done. One of the more notable things we accomplished this session is a comprehensive opioid bill that puts a historic investment into combating the opioid and addiction crises. Included in that legislation were two bills that I was the primary sponsor of in the House.
The first of those bills is the STOP Act, which will help crack down on the amount of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, that are coming into the country from China. Fentanyl can be fifty times as potent and heroin, but has an appearance that is indistinguishable. This makes it extremely dangerous for people already addicted to drugs who have a hard time knowing what they are using. This has caused a spike in overdose deaths nationwide.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were over 72,000 overdose deaths in 2017. Of that number, 30,000 deaths are attributed to synthetic opioids, nearly 16,000 to Heroin, and almost 15,000 to natural or semi-synthetic opioids.
The second bill included in the comprehensive package will improve the educational materials provided to seniors when they join the Medicare Part D program.  A 2017 Department of Health and Human Services study indicated that one-third of all Part D beneficiaries were prescribed some kind of opioid in 2016. Close to 100k beneficiaries were deemed to be at serious risk due to “extreme” prescription amounts.
Currently, the ‘Medicare and You’ handbook does not have comprehensive educational materials to inform seniors on the risk of opioid use, information on their addictive nature, or information on alternative treatments. My legislation will fix that and ensure seniors know what their options are before proceeding with care.  Watch the entire speech here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJYAdtB_8QU. 

Congressional Accountability Act Passes Senate
I'm happy that a much-needed overhaul of the Congressional harassment and discrimination complaint and investigative processes passed the Senate. In February, the House passed its overhaul. 
It is appalling that through the years, members of Congress were able to utilize taxpayer money to settle claims of sexual harassment. These reforms will help ensure unacceptable behavior won’t be covered over with taxpayer dollars.
Harassment, abuse, and discrimination in the workplace are unacceptable, and Americans expect far better from those elected to serve.
Read more about the new policy and how it was passed in this CNN article: https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/13/politics/senate-passes-sexual-harassment-bill/index.html?fbclid=IwAR35I-4PTefmjkLSYoQxCzyZU28QUuyy5NUXuOEeE9psFZzntZu3nLnBiHo.

USDA Launches New Rural Broadband Program
This week, USDA Secretary Sonny Purdue announced the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) e-Connectivity Pilot Program. This new program will issue funds for broadband expansion in unserved and underserved communities.
Earlier this year, I held a meeting with local telecom leaders to discuss and gain input on this rural broadband initiative. As a result of that meeting, I submitted official comments to RUS on behalf of these key stakeholders to ensure that New York may fairly access these funds.  Additionally, the comments urged higher broadband speeds, improved mapping of coverage, and stringent standards for applicants to ensure effective broadband expansion and prevent fraud.   Residents of Upstate New York are all too familiar with the lack of broadband in our communities. I look forward to the implementation of this new rural broadband initiative and am hopeful our comments will shape how this important funding is used. Seniors expecting telemedicine, telecommuting professionals, and children researching schoolwork online all depend on access to reliable broadband internet.

Ichabod Crane Visits the Capitol
I had the opportunity to spend time with Ichabod Crane’s eighth grade class on their annual trip to our nation’s Capital. 
I took them down to the House floor to talk about some of the important duties Representatives have as well as the importance of civic participation. We were also joined by a House historian who told us some of the fascinating history that has occurred in the House chamber. 
Young people are the future of our great nation, and it’s critically important that people, both young and old, are engaged and participate in our government.

Twenty-five percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 to 2014 came from the extraction and burning of fossil fuels from federal lands. Earth’s climate is changing more rapidly than ever before in modern civilization. In 20 years, we will see Arctic summers free of sea ice and a substantial sea level rise unless we act soon. These are highlights from three recent reports on climate change.  
The first, from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), had the data on federal lands. The report was issued on Black Friday, when few Americans follow the news. It is particularly important because it cites the federal government’s own contribution to climate change. This is a reminder of the crucial role of Congress and public lands policy debated through the Natural Resources Committee, on which I serve. We must curb the nation’s contribution to the buildup of greenhouse gases. You can see my reaction to the report here.
The second report, also released by the Trump Administration on Black Friday, is the fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA). Required by Congressional mandate established during President George H.W. Bush's administration, it uses projections of climate change to estimate the toll a changing climate may exact on various economic sectors. The NCA is, to date, the most comprehensive evaluation of the consequences of climate change, the risks of inaction, and potential adaptation strategies for the United States.
According to the NCA, “without more significant global greenhouse gas mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause substantial losses to infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century.” It also makes clear that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the only explanation for the global warming of the last six decades. Without intervention, we will see record heat waves, more acidic oceans, raging wildfires, rising sea levels, and a surge in extreme weather events – all in our lifetime. 
The third report is a special report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). As part of the Paris Agreement, the IPCC was invited to report on how the world can limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The report found that the planet has as little as 12 years to take meaningful climate action if we are to achieve this goal. It was authored by the world’s preeminent scientists drawing on thousands of peer-reviewed research papers, and represents a broad scientific consensus on the latest climate change information. 
The report concludes that stunning impacts such as sea-ice free Arctic Summers, substantial sea level rise, mass die offs of coral reefs, and intense and unprecedented heatwaves will become reality as soon as 2040 unless we slow the current pace of climate change. In addition, the report highlights impacts we will avoid by limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C, or more. The IPCC report also makes it clear that the world has the scientific understanding, the technological capacity, and the financial means to tackle climate change. We only need to act.

News from Representative Bustos 
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
Finishing the Farm Bill 
￼
Congresswoman Bustos signing the final version of the Farm Bill Conference Report 
This week, I supported the passage of a bipartisan Farm Bill that will provide Illinois’ family farmers the support they need to continue putting food on the plates of Americans across our country. As a Farm Bill Conferee, I worked alongside my colleagues to merge the House and Senate versions of the Farm Bill into a final piece of bipartisan legislation. 
I’m proud to have included several of my provisions to help young farmers and veterans launch first generation family farms. I also included language in the bill to strengthen our rural communities by giving them the resources they need to combat the opioid epidemic and grow our economy through expanded rural broadband. However, the fight for our family farmers is far from over. As our producers continue to grapple with a downturn in the agricultural economy, the impact of President Trump’s trade war and the Administration’s undermining of the Renewable Fuel Standard, a lot of work remains to be done. Although this was a step in the right direction, I will continue to fight for our hardworking Illinois farmers. Click here to read more. 
To keep up on the work that I am doing to fight for the hardworking families of Illinois, make sure to stay connected with me @RepCheri!

Have a great weekend, Cheri

This Week in Congress
WOTUS Rollback 
This week, President Donald Trump announced a rollback of the Waters of the United States Rule. The Obama-era rule represented the very worst of federal government overreach by regulating any puddle or trickle of water. This rule hindered farmers, land owners and communities across West Virginia, including my constituent Lois Alt of Hardy County. 
I applaud the Trump Administration for crafting a rule that respects private property rights and gives states flexibility in managing water within their borders. You can read more about the announcement here. 
 UMWA Meeting
I held my first constituent meeting in my new Washington, D.C. office located in the Rayburn House Office Building with my friends from the United Mine Workers of America. I will continue working to ensure we keep our promises to retired coal miners.

 Always a pleasure to meet with my friends from the UMWA 
 Cards for Soldiers
I took a moment this week to write notes and wish a Merry Christmas to service members, veterans, and their families. I hope everyone will join me this Holiday Season in thanking those who have given so much in service to our country. Thank you to the  American Red Cross for organizing this event!

Please remember our service members, veterans and their families this Christmas season 
The Mountaineer Recovery Center
Today, I had the pleasure of visiting the Mountaineer Recovery Center in Martinsburg, West Virginia. This center is going to make a huge impact on the lives of those seeking recovery. This project has been years in the making and I was pleased to speak today at their renovation kick-off. Thanks to everyone, especially Kevin Knowles, who made this project possible!

Defending Vietnamese Refugees 
I was deeply disturbed by the Trump Administration’s efforts this week to subject thousands of immigrants from Vietnam to deportation. Both the Obama and Bush administrations recognized the moral imperative to continue to protect this group of people, which includes Vietnam War-era refugees who have lived in the US for decades.
Vietnam and the United States have a complex history, and our immigration system must acknowledge and accommodate that fact. Thousands of Vietnamese Americans living in the United States fought alongside American troops. These people, and their families, made grave sacrifices and have no home in which they are welcome outside the United States. It would be a betrayal to turn our backs on these men and women.
Our agreements with Vietnam only allow the deportation of those who arrived in the United States from Vietnam after 1995, the date when the United States and the Vietnamese government reestablished diplomatic relations. I am proud to have led 25 of my colleagues to call on the Trump Administration to halt any effort to renegotiate agreements with Vietnam and to jeopardize the futures of Vietnamese Americans who came to the United States prior to 1995 as refugees.

Honoring the 70th Anniversary of Human Rights Day 

On Monday, I was proud to introduce a bipartisan House Resolution honoring the 70th Anniversary of Human Rights Day and the 1948 ratification by the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The rights enshrined in the UDHR uphold the basic principles of life, freedom, and humanity that our nation was founded on, and which are enshrined in our Declaration of Independence and Constitution. Congress, and the world, must recognize that those who are denied basic human rights, such as the freedoms of speech, religion, and political expression, are also denied basic human respect and dignity.
Championed by First Lady and first chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights Eleanor Roosevelt, and adopted by the United Nations in 1948, the UDHR represents the first comprehensive international agreement about the specific rights and freedoms of all human beings. Today, the UDHR is the world’s most translated document, with over 416 different translations.
Since 1948, the UDHR has been the foundational document for enumerable international treaties, regional human rights instruments, national constitutions, and is a key component of the International Bill of Human Rights which went into effect in 1976.

Celebrating 10 Years of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission  
This week, I spoke at a reception recognizing the 10 year anniversary of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, of which I am a proud member.  Since 2008, this bipartisan organization has worked to defend and advocate for international human rights in complex and challenging circumstances around the world. Through dozens of hearings, briefings, letters and other actions, and by taking up cases of prisoners of conscience, the Commission has sought to live up to the legacy of the late Congressman Tom Lantos and his steadfast commitment to ensure the protection of the individual, universal freedoms endowed upon every human being. I look forward to continuing to advocate for human rights worldwide alongside other members of the Commission in the coming Congress.

Looking Ahead to the 116th Congress 
 As the 115th Congress draws to a close, I wanted to take a moment to share my plans for the coming Congress. I will continue to serve on the House Natural Resources Committee (HNRC), and will likely be named Chairman of the HNRC Energy and Mineral Resources subcommittee. In this role I will continue to champion clean, renewable energy policies that protect human health and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. I will also remain an advocate for the protection of our nation’s National Parks, Wilderness Areas, Recreation Areas, and other public lands. 
As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I will champion investments in freight infrastructure to alleviate the bottlenecks that slow goods movement throughout the United States. I also will advocate for increased federal support for the low- and zero-emissions transportation technologies we need to combat climate change.
Expanding access to and reducing costs of healthcare, and specifically mental health, advocating for our nation’s veterans, ending partisan gerrymandering, protecting DACA recipients, and defending human rights at home and abroad will also remain at the top of my list of priorities.   These are some of the priorities that I have worked hard on in the past and will continue to focus on in the coming Congress, along with the many other issues that impact my constituents in the 47th District. 
I would like to thank all of you who engage with my office by emailing and calling me, keeping up with my work in Congress by following me on social media, and subscribing to my weekly e-newsletter. An informed citizenry is vital to a successful democracy, and hearing from you each week allows me to better represent you in Washington. It is a tremendous honor to serve California and the 47th District, and I look forward to representing the district again for the next two years.

Each week hundreds of constituents contact my office to share their views on a variety of topics. I have recently received many messages from constituents expressing their desire to see the issues of malnutrition in America addressed in Congress. Below is a portion of my response to those messages:
  
“All Americans should receive quality health and nutrition education, as well as access to healthy food. As a community psychologist, I believe that providing clear nutrition information, such as restaurant menu labeling, will help Americans make healthier food choices.  You will be glad to know that I have co-sponsored legislation such as the Nutrition Education Act, which would require local educational agencies that participate in school breakfast or lunch programs to give students 50 hours of nutrition education to each student per year.  This bill aims to deliver informative material that is consistent with school meal program requirements. 
I understand the need for a school environment that is conducive to our student’s success—including access to healthy food.  It is essential that we encourage healthy eating and exercising habits from an early age to lay the foundation for healthy living as adults.  I am also a cosponsor of the Healthy Breakfasts Help Kids Learn Act, which would provide commodity support for school breakfast programs, allow more students to receive the benefits of a nutritious school breakfast, as well as increase access to a greater variety of American-grown foods.  
I also support the work of organizations such as the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, which is the world’s largest organization of food and nutrition professionals.  Since its founding, the Academy was founded to improve public health and advancing the dietetics profession by means of research, education, and advocacy. I support legislation that allows hardworking American families to live longer, healthier lives.” 
  
If you have written in to me, please continue to do so. If you have not, I encourage you to share your views and concerns with me, as it is the best way for me to find out which issues you care most about.   You can find out how to contact me on my website by clicking here.

The People's Tree 
Each year since 1923, a large evergreen tree has been placed on The Ellipse near the White House in Washington, D.C. to serve as the National Christmas Tree. 
Congress has its own version of the National Christmas Tree called the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree. Also known as ""The People’s Tree,"" the Capitol Christmas Tree is placed each year on the West Front Lawn of the U.S. Capitol in celebration of the holiday season. The tradition began in 1964 when Speaker of the U.S. House, John W. McCormack (D-MA), placed a live Christmas tree on the Capitol lawn. This first Capitol Christmas Tree was a live tree that was redecorated each of the subsequent three years as the Capitol Christmas Tree before succumbing to wind and root damage after the 1967 holiday season. White pines from Maryland served as the Capitol Christmas Tree for the following two years, before the Capitol Architect decided in 1970 to obtain all future Capitol trees from various National Forests via the U.S. Forest Service. 
The Capitol tree is lit in a ceremony normally preceded over by the sitting Speaker of the House. 
From 1990 to 2004, the tree was officially renamed the Capitol Holiday Tree, before reverting back to the original name of Capitol Christmas Tree for the 2005 season. The name has remained unchanged since 2005. 
Since 1964, California National Forests have provided the Capitol Christmas Tree on four occasions--in 1986, 1993, 1995, and most recently in 2011.

Voting to Prohibit the United States from Supporting Saudi Efforts in the Yemeni Civil War 
This week, the Senate passed a measure that would prohibit the United States from supporting Saudi efforts in the Yemeni civil war and that would only allow U.S. forces to engage in anti-Al Qaeda operations. 
American foreign policy should be dictated by our national security interests and our values, not by the interests of the Saudi royal family. This bipartisan measure, coupled with a resolution condemning the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, sends a clear message to Saudi Arabia that its behavior cannot continue. 
From the brutal murder of Khashoggi to its indiscriminate bombings in Yemen, the Saudi regime must be held accountable for its actions. 
I urge the Trump Administration to listen to the calls from members of both parties and increase pressure on Saudi Arabia and Iran to bring about a peaceful resolution to this crisis. 
With every good wish,

What the Senator is Working On
Fighting for New Hampshire
Senator Hassan voted to approve the bipartisan farm bill this week that has critical priorities for New Hampshire in it, including supporting the agricultural industry, helping prevent Granite Staters from going hungry, making vital investments in rural communities, and helping to combat the opioid epidemic. The farm bill also reauthorizes the Northern Border Regional Commission through a provision the Senator cosponsored. 
Senator Hassan also voted to reverse a Trump Administration rule that would allow dark money groups to further hide their identities when making political donations. The Senate passed this resolution, which Senator Hassan cosponsored, and it will now go the House for a vote. 
This week, Senator Hassan joined a group of her colleagues in introducing a bill to help protect people’s personal data online. The Data Care Act establishes a legal obligation for online service providers to act in the best interests of consumers so that people can trust that their data is being protected and used responsibly.

North Country Wins in the Farm Bill 
￼  
This week, I proudly voted in support of the Farm Bill. Throughout this process, I worked hard to ensure our district had a seat at the table, and I am pleased to report that this final bill includes many important wins for our North Country farmers, including a replacement for the failed Margin Protection Program; expansion of Market Access Programs to help create new customers for our North Country agriculture abroad; and needed funding to expand broadband access in rural areas like ours. The Farm Bill passed by a bipartisan vote, and I urge President Trump to swiftly sign it into law. Click here to read more about the provisions of the Farm Bill. 
Supporting Military Families 
￼  
I’m thrilled that the House passed my legislation to ease burdens on families frequently relocating to meet the needs of the U.S. Military. My bill – the Military Residency Choice Act – allows military spouses to establish the same state of residency as their servicemember for voting and tax purposes and keep that same state of residency through each relocation. I spoke from the House Floor to urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. To watch my full speech, click here or on the image above. 
Honoring a North Country Hero 
On Tuesday, the House passed my legislation to honor North Country war hero Ross Bouyea by designating the post office at 10 Miller Street in Plattsburgh as the “Ross Bouyea Post Office Building.” Over the course of his service with the U.S. Army’s 83rd Infantry ‘Thunderbolt’ Division, Ross Bouyea played a role in some of the most pivotal moments of the Second World War. Mr. Bouyea landed on Omaha Beach following the allied invasion of Normandy and saw 244 total days of combat that stretched across Europe.
I’m grateful to my colleagues for passing this legislation and to the entire New York House delegation for supporting it from the very beginning. I’m humbled by the opportunity to honor this North Country hero’s life and legacy. Click here to learn more. 
Preserving the North Country's Historic Battlefields 
￼ 
From the battlefields of Sackets Harbor to Fort Ann, our district is steeped in rich military history. This week, I proudly helped the House pass the Preserve America’s Battlefields Act – legislation I cosponsored that reauthorizes funding for the Federal Battlefield Land Acquisition Grants Program. This funding source is critical for preserving historic battlefields throughout the North Country. Protecting these battlefields is essential for creating rich educational programming for students, and for promoting our region’s rich culture to tourists from across the globe to experience. Click here to read more. 
Closing the Limo Loophole 
Representatives Paul Tonko, John Faso, and I introduced legislation this week to help ensure that accidents like the tragic Schoharie limousine crash never happen again. Our legislation closes a loophole that allows retrofitted limousines to skirt requirements as re-sold vehicles and avoid compliance with certain National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) safety standards, such as seat belt and egress requirements. Our community was devastated by the loss of our friends and neighbors in the Schoharie accident, and it's critical that lawmakers work to strengthen public safety in the wake of tragedy. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill and thank Representatives Faso and Tonko for their leadership on this crucial issue. Click here to read more about this legislation. 
Recognizing the 100th Anniversary of the Adirondack 46ers 
￼ 
I spoke from the House Floor in recognition of the 100th anniversary of the Adirondack 46ers – an organization in our district whose 10,000+ members have climbed all 46 peaks of the Adirondack Mountains. Their work is central to promoting environmental stewardship, protecting our natural resources, and encouraging younger generations to enjoy the great outdoors. I’m proud to recognize these environmental advocates. To watch my full speech, click here or on the image above.  
Plattsburgh Manufacturing Jobs 
Great news for the North Country economy: The New Jersey Transit Board of Directors has placed a significant order for rail vehicles to be manufactured by Bombardier in Plattsburgh! I am pleased to continue to work actively with Bombardier and the entire transportation equipment cluster in our region on mass transportation funding and other matters in Washington. Plattsburgh continues to lead the way as a hub for manufacturing in our region, and I will continue to pursue policies that will help our businesses succeed. Click here to read more about this important economic development.  
Artificial Intelligence Capabilities on the Battlefield 
 ￼ 
One of my key priorities in Congress is ensuring that the United States is the global leader in developing cutting edge Artificial Intelligence. This week, I chaired a Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities hearing on the Department of Defense’s Artificial Intelligence Structure, Investments, and Applications. Thank you to all of our witnesses for their expert testimony on this important subject. Click here or on the image above to hear my full opening remarks. 
Toys for Tots North Country Caravan 
￼ 
The holiday season is in full swing! I joined the Toys for Tots North Country Caravan as we stopped in Saratoga Springs, Fort Edward, Ticonderoga, Keeseville, and Rouses Point. Thank you to everyone who donated toys and helped us distribute them to families and children in need. It’s great seeing the North Country come together to make the holidays special for every child!

Stefanik praised Zurlo for keeping the tradition on track, as well as the partnerships between the sheriff’s offices and others. It’s an example of the community coming together for families in need, she said. “It’s what the holiday season is about, giving to friends and neighbors,” Stefanik added.

The House freshman class of the 116th Congress.
 
The 116th Congress will be historic in many respects thanks to its freshman class.  The incoming group of freshmen will be the most diverse ever elected to the House and Senate.  In January, 42 women will be sworn in as new members, bringing the total number of women in the 116th Congress to 126.  I am looking forward to working with my new colleagues, who bring much needed diverse perspectives to Congress. 

As the 116th Congress commences, I will continue to serve as a strong leader on the House Armed Services Committee and the Committee on Education and the Workforce.  I will also be voting to support Nancy Pelosi as the next Speaker of the House on the first day of the new Congress. I am confident that Leader Pelosi has the leadership skills to unify the Democratic Caucus and pass legislation. We'll have no time to waste!  A preview of our legislative priorities include a government and elections reform bill, an infrastructure package, a bill to fund gun violence research, and proposals to curb the rising cost of drug prices, among others.  

House Freshman Orientation Presentation
￼
Sharing tips about constituent services at the House Freshman Orientation.

I was honored to have been chosen to share my experience with constituent services during the House Freshman Orientation.  This new class of Representative-Elects was up early and asking questions that showed they are ready to get to work!  As the only woman on the panel, I was moved by the new energy that the incredible group of freshman women brought to the room.

Speaking at NATO Parliamentary Assembly
￼
Presenting a report to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.

As a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, I joined the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in Halifax, Canada to present my report on Russian meddling in elections.  During the presentation, I told the group that Russian cyber interference comes largely in the form of disinformation specifically aiming to spread false information to undermine democratic institutions.  I also urged NATO member governments and parliaments to adopt measures such as regular risk assessments of election infrastructure and to consider mandating post-election security audits, among other initiatives. 

Urging VA to Ensure Full Education Benefits for Veterans

Due to its failure to fully implement the Forever GI bill amid technological issues, the Department of Veterans Affairs is underfunding and delaying education benefits to veterans. I recently joined my colleagues in calling on the VA to remedy the problem and make sure veterans are fully reimbursed for lost benefits.  Our veterans should not be shortchanged on their education benefits because of a computer glitch.  These benefits are a promise we made to servicemembers and this promise must be kept. The VA needs to make whole the benefits these veterans have earned.  To read the full letter, click here.  
 
2018 Constituent Mail Issue of the Year: Immigration

Of all the most pressing issues this year, constituents contacted me most about immigration issues.  Since January, I have received over 750 letters on topics ranging from funding for the border wall to asylum seekers and refugees.  Despite varying opinions, constituents of the of the 53rd district overwhelmingly opposed many of the Trump administration’s immigration policies.  For example, I received 468 constituent letters denouncing the administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy of separating families at the border.

Touring Local Apprenticeships with the Ironworkers
￼
Visiting the Ironworker Training Center with the Ironworkers Local 229.

Recently, I had the opportunity to tour the Ironworker Training Center with the Ironworkers Local 229.  The training center provides hands-on training opportunities for apprentices to fine-tune their skills before going to a work site.  

At the center, I met with coordinators from apprenticeship programs across San Diego County and discussed how apprenticeship programs could be expanded and improved across the country.  This year, I introduced the APPRENTICE Act, a bill which would establish a $50 million grant program to expand apprenticeships.

Joining the ""Beats into Bridges"" Workshop for Girls
￼
Speaking with young women at the Academy of Our Lady of Peace after giving remarks. 

I was honored to join the San Diego Diplomacy Council and the International Rescue Committee at the Academy of Our Lady of Peace for their “Beats into Bridges” dance workshop.  The workshop centered on themes of identity, self-confidence, and female empowerment with the goal of building relationships among girls of different faiths and socioeconomic backgrounds. 

Chula Vista Veterans Home's 17th Annual Veterans Walk
￼
Meeting with veterans during the kickoff for the Veterans Walk in Chula Vista.  

I joined the Chula Vista Veterans Home to kick off their 17th Annual Veterans Walk, an event to raise funds for resident veterans to attend a holiday dinner. Supporting our veterans, active duty servicemembers, and their families continues to be a top priority for me in Congress. I thank and appreciate our veterans for their courage and sacrifice on behalf of our nation. 

Visiting Newly Opened Navy Women's Health Clinic
￼
Speaking with attendees of the ribbon-cutting ceremony.  

I recently attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the opening of the Comprehensive Women's Health Clinic at the Naval Branch Health Clinic, Naval Training Center. This innovative clinic addresses the unique health needs of female servicemembers and dependents in a patient-centered manner, integrating prenatal, primary care, mental health, and force readiness.

Long's Short Report – Local nonprofit providing a hand up, not a hand out
By: U.S. Rep. Billy Long
In October, I had the privilege of lending my auctioneering skills for a charity event supporting at-risk youth in southwest Missouri. I Pour Life, a local nonprofit in Springfield, Missouri, focuses on helping youth become self-sufficient, hosted this special night to raise funds for children and young adults currently in the foster care system, Missouri Department of Social Services Children’s Division and the judicial system.
During the event, I met one of I Pour Life’s youth, a young man who hopes to one day run for public office. Throughout the night I was able to talk with him about what he hopes to accomplish in the coming years. At the end of the event, I handed him my business card and told him that when he’s ready, he’s more than welcome to come and intern for me to gain valuable hands-on experience.
This young man is one of the more than 400,000 children in the foster care system in the U.S. According to the National Foster Youth Institute, nearly one in four children in the foster care system who age out (individuals who turn 18) don’t graduate high school or have the ability to pass their GED. While nearly 70 percent of these kids have a desire to attend college one day, unfortunately only 6 percent actually pursue higher education. These unfortunate statistics are one of many reasons why organizations like I Pour Life exist.
Zach, who came to I Pour Life in 2016, entered the foster care system at birth. After years of jumping from home to home and dealing with both physical and emotional abuse, Zach, like many children in the system, ended up homeless. After coming to I Pour Life things began to turn around. Not only has Zach secured housing, he has also taken on multiple jobs and purchased a car. Although he has accomplished a great deal, he understands there is still more work to be done as he continues to work toward self-sufficiency.
These stories aren’t uncommon for I Pour Life. Organizations like this can do what the government often can’t. Like Danny Thomas, founder of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital once said, “No man stands so tall as when he stoops to help a child.” Truer words were never spoken, and I Pour Life, and organizations like it, are stooping down to help a lot of children and young adults at a pivotal point in their lives.

12/14/18 15:29,This Week Serving Georgia's 12th District...,"￼ 
THIS WEEK SERVING GEORGIA'S 12TH DISTRICT...
 I am thrilled to say that my legislation to rename the Statesboro VA Clinic after Sergeant Major Ray Hendrix is on its way to the President’s desk. 
￼
I cannot think of anyone more deserving than Sergeant Major Hendrix to have their name honored above the Statesboro VA!  I was proud to sign and support the Conference Report to H.R. 2, the Agriculture Improvement Act, better known as the Farm Bill. The 5-year reauthorization passed by an overwhelming margin in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and will now go to the President’s desk for signature. 
￼

￼

At the end of the day, this farm bill is about securing a brighter future for rural America. Facing a nearly 50% decline in net farm income over the past five years, our farmers and ranchers in Georgia and nationwide have had their backs against the wall for far too long. I can confidently say that this legislation sets us on a brighter path moving forward. As a member of the Farm Bill Conference Committee, I believe the agreement we have reached will strengthen the farm safety net and provide a sense of certainty and flexibility for those who feed and clothe our nation. I look forward to President Trump signing this legislation into law to reinvigorate rural America.
I also spoke on the House floor in support of H.R. 2, and you can see my full remarks HERE.
The Environmental Protection Agency made an exciting announcement that they will be significantly scaling back the “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS) rule.
￼
This harmful and flawed rule was never in the best interest of our states, local governments, and landowners and the proposed new WOTUS definition will serve as a breath of fresh air for farmers in Georgia and throughout the nation.  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) unanimously voted to approve additional funding for the “Connect America Fund” – the FCC’s program aimed at expanding broadband deployment and making services more affordable in rural areas.
￼
In today’s world, broadband is not just a luxury, but a necessity. I am very thankful that the FCC is prioritizing the expansion, affordability, and accessibility of broadband in our rural communities. We also addressed rural broadband in the 2018 Farm Bill by implementing forward-looking standards to ensure we are meeting next-generation broadband needs.  U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary, Sonny Perdue, also announced yesterday that USDA is offering $600 million in loans and grants to help expand and build broadband infrastructure in rural America.    
￼

Many communities in Georgia's 12th district lack sufficient broadband service, and USDA's new ReConnect Program will allow internet service providers and municipalities to apply for funding to secure reliable broadband connection. You can read more about Secretary Perdue's announcement HERE. 
I had the opportunity to stop by the American Red Cross Holiday Mail for Heroes event to send Christmas cards to our troops who are stationed in Iraq and Kuwait.
￼
￼
Our servicemembers at home and abroad deserve all of our support this Holiday season and always.
In November, I joined 73 of my colleagues in the House of Representatives in signing a letter addressed to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary, Alex Azar, asking HHS to immediately stop approving research applications that require aborted fetal tissue, and to create a timeline for reviewing all currently-funded research to ensure that ethical research methods are used.
￼
In light of our effort, we received a notice of intent this week from the National Institute of Health (NIH) that they would begin seeking models that “closely mimic and can be used to accurately model human embryonic development or other aspects of human biology and that do not rely on the use of human fetal tissue obtained from elective abortions.” This is an issue that I feel very passionately about, and it is long past time that we end the use of fetal tissue research. To read the full letter to Secretary Azar, please CLICK HERE. 
After the passing of former President George H.W. Bush, it was an honor to participate in a special order on the House floor to celebrate his life and legacy and talk about his lasting impact on the game of golf. 
￼
We will continue to learn from his example for generations to come. Rest in Peace, Mr. President.
I also spoke on the House floor to celebrate the birth of my thirteenth grandchild and namesake, Richard Wayne “R.W.” Allen II.
￼
We even share the same birthday! My prayer for R.W. is that he will grow strong in his faith and personally experience the mercy, grace, peace, and love of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  If you haven’t already heard, my D.C. office has completed our move and we are now located in room 2400 of the Rayburn House Office Building.
￼
If you are in the D.C. area, please feel free to stop by and say hello!
Share your thoughts with me! You can email me ⇒  HERE, contact any of our offices or join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.   Sincerely,
￼
 
Rick Allen

December 14, 2018 
Dear Friend,   
￼ 
Senator Shaheen with Mr. Byrne and his family after his Purple Heart Ceremony 
Today was a special day. Let me explain why: when Francis Byrne (Manchester) turned 18 years old, he immediately enlisted in the Army and was soon sent into the most harrowing battles of World War II. He fought in key turning points in the War, including the D-Day invasion and the Battle of the Bulge. In the fall of 1944 while advancing through a cornfield, his friend stepped on a landmine, detonating the device and sending shrapnel all through his platoon. When a medic tried to assist Francis for his shrapnel wound, he told him to treat the other soldiers who were still in the field. His lieutenant told Francis that he would write him up for the Purple Heart. Sadly, the very next day, his lieutenant was killed in action.
Francis survived the war and would eventually settle in New Hampshire. But over 70 years later, he still had not received the Purple Heart, as there was little documentation from the battlefield regarding his injury. My office has been working with the Army to right this wrong alongside  Easterseals New Hampshire. 
Last Friday, there was a critical breakthrough. I was able to speak with the Secretary of the Army who informed me that Francis’ Purple Heart had finally been approved. It was a tremendous honor to call Francis and let him know that his long wait was over.  
￼￼ 
Sergeant Major Dan Dailey awarding the Purple Heart / Mr. Byrne's Purple Heart 
Today, at the Elliot Hospital, Francis was awarded the Purple Heart by Sergeant Major of the Army Daniel Dailey and Brigadier General David Mikolaities, The Adjutant General of New Hampshire, in front of friends, family and his community. The ceremony was a really special moment for New Hampshire and the nation to show our gratitude to Corporal Francis Byrne for his tremendous service and sacrifice. Francis is an exceptional member of the Greatest Generation that fought and defeated the gravest threat that the free world has ever known. We can never thank him enough for all he did to help secure the liberties that all of us enjoy.
Sincerely, 
￼

Dear Oklahoma Friends and Neighbors: 
I hope you are all enjoying a wonderful holiday season with family and friends. This is an important time for our nation to stop and count our many blessings and refocus on serving one another and our communities. Our nation’s families are our greatest asset, so please take time to connect or reconnect with family during this wonderful time of the year. For those who have lost loved ones this year, I pray you will reach out to those around you to help you find joy this holiday season. Thank you as well to all those who are serving in our military or the families separated from their loved ones this season because of their service to our nation. Thank you for keeping the peace on earth.

Federal Funding and Border Security 
Once again, there is drama over government funding. As we approach the end of the year and the end of the 115th Congress, the Senate continues the work to fund the federal government through the end of fiscal year 2019 (September 30, 2019). Months ago, we passed the bills to fund most of the government including Defense, Veterans, Education, Health, Energy, and more. But several more divisive aspects of the budget are still not complete, including border security.
The President has requested approximately $5 billion in funding for additional border security, including constructing more fence along parts of the southern border. Our nation already has more than 700 miles of fencing, but some of it is old and ineffective. Border agents recently told our team that the old fence had 10 people per day per mile getting through it, the new fence has only one per month. Border security used to not be a partisan issue, but now some want to abolish ICE, not construct any border fencing, and not restrict access to people illegally crossing our border. I support securing our southern border, adding technology, staff, and fencing where needed. We should be wise as we secure our border and address our national security.

Farm Bill 
This week, I voted in favor of the Conference Report for the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, also known as the Farm Bill. The Farm Bill provides much-needed assurance to our Oklahoma farmers and ranchers as our Oklahoma agriculture community continues to face uncertainty from price fluctuation and related international trade agreements. The Administration has made significant strides to conclude trade talks, but there are still a number of negotiations that risk our global markets.
However, the bill was a missed opportunity to reform our food assistance programs. Americans are willing to help people as they get back on their feet, but most Americans want working age adults without children or disability to also work while they get food assistance. This bill could have helped reform the programs, but it only did minor employment training and coordination reforms. The Administration has stated that they will do what they can to improve the system. Requiring work or training is a blessing, not a curse. The only way a family escapes poverty, is through work. Assistance programs can help for a season, but they will never replace consistent income.
I am working on a legislative proposal that would allow US businesses to apply for tariff relief, especially when those businesses import products from China that cannot be imported from anywhere else. The tax on Chinese imports is expected to increase to 25 percent early next year, That is a cost that many companies, especially small businesses cannot afford much less the American families who rely on purchasing goods at a reasonable price. American families will bear the brunt of the tariff burden, and I am committed to working to ease the impact of this unnecessarily burdensome import tax.
CLICK HERE to view my remarks on the Senate floor In October to encourage the Administration to resolve trade negotiations as quickly as possible in order to restore certainty and pursue fair trade worldwide.  
First Step Act 
As you have heard me say before, I believe all people are created in the image of God. All people have value and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. That principle of human dignity extends to law-abiding citizens and criminals. As a nation, we have a system of laws, and if someone breaks those laws and ends up in custody or prison, our nation still treats them with dignity.
Congress has finally heard the call from Oklahomans and Americans to address some important aspects of federal criminal justice reform by considering the revised First Step Act (S. 3649). The First Step Act makes modest reforms to federal criminal sentencing and makes our communities safer by providing recidivism-reduction programming to inmates in the federal system. The bill gives non-violent offenders the opportunity to be productive members of society when they finish serving their time. We should encourage job training and family connection for inmates so they will have the opportunity to leave crime when they leave prison.
The First Step Act improves the federal prison system by enhancing prison security and officer safety, allowing faith-based groups to participate in recidivism reduction programs, and prohibiting the use of restraints on pregnant prisoners (with reasonable safety exceptions). There is also a section on restricting the placement of juveniles in solitary confinement for extended periods, a provision for which Senator Cory Booker (NJ) and I personally pressed.
The First Step Act is truly that: a first step. It helps balance the need to keep our communities safe with honoring and protecting the lives and human dignity of the incarcerated. This bill gives our nation a venue to address the treatment of our nation’s family members while in our prisons. I look forward to the Senate considering this legislation over the next week.

UPDATE: The Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform 
I have mentioned before that for months I have worked with a bi-partisan group to find a solution to our chaotic budget process. After months of work, I outlined the ways we can efficiently move through the budget, end the shutdowns, and have a process for addressing our debt. Unfortunately, in the final week, many members walked away from the negotiations, and the process failed. I have not surrendered. We continue to outline the solutions that can get our debt back on track, and we will keep working in the next Congress.
CLICK HERE to see a list of the recommendations Senators Perdue, Ernst, and I offered to solve some of our broken federal spending process.   
CLICK HERE to listen to my most recent podcast on budget reform. 
UPDATE: Yemen Resolution 
As the Administration continues to take responsive action to the murder of Saudi citizen, Jamal Khashoggi, at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Turkey, we must remember that Saudi Arabia continues to commit many other human rights violations against its citizens. It is appropriate for the US to continue to engage with the Saudi government to share America’s values with them and tell them this is not acceptable. I continue to assess the facts and information provided to Congress by the CIA, DOD, and State Department concerning Saudi Arabia. We can and should consider the litany of options to respond to the alleged murder of Mr. Khashoggi. At the end of November, the Senate voted to advance a joint resolution to cut off US military support to the Saudi-led coalition against the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen who illegitimately and forcibly overthrew Yemen’s government in 2014. The joint resolution, introduced by Senators Mike Lee and Bernie Sanders, tried to pull the US out of Yemen during the current peace talks. Americans are providing millions in humanitarian aid, help for civilians and advice for the peace talks. Now is not the time to abandon the people of Yemen. 
This week, the Senate voted on final passage of the joint resolution and several amendments. I did not support the joint resolution. Despite my no vote, the resolution ultimately passed in a vote of 56 to 41. Following the vote, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution to condemn Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and call on Saudi Arabia to hold accountable those responsible.

Keeping You in the Loop 
	•	As you may have heard, the Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments in the Carpenter v. Murphy case, whose outcome could ultimately affect a significant portion of Oklahoma. Originally a case about a murder that was tried in an Oklahoma State court, the appeal before the Supreme Court centers on whether or not the OK court had jurisdiction over this crime because the crime took place in an area previously considered the Muscogee Creek Reservation. The question is whether the Muscogee Creek land is actually still reservation land; Mr. Murphy’s legal team contends that the land was never disestablished as a reservation in the early 20th century. His crime would therefore fall under federal jurisdiction, and the State’s judgment against him would be vacated. Most Oklahomans have grown up under the impression that Oklahoma does not have Indian reservations but rather historic Indian land. This case may call that presupposition into question and could be a change for Oklahoma. We will continue to monitor the Court’s ruling.
	•	I was blessed to have the opportunity to honor President George HW Bush and his family by attending a beautiful memorial service at the Washington National Cathedral last week. President Bush was certainly one of a thousand points of light for our nation, future generations, and world leaders with whom he worked. Although not everyone might have agreed with his political views, his love for his family and friends is legendary, and he has inspired generations with his touching lifelong love story with his late wife, Barbara. President Bush never missed an opportunity to bring joy and comfort to others. CLICK HERE to watch my Senate floor speech in memory of President George HW Bush.
	•	Last week, The Hope Center in Woodward had its grand opening after many years of work and planning! This important regional food bank will provide food and necessary goods to needy families across NW Oklahoma. I am very grateful for the important work at The Hope Center to bring light and hope to families in six northwest Oklahoma counties. Thank you for how you serve our families!
	•	On November 16, the Oklahoma Rural Water Association (ORWA) hosted a National Apprenticeship Week event to announce its intent to develop an apprenticeship program for the occupations of Water and Wastewater System Operations Specialists and to discuss the importance of utilizing apprenticeship for their industry’s future. This apprenticeship program will offer a solution to an industry that is expected to lose between 30 and 50 percent of the workforce to retirement this decade. Participating Oklahoma water and wastewater utilities will transfer a wealth of experience and knowledge to the next generation of operators through both related technical instruction and on-the-job training. The Oklahoma apprenticeship program will be developed by adopting the National Guideline Standards, created by the National Rural Water Association. The ORWA apprenticeship program will ensure that Oklahoma rural areas and small communities will continue o be provided with clean, affording drinking water and effective sanitation management. 
	•	Right before Thanksgiving, Secretary of the Air Force Heather A. Wilson visited Tinker Air Force Base and announced that Tinker would be one of two AFBs in the US (along with Edwards AFB in California) to provide support and maintenance of the B-21 Raider aircraft. Specifically, Tinker will help coordinate maintenance and sustainment of the B-21. CLICK HERE to find out more information on Tinker’s role in the upkeep of the B-21 stealth bombers.
	•	I was grateful for the honor of being selected to receive the first-annual Senior Executives Association (SEA) Congressional Public Service Leader Award regarding my work to solve some of the issues facing our federal workforce. Congress has an essential duty for oversight, and we should continue to improve processes and policies to make sure our federal government runs as effectively and efficiently as possible. Thank you to our nation’s federal employees for their service!

12/14/18 14:44,Priorities for the 116th Congress ,"￼
￼ ￼ ￼ 
December 14, 2018
Dear Friend,  As your representative, I have established a record of supporting the issues most important to the constituents of Illinois' 16th Congressional District. During the 115th Congress, we secured many of the goals we set out to achieve just two short years ago:  
	•	Rebuilding our military with the tools, resources, and proper equipment they need
	•	Ensuring our veterans have the support they deserve
	•	Creating jobs and increasing wages 
	•	Addressing the opioid crisis with the largest investment to date
	•	Providing tax relief to hard working American families
Our country is moving in the right direction and I’m optimistic about our future. As the 115th Congress comes to an end and we look towards the next two years, I would like to hear about the issues that are most important to you. By hearing your priorities, I will be better able to fight for you in Washington, D.C.   Please consider participating in a short survey by clicking HERE, and checking the boxes that reflect the importance of each issue for you and your family.
Sincerely, 
￼
Adam Kinzinger Member of Congress

Dear Friends, 
I hope you're having a wonderful week. Before you start your weekend, I wanted to take a quick moment to update you on what's going on in Wisconsin.
 Town Hall Time! 
I say it all the time because it's true: our government works best when we can directly communicate with each other. That's why I believe in-person town halls are so important.
I recently held four in northern Wisconsin, and I'm glad we got the opportunity to discuss issues of the day. It was great to see so many of you at our town halls in Mercer, Rhinelander, Florence, and Crandon. 
Click HERE or the image below to see coverage of the recent town halls from NBC 12. 
￼ 
 
Thank A Cop Today 
Even while we are getting ready for the opportunity to spend time with friends and family this Christmas season, our local cops are still out there every day to keep us safe. 
Please take a moment to thank a local cop today for all that they do for our communities! I was fortunate to chat with the team from the Oneida County Sheriff's Office at my recent town hall.  
Click HERE or the image below to ""like"" or SHARE on Facebook. 
￼ 
 Great Opportunity For College Students Or Recent Grads      Attention college students or recent grads: my Washington DC office is now accepting applications for Spring internships. It's a great way to serve your community and get involved in the political process.   For more information on the internship, click HERE or the photo below. Also be sure to share these opportunities with any interested students!
￼ 
  Stay Connected On Social Media          Snapchat is a fun way to stay connected with what’s going on in Wisconsin and Washington (and of course, find me on Facebook and Twitter- @RepSeanDuffy). Find my snapchat profile either by searching @RepSeanDuffy or use the Snapcode below!

Dear 6th District Hoosiers, 
It has been one of the great honors of my life to serve you in Congress these past six years. 
While my term has not officially ended, I recently had the opportunity to give my farewell speech on the Floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
You can view my full speech HERE. 
￼ 

First, I want to thank God who gave our family great peace and strength as we served our state and nation. I want to thank my family, my team and the countless mentors and supporters who helped us along the way and allowed me the opportunity to serve all of you. 
I also want to thank the people of Indiana and the people of Indiana’s 6th Congressional District. Every day of our service, we've tried to do our best to represent the values and beliefs of our district and, to the best of our ability, discern and provide wisdom to do what’s best for the United States of America. 
Our nation faces tough challenges. But it’s important to remember that we have been through tough challenges before, and every time we, as a nation, have risen to meet them.  And I believe the biggest reason why is the four words above the Speaker’s rostrum in the House Chamber: “In God We Trust.” 
As we look for a compass to drive us forward, we don’t need to look any further than those four words.  
America is not like any other nation that came before us. We are a nation that has been blessed time and time again. In moments of crisis, the right leaders have emerged, the American people have rallied, and we’ve done what every other generation before us has done... left this nation better than when we found it. 
There is no reason to believe we can’t do that again. All we have to do is go back to founding principles and stand for the things that have always made this nation great. 
I leave this Chamber optimistic and happy. I’m optimistic for this incredible country and the amazing future we have in store. I’m optimistic for the Messer family and all the great adventures we have yet to come. 
I’m grateful that a little kid who grew up in a single parent family in Greensburg, Indiana has an opportunity to serve this nation in a Chamber like this one. And I want to tell every little boy and girl that’s growing up in America today... you can too.

Dear Friend, 

In one week, we are going to face another government shutdown. The American people want a responsible federal government that works for them. President Trump, however, has said that he would be “proud” to shut down the government. 

I spoke on the House floor against the President’s reckless threats. Click here to watch my speech right now.

A Stronger East Providence 

Earlier this week, I joined Senators Reed and Whitehouse in announcing that more than $144,000 in federal funds will be put to use developing East Providence’s waterfront. East Providence is one of Rhode Island’s great communities, and this federal investment will help make it even stronger by creating a thriving Waterfront District that supports good-paying jobs for working men and women.

I’m pleased that I was able to work with Senators Reed and Whitehouse to put this money to good use in Rhode Island. Click here to learn more about this announcement right now.

Protect Mueller 

Each day, it seems, we learn more and more about the corruption in President Trump’s inner circle. As a result of Michael Cohen’s guilty plea, we now know that the Department of Justice has concluded that the President directed his former personal attorney to commit two separate felonies. This is the first time that a sitting President has been accused of conspiracy to commit campaign finance fraud. No matter how you look at it, it’s a sad day for our country.

If anything, these revelations make clear how important it is to protect Robert Mueller and ensure he can finish the job he’s supposed to do. That’s what I’m committed to doing so that we can restore transparency and ethical government.

Google 

Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, testified before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. I raised the issue of Google's discriminatory behavior online which favors Google products and harms consumers. I also had the chance to ask Mr. Pichai about Google’s work with China’s repressive government. I was disappointed that he didn’t take the opportunity to affirm that Google will not support China’s efforts to surveil their citizens and crack down on human rights.

Dear Friend, 
I'm back in Texas this weekend crisscrossing TX-23 after a busy, productive week in Congress delivering real results for South and West Texans. Take a look:  
It's official! The DHS Data Framework Act is off to the President's desk and will be my 13th piece of legislation signed into law since 2015. Glad my colleagues and I could get this bipartisan initiative to keep Americans safe across the finish line.  
￼ 
Food security is national security and depends on strong agricultural policy that provides certainty and stability for the 3.75 million Texans employed by the agricultural sector. I was proud to join my colleagues in supporting the bipartisan Farm Bill this week that does just that.  
￼ 
The Permian Basin energy sector employs 444,000 people, fuels ten percent of our state's economy and produces thirty percent of our nation's oil and gas. With production in the Permian projected to double in the next five years, it is imperative that West Texans have accommodate increasing traffic. That's why I'm proud to have helped secure funding for the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)'s Texas Energy Sector Rural Improvement Program, to improve roads impacted by the Permian Basin energy boom in Winkler, Reagan and Glasscock counties.  
￼ 
It's been an honor to chair the IT Subcommittee in Congress over the last four years. At my last hearing as Chair this week, we learned that bipartisan information technology policies have resulted in savings across the federal government of over $714 million in taxpayer dollars this year alone. I'll continue to find ways for the federal government to be more efficient and transparent for the American people. 
￼ 
I took some time this week to catch up with the Hondo Students Against Destructive Decisions (SADD) Chapter about their Traffic Safety Awareness Fair happening next Thursday from 9am - 12:30pm at the South Texas Regional Airport. As motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for teenagers across the nation, I applaud these students for educating their peers and keeping the Hondo community safe.  
￼ 
As always, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office with any questions or concerns. For continued updates on my work for you, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube at @HurdontheHill. 
Have a great weekend!
 Sincerely, 
 ￼

12/14/18 13:11,Blaine’s Bulletin: The Farm Bill is Headed to the President’s Desk,"￼ 
December 14, 2018

BLAINE'S BULLETIN

This holiday season, families across America will gather around the table to enjoy wonderful holiday meals with their loved ones. As Americans, we are very fortunate to enjoy access to the safest and most abundant food supply in the world. During this season of reflection and thankfulness we must remember the hardworking farmers who work day in and day out to put food on our tables and in our grocery stores.
Over the last few years, Missouri’s nearly 100,000 farms have faced drought conditions and tariff uncertainty. Congress faced an uphill battle as we sought to protect the programs that are working, while providing our farmers with meaningful reforms they desperately needed. After months of bipartisan negotiations to reauthorize the Farm Bill, it is finally headed to the President’s desk.
I was proud to support this legislation to provide the certainty Missouri farmers deserve while investing in the future of our rural communities. Missouri’s third congressional district will benefit from many of the provisions included in this package.
The 2018 Farm Bill safeguards crop insurance, provides additional funding for animal disease prevention, and supports agricultural trade and research. Protecting more than 290 million acres across the nation, crop insurance is a sound investment that supports America’s abundant food supply. I know our Missouri soybean farmers needed this certainty after the drought conditions they faced, and I’m happy we were able to protect the program and make additional reforms. In meetings over the last few years, I have also heard from dairy farmers across our state who were worried about animal disease prevention. Thankfully, the 2018 Farm Bill includes additional funding for animal disease prevention and management initiatives, including the stockpiling of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines. Finally, the 2018 Farm Bill provides more than $400 million dollars in additional funding for ag trade, along with increased funding for land grant universities and special research initiatives to ensure we have the best and safest crops.
Rural America is the heart of our nation and the heart of Missouri’s third district. The 2018 Farm Bill prioritizes our rural communities, strengthening the Department of Agriculture’s capacity to combat the opioid crisis and making significant investments in rural broadband infrastructure. Rural broadband availability is one of the top issues my constituents bring to my attention, and this legislation includes forward looking standards to meet the needs of rural communities across the nation.
This Christmas, farmers are receiving the gift of certainty with a Farm Bill that prioritizes rural America and supports our Missouri farmers. As we gather for our holiday celebrations, I hope we all have a greater appreciation of those who work day in and day out to feed our nation and the world.

News from Representative Lee Zeldin
￼
Dear Lindsey, 
￼
￼
￼
9/11 first responders should not be forced to come crawling back to Washington, D.C. again next year to plead their case as to why they are worthy of support they have earned. That's why, this week, I spoke on the House floor on behalf of our 9/11 first responders, victims, survivors, and their families calling for the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund to be fully funded at the beginning of 2019 so the fund can fulfill all claims and we can keep our promise to 9/11 victims and their loved ones. 
￼
Watch Rep. Zeldin’s remarks here. 
Below are my remarks as prepared for delivery:   
“I rise today on behalf of our 9/11 first responders and their families, urging all Members of Congress to support passage of the Never Forget the Heroes Act (H.R. 7062), which would permanently fund the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund and extend its authorization through 2090.   
“Regardless of party affiliation and regardless of which district or state you come from, it is imperative that right out of the gate of the next Congress starting next month that this new legislation is passed and sent to the President immediately to become law. 
“First responders who worked on the pile day and night, aiding in the search, rescue and clean up efforts were breathing in toxic debris and ash that are now known to have caused over 50 different types of cancer. 
“James Zadroga was one of those fearless leaders. He was also the first NYPD officer whose death in 2006 was connected to toxic exposure at the World Trade Center site. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act was later signed into law in 2011 to help our 9/11 first responders. 
“Five years later, the Zadroga Act was permanently reauthorized and included $4.6 billion for the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund over five-years, which was established to provide compensation for the victims of 9/11 and their families. However, we’re hearing from the Special Master of the fund that this funding “may be insufficient to compensate all claims.” 
“Representing a district just over 50 miles from Ground Zero, fighting for the Americans affected on September 11th isn’t just my job - it’s personal. Whether it’s losing a loved one or knowing someone who volunteered on the pile, each and everyone of my constituents - including myself - has been affected. 
“Before Congress passed the permanent reauthorization of the Zadroga Act, I vividly recall so many first responders who had fallen ill were forced to come to our nation’s capital and beg for the benefits they rightfully earned. 
“These 9/11 responders live not only in New York, but 433 of the 435 Congressional Districts across this country. 
“This isn’t just a New York issue, this isn’t a Democratic or Republican Party platform or political football, this is a responsibility we all shoulder as Americans first and foremost - it’s the spirit of our nation and it’s who we are as a people. 
“These were the very men and women who in the face of evil were willing to put it all on the line to help save their fellow Americans, who ran into the towers as everyone ran out. It is unconscionable that time and again they have been forced to come crawling to Washington, D.C. to plead their case as to why they were worthy of our support. 
It was heartbreaking and sickening, and I hope we have learned our lesson. 
“We must pass this legislation at the beginning of the 116th Congress so these first responders don’t have to go through this all again, so they can focus on their health and are not forced to travel to D.C. on their own dime dozens of times for the benefits they have more than earned. 
“This past September 11th, 17 years since the attacks, we came together as we always do to remember those who were taken from us on that day. But this year, marked an especially harrowing occasion. By the end of this year, it’s anticipated that more people will have died from 9/11 related illnesses than were killed on 9/11 and over 175 of those deaths occurred just this year. 
“Jimmy Martinez was one of those 175. Diagnosed with bone marrow cancer, he went into remission in 2016, a year after the Zadroga Act’s permanent reauthorization. He responded to the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center, again on 9/11 and came to the aid of so many in the aftermath of Super Storm Sandy. This August, he died a 26-year veteran of the FDNY. 
“Just as there were so many who fought for the Zadroga Act that were not here to fight for its reauthorization in 2015, Jimmy is just one of the so many who are unable to continue this fight today. 
“That’s why it’s up to us - to fight for others like Jimmy, for those who risked so much for us, but need our help. 
“Congress must take action to ensure every family receives the compensation they are entitled to as soon as possible - they have earned nothing less. 
“On that horrific day, in the face of the worst of humanity, these men and women were the best of it. 
“In honor of them and the families who carry on their memory, Congress must do its job and permanently fund the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund. 
“In the aftermath of 9/11 we vowed we’d never forget, and I’m going to make sure of it.”

SUCCESS STORY: JASON OLIVER
 Earlier this year, Jason and Maigan Oliver were vacationing in Cancun, Mexico when Jason suddenly became disoriented. They went to a hospital in Cancun but received confusing information about Jason’s treatment and the associated costs. Additionally, an important test to help determine whether Jason could fly home kept getting pushed back. Our office was made aware of the situation on October 13th. After talking with Maigan, Jeremy, a constituent services representative in my office, placed a call to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico. The Embassy immediately contacted Maigan to provide her with additional information and resources and also made contact with the hospital. Subsequently, the critical test was moved to the next day and Jason was able to fly home to Colorado on October 17th. 
￼
“We are so grateful for my restored health and the incredible amount of assistance we had along the way! Thank you again to you, your office, and Congressman Perlmutter for the fast and extremely effective assistance in getting us home! It is something that we will remember with tremendous gratitude forever!”  - Jason Oliver
“After I received a call from Jeremy, I began to feel some hope in the situation! Shortly after, I then received a call from the Embassy and they asked me what I needed and I simply said “tests to determine his fly status”. Then on Monday, the test that were said to be Friday originally were moved to Tuesday. Those tests said there was no reason he couldn’t fly and we booked the first flight we could. We’re so incredibly blessed to have such amazing friends, family and community support to us!”  - Maigan Oliver

Dear Friends, 

After months of jockeying, hand wringing, and horse trading largely behind closed doors, this week Congress passed another disappointing Farm Bill agreement that does more of the same. It unfortunately is a missed opportunity to provide American families with desperately needed reforms that impact health care, climate change, economic development, and the food we eat.  
 
Instead of developing more ambitious, equitable, and cost-effective legislation like our proposed Food and Farm Act, their agreement continues to fail family farmers and ranchers, vulnerable communities, and the environment. I spent three years listening to the needs of farmers around the country and this bill does not address those needs. This bill cuts an important conservation program and provides subsidies to non-farming cousins, nieces and nephews. 
 
Every day that we continue the status quo, we delay improving and enriching communities, and helping families live healthier lives. We can and must do better to help increase access to healthy food for all families.  This final bill fundamentally misses the mark on addressing critical reforms that communities across the country desperately need. Americans deserve a Farm Bill that works for them and their families—not corporate mega farms. I will continue to lead the opposition to the current Farm Bill structure, fighting instead for a better outcome for all Americans.

Courage, 
￼

House Passes Key Foreign Affairs Resolutions Salute: Kaywin Feldman, First Female Director of the National Gallery of Art “115th Congress set a high standard” Worth a read: 'I'm not a hero. It's the boys that crashed,' says 101 year-old Army Air Force Veteran
House Passes Key Foreign Affairs Resolutions
This week, in some of the final actions of the 115th Congress, the House of Representatives approved a number of critical resolutions expressing our steadfast support for critical allies, as well as, freedom and democracy around the globe.
First, the House passed, with my strong support, H. Res. 1149, which recognizes that the United States-Republic of Korea (ROK) alliance serves as a linchpin of regional stability and bilateral security, and exemplifies the broad and deep military, diplomatic, economic and cultural ties shared between the U.S. and the ROK.  South Korea is one of the United States' most important strategic and economic partners. The U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty, signed in 1953 at the end of the Korean War, is imperative to protecting our nation and stabilizing the region, particularly from North Korea and today, we have approximately 30,000 men and women of our armed forces serving in the ROK.
The House also passed H. Res. 1165, which condemns the Assad regime and its backers for their continued support of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria. For seven years, we have watched the brutal dictator Bashar al-Assad inflict untold suffering on the Syrian people. Since the outbreak of the conflict, half a million people have been killed and 13 million – including women and children – remain in dire need of basic humanitarian assistance in Syria. The Assad regime and its allies, including the Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah, have used chemical warfare, barrel bombed civilians, and used starvation as a weapon against the Syrian people. This resolution represents broad, bipartisan agreement that there will be no peace in Syria as long as the Assad regime remains in power, and as long as Russia and Iran continue their entrenchment in that country.
Next, H. Res. 1162  was approved, which renews calls for Russia to end hostilities that violate Ukraine’s sovereignty and reaffirms the House’s commitment to Ukraine’s independence and security, and urges the president to hold Russia accountable for its aggressive behavior. Passage of the resolution comes in the wake of Russia’s seizure last month of Ukrainian ships and crew in the Azov Sea. I have long considered Russian aggression against Ukraine’s sovereign territory and its people to be a serious threat against the West.  I have taken a leadership role to ensure the United States provides significant assistance to Ukraine and its people!
Finally, in an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 394 to 1, the U.S. House approved H. Res. 1091, declaring crimes against Burma’s Rohingya Muslim minority to be genocide. The Burmese military and security forces have unleashed a targeted campaign against the Rohingya people – killing unarmed civilians, raping women and children, burning down villages, and planting landmines along border areas transited by refugees fleeing for their lives. It is imperative that the persecuted Rohingya know that the U.S. stands with them and recognizes the terrible crimes that are committed against them. Further, the legislation calls for additional sanctions on senior members of the Burmese military and security forces who are responsible for genocide and human rights abuses.
 
Salute: Kaywin Feldman, First Female Director of the National Gallery of Art
This week, the National Gallery of Art Board of Trustees elected Kaywin Feldman as its fifth director, and the first women to lead the institution. Originally from Boston, Massachusetts, Kaywin Feldman currently serves as the Nivin and Duncan MacMillan Director and President of the Minneapolis Institute of Art and will take over at the Gallery in March.
You can read more about this historic announcement in Peggy McGlone’s Washington Post Article.
I would also like to congratulate the outgoing Director of the Gallery, Earl A. “Rusty” Powell III.  Under Rusty’s 26 years of leadership, every division at the Gallery has experienced tremendous growth and contributed to art historical scholarship, conservation, and museology at the highest standard of excellence. Since Powell's first year as director in 1992, the Gallery has welcomed more than 122 million visitors.
With more than 150,000 works of art, from the Middles Ages to the present day, the National Gallery of Art is a “must see” when you are in Washington D.C. For more information on visiting the Gallery please visit here.
 
“115th Congress set a high standard”
As a lifetime member of the American Legion, I was extremely pleased to read National Commander Brett P. Reistad latest column, “115th Congress set a high standard”, praising the bipartisan work of this Congress to improve the lives of the men and women who have served our nation.
We have no greater responsibility than to ensure our veterans have the benefits and care they were promised.  In the 115th Congress, through my role as Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I have worked to ensure the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), has the resources to deliver on this promise. Under my leadership drafting our annual spending bills, the VA has received historic funding to support the timely and efficient delivery of health care and benefits.
Specifically, in the FY 2019 Milcon/VA bill, which was approved by Congress and signed into law in September, the VA was provided $86.5 billion in discretionary, full-year funding, an increase of $5 billion from FY 2018. This funding will support care at VA Medical Centers at Lyons and East Orange and the Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) in Morris Township and Newton.
To read Commander Reistad’s entire column please visit here.

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
This week, Senator Baldwin continued her work to hold prescription drug companies accountable for skyrocketing drug prices and called on the CEO of Pfizer to provide an explanation after the company announced they intended to increase the cost of 41 prescription drugs starting in January. 
“I am disappointed that your company has decided to continue playing political games and to raise prices once again in January instead of making a commitment to permanently reduce prescription drug prices for millions of families struggling to afford needed medications,” said Senator Baldwin to Pfizer CEO Ian Read. 
The partisan tax legislation signed into law last December gave permanent tax breaks to corporations such as Pfizer. Since then, Pfizer has received almost $11 billion in tax benefits and announced more than $10 billion in stock buybacks - largely benefiting top executives and wealthy shareholders as prescription drug prices continue to rise for Wisconsin families. 
Pfizer and many other companies instituted price hikes on prescription drugs after the corporate tax cut became law. In January of this year, Pfizer instituted 116 price hikes. Then on July 1, Pfizer increased prices for the second time on many prescription drugs by nearly 10 percent. Days later, Pfizer issued a puzzling statement that they would return the prices of over 40 prescription drugs “to their pre-July 1 levels as soon as technically possible” but only until the end of the year or until the President’s prescription drug “Blueprint” is implemented. 
Senator Baldwin then called on Pfizer to make those price reductions permanent. Instead, Pfizer is increasing prices again rather than lowering costs for Wisconsin consumers.  
“I have heard from countless Wisconsinites who are struggling to afford medications that they have relied on for years as major drug companies continue to systematically raise drug prices with no transparency or accountability. That is why I have offered a bipartisan solution, the FAIR Drug Pricing Act, to institute basic transparency for drug companies that raise prices,” said Senator Baldwin. 
In 2017, Senator Baldwin and the late Senator John McCain introduced the bipartisan FAIR Drug Pricing Act, which would begin to address high prescription drug prices and hold pharmaceutical companies accountable by requiring transparency for drug companies that plan to increase drug prices. The bill would not prohibit manufacturers from increasing prices, but it would, for the first time, give taxpayers notice of price increases and bring basic transparency to the market for prescription drugs. 
Earlier this year, Senators Baldwin and McCain also sent a letter to President Trump urging him to hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable and make good on his promise to lower the skyrocketing prescription drug prices that American families are struggling to afford. 
Read Senator Baldwin’s letter to Pfizer CEO Ian Read and learn more about her work to hold prescription drug companies accountable for skyrocketing drug prices here.

Dear Friend, 
As your Representative in Congress for New Jersey’s Ninth Congressional District, I always want to keep you informed about my work in Washington and in New Jersey. 
New Members in the New Jersey Delegation 
 ￼
From left to right, Congressman Donald Norcross (D-NJ), Congressman-elect Jeff Van Drew, Congressman Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ), Congresswoman-elect Mikie Sherrill, Congressman-elect Thomas Malinowski, Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ), Congressman Albio Sires, Congressman Bill Pascrell, Jr., Congressman-elect Andy Kim, Congressman Donald Payne, Jr. 
After this year’s midterm election, I was proud to sit down with the new members of New Jersey’s delegation. With the incoming Democratic majority and four new members in the delegation, I am excited for the future of our state. I look forward to fighting side-by-side with my new colleagues to improve health care, roll back the harmful tax policies of the GOP Tax Scam, and improve our transportation infrastructure for all New Jerseyans. This group is going to do big things together and fight for New Jersey’s seat at the table in Washington, D.C. 
￼

Undoing the GOP Tax Scam 
As New Jersey’s only member on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, I strongly opposed the Republican’s latest tax scam that pummeled New Jerseyans and millions of other middle-class Americans to give more money to millionaires and big corporations. Voters in New Jersey and other high-tax states across the country that were targeted by the Republican tax bill sent a clear message in November.
Among the most egregious offenses, this new bill would make permanent the harmful caps on the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction. Just as table salt enriches our food, the SALT deduction enriches our communities. To highlight the importance of this deduction, Congressman Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) and I stood in front of Ramsey’s salt depot to kick off our fight to restore this deduction for New Jersey families. 
 ￼
From left, local officials, Rep. Bill Pascrell, Jr., Rep. Josh Gottheimer, and Mayor Deirdre Dillon in Ramsey talking about the importance of the SALT deduction
According to 2016 Internal Revenue Service data, middle-class New Jerseyans enjoyed State and Local Tax (SALT) deductions on average of at least $10,000 in 20 of 21 counties in our state. In our district, the average SALT deduction was $14,491 in Hudson County, $14,714 in Passaic County, and $24,783 in Bergen County. For decades, our communities have relied on this deduction to protect their own revenue for local needs like roads, schools, and police. Homeowners have relied on it to offset their high property taxes, which I don’t have to tell you are some of the highest in the nation. In their tax scam, Congressional Republicans stole this valuable deduction from our state to convert it into tax cuts for corporations. The fight to restore this deduction is far from over – we are just getting started. 
You can read more about our efforts here. 
Fairness for Toys “R” Us Workers 
For months, Senator Robert Menendez and Senator Cory Booker and I have decried the lack of support for Toys “R” Us employees and their families. We pounded the pavement when we learned the iconic New Jersey-based retailer was being forced into bankruptcy following a leveraged buyout that saddled it with exorbitant debt.  
Back in March, Toys “R” Us announced it would be closing its stores and laying off all 33,000 of its workers, including more than 1,500 in New Jersey. But while the company was being destroyed, the Wall Street firms and creditors that bought it made out like bandits. At the same time, Toys “R” Us stated in a letter to its workers that it would not pay severance to any employees. 
 ￼
 Rep. Bill Pascrell, Jr. demands answers for workers in front of Toys “R” Us in Totowa
While the dismissals of Toys “R” Us workers was simply shameful, the private equity companies responsible for the leveraged buyout recently announced they were rolling out a fund to compensate the many Toys “R” Us workers who unjustly lost their jobs. This is an important first step in justice for the workers who built a great New Jersey company. I was proud to stand with Senators Booker and Menendez in demanding severance for these workers.
You can read more about how Toys “R” Us workers are being compensated here. 
Be assured that I will continue working to assist you with any federal issues. My first priority in Congress is representing the people of Northern New Jersey, so please continue to contact me to express your views and ideas.

Dear Neighbor, 
The deadline to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act is December 15.
To sign up for coverage, visit www.healthcare.gov. Right now is the only period during which you can select new health insurance in the federal marketplace or change coverage options for 2019. 
Signing up for health coverage is often much easier and cheaper than people think. Most Americans qualify for financial help and as many as 8 in 10 people can receive coverage for less than $75 per month. You can also get free local help at localhelp.healthcare.gov. 
Health care continues to be one of my top priorities, and I strongly believe that coverage must be accessible, affordable, and comprehensive. 
If you have any questions about these or other topics, please contact the staff in my District Office at 321-388-9808 or my D.C. Office at 202-225-2176.

No Seismic Testing Off Our Beaches
￼  
Earlier this month, I shared my concern over efforts to conduct seismic testing - the first step to offshore drilling - off our Atlantic Coast. Last week, I authored a bipartisan letter with 92 of my colleagues to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross urging that they not allow seismic testing to move forward in the Atlantic. This is a matter of protecting not only vulnerable marine mammals and fisheries, but also naval operations, our coastal communities, and our national security. I am encouraged by the strong showing of bipartisan opposition to opening the Atlantic to seismic testing.

Legislative Update
On Tuesday, I voted to support H. Res. 1165, a House resolution which publicly condemns the Assad regime and its supporters for their continued support of war crimes and atrocities committed against the Syrian people. For several years, the reign of Assad in Syria has led to the death of countless civilians and endless violence in Syria. This abuse from Assad must end. 
On Wednesday, I voted to pass H.R. 2, the 2018 Farm Bill. This important bipartisan legislation attacks fraud and abuse while supporting our farmers and agriculture industry, which is critical to the Florida economy. The House also passed H.R. 1318, the Preventing Maternal Death Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor. This bill supports states in their efforts to protect the health of mothers during pregnancy, childbirth, and in the postpartum period by helping to identify means of improving both health care quality and outcomes for mothers. 
Yesterday, I voted for H.Res. 1091, a House resolution that urges the government of Burma to release two journalists who have been sentenced to seven years in jail for simply doing their jobs – investigating attacks against civilians by Burma's military and security forces. A free press is fundamental to supporting human rights and holding governments accountable for their actions.

Conaway Chronicle: Farm Bill Passes Congress, Heads to President Trump's Desk, House Passes George W. Bush Childhood Home Act, House Passes Resolution to Oppose Nord Stream II
__________________________________________


Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress and the 11th District. 

Farm Bill Passes Congress, Heads to President Trump's Desk

House Republicans refused to stop fighting for rural America and this week, we approved a bill that sets us on a better path – for farmers and ranchers, for rural communities, and for the American consumer. I am proud of the work we have done to fight for the hard-working farm and ranch families who feed and clothe this nation, to fight for better policy that strengthens the farm safety net and our rural communities, improves conservation initiatives, expands exports, and enhances the integrity of our nutrition programs.

I’ve maintained from the beginning that this farm bill ought to be about standing up for America’s farm and ranch families who are going through some very hard times. And we have kept faith with that commitment. Farm country and rural America will be better off under this farm bill than they were before. I want to thank our leadership in the House, Secretary Perdue and President Trump. Because of our work this year, rural America and farm and ranch country know we have their backs.

￼


House Passes George W. Bush Childhood Home Act

George W. Bush’s childhood home in Midland, Texas is a piece of our nation’s history. Two Presidents, two governors, and a first lady have called this house their home. As the nation mourns the passing of George Herbert Walker Bush, our 41st President, we are especially reminded of the importance of preserving living landmarks for future generations.

Monday, the House of Representatives passed my bill, H.R. 3008, the George W. Bush Childhood Home Study Act. This legislation, which passed 382-4-2, aims to preserve the Midland home of the Bush family as a national landmark. 

Currently open to the public as a museum, my legislation will work to protect the home as a national historic landmark. I’m grateful for the outpouring of support this bill received, which will ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to be inspired by the lives of the Bush family.

House Passes Resolution to Oppose Nord Stream II

Vladimir Putin is once again attempting to flex Russia’s energy muscle to exert control over Western Europe through the construction of Nord Stream II, an underwater gas pipeline that would connect the Russian Federation to Germany through the Baltic Sea. Despite a 55 billion cubic meter surplus in existing transit lines through Ukraine, Russia is determined to build a pipeline that would be 100 percent Russian owned and operated by a company whose chairman is currently sanctioned by the United States. 

Tuesday, the House of Representatives unanimously passed H. Res. 1035, a resolution I authored to express opposition to the completion of Nord Stream II. 

Russia has continually defied global norms, sovereign boarders, and international law. We would be foolish to allow Vladimir Putin a stronger grip on our European allies and the global energy market.

My speech on the House Floor in support of H. Res. 1035 can be found here.

Fighting for Ohio GM Workers 

 ￼
  ￼
  ￼
  ￼
If you love this country, you fight for the people who make it work – people like the workers at Lordstown. 

That’s why last week, Senator Portman and I met with General Motors CEO Mary Barra and demanded answers, calling on GM to work with us to find solutions and save Ohio jobs, after GM announced it would lay off its final shift of workers and close its Lordstown plant in March of 2019.

That decision came on the heels of GM’s announcement this summer that it would lay off the second shift of workers at the plant, on the very same day that we got word that GM plans to build its new Chevy Blazer in Mexico.

During last week’s meeting, we urged Barra to work with us to save these Ohio jobs, and consider retooling the Lordstown plant to build a new vehicle. We know Ohio workers are the best in the world – the plant was rated the top GM plant in North America by J.D. Power and Associates this year.

Ohio has stood by GM. And now GM needs to stand by Ohio, and the workers who make their company successful.

The Mahoning Valley isn’t giving up. The community is waging a grassroots campaign with labor and business and local leaders to make it clear to GM how vital this plant and the entire Ohio supply chain is. I stood with them last month as they launched that effort. 

And I spoke to President Trump, and called on him to join us in working to save these jobs, and support my American Cars, American Jobs Act. 

The bill has two simple parts: it gives customers a discount when they buy American-made cars, like those built in Lordstown, and it gets rid of incentives that reward car companies for sending jobs overseas. 

Communities like the Mahoning Valley trusted Donald Trump when he said in 2016, “If I’m elected, you won’t lose one plant, you’ll have plants coming into this country…I promise you that.”

If he meant that, I’m calling on the president – help us pass the American Cars, American Jobs Act.

Let’s end the tax cut for corporations that shut down these American plants and move American jobs overseas, and let’s keep workers on the job in Lordstown.

Sherrod

Weekly Update From Congresswoman Anna G. Eshoo 
Highlights of Legislation the House Took up This Week 
Passed S. 3029, the Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early (PREEMIE) Reauthorization Act 
This week the House passed my legislation to reduce infant deaths related to premature births, defined as a birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy, and it will now be sent to the President for his signature. This bipartisan, bicameral bill will reauthorize legislation I shepherded into law in 2006.
This bill specifically expands research, education and intervention activities aimed at preventing premature births. Every year in the U.S., ten percent of babies are born prematurely, placing them and their mothers at an increased risk of complicated health problems. Since this legislation became law in 2006, the PREEMIE Act has helped researchers and doctors identify the causes of premature births and work to prevent them. The number of preterm births decreased from 2007 to 2014, but they’ve begun to rise again. I look forward to the President signing this reauthorization into law to ensure that every child has a healthy start to life. 
Passed S. 428, the Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids Act (ACE Kids Act)  
This week the House passed legislation that will advance care for the sickest children who are Medicaid beneficiaries. Children with complex medical conditions require a multi-pronged level of health services which are expensive and difficult for families to coordinate. The ACE Kids Act aims to better coordinate this care while reducing overall Medicaid spending by creating a Medicaid care coordination program. Every state program will be specifically tailored to fit each child’s needs and will provide families with a care coordinator. This legislation is based on existing programs that save money by decreasing hospital visits and improving care. I salute the work of Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital on this issue and I look forward to the President signing this legislation into law.
Voted NO on a Rule Blocking the House from Voting on Resolution to withdraw U.S. forces from the conflict in Yemen 
The ongoing civil war and humanitarian crisis in Yemen is horrendous. Since the war in Yemen began in 2015, at least 6,000 civilians have been killed and 10,000 injured. A recent report by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) Group of Experts found that the Saudi-led coalition which the U.S. supports, has committed acts including rape and the use of child soldiers, that likely amount to war crimes.
This week the Senate sent a powerful message to the Administration by voting on a Resolution to withdraw U.S. forces from the conflict in Yemen. Unfortunately, the Speaker of the House prevented any Resolution related to the war in Yemen from being brought directly to the full House for a vote during the remainder of this Congress. 
Legislation Anna Cosponsored This Week 
Introduced H.R. 7277, the Prevention of Unconstitutional War with Iran Act 
In my view, the President’s decision to walk away from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran represented an abdication of U.S. leadership. Since he withdrew the U.S. from the agreement, he has made repeated threats to wage war on Iran. 
This week I introduced the Prevention of Unconstitutional War with Iran Act, legislation prohibiting the use of any funds for military operations in or against Iran without Congressional authorization. This legislation guarantees that any decision to take military action against Iran must first be authorized by Congress which has the sole authority to declare war under Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution. 
Letters Anna Wrote and Cosigned this Week 
Letter to the Trump Administration Urging Action on Climate Change 
During the Thanksgiving holiday, the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) released an assessment that is the most comprehensive, science-based evaluation of the consequences of climate change, the risks of inaction and potential adaptation strategies for the United States to date. The assessment adds to the overwhelming research indicating that the consequences of inaction on climate change will be serious and swift. Sadly, the President has dismissed the report and questioned the validity of climate science.
This week I joined colleagues in writing to the President urging him to address climate change in response to the assessment. To read the full letter, CLICK HERE.  
Letter to the State Department Opposing Closure of Bay Area Refugee Resettlement Agencies 
Refugee resettlement has been a cornerstone of American foreign policy for decades. Historically, the U.S. has admitted an average of about 80,000 refugees annually, but for Fiscal Year 2019 the Trump Administration has set a historically low ceiling of 30,000 refugees. This means that resettlement agencies, including nine in the Bay Area, will have to close their affiliates and further reduce staffing. 
I joined colleagues this week in writing to the Secretary of State, urging him to reconsider these short-sighted cuts and instead utilize the full capacity of these agencies. Resettlement agencies have helped nearly all refugees find jobs, provide training to establish new businesses, and helped children enroll in schools. These agencies work hard to ensure that each refugee becomes economically self-sufficient and proud American citizens who can fully contribute to their new nation. To read the full letter, CLICK HERE.  
In the Words of My Constituents 
Every week hundreds of my constituents call and write to me to express their concerns, share their passions and ask questions regarding a wide range of legislation and policies. I actually read every communication and every constituent receives a personal response from me regarding their specific questions and comments.
Here’s a snapshot of the issues constituents wrote and called me about this week:    
·         294 constituents wrote to me to express their support for the Green New Deal. 
·         40 constituents wrote to me to express their support for H.R. 1847, the Prevent All Soring Tactics (PAST) Act which takes significant steps to halt the disturbing practice known as ""horse soring.” Horse soring involves the intentional infliction of pain to a horse's legs or hooves in order to force the horse to perform an artificial, exaggerated gait.
·         22 constituents wrote to me about their concerns with funding for the U.S. border wall.  
Weekly Highlights 
This week the Communications and Technology Subcommittee held a hearing on the RAY BAUM’S Act, which reauthorizes the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). This law makes the FCC more transparent, efficient, and modern, strengthens our nation’s critical telecommunications services. I’m especially proud to have two bills I wrote and have championed for many years included in this legislation: ‘Dig Once’ and the RESPONSE Act. Both bills are commonsense and won’t cost a dime.
My ‘Dig Once’ policy will help eliminate the need to dig up recently-paved roads to expand broadband infrastructure, significantly reducing the cost of increasing Internet access to rural communities across the country.  
The RESPONSE Act will provide first responders with the precise location of a 9-1-1 caller, whether they’re on the 20th floor of a hotel or the 30th story of an office building. Every second counts to save lives during emergencies, and location technology is essential for first responders to get to those in danger as quickly as possible. 
Anna’s Recommended Reading 
I frequently read articles or see videos I think my constituents would benefit from.   
Time Magazine Person of the Year (2018) “The Guardians and the War on Truth”  
This year Time Magazine chose slain journalist Jamal Khashoggi and staff members of the Capital Gazette of Annapolis, Maryland, along with journalists punished for attempting to report facts as their Time Person of the Year for 2018. Time calls them the ""Guardians"" in a struggle against lies and misinformation that has pit news agencies against political groups and governments.

Dear Lindsey,
I know it may be hard to believe, but I actually have some good news to report from Washington.
This week, we passed the Farm Bill, which is a bill Congress is supposed to pass every five years to guide our nation’s agriculture and nutrition policy. One of its most important parts is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which literally puts food on the table for our nation’s neediest and is one of our most effective anti-hunger programs. Originally, House Republicans tried to make deep cuts to SNAP that would have kicked millions of low-income families off the program with no other way to put food on their table. I, and every other Democrat, refused to go along, and I am proud to say that bill we passed this week rejected all of these cuts and even found ways to invest nearly $1 billion in additional support for food banks nationwide, the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, the SNAP Employment and Training program, and in incentives for healthier eating for SNAP beneficiaries.
I’m also proud to report that the House and Senate have finally agreed on a final bill to contend with Congress’s own #MeToo problem. With this legislation, we are creating a fair process for Capitol Hill staffers to come forward with allegations of sexual harassment and assault and enacting tougher punishments for perpetrators. This means that House of Representatives staff will now have access to House counsel, have a dedicated advocate to guide them through the process before making a formal complaint, and be able to work remotely or request paid leave without fear of retribution. It also requires public reporting of any settlements and identifying if a Member of Congress was personally liable. It also importantly requires that Representatives and Senators use their own money for harassment and retaliation settlements, instead of misusing taxpayer money.
I will return to Washington, DC next week in the hopes of voting on bills to keep the government open and funded. Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi made it clear in the Oval Office this week that there are several reasonable options on the table to prevent a shutdown. Republicans in Congress would be wise to ignore the President’s desire for a shutdown and work with us to keep the government open and serving the people.  
As always, your concerns remain my top priority. Please do not hesitate to reach out to my office via my website to share your thoughts.
Sincerely,
￼

Dear Lindsey,
 As you may know, the Farm Bill, which expired on October 1 of this year, came to the House floor again for a vote this week. 
Agriculture has always been an integral part of North Carolina's history and economy, and the Farm Bill plays a crucial role in supporting our farmers and ranchers—improving quality of life, and addressing food insecurity, which impacts more than one in six North Carolinian families.  Although I do not serve on the Agriculture Committee which oversees the Farm Bill, as our state’s only member of the Appropriations Committee, I have advocated for robust funding for anti-hunger initiatives, agricultural research, and rural development programs that benefit our state.  In the current Congress, I have also cosponsored legislation to increase Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits (H.R. 1276, the “Closing the Meal Gap Act”) and to invest more in organic agriculture (H.R. 2436, the “Organic Agriculture Research Act”). 
The Farm Bill that came to the House floor for a vote on December 12 was a result of extensive bipartisan negotiation and compromise. I’m pleased that harmful provisions in the original House version that would have drastically reduced SNAP benefits and funding for conservation programs were ultimately omitted from the final legislation. The bipartisan bill, which I’m proud to have voted for, protects SNAP benefits for American families, maintains critical funding for farming conservation programs, supports cutting edge federal agricultural research, and strengthens rural development programs across the country. 
As your member of Congress, you can rest assured that I will continue to protect anti-hunger programs, advocate for our farmers and ranchers, and support legislation that will improve the lives of all North Carolinians. 
To stay in touch regarding agriculture policy and many other important issues, please connect with me on Facebook and Twitter or subscribe to my e-newsletter.

Sincerely,

Honoring Our Veterans 
           ￼ 
Dear Friends,  
As a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, I learn every week about the bravery of our military service members. The sacrifices they make to defend our freedom are truly awe inspiring, and we owe them an immeasurable debt. From the earliest days of the Republic, caring for our returning soldiers has been a sacred duty of Congress. And while it is important that we take the time to demonstrate our appreciation throughout the year, each Veterans Day is a special opportunity to show our gratitude to the thousands of veterans who reside here in Rhode Island.  
November 11 was chosen as Veterans Day because it is the day World War One ended, and this year’s commemorations were particularly poignant as they fell on the 100th anniversary of that armistice. Over the weekend, I joined several of my colleagues in federal and state government at the WaterFire Salute to Veterans lighting ceremony. This particular edition of one of Rhode Island’s iconic traditions served as a fitting tribute to those who have served in uniform. I also had the pleasure of participating in the North Kingstown Veterans Day Parade. From Wickford Village to North Kingstown High School, it was wonderful to see so many Rhode Islanders on the parade route.  
More recently, I was pleased to help usher legislation through the House of Representatives to memorialize Army Captain Matthew J. August, a North Kingstown native who was tragically killed in action when his convoy was ambushed in 2004. Captain August was the first Rhode Islander to be killed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. This legislation will designate the post office in Saunderstown as the “Captain Matthew J. August Post Office” in his honor.  
If you are a veteran in need of assistance with your benefits, I encourage you to call my Rhode Island office at (401) 732-9400. For more information on veterans’ issues and my visits around the Second District, please visit my website and follow me on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.  
            Sincerely,  
           ￼

Getting Down to Small Business 
Small businesses are the heart and soul of retail districts here in the Ocean State. On “Small Business Saturday,” I joined the Rhode Island SBA and my colleagues in the federal delegation to celebrate the local shops and restaurants that line the Main Streets of communities across the state. Shopping small is a great way to support the local economy and find unique gifts for your loved ones this holiday season. 
  
￼ 
Reducing Waste 
The Center for EcoTechnology was recently awarded a federal grant to help address the issue of food waste in Rhode Island. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, up to 40% of the food in the country goes uneaten. This grant will help restaurants and other businesses find cost-effective ways to reduce this waste through composting or programs aimed at battling food insecurity.

Talofa Lindsey,

Congress is wrapping up 2018 after an eventful year, and I wanted to report back once more before we start the new 116th Congress in January with our priorities for American Samoa. 

We always have Veterans’ legislation moving through Congress, and this time of year is no exception. Much of this activity is dedicated to continuing bipartisan VA reforms based on the comprehensive VA MISSION Act which became law this year to ensure future services are available and prompt. Our Veterans should have confidence in these federal programs for their well-being and health, and in American Samoa – where our Veterans travel long distances for many services – there are long term needs for better facilities and access.
﻿
A personal highlight recently has been the opportunity to congratulate two of our own from American Samoa, retiring after lengthy and impressive careers in the U.S. Army. Chief Warrant Officer Taufaga’afa Lincoln P. Glenister served under seven U.S. Presidents in over 40 years, and Master Sergeant Christabel “Chris” Lupetaliaami Jennings Joyner retired after 26 years of service and deployments. It’s a privilege to serve on the Committee that oversees our nation’s commitments to our Veterans through these legislative efforts to reduce VA wait times and improve claim responses. Read more about our oversight of the VA’s implementation of new laws. 


Soifua,

￼

Congress Honors Our 41st President
￼

Former President George H. W. Bush lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda. 

Legislative efforts in Congress came to a halt last week for something even more important, the national remembrance of former President George H. W. Bush. The House passed House Resolution 1167 to express “profound regret and sorrow” as “the House tenders our deepest sympathies to the family.” Congress hosted former Presidents and dignitaries to honor his many decades of service. He was at one point the youngest Navy pilot as he served in combat in World War II, then went on to remarkable public service, including Director of the CIA, envoy to China, Ambassador to the UN, Vice President and President. Following the invasion of Kuwait, he united much of the world in an international coalition to liberate Kuwait, and he was President during the historic fall of the Berlin Wall. Last week, Congress commemorated this extraordinary role in our national history, as thousands of Americans lined up to view President Bush lying in State in the Capitol. 

This year, Congress also paid tribute to the memory Senator John McCain of Arizona, another Veteran with heroic wartime service followed by lengthy public service. Congress passed House Concurrent Resolution 140 to commemorate his contribution to our nation and the causes of human rights and peace, and named in his honor the Defense Authorization Act which secured a pay raise for our troops. 
﻿
Finally, the House Natural Resources Committee, on which I serve, paused recently under the leadership of Chairman Rod Bishop to remember the life of Utah’s longest-serving Congressman, Rep. James “Jim” Hansen, who started his life of service with a stint in the Navy and a two-year mission for his faith, and ended his public role as Chairman of the Natural Resources Committee. We also honored Rep. Hansen in the Western Caucus, a group which he led and started in his time in Congress.
￼

Pacific World War II Heritage
￼

￼

American Samoa’s own Peter Tali Coleman, pictured here in the U.S. Army in World War II, is a Pearl Harbor survivor.

On December 7th, as we do each year, the nation commemorated Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, and in American Samoa our history includes the presence of American Samoa’s first Governor, Tali P.T. Coleman, on Oahu during the attack, and my statement on the 73rd V-J Day recalls American Samoa’s role in World War II. 

﻿Recently, Congress passed a bill to establish Pearl Harbor National Memorial and the Honouliuli National Historic Site. I cosponsored and voted for this legislation in the Natural Resources Committee, called the World War II Pacific Sites Establishment Act (H.R. 5706). 
￼

News to Know 
￼

Airport and Infrastructure

In October, the President signed our cabotage bill for American Samoa into law following passage by both houses of Congress. Over time, this change to regulations will help hold down costs for our people as they travel among the islands. This dovetails with recent federal action to invest $23 million in better pavement at our Pago Pago International Airport. American Samoa’s population, combined with our economic and geographic isolation, necessitate dependence on federal backing for our regular programs and especially infrastructure enhancements, often through federal grants. The role of Congress is to authorize and appropriate funds for the departments and agencies, which then follow Congressionally established priorities to distribute funds. 
￼

Fishing and Environment

This week, the House passed a bill which I cosponsored that establishes more funding support for coral reef preservation. The bill asserts each Territory’s right to determine for themselves whether to consider offshore wind energy. I support our friends in these other Territories in this legislation, and the bill confirms an important principle that our Territory and our people are the ones who should decide when it comes to any offshore wind proposals in the future. American Samoa recently received federal funds for coral reef preservation efforts. In November, the House Natural Resources Committee passed a bill I recently introduced (H.R. 5025) to put sensible time limits on any government fines and penalties for fishing vessels. These limits are important to address violations in a timely way for the protection of workers. 
￼

Constituent Services
￼

We’re proud of our high rate of Armed Forces enlistment in American Samoa. As always, our office each year seeks highly qualified applications for the nation’s service academies. If you’re a parent, teacher or student don’t forget to be thinking about participating in the Congressional Art Competition! Finally, we also have a very specific eligibility for a service-disabled Veteran for a potential two-year fellowship in the District Office working with our large population of Veterans. To qualify, veterans must meet all the following requirements: 

• Honorably discharged, released from active duty within the last five years 

• Terminal pay grades at or below E-5 or O-3, 

• 20% or greater service connected disabilities (waived if you have a Purple Heart). 

Veterans who are in receipt of a 20-year or Temporary Early Retirement Authorization (TERA) retirement are not eligible for the program. Interested veterans should go to https://www.usajobs.gov/ and search “Wounded Warrior Fellowship Program” for more information and how to apply. Please address any questions to the points of contact below. Mac Tolar, Director, Wounded Warrior Program, U.S. House of Representatives 202-226-1965; or Solomon “Sol” Jennings IV, Program Manager 202-226-1944, or their email address housewoundedwarriors@mail.house.gov. 
￼

A Congressional Tradition
￼

Each year, Congress beautifies the Capitol grounds with a special tree selected by the Architect of the Capitol with the aid of the U.S. Forest Service. This year’s is an 80-foot noble fir tree brought all the way across the U.S. mainland from the West Coast in Oregon’s Willamette National Forest to the East Coast. On December 6th, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan presided over the tree lighting and unveiling.

Dear Lindsey,   It has been an extraordinary honor to serve the residents of central and northwest Connecticut as their Representative in the U.S. House of Representatives over the last 6 years. Earlier this week, for the last time as a Member of Congress, I went to the well of the House and offered my final floor speech.  I wanted to make sure that you had an opportunity to see it.

Thank you to my constituents who entrusted me to work on their behalf, my amazing family for their love, support, and sacrifices over more than a dozen years of elected office, my staff who worked so hard and ably, and my many colleagues who generously guided me for an amazing 6 years in Congress. 
                       
Sincerely,
￼ 
Elizabeth Esty 
Member of Congress
  
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  
I rise today for the last time as a Member of Congress.  For the past 6 years it has been an extraordinary honor to serve the residents of central and Northwest Connecticut as their representative in the House. 
The title for this job is a humble one – Representative.  Not Emperor.  Not Knower-of-all-Things.  Representative. 
Congress was not my dream – but making a difference was. In 2005, my then-15-year-old daughter challenged me to either run for the local Town Council or stop complaining.  I ran. 
And I found that I could get things done, first on the Town Council and then as a state representative.  I came to Congress with a desire to make a difference for people, to help solve their problems, fight for affordable quality health care, ensure education that addresses the needs of every child, work across the aisle for better jobs and better pay for Americans, and keep us all safe and free. 
Yet I arrived in Congress in the aftermath of the terrible shootings of 20 six- and seven- year old children and 6 educators in the town of Newtown in my district, 6 years ago this coming Friday.  My task immediately became how to truly care for and represent those families, and be an effective voice for taking action to prevent gun violence.  
At the time, I did not even know how to find the elevator to get to my attic office in the Cannon House Office Building.  John Dingall, longest serving member of Congress, took me under his wing and helped me navigate these halls.  He gave me invaluable advice.  He said, “Elizabeth, always remember this.  What you DO is very important.  But YOU are NOT important.”  He also told me, “It is your job to know your district, and vote your district.”  
How right he was.  I learned my district. My team and I worked with others to get lots of legislation passed to help veterans and their families; to support STEM education for women and girls and children of color; to modernize and upgrade our infrastructure; and to fight the scourge of opioid addiction.  
And we helped thousands of individuals at home cut through red tape and get much needed support.  By working WITH people, we were able to help government work FOR people. 
Here are some things I have learned: 
The American people are good and great, and eager to see our democracy work better. Sharing credit is not only the right thing to do, but it works. If you listen to others, if you look for and build on common ground, you can get things done even with people with whom you disagree on many issues. The first step is often the hardest. In politics, you need to earn support. You’re not entitled to it. You will fail sometimes. You won’t meet your own high expectations. You will disappoint people. You will lose an election. But you get up the next day and you try harder. If there’s nothing you would be willing to lose an election over, you shouldn’t run for office. 
Democracy needs people who are prepared to lose their job to make a difference. Democracy is not about perfection. Democracy is about trying your best every day. And bringing out the best in others. And when we fall – which we will – we should not give up. We should get right back to work. You shouldn’t run because you know you’ll win. You should run because there are things worth fighting for. If we remember our common values, rather than call into question each other’s integrity, there is much we can do together. Democracy is something we do, not something we tweet about. Democracy is hard – it is not a spectator sport. You don’t need permission in this great country. Democracy gives us – each and every one of us – the opportunity, the right to run, to serve, and to make a difference. American democracy is a great thing. But it requires us to pitch in. To do our part. We have the opportunity – and in these challenging times for our nation and the world, I believe we have an obligation – to get involved. 
I thank my amazing family for their love and support, and their sacrifices over more than a dozen years of elected office. I thank the voters who entrusted me to work on their behalf. I thank my excellent staff who have worked so hard and ably.  And I thank the many colleagues who generously guided me, and worked with me on issues of common concern for the American people. 
In closing, John Dingall’s words return to me – “If you ever look up at the Capitol Dome at night, Elizabeth, and it doesn’t send shivers down your spine, you don’t deserve to be here because you aren’t sufficiently in awe of Democracy.” I can say without hesitation -- the white of the Capitol Dome gleaming in the night still sends shivers down my spine.  And it always will.  For we are fortunate enough to live in this amazing country where we have the right to choose our leaders, to raise our voices, and together to forge a better nation and a better future for all our children.

BEATTY BULLETIN FALL 2018

 Fighting for Affordable, High-Quality Healthcare and Education  
In August, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) held separate events on healthcare and education, including her Healthcare Listening Session and Roundtable for Ohio’s Third Congressional District and a Community Conversation on science, technology engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. 
More than 30 healthcare executives, community leaders, government officials, and nonprofit organizations participated in the August 15th Listening Session and Roundtable, sharing their perspectives on improving access to and the delivery of healthcare, as well as fresh ideas to make sure more individuals and families can live happier, healthier lives. Attendees discussed the social determinants of healthcare and how to best help people overcome obstacles to obtaining healthcare. 
“This event is all about strengthening the dialogue between policymakers, stakeholders, and the healthcare community in Central Ohio. My constituents are concerned about rising healthcare and prescription costs and quality of care.” Beatty continued, “Your insight will allow me to work closely with my Congressional colleagues to develop positive, sustainable policy solutions to the important healthcare issues facing our nation.” 
The August 14th Community Conversation at St. Stephen’s Community House served as an opportunity for constituents of Ohio’s Third Congressional District to speak one-on-one with Beatty and to get an update on the positive impact of STEM in Central Ohio. 
“We need a highly trained workforce ready for the jobs of tomorrow. Unfortunately, our country is facing a massive shortage of workers skilled in these areas. To help fill the void, St. Stephen’s Community House, countless local nonprofits, and community stakeholders are working overtime to equip more people with the much-needed tools, expertise, and education to succeed in the 21st century, and I am working in Congress to make it a reality.”

A Voice ""For the People""
Congresswoman Beatty recently lead a press call with national and local media, highlighting her commitment to better jobs, better healthcare, and a better future for all Americans. Coinciding with the call, Democrats released a new report on the economic struggles facing hardworking families and middle-class Americans. Highlights from “For the People: Report on Impacts of GOP Agenda on Health and Economic Security of Ohioans” include:
• 78 percent of full-time workers are living paycheck-to-paycheck.
• Real wages have fallen in Ohio since 2017.
• One million Ohio taxpayers will see no tax benefit by 2019. 
• Health coverage for more than 4.8 million Ohioans with pre-existing conditions is in jeopardy if the  Affordable Care Act is repealed. 
Reacting to the new report, Beatty said, “Americans want a government for the people. This report shows that many of my constituents, their families, and our seniors are struggling to simply make ends meet. That is why I will continue to do everything in my power to ensure all their voices are heard, and that we work to close the wage gap and growing wealth inequality.”
 
 
Working to Improve Central Ohio’s Mail Delivery
Following several complaints about mail being delivered to incorrect addresses, unacceptable delays, and—even worse—lost mail, Congresswoman Beatty sprung into action. 
Since first becoming aware of potential problems in March 2018, she and her District staff have held weekly phone calls with local and regional officials regarding service, hiring efforts, and individual cases. Staff has traveled across the state on multiple occasions for one-on-one meetings with United States Postal Service (USPS) leadership and secured a commitment from the agency to hire more than 800 carriers throughout the area. Also, the USPS created a new Consumer Advisory Council to provide feedback and suggestions on how to improve quality of services. This is the third such council ever created and came about after communication between Deputy U.S. Postmaster General Ronald Stroman and staff.  
Please note, residents of Ohio’s Third Congressional District with unresolved issues are strongly encouraged to call the USPS consumer affairs line at (513) 684-5794 or Beatty’s District Office at (614) 220-0003 for assistance.   ￼

In the Community: Central Ohio-Mauritanian Listening Session and Moms2B Visit

       ￼        ￼
Pictured above, Congresswoman Beatty convened a meeting on October 9, 2018, between representatives of Central Ohio’s Mauritanian community, national experts, and various stakeholders, to discuss the plight of local families facing deportation because of recent executive action. 
On August 13, 2018, Congresswoman Beatty visited New Salem Baptist Church in the Linden neighborhood to see firsthand the impact of Central Ohio’s Moms2B campaign and talk about her work to address the community infant mortality crisis. 

 

Looking Toward the New Year and New Congress
As the 115th Congress comes to a close, and with the New Year and new Congress on the horizon, it is my hope that 2019 will usher in a sense of urgency and renewed commitment to civility. 
Still today, too many hardworking Ohioans and middle-class families are struggling to make ends meet and want Congress to do something about it. They want better wages, better jobs, and a better future. 
They want affordable, high-quality healthcare, education, and childcare. They want to be able to pay their bills, afford a mortgage, save a few extra dollars at the end of the month, and equal opportunity at the American Dream. Finally, and equally as important, they want a government that is accountable to the people. 
In that spirit, I will work in Congress with Democrats and Republicans to deliver real progress on these issues and the many economic, social, and global challenges facing our country.
Unfortunately, civility and bipartisanship are sorely missing right now. It is time we move beyond the divisive and hurtful rhetoric poisoning our political landscape and realize that, first and foremost, we are ALL Americans. Violence cannot be the answer. That is why I will continue to fight in D.C. and Central Ohio to be a bridge builder and spearhead efforts in Congress to ratchet down the rhetoric. 
I look forward to talking, listening and working with you in the weeks and months ahead to make these goals a reality.
Best wishes in the New Year! 
Sincerely,
￼ 
 

Getting to Know the District:
Highlighting the Franklinton Neighborhood 

Franklinton is located on the banks of the Scioto River and immediately west of downtown Columbus. Franklinton was founded by Lucas Sullivant in 1797 as the first American settlement in Franklin County, Ohio. As the City of Columbus grew, the city annexed and incorporated the existing Franklinton neighborhood.
Approximately 36,000 people call Franklinton home, and under former Columbus Mayor Michael B. Coleman a concerted effort was made to revitalize and reinvest in the neighborhood. These efforts are still ongoing, and the City of Columbus is squarely focused on further modernization and strengthening of the area economy. 
As the Member of Congress for Ohio’s Third Congressional District, Congresswoman Beatty has the privilege of representing residents of Franklinton in the U.S. House of Representatives. In Congress, she is working with state and local officials to attract new business opportunities and housing development projects to the community and is committed to helping constituents resolve problems with their Social Security, Medicare, VA, and many other federal issues.

ISSUES 
Dear Friend, 
Only two more days to get health insurance coverage for 2019. Most Americans can find cheaper plans that work for them and their families by logging onto healthcare.gov.  
￼ 
Latino Guidelines for ACA Enrollment 
This week, I joined Congressman Ben Ray Luján (NM-03) in sending a letter demanding an explanation from the Administration on reports that they had removed a document titled “Marketplace Outreach: Best Practices for Outreach to Latino Communities” from its Health Insurance Marketplace website.
￼ ￼ 
The removed PDF was a slide presentation intended as a training resource for assisters. It focused on the challenges Latinos might face when enrolling for coverage and included guidance on making services culturally and linguistically appropriate. You can read the letter here. 
Honoring our Nation’s Veterans 
Team Castro attended the Unaccompanied Veterans Funerals for Mr. Maximo Elizondo Garcia and Mr Robert Wayne Calcote. We thank them for their service to our nation.  
￼ ￼ 
Ensuring Safety and Wellbeing of Children in Government Custody 
In May, an 18-month-old toddler died just days after leaving government custody. I joined House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member Elijah E. Cummings, House Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson, and House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jerrold Nadler in asking for the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General to conduct a review into the medical care provided by ICE Health Service Corps. You can read the letter here and read about the broader story on Vice News here. 
￼ 
Preventing Government Shutdown 
Americans don’t want a border wall, nor do they want to see our government shutdown. We’ve offered bipartisan compromises that could pass both chambers. Instead of pursuing partisan promises, the President should stop undermining our country’s ability to perform vital functions and agree to the proposals put on the table. You can read my full statement here on the President’s comments about a possible government shutdown next week. 
District Updates 
Team Castro joined Alamo Area Metropolitan Planning Organization for updates on transportation plans and roadway safety; met with SAStands for an update on their work in immigration and criminal justice reform; and joined fellow San Antonio residents at the City Council District 1 Holiday Open House.
￼ ￼ 
￼ ￼  
Team Castro also participated in the Ribbon Cutting and Grand Opening of the SGI-USA San Antonio Buddhist Center. 
Russia Investigation 
It’s clear that the Special Counsel’s investigation is working and we must protect him and his investigation so the American people can get the truth they deserve. I spoke to MSNBC’s Ali Velshi on All In with Chris Hayes to discuss the Mueller sentencing memos for Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. I also spoke with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews this week to discuss Maria Butina’s plea deal with federal prosecutors.  
￼ 
As Congress continues to address issues that directly affect San Antonians’ daily lives, I want to hear from you. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or questions for me by calling my office at 210-348-8216 or reaching out online through my website, castro.house.gov.

Big win for animal lovers this week! Congress passed and sent to the president my bill to ban the slaughter of dogs and cats for food. Two other animal welfare bills I co-sponsored also passed and will be signed into law.   My Dog and Cat Meat Trade Prohibition Act, amends the federal Animal Welfare Act to make it illegal to knowingly slaughter dogs or cats for human consumption. Although rare, the practice is still legal in 44 states. A restaurant in Philadelphia was closed several years ago after a worker was caught slaughtering cats chained in the basement to be served as meals, according to the Animal Welfare Institute.  The other animal welfare bills I co-sponsored are:   Pet and Women Safety (PAWS) Act makes it easier for women to bring their pets with them to domestic violence shelters when they leave abusive relationships by providing grants for shelter and housing assistance for domestic violence victims with pets. And the Parity in Animal Cruelty Enforcement (PACE) Act ends animal fighting in all United States territories. An animal fighting ban currently applies to the United States, but not territories, including Puerto Rico.   As chair of the Animal Protection Caucus in Congress, fighting against cruelty to animals will always be a priority. That is why I received a 100 percent score from the Humane Society for my leadership and votes in 2018. I am also a past recipient of the Humane Society’s “Legislator of the Year” award.  Please let me know your thoughts on how we can continue to promote efforts to protect animals and wildlife. I look forward to hearing from you.

12/13/18 10:43,I cannot thank you enough,"￼ 
 
Dear Friends,
I took to the Senate floor for the final time today to deliver my farewell address and to thank the people of Florida for the honor they've given me to serve as their voice in the United States Senate.
Grace and I have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support we have received over the last few weeks, and I don't think anyone could have been more blessed.
It's not easy to take leave from the people and the work that I love, and it has caused times of intense reflection for me.
For instance, I remember the weeks leading up to our eventual launch aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia in 1986. We had been scrubbed four times before we successfully launched from the Kennedy Space Center on January 12, 1986.
It's not the flight itself that I have been focused on lately, instead it's the fact that after each of those four failed attempts, NASA engineers - after reexamining the shuttle - determined that all four would have likely ended in a catastrophic disaster had those flights not been aborted. 
I have been asking myself lately: Why was I spared? And only now, upon intense reflection in recent weeks, I think I'm beginning to understand why.
You see, it has been the great honor of my life to serve our country and the people of Florida - but, as I told my colleagues on the Senate floor today, we still have much work to do.
Now, more than ever, we need leaders who will focus on building the kind of relationships in Washington that can solve the great problems that our nation faces. We need our leaders to resist the forces that seek to divide us and, instead, demonstrate the moral courage it takes to choose country over party, or over power.
As I leave the Senate, I do so filled with hope for the future and with the fondest memories. I intend to keep fighting for all that we've accomplished in recent years, and will never stop fighting for the people of Florida.
Because, at the end of the day, I'm just a country boy who loved serving my state and our country. It's been an incredible honor, and I can't thank you enough.
￼
Sincerely,  ￼

12/13/18 8:37,3 DAYS LEFT! Enroll in Healthcare,"￼ 
 


Lindsey,  Don’t wait, there are only 3 DAYS left in the 2019 open enrollment period to get covered! Whether you’re uninsured, exploring available options, or updating life information, you have until December 15th to find coverage through the Marketplace that meets you and your family's needs. 
￼
Quality health coverage is more affordable than you may think. An average of 8 in 10 Delawareans qualify for financial help and premiums may be more affordable than previous years. The Marketplace and the expansion of Medicaid helped lower average health coverage costs by bringing the rate of uninsured Americans to a historic low at just 8.8 percent(1) — a win-win for everyone.
While there’s still time, visit www.HealthCare.gov to create an account and find a quality health insurance plan that works for you and your budget. And if you currently have health coverage from the Marketplace, now is your chance to review your application and ensure it’s up to date.
If you have any questions about signing up, or want to talk to a trained Marketplace navigator, free help is just a call or click away. To apply and enroll quickly online, visit www.HealthCare.gov or www.choosehealthde.com. You can also call the Marketplace call center 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at 1-800-318-2596, and a trained representative will be able to assist you in the enrollment process as well as to answer any questions you may have.  Sincerely,   Lisa Blunt Rochester Member of Congress  1.

Congressman Al Green's Statement on 2019 Open Enrollment Period 
(Houston, TX) - On Wednesday, December 12, 2018, Congressman Al Green made the following statement regarding the severity of enrolling in a health plan before open enrollment ends on Saturday, December 15, 2018:
“As the deadline for open enrollment rapidly approaches, I urge all of my constituents and everyone in this country to be sure to secure healthcare coverage for 2019. According to Community Health Choice, more than 185,000 constituents of the Ninth Congressional District of Texas, which I am proud to serve, do not have health insurance. This includes residents of both Fort Bend County and Harris County. In 2018, 13% of Fort Bend County’s uninsured population were eligible for Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and 17% were eligible for premium tax credits. In 2018, 13% of Harris County’s uninsured population were eligible for Medicaid or CHIP and 15% were eligible for premium tax credits. 
“If you do not have health insurance, please sign up for coverage at www.HealthCare.gov. If you feel you cannot afford coverage, visit www.HealthCare.gov to learn more about Medicaid and tax credit eligibility. For free, in-person assistance, call 1-800-318-2596 or visit Localhelp.HealthCare.gov. For assistance in other languages, visit www.HealthCare.gov/Language-Resource/.  
""Healthcare coverage is a life or death decision. Please, get covered. Make the December 15, 2018 deadline your lifeline to health care.""

My D.C. office is on the move
After three terms and six years in 425 Cannon, it's time to move on. Like a first home, our original office in D.C. will always be special to me. It's where I met with thousands of you who helped inform me of the many important decisions we've made since 2013. It's where we made plans to pass Export-Import Bank reauthorization, protect consumer protections for military servicemembers, and add Billy Frank Jr.'s name to the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge, among many other initiatives. 
My D.C. office will be moving to 2452 Rayburn House Office Building for the next Congressional session. While Cannon is 110 years old, Rayburn is the newest, finished in 1965. My new office was first occupied by the legend, Congressman John Dingell, Jr. Representative Dingell is the longest-serving Congressperson in U.S. history, representing his seat in Michigan from 1955 to 2015. Nowadays you might appreciate his hilarious quips on Twitter, and I'm proud to serve with his wife, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.  
The numbers of the house office buildings can get confusing, so it's useful to think about in terms of 0 as Cannon, 1 as Longworth, and 2 as Rayburn, with the second number indicating the floor. So we are going from the fourth floor of Cannon (0425), to the fourth floor of Rayburn (2452), and our friend Congressman Kilmer won't be far away on the fourth floor of Longworth (1410).
It's fitting as we both start our fourth term in Congress. I know we are both excited to represent the South Sound and continue to build on our Puget Sound recovery efforts. 
See you soon, either in our new digs in D.C. or in our district offices in Lakewood and Lacey - those will still be in the same locations.
Sincerely, 
￼
Denny Heck
Your Member of Congress

12/12/18 19:06,Poll: Border Wall Funding,"￼ 

Poll: Border Wall Funding
Hoosiers,

Current government funding expires next Friday, December 21. Congress must pass a spending bill before December 21st to avoid a lapse in funding and a partial government shutdown. President Donald Trump has called on Congress to include $5 billion in the funding bill to pay for a wall along our country’s southern border. 

As Congress and the White House negotiate the contents of the bill, the president stated he would be willing to not sign the bill and shut down the federal government if this border wall funding is not included in the spending bill. 

Question of the Week: Do you support President Trump not signing a government spending bill into law if funding for the border wall is not included?

[_] Yes. We need to fund a wall along the southern border.
[_] No. We need to compromise and keep the government open.
[_] I don’t know.
[_] Other (share your thoughts).

Take the poll here.

Dear Friend,
Good news: families of children with complex medical conditions can celebrate passage of the ACE Kids Act in the U.S. House after many years of advocacy! The bill authorizes the creation of new cost-saving and time-saving medical homes where specialized care is coordinated in a high quality setting. I wrote the ACE Kids Act many years ago with the simple but important goal of putting children with complex medical conditions and their families first. The children served at St. Joseph's Children's Hospital Chronic-Complex Clinic in Tampa were my inspiration. Now, I am urging my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to pass the important bill before Congress adjourns for the year. 
￼
Florida is leading the nation again in sign-ups for affordable health coverage during Open Enrollment! With only three more days left until the December 15 deadline to sign-up, make sure you, your family, your friends and everyone you know has coverage.  Check out HealthCare.gov today and be ready for 2019! You can receive free, independent advice from Covering Florida Navigators at coveringflorida.org and other grassroots experts to find the right plan for you and your family. 
￼
In the waning days of the Republican House majority in the House the following votes are scheduled:  The 2018 Farm Bill (Conference Report for H.R. 2) was passed in the House and is on the way to the President’s desk. Most importantly, a bipartisan group of lawmakers were able to beat back devastating cuts to supplemental nutrition proposed by House Republicans. I was able to add provisions that aim to improve water quality by reducing nutrients relating to agriculture in response to one of Florida’s worst outbreaks of red tide and harmful algal blooms in our state’s history. These clean water provisions seek to better target conservation spending on the right practices in the right places, prioritizing clean water investments and addressing obstacles that get in the way of continued improvements in water quality and algal bloom prevention. Florida is a diverse agricultural state and the Farm Bill’s inclusion of conservation programs can play an important role in addressing our water quality challenges.  President Trump said this week that he would “be proud” to shut down the U.S. government at the end of next week over a border wall that he promised Mexico would pay for. That is irresponsible. Instead, Democrats and Republicans in Congress are ready to compromise, provide effective border security and not leave people out in the cold this holiday season. I hope the President listens. 
￼

Sincerely, 

Kathy Castor

Rep. Cuellar Votes in Support of Farm Bill
WASHINGTON— Today, Congressman Henry Cuellar (TX-28) joined his colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives by voting for H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, also known as the Farm Bill. The bill, which passed the House by a vote of 369-47, will extend all agriculture and nutrition programs for the next five years, that includes support for farmers and ranchers in Texas and across the country. This legislation passed the U.S. Senate, and now moves to the President’s desk to be signed into law. 
“This bill is a direct investment for our farmers and cattle ranchers,” said Congressman Cuellar. “It will also ensure that Americans in rural and urban areas across the country continue to be provided with the safest and most abundant food supply in the world. Specifically, this legislation will modernize our agriculture support systems, save American taxpayer dollars, and offer our farmers and ranchers certainty on how American agriculture policy will be regulated.”
Congressman Cuellar continued, “I would like to thank House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway (TX-11), Ranking Member Collin Peterson (MN-7), and my fellow colleagues for working across the aisle to get this crucial bill passed.”
Nutrition & Hunger
This bill preserves crucial benefits for millions of Texans and their families, such as:
·         Reauthorizes SNAP for five years;
·         Expands funding for food banks with $206 million for The Emergency Food Assistance; Program (TEFAP), which helps supplement the diets of low-income Americans, including the elderly;
·         Makes donating fluid milk for food banks and other feeding programs easier; and
·         Provides $238 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which works to improve the health of low-income elderly persons by supplementing their diets with nutritious foods.
 
Support for Farmers & Ranchers
·         Maintains the core provisions of the federal crop insurance program, which is permanently authorized;
·         Increases farm loan authorization level from $4.23 billion to $10 billion, including a 50 percent set-aside for direct operating loans for beginning farmers and ranchers;
·         Combines and establishes mandatory funding for important programs to promote U.S. agricultural exports;
·         Improves the Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage programs and offers producers choices;
·         Allows farmers to update their program yields, boosting their eligibility to receive support;
·         Increases marketing loan rates to improve farmers’ cash flow and access to credit when prices are low during harvest time;
·         Updates limits on Farm Service Agency (FSA) farm loans to keep pace with increasing costs and land values; and
·         Expands access to FSA farm loans for veteran and beginning farmers.
 
Partnerships with HSIs
·         Reauthorizes National Institute of Food and Agriculture education grants programs for Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs), which prepare underrepresented students for careers related to the food, agricultural, and natural resource systems. HSIs in South Texas include: Laredo College, South Texas College, Texas A&M International University, University of Texas at San Antonio, and the University of the Incarnate Word. 
Conservation
·         The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), which received $1.75 billion for FY19, would receive $2.03 billion by FY23. The program helps agricultural producers confront challenges while conserving natural resources like soil, water and air. Through EQIP, the National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) provides agricultural producers with financial resources and one-on-one help to plan and implement improvements and conservation practices. Using these practices can lead to cleaner water and air, healthier soil and better wildlife habitat, all while improving agricultural operations for farmers in the 28th District;
·         Increases the amount of land allowed under the Conservation Reserve Program, which pays farmers not to produce crops on environmentally sensitive land; and
·         $450 million annually for the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which provides financial and technical assistance to help restore, protect, and enhance agricultural lands and wetlands.
 
Rural Development & Transparency 
This legislation includes provisions that helps struggling rural hospitals to gain better financial footing, reauthorizes critical rural water and sewer infrastructure programs, and boosts technical assistant for rural development programs in rural communities. It additionally increases USDA transparency. Provisions include:
·         $350 million annually for new broadband infrastructure. New projects would have to be in areas where at least 90 percent of households are unserved by broadband, instead of 15 percent under current law;
·         $82 million for Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grants, which help rural communities use the unique capabilities of telecommunications to connect to each other and the world;
·         $65 million for Rural Business Development Grants;
·         $50 million for Emergency Community Water Assistance Grants;
·         Requires USDA to establish a rural health liaison; and
·         Improves transparency through annual reports of USDA lending activity. 
 
Animal & Plant Health
·         $120 million from FY19 through FY22, and $30 million annually after that, for animal disease management programs, including research on cattle fever ticks;
·         Beginning in FY23, $18 million for a new National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program;
·         Funding would also be allocated for a new National Animal Vaccine and Veterinary Countermeasures Bank and for the National Animal Health Laboratory Network;
·         Provides $25 million annually for a new Citrus Trust Fund for research into citrus diseases and pests; and
·         $15 million annually for five years for USDA to establish a National Plant Diagnostic Network to monitor threats to plant health.

Dear Friend, 
We are now only 3 days away from this year’s December 15 deadline to sign up for health coverage at HealthCare.gov. 
Now is the chance to compare plans and benefits, find the best prices, and sign up for coverage.   
Hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of not having health insurance next year should they miss the Open Enrollment deadline.  I urge you, your friends, and your family to ensure they do not miss this opportunity for high quality, affordable health coverage.  If people miss the deadline, they will have to wait until the end of 2019 to obtain affordable coverage.
If you or someone you know needs health insurance, the time to act is now: 
Visit HealthCare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596 right now to enroll in coverage.

Accidents and illness can happen at any time – that’s why affordable, comprehensive health insurance is the smart choice.  Plans covered under the Affordable Care Act provide important benefits like prescription medicine coverage and are available to anyone, even those with pre-existing conditions.
I hope you’ll visit HealthCare.gov today and find a plan that works for you. 
  
Sincerely, ￼  G. K. Butterfield Member of Congress, NC-01

	2.	Don’t forget: You must sign up by this Saturday, December 15.  Enroll today on healthcare.gov.
	3.	Free, expert help is available.  Call 1-800-318-2596 for confidential assistance or visit localhelp.healthcare.gov to talk through your options with a trained professional.
	4.	New plan options for 2019.  This year, it is more important than ever to head back to HealthCare.gov to shop and save – comparing options for 2019.  In many areas, there will be more plans to choose from and you may save more.

Bergman Supports First District Farmers, Sends Farm Bill to President's Desk

Washington - Upon House passage of the 2018 Farm Bill conference report, Rep. Jack Bergman released the following statement:
""First District farmers supply our district, country, and world with food. I'm thankful the House and Senate were able to reach an agreement to pass a Farm Bill that protects our nation's farmers, ranchers, and rural families. Streamlining and reducing unnecessary regulations, ensuring our farmers remain protected from outside unfair trade practices, and ensuring a safety net remains in place especially for specialty crops such as cherries were key to this bipartisan victory.  ""Additionally, the 2018 Farm Bill will help work towards the goal of ensuring high-speed broadband access for rural communities. Provisions included in the Farm Bill will help level the playing field for rural communities by continuing investments in broadband deployment across rural America.""
In addition, the Farm Bill: 
	•	Protects Michigan cherry farmers by maintaining crop insurance framework so farmers, bankers, and businesses in the First District have a responsible support structure in cases of adverse weather or unexpected loss;
	•	Eliminates duplicative and unnecessary regulations, getting the government off the backs and out of the pockets of American farmers;
	•	Dedicates funding to help communities battling with the effects of the opioid epidemic;
	•	Makes significant investments for low-income Americans seeking further education;
	•	Maintains Good Neighbor Authority provisions, allowing the Forest Service to enter into agreements with States for forest management services; and
	•	Reduces the threat of catastrophic forest fires by allowing an expedited reduction of hazardous fuels in our forests.

12/12/18 17:24,Fighting Fire with Science,"￼
December 12, 2018
Dear Friend,
We are now living in an era of severe drought, extreme wildfires, and climate disruption. That's why I fought so hard to secure policies in the Farm Bill to improve the management of watersheds in our national forests and reduce the risks of costly catastrophic wildfires. I wanted to share a few of these major conservation wins in the Farm Bill, which we just passed in the Senate.
I authored a provision in the Farm Bill to establish a Water Source Protection Program within the U.S. Forest Service. This program would build on partnerships between cities, businesses, water utilities, farmers and ranchers, and the Forest Service-like the Santa Fe Water Fund and Rio Grande Water Fund-to support forest health projects on lands that provide water resources for downstream users.
I also fought to expand the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, which allows local community collaborative groups to take on large, landscape-scale forest and watershed restoration projects. In New Mexico, the Southwest Jemez Mountains Collaborative and the Zuni Mountains Collaborative are two examples of this successful program. These local efforts are critical to restoring the health of forests and watersheds that are integral to life in New Mexico, ensuring our communities have clean drinking water, and bolstering our agriculture industry. Now these partnerships can be extended and expanded.
These victories come on top of a much-needed fix to the U.S. government's antiquated funding process for wildfire suppression that I helped pass earlier this year. Our new policy pays for catastrophic fires in the same way we pay for other natural disasters, while protecting funds for stewardship contracts, watershed restoration projects, and other critical forest health programs. We no longer have to choose between fighting fires and preventing them - going forward, we can and must do both.
While the President refuses to acknowledge accepted science on climate change or take major challenges in forest policy seriously, I remain focused on using my role in the Senate to deliver common-sense solutions to the challenges we face. I will keep fighting for us to utilize the best available science and deliver resources to our communities to promote long-term sustainable use of New Mexico's land and water.

12/12/18 16:59,Farewell to our 41st Commander in Chief,"￼ 
December 12, 2018

Dear Friend, 

Last week, Americans celebrated the life and legacy of the late President George H.W. Bush, a devoted husband, father, and member of the greatest generation.  From the time he was a young U.S. Navy aviator serving in World War II to his final days, President Bush demonstrated what it means to be a true American hero and distinguished leader.  

￼

His devotion to public service will always be remembered and will serve as an example for generations to follow.  Our thoughts and prayers are with his family as we bid farewell to our 41st Commander in Chief.    

AVIATION MACHINIST 2ND CLASS DURELL WADE

￼
                                           
On December 7, 1941, U.S. Navy Aviation Machinist 2nd Class (AM2) Durell Wade, a native of Calhoun County, was killed while defending our great nation aboard the USS Oklahoma.  During the surprise attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, the ship was struck multiple times by torpedoes.  The USS Oklahoma capsized, claiming the lives of 429 crewmen.  Following his death, attempts to identify his remains were unsuccessful until recently.  In June 2015, Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) personnel began the process of identifying the remains of all unidentified USS Oklahoma crew members who were buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii.  They were able to identify Wade's remains through DNA testing.       
                                            
￼

After 77 years, the family finally has closure.  Last week, a visitation was held in Calhoun City to celebrate the life of this American patriot who gave all to protect our freedoms.  Following visitation, state and local officials gathered with the family for an interment ceremony held at the North Mississippi Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Kilmichael, Mississippi.  Durell Wade's service and sacrifice will always be remembered.  
                                            

SUTTER STREET MANUFACTURING

Evidence of our thriving economy is all around us!  One after another, companies are announcing plans to locate to Mississippi or expansion of their operations.  Sutter Street Manufacturing, a subsidiary of specialty homes furnishings retailer Williams-Sonoma, Inc. is expanding production of its upholstered furniture manufacturing operations, creating 350 jobs over a five-year period.  The company plans to start up their northeast Mississippi operation in January at the Harry A. Martin North Lee Industrial Complex in Lee County.

￼
                                            

VETERANS ASSISTANCE UPDATE

Our veterans deserve the best care our nation has to offer. We want all those who have served our nation to have access to services that they have earned and deserve.  It is with this in mind that the vets.gov project was created to increase access to VA information, benefits, and services for veterans and affiliated users with an easy to navigate, one-stop location.  Recently, the web address was changed to va.gov.  The user will not experience difficulties.  They will automatically be rerouted to the new address.  If you have any questions, please contact our Veterans Services Coordinator Mike Patterson at (662) 841-8808 or send him an email at Michael.patterson@mail.house.gov.

12/12/18 16:51,End U.S. Support for Saudi Atrocities,"￼



 December 12, 2018   
  



10849 E. Walking Stick Way 


San Antonio, Texas 78205- 
  
  
Dear Lindsey,   
I write to update you on my efforts to end U.S. support for Saudi atrocities in Yemen. Today, House Republicans stifled—for now—debate on ongoing U.S. support for a Saudi coalition fighting in Yemen. The provision was hidden in a Farm Bill-related vote. You can watch my speech on the House floor today here strongly urging my colleagues to end the suffering. What cruel irony—that this rule, dealing in part with too much food in America, may starve millions in Yemen. As this Congress invests in food here, we pour tax dollars into stripping Yemeni children of theirs. Enough.
￼ 
In Yemen, 85,000 children seem to have died and another 12 million people are on starvation’s brink. This very day, even more children will be lost to starvation and disease. In an eloquent plea this week, Nicholas Kristof with the New York Times reports on an “8-year-old boy who is starving and has limbs like sticks.” And Mr. Kristof rightly concludes, “The bottom line: Our tax dollars are going to starve children.” Republican leaders know that so many members of both parties can no longer stomach the atrocities. They fear that a bipartisan majority of this House would reject what has become a wretched stain on our Nation. But Yemen cannot wait; we must not relent until we end this unauthorized support. 

I welcome your advice on this and other federal issues, and I look forward to a Congress in the new year with the courage to act. I also hope that you will take this opportunity to visit my Facebook page, follow me on Twitter, follow me on Instagram, or send me an e-mail at Lloyd.Doggett@mail.house.gov.

Revised WOTUS Rule a Win for Landowners, Ag Community and States’ Rights December 12, 2018 
Earlier this week, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers announced a rewrite of the previous administration’s ‘Waters of the U.S.’ (WOTUS) rule. The revised WOTUS rule gives farmers, ranchers and landowners the certainty they need to know when the Clean Water Act applies to them and when it does not. In providing this clarity from the onset, it removes Washington bureaucrats from making ambiguous decisions on land which they aren’t familiar with, as landowners are. It works with landowners and farmers to strengthen water safety – not saddle them with unnecessary burdens with little to no benefit to the environment and our water supply. It also respects states’ rights, recognizing that state and tribal governments have a right to regulate and manage their land and water resources themselves.  As it was previously written, the WOTUS rule would have been one of the largest federal land grabs in U.S. history. It would have given the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA control of nearly all water, including man-made water management systems, farm ponds, drainage ditches and any other water the federal government wanted to decide has a ‘significant nexus’ to downstream water. This would have required farmers, ranchers and landowners to spend countless hours filling out burdensome paperwork to get permits from the federal government just to conduct normal agricultural activities or spray for weeds along our county roads.  A 60-day public comment is underway for anyone wishing to weigh in on the proposal. I encourage those who may be affected by the WOTUS rule to offer your thoughts on EPA’s website HERE. Additional information on the proposed rule, as well as supporting analyses, is available on EPA’s website HERE.

Dear Lindsey, 
This year, voters showed up for our democracy.  
Your voices were heard loud and clear. This coming year, we have the opportunity to restore a government that works for the people, instead of special interests and wealthy donors. 
Billionaires have had too much sway over what goes on in Washington. We need a Congress that works for students, single moms, retirees, teachers, nurses, and families struggling to get ahead.   
Everyone in our country should be able to live with dignity and security. No one should have to choose between paying for groceries, seeing the doctor, and keeping up with rent.  
As we develop our top priorities for the 116th Congress, I want to hear from you. 

What issues would you like to see us tackle in the coming year?

Keeping Connected 
Hello Alaska!
I just returned to Washington D.C. from a brief trip to Anchorage, Eagle River, and the Mat-Su Valley with Senator Sullivan to assess the damage from the 7.0 magnitude earthquake which struck the region on November 30. The words I would use to describe what we saw are gut wrenching, astounding, and remarkable. Gut wrenching, to stand in a school where cinder blocks flew through the walls. Astounding in the sense that in places, the ground literally liquefied, which caused highways to collapse. And remarkable because we know of no one who was seriously injured, despite the extensive damage. While we are still in the early process of impact assessment, we do know there has been significant damage to homes, roads, infrastructure, and schools. I have been assured from our federal partners that Alaskans will have what they need to deal with and recover from this natural disaster. Know that the congressional delegation is on top of this and will do everything we can to assist Alaskans in this road to recovery.

Washington - Today, Governor Rick Snyder signed legislation into law to create the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority (MSCA), which will oversee construction and operation of a tunnel in bedrock beneath the waters of the Straits of Mackinac. Congressman Jack Bergman released the following statement:

""I applaud Governor Snyder, along with State House and Senate leadership for their work to protect our the Great Lakes, while ensuring Michigan's energy infrastructure is brought into the 21st Century. This forward thinking approach will create jobs, protect our water, and secure a more thorough and comprehensive energy connection between the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of Michigan. The First District of Michigan is home to our nation's most beautiful natural resources, and our future relies on clean water. This is a monumental step towards keeping our most valuable resource preserved and protected for future generations.""

Earlier today, Governor Snyder released a statement announcing legislation signed to create the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority, as well as three appointees to the commission. That release in its entirety can be found HERE.

12/12/18 10:07,"Reps. Bergman, Kildee Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Identify Toxic PFAS Chemical Contamination Sites in Michigan, Across U.S.","

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  Dec 12, 2018
CONTACT: James Hogge (Bergman) 231-640-9158
Robyn Bryan (Kildee) 202-256-6655


Reps. Bergman, Kildee Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Identify Toxic PFAS Chemical Contamination Sites in Michigan, Across U.S.

Washington - Congressman Jack Bergman (MI-01) and Congressman Dan Kildee (MI-05) introduced bipartisan legislation today to help identify sites in Michigan and across the U.S. that may contain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are toxic chemicals that are a threat to public health.
The Kildee-Bergman legislation would authorize $50 million for the U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS) to search for toxic PFAS chemicals in water, soil and air across the country. The bill would also help provide states like Michigan, as well as public health officials, with information to identify contamination and better protect communities.
“Every family deserves the peace of mind in knowing their water is safe and clean. Limited data regarding breadth and scope of PFAS contamination throughout the state and country has left countless families with the feeling of uncertainty when it comes to whether their water is safe for consumption. Our bipartisan legislation takes the necessary steps to begin identifying the areas affected by these chemicals and allows for appropriate remediation plans to be set in place. I look forward to helping enhance community health as we gain a better understanding of the work ahead of us,” said Congressman Bergman.  “In order to speed up clean-up efforts and protect our communities, we need to first identify PFAS sites that exist in Michigan and around the country,” Congressman Kildee said. “This bill is an important first step in making sure that state and federal governments have the proper resources to clean up PFAS contamination. I am proud to work with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to make sure that Michigan families are not exposed to toxic PFAS chemicals.”
Toxic PFAS chemicals have been used in manufacturing, consumer products and firefighting foam for decades and now have been found to be dangerous to humans. These chemicals have been used around many military bases and industrial sites, including the former Wurtsmith Air Force Base in Oscoda, where PFAS have now leached into groundwater and local-area wells.  Despite knowing the potential threat of PFAS contamination, clean-up of the chemicals has proven to be an expensive endeavor, and many states and local communities do not currently have the resources to address the public health risk. The Kildee-Bergman legislation would authorize new funding to help states like Michigan address the ongoing contamination threat. 
The Kildee-Bergman bill is also sponsored by Congressman Sandy Levin (MI-09), Congresswoman Debbie Dingell (MI-12), Congressman Peter Welch (VT-At large) and Congressman Jared Huffman (CA-02). U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) has previously introduced a Senate-companion bill, S. 3382.

12/11/18 20:46,Rounds Report: South Dakota Priorities Included in Final Farm Bill," 
 
￼ 
 
     
 

South Dakota Priorities Included in Final Farm Bill  December 11, 2018 
Today, the Senate voted to pass the farm bill conference report. This legislation, which will provide certainty to South Dakota’s ag community, passed with strong bipartisan support.  It includes a number of priorities that I requested which will benefit South Dakota farmers and ranchers. I encourage the president to sign this bill into law soon after the House votes on it later this week.  The farm bill: 
• Strengthens safety net programs such as crop insurance;  
 • Allows for re-enrollment for producers utilizing commodity programs under Title I, specifically Price-Loss Coverage (PLC) and Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC); 
 • Increases the cap for Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres from 24 million acres to 27 million acres, with 2 million acres reserved for grasslands; 
 • Establishes an Animal Disease and Preparedness Program, which includes a  vaccination bank to combat economic, food and national security concerns; 
 • Increases the total Farm Service Agency (FSA) Guaranteed Loan Program’s individual cap on  Ownership and Operating Loans from $1.399 million to $1.75 million. I called for an increase to these individual loan caps in the FSA Loan Guarantee Enhancement Act that I introduced; 
 • Establishes a Rural Health Liaison position to work in coordination with the Department of Health  and Human Services to improve rural health care delivery. This measure is based on legislation I sponsored.  
At a time when South Dakota’s farmers and ranchers are on the tip of the spear with the ongoing trade disputes, passage of a five-year farm bill is a critical step toward providing our ag community with much needed certainty and stability. I thank Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and Ranking Member Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), and House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas-11) and Ranking Member Collin Peterson (D-Minn.-07), as well as all committee members for their work on this crucial piece of legislation.

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Senator Baldwin is proud to announce her bipartisan Improving Access to Maternity Care Act has passed the Senate and now heads to the president’s desk to be signed into law. Senator Baldwin led this bipartisan effort along with Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and their legislation will help ensure women have better access to timely, high quality maternity care by identifying provider shortage areas in rural and underserved communities. 
“Too many communities around Wisconsin are still facing a shortage of qualified, maternity care professionals and services. I’ve heard from expecting mothers across the state who can’t find a maternity care provider in their community and are forced to drive over an hour for their appointments – often putting their lives and their babies' lives at risk,” said Senator Baldwin. “This bipartisan legislation will identify shortages to better target resources so providers can deliver the care that expecting mothers in Wisconsin so desperately need – no matter where they live. I’m proud to have led this bipartisan effort with Senator Murkowski to ensure that healthier pregnancies lead to healthier babies, and I’m looking forward to the President signing this bill into law.”  
See why the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM), the March of Dimes, and the National Rural Health Association (NRHA) endorsed Senator Baldwin’s Improving Access to Maternity Care Act 
Senator Baldwin’s bipartisan Improving Access to Maternity Care Act directs the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to identify maternity care shortage areas that may be used by the National Health Service Corps (NHSC). The NHSC is critical to filling workforce shortages in underserved areas, with over 9,200 Corps clinicians delivering services to about 9.7 million people across the country. Currently, ob-gyns are recognized under the primary care shortage designation, which fails to adequately address shortages in maternity care. 
HRSA already collects data on shortages of primary care, dental care and mental health care providers, and this reform will require HRSA to start collecting data on shortages of maternity care providers as well, to help better target resources where they are needed most.  By identifying maternity care needs within existing shortage areas, Wisconsin can begin to fill the gap in maternity care access. Senator Baldwin's legislation is critical to facilitating a better understanding of where the serious maternity care shortages are located and to subsequently direct health care providers to those communities. 
Read more about Senator Baldwin’s bipartisan legislation and her leadership to help ensure women in Wisconsin have better access to timely, high quality maternity care  here.

Jon Kobes Confirmed to Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit December 11, 2018 
Today, the Senate voted to confirm Jonathan Kobes to be a Circuit Judge on the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Jon has served as my general counsel since I was elected to serve in the Senate in 2014. Jon will make an excellent federal judge, having spent his career demonstrating his commitment to justice, the fair application of the law and the betterment of the community by providing pro-bono legal services to those in need.
A lifelong conservative, Jon believes a judge's role is to make decisions based on the law as it is written, not to legislate from the bench. President Trump has done a tremendous job putting fair-minded, conservative judges on the bench, and Jon is no exception. I have the utmost confidence in his ability to protect the Constitution and the rule of law, and I look forward to watching him excel as a federal judge.

Greg's Treasure State Update
Remembering and honoring President George H.W. Bush 

America lost a true hero and a dedicated public servant with the passing of President George H. W. Bush. At 18, he enlisted and served as a Naval Aviator in the Pacific Theater during World War II, and he later served our country in its highest office. Our hearts are lighter knowing he is reunited with the love of his life, Barbara. 

I had the honor of attending his funeral service, which was an emotional reminder of his dedication to family, his lasting legacy of service to our country, his steady leadership, and his honor and decency. 

As our grateful nation mourns and celebrates President Bush’s remarkable life, Susan and I pray for the Bush family.

Meeting with border patrol agents 

I recently met with the dedicated agents of U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the Havre station. They addressed the challenges they face and ways to secure our northern border. 

Last year, law enforcement agents from the Department of Homeland Security seized nearly a million pounds of illegal drugs, including nearly 2,400 pounds of fentanyl, and 7,000 pounds of heroin. They arrested more than 127,000 criminal aliens who were charged with weapons offenses, drug crimes, gang-related activity, sexual assault, kidnapping, and murder. 

It’s time to secure our borders.

Protecting the gateway to Yellowstone 

I recently met with Park County residents and members of the Yellowstone Gateway Business Coalition to recommit our efforts to protect Paradise Valley. 

Last year, I introduced the Yellowstone Gateway Protection Act to permanently withdraw mineral rights on approximately 30,000 acres of public land in an area north of Yellowstone National Park. In September, it passed the House Natural Resources Committee, and I’m optimistic we can get it signed into law by the end of the year. 

I appreciate the efforts of the local community and will continue working to protect their interests.

Advocating for our public lands 

As Congress begins to conclude its work for the year, I reached out to Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate about including Montana priorities in any public lands package. 

I urged them to make sure any potential package includes measures
	•	Protecting the gateway to Yellowstone,
	•	Permanently reauthorizing LWCF,
	•	Resolving the maintenance backlog in our national parks,
	•	Providing clean water throughout Montana, and
	•	Reforming how our federal forests are managed.
I’ll continue working in support of these important public lands issues.

Dear Friends, 
Yesterday, I delivered the last of many, many floor speeches that I've made in the Senate on our nation's space program - a subject that's very dear to my heart.
I've been extremely privileged to have witnessed, and in some cases, participated in the extraordinary triumphs of our nation's 60-year quest to explore the heavens.
The experience of going to space reinforced my belief that we need to not only be good stewards of our planet, but that we should always strive to treat those who we may differ with culturally, ethically, or socially with dignity, compassion and respect.
Looking back at Earth from the window of a spacecraft, you don't see political divisions. You don't see racial divisions. And you don't see religious differences. You don't see the suffering or the injustice facing those back home on the planet.
Instead you quickly realize that we on this planet, our planet Earth, are all in this together.
Our space program has a spectacular and an exciting future. It's a future full of opportunity, and it is a future that will require everyone - industry, Congress, and NASA, as well as our international partners - pulling in the same together to make it a reality.

ZOA to ADL: Apologize/Retract ADL’s “Abhorrent” Attack Against Pro-Israel Cong. Gohmert
December 11, 2018




Morton Klein, President of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), released the following statement defending Congressman Louie Gohmert (R-TX) and his statements criticizing George Soros on the Fox Business Network, and urging ADL to apologize for ADL’s “abhorrent” attack on Congressman Gohmert:
It is not antisemitic to point out that Soros funds attacks on Israel and failed to feel remorse or guilt.  ADL should apologize to Congressman Louie Gohmert.
Congressman Louie Gohmert is one of Israel’s best friends in Congress, a stalwart defender of the nation of Israel, an outspoken critic of Iran, and a great man of principle who regularly speaks at ZOA Washington Mission luncheons.  He has demonstrated his abiding love for the Jewish nation repeatedly:  Congressman Gohmert clearly articulates the Jewish people’s rights to Jerusalem and the land of Israel.  He opposes sending U.S. tax dollars to those who seek to destroy Israel, including by objecting to packages that tie funding to Israel to funding to Israel’s enemies.  He opposes creating a Palestinian state (which would promptly become an Iranian-Hamas-Fatah terror state) in Israel’s midst.
It was wrong and deeply offensive for ADL to call Congressman Gohmert’s remarks criticizing extremist Israel-basher George Soros on Fox TV “abhorrent” and “antisemitic” and “conspiracies.”  (Incidentally, ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt previously worked for the Soros-funded Aspen Institute.)
ZOA calls upon ADL to retract and apologize for ADL’s “abhorrent” attack on the Jewish people’s great friend, Congressman Louie Gohmert.
Congressman Gohmert stated: “George Soros is supposed to be Jewish but you wouldn’t know it from the damage he inflicted on Israel and the fact that he turned on fellow Jews and helped take the property that they owned.”  Gohmert’s statement was essentially correct.
ZOA points to the following facts:
Soros Extensively Funds Virulent Anti-Israel Groups: It is a well-documented fact that Soros undercuts Israel at every turn by funding organizations that demonize, defame, and propagandize against Israel, promote anti-Israel boycotts and anti-Israel UN actions, and engage in lawfare against Jews and the Jewish state.
NGO Monitor ‘s detailed 2013 report documents how Soros, through Soros’ “Open Society Foundations” (OSF), funds twenty-six (26!!) organizations that are at the forefront of undermining, delegitimizing, spreading false stories about Israel and virulently attacking Israel in every conceivable forum.  These Soros-funded anti-Israel groups include Adalah, B’tselem, Breaking the Silence, Yesh Din, Mossawa, the so-called Center for Constitutional Rights, etc.  NGO Monitor’s report also documents OSF’s direct programs harming the Jewish state. (See “Bad Investment: The Philanthropy of George Soros and the Arab-Israeli Conflict: How Soros-funded Groups Increase Tensions in a Troubled Region,” by Alexander H. Joffe & Professor Gerald M. Steinberg, NGO Monitor, May 1, 2013.)
In addition, DC Leaks uncovered Soros/OSF documents that reveal that Soros/OSF made large grants to additional anti-Israel organizations, for stated purposes such as “Garner Israeli public and political support against settlements”; “support to grantees’ advocacy missions to the US and EU with the support from OSF’s DC and Brussels offices,” (meaning defaming Israel in the U.S. and in Europe); and “strategic litigation” (meaning abusing the legal system to harass Israel).  (See OSF:  “Arab Regional Office (ARO)-Presidential Portfolio Review, Palestinian Citizens of Israel-List of Portfolio Elements,” 6 August 2015.)  These documents also reveal that Soros/OSF has been focused on this since 2001 (which happens to be the time of the Durban meeting condemning and strategizing against Israel); and that these Soros/OSF grants are approximately $4.6 million per year. The documents also reveal that while seeking to conceal its involvement and “maintaining a low profile,” Soros/OSF funds and otherwise assists a bevy of groups to “maintain sustained and targeted international advocacy” against Israel (which is also referred to in OSF documents as “Occupied Palestinian Territories”)  (See “Open Society Foundations Arab Regional Office, Portfolio Review Document, Palestine/Israel International Advocacy Portfolio,” March 25, 2014; and “Soros Hack Reveals Evidence of Systemic Anti-Israel Bias: Millions clandestinely funneled to organizations dedicated exclusively to opposing the Jewish state,” by Liel Leibovitz, Tablet Mag., Aug. 14, 2016.)
In addition, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu noted that Soros-funded NIF (New Israel Fund) “endangers the security and future of the State of Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people. . . . For decades, the Fund contributes to anti-Zionist, pro-Palestinian organizations, including ones that slander IDF soldiers, such as Breaking the Silence and B’Tselem, and those fighting for Palestinian terrorists, such as Adalah.” (See “Netanyahu: Soros-Backed New Israel Fund Seeking to ‘Erase’ Israel’s Jewish Character,” by Aaron Klein, Breitbart, Apr. 16, 2018.)
SOROS: I Am Not a Zionist, Hamas Has a Moderate Wing: In a 2007 article, Soros admitted “I am not a Zionist,” criticized Israel and the U.S. for not recognizing a Hamas government, falsely claimed that Hamas has a “moderate” political wing, and demanded that Israel should accept Hamas and agree to a Hamas-Fatah Palestinian state in Israel’s midst, among other things.  (“On Israel, America and AIPAC,” by George Soros, The New York Review of Books, April 12, 2007.)  The U.S., Egypt, Canada and the European Union all designate Hamas as a foreign terrorist organization, and Jordan bans Hamas. Shortly after Soros published this article, Soros-funded J Street was formed and began promulgating Soros’ dangerous views.
Soros’ funding of J Street is telling:  J Street repeatedly sides with Israel’s enemies, including by demonizing Israel on campuses and conferences, promoting anti-Israel UN resolutions and boycotts, lobbying for the catastrophic Iran deal, lobbying against pro-Israel U.S. government appointments, lobbying against moving the U.S. embassy to Israel’s capital Jerusalem, and raising funds for anti-Israel Congressional candidates – to name just a few.  (See ZOA’s Special Report: “J-Street Sides with Israel’s Enemies & Works to Destroy Support for Israel.)
Incidentally, during his speech at J Street’s annual conference, ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt wrongly praised J Street as “the front line of defense against BDS and delegitimization.”  In fact, J Street honors leaders of the BDS movement, brings BDS leaders to its conferences and college campuses, and supports BDS against the 650,000 Jews living in the Jewish homeland beyond the green line.  In his J Street speech, ADL’s Greenblatt also supported the anti-Israel Black Lives Matter, wrongly accused fellow Jews of “Islamophobia” and “marginalizing Palestinians” and claimed that the “Palestinian narrative” is “legitimate” – and more.  See “ADL Speech to J St. Wrongly Casts “Equal” Blame on Israel, Promotes Pro-BDS “Black Lives Matter,” Complains about Jewish “Islamophobia,” May 13, 2016.)
Soros admitted to his lack of guilt about accompanying Jewish property confiscations: Soros admitted that at age 14, he accompanied his godfather, a Nazi official, while his godfather was involved in seizing other Jews’ property in Hungary in 1944, and that Soros felt no guilt about this.
Soros stated during his 60 Minutes Interview (video):
Q: My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours, who swore that you were his adopted godson.
Soros:  Yes, yes.
Q: Went out in fact and helped with the confiscation of property from the Jews.
Soros: That’s right, yes.
Q: That sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years.  Was it difficult?
Soros:  Not at all.  Not at all.  Maybe as a child you don’t see the connection.  But it created no problem at all.
Q: No feeling of guilt?
Soros:  No.
In sum, Congressman Gohmert’s critique of George Soros was amply justified.  It is not antisemitic to point out that Soros funds attacks on Israel and failed to feel remorse or guilt.  ADL should apologize to Congressman Louie Gohmert.
ADL Recently Wrongly Attacked Other Staunch Pro-Israel Officials and Groups:  Sadly, ADL’s attack on Republican Congressman Gohmert follows other ADL attacks on other strong pro-Jewish, pro-Israel officials and organizations.
Governor Greg Abbott:  Last year, ADL unfairly attacked Texas’s Republican Governor Greg Abbott, who is another great supporter of the Jewish people and state. In May 2017, Governor Abbott proudly signed an anti-BDS law and proclaimed: “Anti-Israel policies are anti-Texas policies.”  A few months later, ADL distorted and condemned Governor Abbott’s apt and accurate reflection, regarding the fatal shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, that evil has always been with us.  (“Abbott puts church shooting in context of evil from Bible to Hitler,” by Jonathan Tilove, The Statesman, Nov. 6, 2017.)  ADL twisted the Governor’s apt reflection into a false claim and false accusation that Governor Abbott “diminished the value of the innocent lives lost in the church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas.”  ADL wrongly called Governor Abbott’s remarks “deeply insulting and irresponsible,” and “deeply offensive and an insult to the memories of those killed in Sutherland Springs.”
Sec’y of State Pompeo, ACT for America and the Center for Security Policy:  This past April, ADL wrongly maligned strong pro-Israel then-CIA-Director Mike Pompeo, in a lengthy letter to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, just before Pompeo’s confirmation hearing to become Secretary of State.  ADL’s letter wrongly maligned Director Pompeo for raising real concerns regarding Islamist terrorism in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing; wrongly criticized Director Pompeo for describing the obligation to speak out about evil and suspicious activity that one observes; and wrongly branded pro-Israel anti-terrorism experts and organizations (including ACT for America, the Center for Security Policy, and their officials) as “Islamophobes,” etc., and then essentially accused Director Pompeo of “guilt by association” for speaking with the experts whom ADL had wrongly labeled.  See “ZOA Letter to Sen. Foreign Relations Committee Endorsing Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State,” April 11, 2018.)
Canary Mission:  Also last April, ADL wrongly defamed the pro-Israel Canary Mission, by accusing Canary Mission of engaging in “Islamophobic and racist” rhetoric.  In fact, Canary Mission exposes and combats antisemitism and anti-Israel activities on U.S. college campuses – and surely did not deserve ADL’s attack.  (See, “ZOA to ADL: Stop Attacks on Pro-Israel Groups/Leaders Who Combat Radical Islamists/Anti-Semites – Don’t Promote Groups Hostile to Israel,” Apr. 27, 2018.  In this instance, ADL later announced that it regretted its attack on Canary Mission.
ADL needs to likewise apologize for wrongly attacking Congressman Gohmert.  
Capital Research Report regarding ADL and ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt:  A recent Capital Research Center report discusses ADL’s “leftward mission shift,” and “antisemitism double standard” – how ADL focuses on antisemitism from the right (some of which – e.g.., neo-Nazis, is surely real, while sometimes ignoring the real problem of antisemitism from the left and Islamists.  An article cited in the report notes that “under its new president, Jonathan Greenblatt, the ADL had moved ‘onto a partisan course at odds with [its] core mission’.”  The report also cites World Jewish Congress President Ron Lauder’s critique that “ADL play[s] politics” and ADL’s “manufactured outrage” …reduces ‘public sensitivity to the real dangers of anti-Semitism’ that confront the Jewish community.” The report also discusses ADL’s “promot[ion] of the Black Lives Matter movement […] despite BLM’s support for [Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions against Israel] and open hostility toward Israel”; ADL’s “partisan liberal political and policy positions similar to that of . . . J Street”; and that “Greenblatt [had] accused American Jews of living with ‘white privilege.’”  (See also “Jonathan Greenblatt is Destroying the Anti-Defamation League,” by Alex VanNess, New York Post, Dec. 9, 2016, noting, among other things, that “ADL has also promoted the Black Lives Matter movement, for example, by creating school lesson plans that promote it, despite BLM’s support for BDS and open hostility toward Israel.”)
Inappropriate criticism against great friends of the Jewish people such as Congressman Gohmert is counterproductive and deeply troubling.  ZOA urges ADL to retract/apologize for ADL’s wrong and unfair accusations against a great Zionist and friend of the Jewish people Congressman Louie Gohmert.  Read the press release online, here.

Dear ,
In the last week, several of the Trump Administration's efforts to expose more federal land to oil and gas drilling and exploration have come to light.   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge serves as a critical habitat for several plants and animals, including the rapidly declining population of polar bears. Despite this, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is on track to complete an environmental impact assessment regarding oil and gas leasing on the Refuge in half the usual time.   I believe this raises serious questions about the accuracy of the assessment and the risks posed by drilling in such a fragile ecosystem.   On the east coast, the Administration has issued five permits for companies to conduct seismic testing off the Atlantic Coast. Seismic testing is not only harmful to animals, but is also the first step toward opening the region to oil and gas drilling.   The Administration has also simultaneously lifted protections for Sage Grouse habitats, reducing the area of protected habitat by 9 million acres including in California. I believe these changes could further endanger an already imperiled species by exposing their habitat to harmful development.  
As your Representative in Congress, I want to hear directly from you on this important issue. Do you support the Administration’s efforts to expand oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Sage Grouse habitats, and the off the Atlantic Coast?
￼

In light of these developments, I have joined my colleagues in a bipartisan letter opposing efforts to conduct seismic testing in the Atlantic Coast. I have also cosponsored legislation which would designate the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness, which would protect the region from development.   A recent report has revealed that nearly a quarter of the United States' greenhouse gas emissions come from drilling on public lands. As we face the most significant challenge of our lifetime, I believe we must work to prioritize green energy alternatives and maintain protections on fragile ecosystems and environments so that they may be enjoyed by generations to come.   Sincerely, 
￼

Come and Read It Report
Dear Texans, 
In case you missed it, the US economy grew 3.5 percent in the third quarter, which boosted corporate profits to a six-year high - this is great news for Americans! House Republicans are committed to working with President Trump to deliver a stronger, more reliable economy for you, your business, and your family. Click here to read more. 
Joint Chiefs of Staff Update 
This weekend, President Trump named Army Chief of Staff General Mark A. Milley to succeed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford. I first met Gen. Milley when he was named Commanding General of III Corps and Ft. Hood in Texas’ 25th District. Since then, I have come to know him not only as a first-rate military leader, but as a friend. 
Time and time again, I have called on Gen. Milley for his exceptional guidance on issues that range from the needs of ‘The Great Place,’ to the needs of our soldiers’ families. Unsurprisingly, he has done what is best for our men in women in uniform and kept the welfare of this nation at the forefront of his mind each time. Gen. Milley is the definition of a true American patriot, and President Trump could not have picked a better individual to serve as our country’s highest-ranking military officer.
Legislative Update 
Last week: although our agenda was cut short in order to pay our respects to former President George H.W. Bush, we  were able to vote on five pieces of legislation in the House. 
This week: I'll participate in a Financial Services Committee hearing on the Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade, that I am vice chair of, on Wednesday at 9:00am CT. 
 I have included some articles and releases you may find interesting located on the right side of this newsletter. It is an honor and privilege to represent the people of Texas’ 25th Congressional District and as always, please reach out to me with any issues and concerns that are important to you.
In God we trust,

12/11/18 11:18,Standing Up For Minnesotans,"News from Representative Tom Emmer
￼

Dear Friend,

Thousands depend on our state’s reinsurance program, which stabilizes the insurance marketplace to ensure that more Minnesotans have access to affordable, quality health care.

When the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that they will reduce funding for Minnesota’s reinsurance program by approximately $100 million for the 2019 plan year without a clear reason why, I knew action had to be taken. That’s why I joined with my colleagues to urge CMS to reinstate full funding for Minnesota’s reinsurance program. 

Specifically, CMS previously indicated Minnesota should expect $183,930,230 for plan year 2019. However the state received a letter on November 30, 2018 stating that Minnesota would receive only $84,757,861 –which would be about $100 million less than the anticipated amount.

We wrote to CMS:

“A sudden notification that CMS would be reducing federal funding by roughly $100 million just one month before the 2019 plan year has created significant uncertainty for our state, and to date CMS has offered no explanation for why this dramatic reduction in funding has occurred. We strongly urge CMS to reconsider its decision and provide a level of pass-through funding for Minnesota that more closely matches the figure provided in the original 2017 agreement.”

You can read the full letter here.

Standing up for Minnesotans and their families is a top priority. If you have further questions regarding our letter to CMS, write to me here.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Lindsey,
I hope you’re having a wonderful holiday season. While there is much happening right now in Washington, DC as we prepare for a new Congress come January, I wanted to remind you that open enrollment for healthcare coverage is happening now for those who get their healthcare through the individual marketplace. You can compare plans and find out if you are eligible for financial assistance at nystateofhealth.ny.gov. Open enrollment in New York closes on January 31, 2019. To ensure that your coverage starts by January 1, you should sign up by December 15. If you need any additional help, please call my Manhattan office at 212-860-0606. We want to make sure you are getting the best coverage for you and your families.
From the first days of the Trump Administration, the President and Congressional Republicans have consistently tried to dismantle, sabotage and outright repeal the Affordable Care Act and I have stood strong against them each and every time. As we look forward to the 116th Congress, rest assured that my commitment to protecting the ACA’s critical protections and programs and expanding affordable coverage to every American remains firm. 
Specifically, I will work to make sure we never return to the days when Americans with pre-existing conditions were denied coverage, to expand affordable health care coverage and to boost funding for the Prevention and Public Health fund. This fund helps keep down long term health care costs and saves lives by investing in public health efforts to prevent avoidable illnesses. It invests millions of dollars in state and local immunization programs to expand and increase vaccination coverage, which is absolutely essential in combatting preventable diseases, in new screening and prevention programs for diabetes, heart disease, and more, and in many other critical public health programs. It’s time for a Congress that once again fights to improve health care, instead of one that rips it away from millions of Americans and I can’t wait to get to work on that. 
If there is anything else that I can do to assist you or your family with a federal matter, please don’t hesitate to contact me at one of the phone numbers below or send me a message here.
Sincerely,
￼
Carolyn B. Maloney

12/11/18 9:33,Happy Birthday Indiana!,"￼ 


Hoosiers,

Happy Birthday Indiana! 202 years ago, Indiana was admitted to the United States as the 19th state on December 11, 1816. Our state motto, Crossroads of America, accurately reflects the growth and innovation across a variety of industries I see as I meet with Hoosiers everyday. Today on Indiana's birthday, I wanted to share with you just a few of my favorite photos from across Indiana's Ninth District this year. From Bedford to Charlestown, we have so much to celebrate as a state: 

￼
Bedford Limestone. One of Indiana's best traditions: limestone. 3D Stone (pictured above) and a variety of stone and stone tool companies provide prosperity and jobs in our southern Indiana communities. 

￼
Hoosier Farms. Agriculture is an important part of our state's history - and our future. Across the district, I've hosted agriculture townhalls to hear from farmers and take their thoughts and concerns to Congress.

￼
Clark State Forest. One of the best views in southern Indiana - Clark State Forest. 

￼
Jobs for America's Graduates. At Scottsburg High School (pictured) and across the state, the Jobs for America's Graduates (JAG) program is providing the encouragement and direction that students need to work toward the bright future that they are all capable of achieving. 

￼
Students in STEM. At Stinesville Elementary School in Monroe County, the students in the Robotics Club built and programmed robots and were headed to a world competition for their programming. 

￼
Hoosier Manufacturing. Across Indiana, manufacturers keep our economy rolling, making everything from the car you drive to your family's dinner table. Every day, I'm honored to fight for these hardworking men and women and create an economy that allows our local manufacturing industry to thrive for generations to come.

Be of good cheer,
￼

Friends, 
This past Friday marked the 77th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The events of that day will forever shape our nation, and I am grateful for the many men and women who risk all to protect our freedoms.  
￼ 
Let's honor the Pearl Harbor heroes and remember their sacrifice.   HONORING THE LIFE OF OUR 41ST PRESIDENT 
Last week, our nation joined together to mourn the passing of our 41st President, George H.W. Bush. He was a great leader and a truly good man, and our country will be forever shaped by his legacy. I was humbled to be present at the National Cathedral as we paid tribute to his life. You can watch the service here. I hope you will join me in keeping the entire Bush family in your prayers as our country mourns the passing of their loved one. You can read my column about his remarkable life here.   ALABAMA MEN GUARD BUSH'S CASKET IN THE CAPITOL 
￼ 
What an awesome story! Two Alabama men guarded over former President George H.W. Bush’s casket as he laid in state at the U.S. Capitol. One of these heroes was AL-02 native Captain Brye French of Deatsville.   SHAW INDUSTRIES INVESTS IN AL-02 
Great economic news in AL-02: Last week, Shaw Industries, which employs more than 1,000 Alabamians, formally announced plans to invest $250 million into its Andalusia carpet manufacturing facility. This investment includes technology upgrades with an anticipated completion date of 2020. I am thrilled to celebrate this significant contribution to our economy, and I am proud of Shaw's growth and success in the State of Alabama.   OPEN ENROLLMENT EXTENDED UNTIL FEBRUARY 
￼ 
Open enrollment for Medicare has been extended until February for those who live in counties affected by Hurricane Michael. More information is available via the Dothan Eagle. Please share this information with those you know who might need it.    THE HOUSE RECONVENES  
The House is back in session this week with plenty of work to do before the holiday season. You can stay up to date on my work in Congress via Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.          
It is an honor to serve you. Please never hesitate to let me know if there is a way my office can be of assistance.    Sincerely,

Dear Friends, 
Last week, our nation said farewell to our 41st commander in chief. Linda and I were honored and humbled to attend the service at the National Cathedral. It was a beautiful celebration and noble tribute to the life of George H. W. Bush.
On our National Day of Mourning, I reflected on President Bush’s words from his Inaugural Address in 1989. I hope in his honor, we can re-engage our high moral principle to make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world.

￼  
Anniversary of the Attacks on Pearl Harbor 
December 7, 1941 remains, as President Roosevelt asserted it would, a date which lives in infamy. The sudden and deliberate attack by the Empire of Japan designed to deter America’s involvement in the Pacific instead inspired her Greatest Generation to leap into breach and defend democracy abroad.
In 1991, on the 50th Anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, a member of the Greatest Generation stood in front of the USS Arizona Memorial in Hawaii as President of the United States. 
President George H. W. Bush – called by duty to the perilous skies over the Pacific himself – consecrated the men of Pearl Harbor as the finest sons any nation could have. He told us of the unity of purpose and the principles, decency, fidelity, and honor that motivated these heroes to serve a cause greater than themselves. It is our moral responsibility on this solemn anniversary to recall those sacrifices and re-immerse ourselves in our shared commitment to peace and prosperity.

Today is Human Rights Day. It commemorates the anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the United Nations. 
In 1948, after nearly half a century of unprecedented destruction and unparalleled evil, the nations of the world came together and asserted that all people are to be guaranteed basic human rights. The concept of fundamental freedoms is engrained in us as Americans. We know all people are endowed by God with certain unalienable rights: Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.   
It is imperative that we never forget our era of individual liberty and global democracy is an exception in history, not the norm. It is something we must always be willing and able to defend.

Legislative Update 
Last week, in light of the passing of President George H.W. Bush, there were no votes in the House.   
This Week, the House is scheduled to vote on a number of important pieces of legislation. Here are a few you may be interested in:  
	•	H.R. 7217 – the IMPROVE Act. The legislation, among other things, allows states to provide coordinated care through Medicaid for children with complex medical conditions. As founder of the Childhood Cancer Caucus, I understand well of the needs of children who need extra attention for their care, and am proud to support this bill. 
	•	House Amendment to S. 2248: The measure would authorize $847.4 million to construct or renovate Veterans Affairs Department medical facilities, reauthorize programs for homeless veterans, and require the VA to provide Congress with more information on a new electronic health record system.
	•	H.Res 1035 – Expressing opposition to the completion of Nord Stream II. The Nord Stream II is an underwater gas pipeline that would transport natural gas from Russia through the Baltic Sea to Germany, further increasing Europe’s reliance on Russia for energy. The resolution would urge U.S. actions in support of European energy diversification.
This legislation also shows why the Senate needs to pass my Energy Diplomacy Act, so we can elevate and better coordinate where issues of energy and foreign policy issues intersect. The U.S. needs to step up and be able to provide energy resources to its allies where needed. 
As always, I encourage you to visit my website, mccaul.house.gov, for more information on constituent services and legislative updates. Also, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to get the latest updates on my work in Washington and the 10th District of Texas. It continues to be a great honor to represent you in the United States House of Representatives.

Kansas Common Sense  December 10, 2018
Hello,
 
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
Celebrating 41 and a Life of Public Service I was honored, on behalf of Kansans, to attend a memorial service for President George H.W. Bush at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday. During this beautiful service, numerous individuals, including former President George W. Bush, spoke to his compassion, deep commitment to public service, care and concern for the nation, work to make our country safer, dedication to his family and God, and sense of humor. 
I am grateful to President Bush for his years of leadership in various capacities. As the last president from the Greatest Generation, we will miss his perspective and sage wisdom. 
“O God, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come, Be Thou our guard while life shall last, and our eternal home.” 
 ￼ 
Urging the VA Inspector General to Investigate Allegations of Underpaid Benefits to Veterans I joined a bipartisan group of congressional colleagues in calling for a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Inspector General investigation into allegations that the VA would not reimburse veterans for missing or underpaid benefits. The VA must make every effort to restore confidence with veterans by delivering the care and benefits they have earned. The technical and staffing shortages that caused these significant problems with the implementation of the Forever GI bill must be resolved immediately, and the VA must take action to ensure these mistakes are not repeated. Further delays are unacceptable and will burden those veterans impacted who deserve a VA that is worthy of their service and sacrifice. To view the letter, click here. 
Requesting Information from Marriott Following Data Breach As chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security, I sent a letter with Senate colleagues to President and CEO of Marriott International Arne Sorenson on Monday requesting further information on a data breach the company suffered, affecting up to 500 million consumers. Marriot International announced the week before that it discovered unauthorized access of its Starwood guest reservation service in early September, and its subsequent investigation revealed that there had been unauthorized access to the network since 2014. 
This is yet another example of why it is essential to protect Americans from data misuse and breaches. In an increasingly connected economy, Congress and federal regulators must protect consumers from unfair and deceptive practices, including those involving their personal data. To read the letter, click here. 
Speaking at the Home Away from Home Holiday Reception
On Saturday morning, I spent time with Ft. Riley soldiers and local community members at the C.L. Hoover Opera House in Junction City. Former Big Red One soldier and Junction City Vice-Mayor Phyllis Fitzgerald created the Home Away from Home program to help connect incoming soldiers with local families. Fifty local families made the commitment to treat over 100 young soldiers as their own.
Over the past year, civilian families and their soldiers have spent countless hours together in an effort to ease the difficulties of moving to a new duty station. I applaud Phyllis’s commitment to creating such a program and the local families that make our Ft. Riley soldiers a priority. This is an example of why the Ft. Riley community is unique and truly is the best place to live, train, deploy from and come home to. I appreciate Ft. Riley Garrison Commander Colonel Steve Shrader for supporting the program and attending the reception.
￼ 
Announcing DOT Grants to Critical Surface Infrastructure Projects in Kansas I am pleased to share that the City of Hays and the Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City have received awards from the U.S. Department of Transportation as a part of two grant programs. 
Through the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) discretionary grant program, the Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City was awarded a $13.8 million for its Turner Diagonal Project. This project will replace the existing interchange at Interstate 70 and Turner Diagonal with a diverging diamond interchange. This new interchange will be safer and more efficient, help facilitate economic growth, and attract commercial activity to the area. It’s estimated to create 2,500 jobs and generate over $3 billion in economic growth for the area over the next several years, further highlighting the importance of surface transportation to expanding the workforce in our metropolitan areas. 
In addition, the City of Hays was awarded $6.05 million for infrastructure improvements along U.S. Highway 183 as a part of a new grant program known as Better Utilizing Investment to Leverage Development (BUILD). The BUILD grant program places greater emphasis on rural infrastructure than prior federal transportation grant programs. Hays is a growing community that is critical to our state, and I was pleased to help secure federal funding to maintain and improve an important portion of Kansas’ rural surface infrastructure. 
These grants are positive developments for both communities, and I’ll continue working with my colleagues and local leaders to build on this progress and to advocate for more federal dollars to return to Kansas for improvement projects right here at home. 
Commending K-State for Securing EDA Grant Award As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science, I commend the announcement of a $745,000 grant from the Economic Development Administration’s (EDA) 2018 Regional Innovation Strategies program competition awarded to Kansas State University to launch the Global Food Systems Economic Prosperity Accelerator. This grant will grow the knowledge-based food systems economy of Kansas, will produce more university-industry partnerships and create jobs in the region. 
I’ve been a supporter of EDA’s Regional Innovation Strategies program and have proposed increased resources for this program in my FY2019 appropriations bill. Additionally, I’ve advocated for this program in my bipartisan Startup Act, which would modernize and increase its annual authorization level. I extend my congratulations to all those working at K-State on securing this grant and my thanks for all the work they do to increase the sustainability of our global food supply, as well as the economic success of the Manhattan region. I look forward to continuing to work in partnership with K-State and the community on this important work. 
Speaking to Marysville Rotary Club On Monday, I joined the Marysville Rotary Club during their regular meeting to discuss various issues I’m working on in Washington, D.C., and to hear an update on happenings in the Marysville community. Rotary Clubs across Kansas serve as places for local leaders, business owners and passionate citizens to come together and help serve their communities. I’m grateful for my own experience as a Rotarian, and the collective impact the organization has on communities and on our state. Thank you to folks in attendance for the warm welcome and conversation, and thank you to Paula Landoll-Smith for arranging my visit. 
￼ 
Touring Hayden High School Early last week, I also toured Hayden High School in Topeka and visited with students, faculty, staff and administration officials. I appreciated the many updates I received from students on upcoming final exams, winter break plans and on the various winter sports in season. Thank you to Hayden student leaders Carline Setter and Mac Piles for leading the tour of the school and for introducing me to their fellow students. Thanks also to Hayden High School President and Shawnee County Commissioner Shelly Buhler for arranging my visit and for our conversation. 
￼ 
Visiting Quinter Following the Fire at Formation Plastics Recently, the community of Quinter suffered a major loss following a fire at Formation Plastics. I’m grateful that everyone is safe and no one was injured in the fire, and I’m continually appreciative of the many volunteer emergency responders across our state who assist during such times of need. Upon my return to Kansas, I visited Quinter to meet with city and county officials to discuss state and federal resources that may be available to help the community and those affected by the fire. 
I remain committed to assisting the community in any way I can as they recover. Thank you to Quinter Mayor Dwight Tummons, Gove County Commissioners Mike Gillespie and Duane Vollbracht, Gove County Clerk Shelly Holaday and Gove County Economic Development Board Member Mitch Gillespie for taking time to meet with me. Robba and I have the community in our thoughts and prayers. 
￼ 
To Infinity and Beyond! One of my goals as a United States Senator is to create and foster an environment where young Kansans interested in STEM can receive a quality education and enjoy robust career opportunities right here at home. 
As part of this mission, I hosted NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and NASA Astronaut Don Pettit on December 1 in Wichita to speak with students interested in STEM and space exploration. Over 150 Kansas students, educators and families heard from Astronaut Pettit on his path to becoming an astronaut and his many missions to the International Space Station. Astronaut Pettit shared exciting stories from his time in space and encouraged students to “find their frontier” and chase after their dreams. I am certain that we had numerous future scientists, engineers, mathematicians – and even astronauts! – in the room with us. To view a recap of the day’s events, click here.

Honoring K-State Coach Bill Snyder on the Senate Floor This week, I gave remarks on the Senate floor honoring retiring K-State Head Football Coach Bill Snyder on an extremely successful career at K-State, as well as his many contributions to and impact on K-State, the city of Manhattan and the state of Kansas. His legacy is deeply etched into the university and surrounding region, and his commitment beyond the football field has improved the lives of others. An extremely caring and talented developer of young men, we all hope to make the kind of positive impact that Coach Snyder has. Robba and I wish Bill, Sharon and the entire Snyder family all the best in this new chapter. To watch my floor remarks, click here. 
￼  
Honored to Serve You in Washington It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

Hail to the Chief
Dear Friends,
Last week, votes and hearings were postponed as people from across America came to the U.S. Capitol to pay respects to the late President George H.W. Bush – a true patriot from the Greatest Generation.  
President Bush was a remarkable leader who led a life of duty, purpose, and conviction. He was the last of our presidents to wear the uniform and serve in combat, but his contributions to our Nation didn’t end there. A World War II veteran, President, Vice President, Congressman, UN Ambassador, CIA Director, husband, and father – he devoted his life to country and family.
The true embodiment of service and leadership, he made his mark on America and the world. His memorial services throughout the week showed just that, and at Wednesday's service, we heard the deeply moving words of his son, President George W. Bush, and others, whose lives he touched in countless ways. Click here to watch Wednesday's beautiful service.
￼
It was amazing to see our country come together to mourn and reflect on the President’s life. Families stood in line for hours to pay their respects in the Capitol, people crowded the streets of Washington, D.C. and Texas to say goodbye, and many shared stories with loved ones. Even the sheer range of distinguished officials, foreign dignitaries, and government representatives who joined together to lay our former Commander-in-Chief to rest was truly moving.
It was a touching service for a remarkable man. His leadership, love of country, and dedication to family will be his lasting legacy. In another display of respect and admiration, last week, I proudly cosponsored a resolution to honor the life of President George H. W. Bush and commemorate his service to our country. Rest In Peace, Mr. President. 

Monday Gatherings
Last Monday, I joined folks in Gibson for the annual meeting of Family Connections and Community In Schools (FCCIS) of Glascock County. With a little holiday spirit, I was grateful to speak with well over 100 community members – all of whom contribute in one way or another to the success of the organization. Collaborative members include law enforcement officers, school officials, business owners, churches, and vital corporate partners, such as Walmart and Golden Harvest Food Bank. The work that’s being done there is phenomenal. From helping students excel in school through tutoring and mentorships to making sure that kids don’t go to bed hungry through its backpack program, FCCIS is bridging the gap and empowering people to pursue their full potentials. 
I was happy to hear from Executive Director Wanda Davis, who shared more about the organization’s mission and accomplishments. Over a hot meal, the group heard from Wadley native and arena league football player AJ Harmon, who gave an inspirational message about how he overcame hardship with the help of his teacher and mentor.

Investing in Better Roads
Last week, Georgia got some great news with the announcement that the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded the state a $24.8 million BUILD grant award to assist with highway improvements in Barrow County, including the widening of Highway 316. 
This important federal investment and federal grant project will enhance efforts to improve our infrastructure and road safety as we continue to build along this critical corridor. Click here for more information on the announcement. 

Cadet's Corner
On Saturday, one of my Service Academy nominees, Anna Jerald, had the opportunity to meet and speak with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during the 119th Army-Navy game. Now a sophomore or “yearling” at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, her drive and motivation to serve our Nation are making us proud. She’s also an active member of the Women’s Rugby team. Keep up the great work, Anna!

Look Who's Coming to Town 
Christmas came early for Taliaferro County with the announcement that Harrison Poultry is building a state-of-the-art chicken feed manufacturing facility just outside of Crawfordville. Last Tuesday, community members gathered at A.H. Stephens State Park for a groundbreaking ceremony for the new feed mill, which is projected to bring more than 230 full-time jobs to the Taliaferro County region. This is huge for the community as it represents the first major industry to move into the area.  Congratulations to Taliaferro County Development Authority Chairman Jackie Butts, County Commission Chairman Charles Ware, the Harrison Poultry family, and all who made this development possible.  I look forward to seeing its operations when construction is complete in the summer of 2020.

Georgia delegation congressional voting Albany Herald – 12/9 Here’s a look at how Georgia’s members of Congress voted over the previous week. Along with roll call votes this week, the House also passed a resolution (H.J. Res. 143) making further continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2019 and passed a resolution (H. Res. 1167) expressing the profound regret and sorrow of the House of Representatives on the death of George Herbert Walker Bush, 41st president of the U.S. 
Exclusive– Rep. Jody Hice: Republicans ‘Need to Deliver’ $5B in Wall Funding Breitbart – 12/4 Rep. Jody Hice (R-GA) told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement on Tuesday that Republicans “need to deliver” on their commitment to President Donald Trump to secure $5 billion in border wall funding this December, cautioning that a late December deadline may make it harder for the president to secure more funding.
Indian eGov: TURNER LEADING HOUSE MEMBERS IN URGING TRUMP TO UPHOLD $733B FOR DOD IN FY20. Bloomberg Government – 12/9 Chairman Mike Turner (OH-10) of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces is currently leading a letter to President Donald J. Trump strongly urging his administration to uphold its commitment of $733 billion to restore our nation's military as they complete the fiscal year 2020 President's Budget. The letter, which currently has 70 signatures of House members, will be sent to the President at the end of next week. ""We are strongly urging the President to follow his original budget plan of $733 billion for the Department of Defense as he prepares his presidential budget for Fiscal Year 2020,"" said Chairman Turner. ""President Trump cannot claim he is rebuilding our military while cutting the funds necessary to do so.

Israel has long been our closest ally in the Middle East, and it was a great honor to witness the historic – and long overdue –  opening of the American Embassy in the holy city of Jerusalem just a few months later. Today, I’m proud to celebrate the anniversary of this recognition, and I look forward to continuing to strengthen the enduring ties between our two nations.” – Congressman Jody Hice (GA-10)

Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends: 
This week, the nation paused to mourn the passing of President George H. W. Bush.  A member of the greatest generation, he led our country and the world with grace, integrity and grit.  I first met President Bush when he was then, Vice-President Bush.  It was an honor to attend his funeral service in Washington, D.C. 
￼
______________ 
Friday was the anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  May we always remember the fortitude of those who served and sacrificed that day.  And may we never take for granted the freedoms they died defending.  
￼ 
_______________ 
Also, on Friday, the most recent job numbers were released and provided more good news – unemployment remains at the lowest it has been in almost a half century (since 1969). Labor participation is nearly 63 percent and the economy added 155,000 in November.  Last but not least, we are on track for jobs gains to exceed 100,000 every month for only the 2nd year since 2000. 
￼ 
_______________ 
This week, Senators Coons and Young introduced the Senate companion to the Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act of 2018 – that I introduced with Rep. Dan Lipinski earlier this year. This bill supports the expansion of the successful National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program to teach scientists and engineers about leveraging their laboratory research into successful commercial products and services; With a Senate companion, the bill now has a clear path to become law.  It will bridge the divide between the academic world and commercialization sphere, playing a critical role in the efforts to increase innovation for all Americans. It also requires a Government Accountability Office assessment of the I-Corps program – its first comprehensive, independent evaluation since it was created.  
_______________ 
It is the season of Christmas parades! This weekend, I participated in the Brooksville and Belleview’s annual Christmas parade. I was honored to serve as the Grand Marshall for Belleview.  It was great to see so many friends and constituents enjoying this holiday season.

Constituent Corner
A constituent from Leesburg contacted our office after receiving news from her doctor that Medicare would no longer cover the cost of medications that she depended on. Following the inquiry, we sent on her behalf to Medicare, we learned a technician was in contact with the constituent’s doctor to resolve the issue. Medicare had reviewed the medication and provided the constituent’s doctor the information that the prescription schedule was indeed covered under Medicare.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.    
District Update
 Pam Jones from my district office took a tour of the Lake County Fairgrounds this last week. She met with Cole Scharlau, the manager of the Lake Country Fairgrounds, along with offices from the Lake County Agency for Economic Prosperity. The Fairgrounds host the weekly farmers market on Thursdays and a vast number of events throughout the year.
￼ 
Pam also attended ""Light up Lady Lake"" this past Friday. This celebration brought the Town of Lady Lake together to bring in the Holiday season.   
￼ 
  
Legislative Update
On Friday, President Trump signed into law a two-week extension of government funding, which was set to expire on December 7 but will now expire on December 21. This two-week extension was to accommodate the changes in schedule in Washington surrounding the passing of President Bush. While all sides were able to agree on moving the deadline to accommodate the activities of last week, we still have very real challenges ahead to agree on a responsible budget that properly funds core government functions such as border security. Hardworking taxpayers make tough spending decisions to stay within their budget and expect their representatives will do the same when funding our massive federal government.
I remain concerned about our nation’s debt and spending trajectory and that concern will be at the front of my mind in evaluating any potential budget/spending plans. I pledge to continue to work hard on behalf of Florida’s hardworking taxpayers and families to advance common-sense reforms and principled policy and budgets that get our fiscal house in order.

$40 Million for I-65 Expansion Projects in Indiana 
As the Crossroads of America, it is critical that Indiana’s roads can accommodate the safe transportation of people and goods. I was happy to announce that Indiana will receive two BUILD Grants from the U.S. Department of Transportation totaling $40 million. These big investments in infrastructure will promote both safety and economic opportunity for Hoosiers and those who want to do business in our state. 
Changing our Criminal Justice System 
Earlier this year I launched my Fair Shot Agenda with the goal of ensuring all Hoosiers have a fair shot at success. This includes people in need of a second chance to turn their lives around. 
On Tuesday, I announced my support for the First Step Act to make needed reforms to our criminal justice system to reduce recidivism, create fairer sentencing requirements, and prepare inmates to be successful members of society. I’m proud of this bipartisan legislation, and I will continue working with Indiana stakeholders to ensure that it accomplishes its goal creating a fairer and more effective criminal justice system, and ensuring non-violent inmates become successful law-abiding citizens when they return to society. 
See what Indiana groups think about this bill.

39 Exemplary Young Hoosiers  
Out of a record 149 applicants, I had the privilege of recommending 39 talented Hoosiers for admission to the United States service academies this year. These young men and women are highly qualified to serve our country and I’m very proud of all their hard work. I wish them the best of luck in their application process.

The Latest in Yemen 
Last week in the Senate Foreign Relations committee, the administration’s nominee to serve as Ambassador to Yemen said the civil war has exacerbated the world’s largest food security emergency, created power vacuums that terrorists have exploited, facilitated Iran’s ambitions, and complicated our CT efforts.

 Pete’s Top Tweets  RepPeteOlson  Today we celebrate the life of fallen #TX22 @HoustonFire firefighter Anne Sullivan. She would have been 30 today. Anne was 1 of 4 brave firefighters killed fighting the 2013 Southwest Inn fire. #NeverForget @FortBendISD  ￼   RepPeteOlson  Today, on the 77th anniversary of Japan’s attack on #PearlHarbor, we remember our brave military who lost their lives. We honor those who fought to defend America, like #TX22 veteran George Griffin, who served on the USS Curtis when it was attacked that fateful day. #NeverForget  ￼   RepPeteOlson  Great meeting with @AndrianCandu & @CristinaBalanDC of @USembMoldova yesterday to discuss the importance of free & fair elections around the world. Both Congress & @StateDept must continue to support democracy, economic growth, security & reform in eastern Europe. ￼ 
Dear Friend,  Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to read about some of last week’s highlights in Washington.   Assuming Poe’s Mantle on Victims’ Rights   It was an honor when my good friend and Houston colleague Rep. Ted Poe asked me to carry on his work as co-chair of the Congressional Victims’ Rights Caucus. Houston is a growing haven for human trafficking, which is why I’m committed to advocate for victims and make criminals pay for their violence. The Congressional Victims’ Rights Caucus is the bipartisan voice in Congress for victims of crime. The caucus represents the interests of victims, increases awareness about violent and sexual crime in our country and works to increase resources available to law enforcement to combat the problem. While I have some big shoes to fill, I promise to continue Ted’s tireless work and look forward to working with my co-chair Rep. Jim Costa.     Ellington Update from TX National Guard  It was great to get an update on Ellington Field operations from Maj. Gen. John Nichols, Maj. Gen. David McMinn of the Texas National Guard and Marcy Weldin from the Texas Military Department. We discussed my recent visit to Ellington and how Congress can continue to support our men and women in uniform. As a former Navy pilot, I understand the critical role our troops play in protecting our nation and will continue to advocate for the resources they need to complete their missions.    Harvey Homeowner Assistance Program Applications Now Open  Applications for a new Homeowner Assistance Program is now open for eligible folks in Fort Bend and Brazoria Counties.  This program is administered by the Texas General Land Office to help folks continue to rebuild their homes. Folks in Harris County are currently not eligible for this program, however the County is developing their own program. Click here for more information and updates. Eligibility is determined if a primary residence was damaged or destroyed by Harvey. Click here for more information and to apply. Also, make sure you have all of the documents needed to complete the process. Have questions about the program or need help with the application? You can email cdr@recover.texas.gov or call 1-844-893-8937. Please feel free to contact my office with any Harvey related questions. My staff is more than happy to help navigate the process.  I’m honored to represent you in Congress. For more information on constituent services, current legislation or to sign up for my E-newsletter, please visit my website, www.olson.house.gov.    Very respectfully, Pete Olson

Dear Lindsey: 
Last week, plans to be voting in DC were changed to pay respects and lay President George H.W. Bush to rest. Bush served our country with dignity, and our thoughts remain with the Bush family during this difficult time. 
Sincerely, ￼ Mark DeSaulnier Member of Congress

LEGISLATIVE UPDATE
Mark's Bill to Rename the Nevin Avenue Post Office in Richmond was Signed into Law
On Friday, Mark's bill to rename the Nevin Avenue Post Office in honor of Harold D. McCraw Sr. was signed into law. Harold was a distinguished and dedicated civil servant, who began working for the Richmond Post Office in 1965 and served the United States Postal Service (USPS) for 45 years. Mr. McCraw was also an active member of the Richmond community, serving on various boards and commissions, and he facilitated the development of a child care facility that has expanded to five locations and cares for hundreds of children.

During World War II, the beacon atop Mt. Diablo went dark to make an air attack on California more difficult, and was not lit again until 1964. Each year since on December 7th, a date which will live in infamy, we light the beacon to pay tribute to the lives lost at Pearl Harbor.

12/10/18 17:40,November Highlights from the House,"￼

 
Welch Legislation Would Improve Child Nutrition
Along with Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Peter introduced the Local School Foods Expansion Act, legislation to improve child nutrition by expanding access to locally-grown, unprocessed fruits and vegetables for school meal programs. “Farm-to-school programs effectively support our family farmers, reduce energy use, help maintain open land, and provide healthy food and educational opportunities for our students,” insisted Peter. “This commonsense legislation will expand access to locally-grown, fresh fruits and vegetables to even more schools and communities.”
“Nobody is Above the Law”  
In a message to the demonstrators gathered in Burlington to protest the President’s firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Peter called upon the new Acting Attorney General, Matthew Whitaker, to immediately recuse himself from the Mueller investigation and for Congress to open an investigation into the circumstances of Mr. Sessions departure. “It is imperative that all Americans pay attention to what is happening in Washington and speak up as you are today. Your voice matters. Your actions matter. And your passion for our democracy matters. Thank you for all you are doing to stand up for our democracy and our democratic norms of free speech, a free press, and the rule of law,” said Peter.
Standing Up for Humanitarian Values 
Peter took to the floor of the U.S. House to demand the House take up a resolution that would halt the sales of arms to the Saudi government that are being used to bomb and displace innocent civilians in the brutal war in Yemen. 
￼ 
WATCH HERE 
Touring Small Businesses  
Peter held a press conference with members of the Small Business Administration as part of a Shop Local event to highlight small businesses in Brattleboro. Peter continues to be a strong voice in Congress for Vermont’s small business owners. 
￼ 
Peter met with the owners of Malisun, a clothing and jewelry business. Supporting small businesses like Malisun keeps our downtowns vibrant and our communities strong. 
Eliminating Wasteful Pentagon Spending 
Last year, the House passed legislation co-sponsored by Peter calling for a long-overdue financial audit of the Pentagon. The results are in, and the Pentagon failed. “Though President Trump is proposing dramatic increases to our already bloated defense budget, it is clear that more money is not that the answer,” said Peter. “The Pentagon must make every effort to crack down on this unchecked waste, fraud, and abuse to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being spent responsibly.” 
Visiting Neighbors 
Over the past month, Peter has traveled the state to meet with and see first-hand the charitable heart of Vermonters and our communities as we head into the holiday season. 
￼ 
Peter met with volunteers collecting food for the Salvation Army at the 17th Annual Stuff-A-Truck Food Drive in Barre. 
￼ 
Peter stopped by to help at the annual Turkey Day event at the Upper Valley Haven. 
￼ 
Peter had a special visit in the D.C. office from his newly elected colleague from New Hampshire, Chris Pappas, along with Congresswoman Annie Kuster. It seems they both needed some schooling on the superiority of Vermont pure maple syrup, so he gave them a sample from the Richardson Family Farm.

Dear Lindsey, 
President George H.W. Bush truly made the United States a “kinder, gentler nation.” Last week, I had the honor of attending President Bush’s funeral at the Washington National Cathedral. Our nation heard touching eulogies honoring the former president’s decades of service and lifelong example of civility, loyalty, and sacrifice. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch’s Chuck Raasch covered the funeral, featuring the calls for civility. I wholeheartedly agree that our nation’s public servants have a duty to call people to their highest and best, not to their lowest and least. I will be forever thankful to Bush 41 for the kindness he showed to me and so many others throughout his life. His legacy will live on in the hearts of countless Americans.
 
￼
￼

Jefferson County got big news when the House passed the Coast Guard Authorization bill, allowing the historic Delta Queen steamboat to once again carry passengers up and down the mighty Mississippi River. The bill was signed by President Trump last week, and the Delta Queen Steamboat Co. has announced their renovation plans before resuming operations in 2020 from their base port in Kimmswick. I am proud that the Delta Queen will provide visitors with a true riverboat experience and bring more job opportunities to the region.
 
Last month, I joined many of my fellow Members of Congress in pressuring the Rwandan government to release opposition figure Diane Rwigara and her mother Adeline after they were imprisoned on politically motivated charges. Diane ran for president against Rwandan President Paul Kagame and was absurdly arrested for “insurrection and promoting sectarianism” because she dared to challenge the ruling regime. I was so delighted that last week, the Rwandan court acquitted Diane and her mother of all charges. No one should be imprisoned for running for public office. Freedom of expression is a basic human right.
 
￼

Lastly, I want to thank the impressive and diligent MO-02 Academy Nominations Panel for their hard work culminating in interviews with all 41 candidates last week. I was thrilled to see them in action and personally express my gratitude. Candidates will be notified regarding their nomination status in the coming weeks.

It is an honor to represent more than 70,000 Pinellas veterans in Congress. Whether introducing bipartisan legislation expanding veterans’ access to medical marijuana, ensuring VA facilities are providing the best care possible, or returning over $700,000 in earned benefits and service awards to Pinellas veterans, we’re fighting every day for the men and woman who put their lives on the line for our freedoms. Our office is here for you, to help you – and your family – get the benefits you have earned.  To best serve Pinellas veterans, I need to hear from you what is and is not working, what needs improvement, and what additional support the veterans community needs. This is especially true as we work to modernize the VA healthcare system in a way that does not compromise accessibility or quality, so that our veterans are getting the very best care. Please take our survey to share firsthand experiences with the VA’s healthcare system and suggestions on ways to improve the care our veterans receive here in Pinellas.  

 Share your thoughts now!
Please feel free to forward this survey to family, friends, and neighbors in the veterans community so they can share their thoughts as well. If you are currently experiencing an issue with benefits and need assistance, please call (727) 318-6770 – we’re here to serve YOU!

House Democrats Send Letter Inviting President Trump to Visit Idled GM Facilities and Workers
Last week, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) joined Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (OH-09), Congresswoman Debbie Dingell (MI-12), Congressman Tim Ryan (OH-13), and Congressman-elect Andy Levin (MI-09) in sending a letter to President Donald Trump formally asking him to visit the communities impacted by General Motors’ decision to idle several North America plants. 
“Respectfully, we invite you to join us to visit the Lordstown Assembly, Warren Transmission, Brownstown Battery, Baltimore Operations and Detroit-Hamtramck plants, to meet the workers who will soon receive pink slips. This idling will impact over 14,000 workers, including the layoff of 3,300 production workers in the United States and 2,500 in Canada, and another 8,000 salaried employees,” the Members wrote.
“We urge your Administration’s intervention in every manner possible to seek both short and long-term remedies for these workers, the auto-part supplies that will also be impacted, and the communities sure to be severely impacted by these job losses,” the Members continued.
“Our communities need deliverance on your promises to invest in and restore America’s manufacturing might and to put an end to the outsourcing of American jobs. We will work with you and your Administration to reinvest and modernize American auto manufacturing. Thank you for review of this urgent request,” the Members concluded.

Dear Friends, 
Last week, Congress stood in recess and the nation came together to mourn the passing of our 41st president, George H.W. Bush.  George Bush lived a life of integrity and decency dedicated to service to our country – as a WWII pilot, Member of Congress, CIA director, Ambassador, VP, and finally President. While party was important to him, he was a statesman who put country first. I join the nation in mourning his loss and offer my sincere condolences to the Bush family.
While Washington was put on hold, I was grateful for the opportunity to work in the district this week.  I had several informative meetings with constituents in our office and at our Neighborhood Office Hours in Northbrook.  I also attended events hosted by  the Lake County Veterans and Family Services Foundation in Grayslake, the Lake County Municipal League, the Illinois Business Immigration Coalition, and the Health Professionals Education Consortium.  And I finished the week meeting with a group of extraordinary high school students involved with Find a Cure, a  service organization benefiting the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS).
On a personal note, I hope you’ll keep in mind two important upcoming deadlines. First, Open Enrollment for Health Insurance ends this Saturday, October 15. Visit healthcare.gov today to compare and select plans to make sure you’re covered for 2019. Second, we’re continuing to collect holiday cards for servicemembers at our Lincolnshire office until this Friday, October 14.
Please continue reading for more updates from the week, as well as the results to our recent constituent survey. 
CONSTITUENT SURVEY RESULTS 
￼ 
  
Earlier this month, we asked you to take a brief survey and share the top issues you believe Congress should address in the new term. 
More than 2,400 of you responded, and the top three issues selected were Health Care Gun Safety, and the Environment/Climate. (They were followed by Immigration, Medicare/Social Security, and Campaign Finance/Ethics Reform).  
I appreciate your feedback, and will keep your priorities top of mind as I work with my colleagues in the new majority to make progress on the issues that matter to our communities.

HOLIDAY CARDS FOR HEROES – DROP OFF BEFORE FRIDAY! 
￼ 
  
With some of the cards constituents dropped off in 2017. 
For the second year, we’re running our “Holiday Cards for Heroes” program to collect cards for military servicemembers stationed far from home this holiday season.  
You’re invited to drop off cards at our District Office or any Neighborhood Office Hours event through Friday, December 14. We’re open Monday through Friday, 9:00am – 5:00pm at 111 Barclay Blvd, Suite 200, Lincolnshire, IL 60069. 
Last year,we collected and distributed more than 200 cards with help from the United Service Organizations (USO). A personal, handwritten card is a much-appreciated way to say thank you to the Americans serving our country, offer words of encouragement, and share holiday cheer. I’m glad we can again facilitate this program to connect constituents and our service members.
  
NEIGHBORHOOD OFFICE HOURS 
This week, our constituent service representatives will be in Des Plaines, Waukegan, Grayslake, Zion, Lake Bluff, and Wheeling. If you need assistance with a federal issue, from Medicare and Social Security to Immigration and the VA, please come see us!

THE SCALISE CAPITOL REPORT
Mourning President George H.W. Bush
Last week, we laid to rest President George H.W. Bush. President Bush dedicated his entire life to public service, including so many different roles in elected and appointed positions. While we all mourn his loss, we gain solace in knowing that he is finally reunited with his beloved wife of 73 years, Barbara. His legacy will loom large in so many ways, but none more than in his five children and 17 grandchildren, many of whom are already paying tribute to his life of public service by continuing on in his footsteps. Jennifer and I are keeping the entire Bush family in our thoughts and prayers as we share in their mourning.

Securing $41.4M for LA-01 Transportation Projects
Last Thursday, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced LA-01 was awarded $41.4 million in two separate BUILD grants. St. Tammany Parish was awarded $25 million to expand I-12, and the Greater Lafourche Port Commission was awarded $16.4 million for the South Lafourche Airport Corridor Project. 

The $25 million grant to widen I-12 in St. Tammany has long been a top priority of mine, and the recent tragedy over Memorial Day weekend underscored why this project is needed, and why the announcement by DOT Secretary Chao is so important.

I was also very excited to announce that another priority of mine, Port Fourchon’s Airport Connector Project, will receive a $16.4 million grant. Port Fourchon is a hub of economic activity, and as America continues to be a leading oil and gas producer, improving access to our offshore rigs is crucial. Construction of this industrial corridor will not only be a boon to our local economy, but has incredible national significance because of the importance of American energy production.

Remembering President Bush 
Our Country, and indeed our state, have lost a man of honor who leaves a legacy of love and service for his nation and his family. 
Our state and our nation have been in mourning over the loss of President George H.W. Bush. From my office in the Capitol, I could see the thousands of visitors streaming in to pay him their respects. He inspired our nation with his kindness, dedication, and humility, and few Americans will ever rival the depth and breadth of service to our nation that President Bush has. I am truly blessed to have been a part of President Bush’s life, and he will be greatly missed.

12/10/18 12:41,"ICYMI - The Senate Should Pass ""Jobs 3.0""","￼ 
ICYMI:
Dallas Morning News Supports ""Jobs 3.0""
This week, the Dallas Morning News urged the Senate to pass the Jobs 3.0 capital formation package, containing bills that will encourage American entrepreneurship. Rep. Hensarling introduced the Jobs 3.0 package earlier this year, and it was passed by the House by a vote of 406-4 in July.

Finally, a reason for the lame-duck Congress to meet; if only the Senate can do its job                                                                       
We aren’t sure who exactly came up with the term “lame-duck Congress,” but then we also believe it doesn’t much matter. The Congress that’s meeting now likely won’t do much as the world waits for new members to be sworn in during January and a new House majority to hand the speaker’s gavel to Nancy Pelosi of California. 
But the lameness of what Congress will likely do doesn’t take away from the fact that there is work that could be done. We would go so far as to say that there is good reason for Congress to convene beyond the normal spending necessary to keep the government lights on. Namely, there is a rare bipartisan opportunity to enact legislation that would lessen the burden small businesses face when attempting to create jobs in America.
We understand that just about every economic reform is justified under the rubric of helping the little guy in businesses. But in this case, there is a set of reforms on the table that would bolster small businesses, which create two out of every three new jobs in this country.
Here is what is happening: Earlier this year, Jeb Hensarling — the retiring Dallas Republican who for a few more weeks will be chairman of the House Financial Services Committee — shepherded through the House a bill he calls JOBS 3.0. Like all things congressional, the bill is an ode to complexity and bureaucratic-speak and could be improved. But overall, the bill helps reshape the regulatory landscape for small businesses in such a way as to make it easier for them to create more jobs that can employ more Americans.
The bill contains 32 measures that cut red tape and promote investment, innovation and access to capital. One provision would make it easier for people with little or no credit history to obtain bank loans. Another provision revises securities rules to help businesses and investors raise capital. Other changes update old rules that make it difficult and expensive for companies to go public.
But like many other good ideas, this one passed the House overwhelmingly and headed to the Senate, where it appears headed for a quiet death. It appears to be hung up on a few objections — one of which is too arcane to print in an editorial but has to do with the role that state insurance regulators should play in international disputes.   
Hensarling doesn’t want this bill to go quietly into the night, so he recently took to the House floor. “We couldn’t get 406-4 votes on a Mother’s Day resolution,” he said. “And yet it languishes on that side of the Capitol.” 
Maybe he is just upset about all the hard work he did to win over Maxine Waters — a Democrat from California — who not only supports JOBS 3.0 but was instrumental in getting her Democratic colleagues on board, too.
In any case, if there is going to be a lame-duck Congress, the Senate should use part of its time to pass this bill. Doing so just might help millions of middle-class Americans land a job, increase their pay, or otherwise make permanent gains while this booming economy lasts.

Thankfully, there were no fatalities but several were injured and dozens more suffered damage to their homes and property.   Recovery efforts are on-going. Many local volunteers and many in the surrounding communities in central Illinois have donated time and money to assist Taylorville.   I cannot thank everyone who has volunteered to help friends, neighbors, and even strangers enough. First responders and other volunteers stepped up to make sure people were safe and immediately began the recovery efforts.   To see my community and friends help each other; that’s what makes small-town America great. That’s what makes Taylorville great.   We still have a long way to go but the support has been amazing to see.

Good morning folks - 
I take seriously the responsibility you have entrusted in me to make Washington more competent and less wasteful. 
This is why, every month I research and identify areas of abuse and inefficiencies then give out the Squeal Award, which recognizes a Washington expense, program or concept that is not working and must be fixed or eliminated. 
This month, my award goes to the U.S. Forest Service ...  

Squeal Award: Taxpayer Dollars are Subsidizing Sexual Misconduct within the U.S. Forest  Service
What happens when a federal agency – funded by taxpayers – is breaking its trust with the American people, by allowing a culture of sexual abuse to exist throughout the agency? 
Well, believe it or not, the U.S. Forest Service is that agency.   And, multiple lawsuits and congressional investigations have now been levied at the agency – trying to curtail this horrifying culture of abuse occurring among the ranks of the federal government.  
The U.S. Forest Service has an extensive history of mishandling the repeated claims of sexual assault and harassment within their agency.   For example, earlier this year, Tony Tooke, the former chief, was accused of multiple sexual misconduct allegations, resulting in his resignation.  Moreover, a 2018 survey of employees within the Forest Service’s California region, reported that 22 people indicated that they experienced sexual assault or harassment during their tenure.  Prior to that, in 2016, a congressional committee reported that gender-based discrimination and harassment had become increasingly prevalent within the agency since 2008.   Furthermore, multiple women have filed class-action lawsuits against the Forest Service, shedding light on the inadequacy of the agency’s culture.  It is frankly negligent and downright unacceptable to have this behavior persist for years on end. 
That’s why during a recent nominations hearing of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I tried to get to the bottom of not just why sexual misbehavior was happening – but continuing to happen – at the U.S. Forest Service.  
I came to Washington to make sure that unaccountable bureaucrats know they won’t be able to continue to hide in the shadows. For this reason, I’m presenting this month’s Squeal Award to the U.S. Forest Service for allowing taxpayer dollars to subsidize sexual misconduct within its ranks.
Our society has no place for this sort of behavior and it especially should not be funded by hard-working Americans.

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 12.10.18

Help for Sexual Assault Victims
Before the 115th Congress concludes, the House of Representatives will take up an important bill I cosponsored with Rep. Ted Poe (R-TX), the Megan Rondini Sexual Assault Victims Protection Act.
The namesake of the bill was a student at the University of Alabama. One night, Megan was raped by a man from a prominent local family. She went to the local hospital and reported the incident to the police, but the hospital did not have the proper resources to deal with sexual assault, and the police soon focused on infractions they believed she had committed.
The district attorney did not pursue a case against Megan’s attacker, and her emotional and mental state declined. She transferred universities, but still, the rape and its aftermath haunted her, and ultimately, she took her own life.
Megan’s story shows that we have to do better for sexual assault victims. The bill introduced in her name will help.
Under the provisions of the Megan Rondini Sexual Assault Victims Protection Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) would set up a task force to identify the barriers that block access to sexual assault forensic examiners, sexual assault nurse examiners, and other forensic medical examiners. The task force would help states improve their ability to gather evidence.
When this bill becomes law, by July 1, 2019, the HHS website would include resources and best practices developed by stakeholders for responding to sexual assault, and an annual summit would be convened by the Secretary to address gaps in health care regarding sexual assault.
Improving responses to sexual assault cases will also be the subject of an upcoming hearing by the House Energy and Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, of which I am Vice Chairman. We will examine the availability of Sexual Assault Forensic Exams (SAFE kits) and sexual assault nurse examiners (SANEs) in hospitals.
By improving access to proper resources and professionals trained in responding to sexual assault, we can help support the victims of these heinous crimes.
The Greatest Generation
The nation paused for several days to say goodbye to George Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st President of the United States, who died on November 30.
In one sense, his passing was a rare event. He was one of only 44 people who have held the office of president since the Constitution went into effect in 1789, and the last president to pass away was Gerald Ford in 2006. Further, he was only the second president to also be the father of a president, following John Adams and his son, John Quincy.
But in another sense, this event was all too common. President Bush was one more of the World War II veterans who are rapidly slipping away from us. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs projected in November that only 496,777 World War II veterans remained alive, and 348 of them pass away each day.
President Bush’s service in World War II would have been noteworthy even if he did not subsequently have the illustrious life he led. He enlisted in the Navy on his 18th birthday and become one of the youngest aviators in the Navy. While flying in a mission over Chi Chi Jima in 1944, his plane was hit by Imperial Japanese antiaircraft fire. The plane completed its mission before Bush had to bail out; while the other crew members were killed, he parachuted into the Pacific Ocean and was rescued by a U.S. submarine after several hours on a raft.
The death of President Bush came only days after Ray Chavez, the oldest living survivor of Pearl Harbor, passed away at the age of 106. When asked by CNN about how much he thought of the events of December 7, 1941, and his service, he said, ""Every day. And not hysterical or mean thoughts about it -- it was great. But it never goes away. All of what you see and learned.""
For the first time since the attack, this year’s remembrance ceremony at Pearl Harbor included no survivors of the USS Arizona, the battleship most devastated by the air raid. Five survivors remain alive, but none could return to commemorate the “date which will live in infamy.”
Journalist Tom Brokaw famously labelled them “The Greatest Generation,” and their accomplishments were incredible – not only the heroism of their wartime service, but their contributions upon coming home. As we honor President Bush, let us also honor all the members of his generation who gave so much on behalf of our country.

Wicker Remembers President George H.W. Bush
Recalls Bush’s Personal Courtesy Years Ago
In his inaugural address almost exactly three decades ago, President George H.W. Bush reminded Americans that some ideas are timeless.  Those ideas, he said, include “duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in.”  
President Bush knew these principles were timeless because he had lived his entire life by them.  A member of the Greatest Generation, he understood that “taking part and pitching in” were small but necessary prices to pay for the good fortune of living in the land of the free. 
The tributes for President Bush, who passed away on November 30 at the age of 94, have brought deserved attention to his extraordinary biography.  But they have also captured the 41st president’s abounding humility, kindness, and compassion.  He was “an empathetic man” who “valued character over pedigree,” as President George W. Bush noted during his father’s funeral.
I was on the receiving end of that kindness as student body president for the University of Mississippi in 1973, when I got the chance to make a presentation before the future president, then chairman of the Republican National Committee.  His gracious words of praise following my brief remarks were overly generous but they meant the world to this college senior.  I am thankful our paths crossed several times after that first encounter and that President Bush forged such close ties with our state through his longtime friendship with Mississippi Congressman Sonny Montgomery. 
By the time he was elected to Congress in 1966, President Bush had already earned awards for his bravery in World War II, risking his life as a naval aviator in no less than 58 combat missions.  He represented the 7th district of Texas for two terms before serving as ambassador to the United Nations, ambassador to China, and director of the Central Intelligence Agency.  Any of these roles would suffice as the capstone of a career, but they were merely the prologue for his rise to our nation’s highest offices, vice president and president of the United States.  
The world was at a critical juncture during President Bush’s time in the White House.  Under his watch, Americans witnessed the end of the Cold War, the reunification of Germany, and the liberation of Kuwait from the grip of Saddam Hussein.  The international order was changing, and so was America’s place in it.  President Bush rose to the occasion, just as he had as a young recruit during World War II, and shepherded the advancement of freedom with both strength and grace.  All the while, he never abandoned his commitment to the good work and service done by ordinary citizens, the “thousand points of light” needed to sustain democracy here at home.        
President Bush’s life was marked by distinction, but his legacy will be sustained by the larger-than-life devotion and love he showed to his family and friends.  He and Barbara were married longer than any other presidential couple.  He became the second U.S. president to watch his son take the oath of office, and he leaves behind for us the same purpose that he dedicated his life to fulfill: “to make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world.”

Bipartisan tribal equity bill heads to president's desk for signature
￼
It was great to meet with Chehalis Chairman Harry Pickernell Sr. in DC last week.
When the Chehalis Tribe first approached me about an antiquated law that prevented them from building a distillery on their land, it was clear that Congress needed to take action and repeal it in the name of fairness. I was pleased to partner with the Chehalis to craft, introduce and secure passage of this legislation in the U.S. House, and am grateful my colleagues in the Senate were equally successful in their efforts.   Now we’re sending a common-sense, bipartisan bill to the president’s desk that removes a hurdle for tribes in Southwest Washington and across the country that was impeding them from pursuing economic opportunities that bring with them new jobs and skills training.  You can read more on this issue here. 
Providing relief for landowners, farmers
It’s time for Congress to restore the more sensible definition of “navigable waters” and provide relief to farmers and landowners who have been hit hard by the costly “Waters of the U.S.” (WOTUS) rule. I recently introduced a bill to repeal this controversial regulation and clarify that the Clean Water Act remains in effect as it has been interpreted for more than four decades.   The current WOTUS rule expands the definition of “navigable waters” under the Clean Water Act to include water that is not “navigable” under any previous interpretation or common sense definition. Under this rule, private landowners must obtain costly Clean Water Act permits when improving their land, costing thousands of dollars and years of wait time.  The bill, titled Regulatory Certainty for Navigable Waters Act, would also require the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to act upon request within 60 days to determine whether water on a private property is a covered wetland under the Clean Water Act, relieving property owners from waiting lengthy periods of time for a costly review.   It is unthinkable that D.C. bureaucrats and courts would allow the federal government to regulate non-navigable water on private property this way – overturning four decades of effective Clean Water Act protection of our lands. My bill is necessary to defend Southwest Washington residents from this egregious government power grab. 
Helping relieve congestion by asking Coast Guard to review I-5 bridge lift protocol 
In an effort to help relieve congestion for Southwest Washington commuters, I’m requesting the U.S. Coast Guard revisit its protocol for I-5 drawbridge lifts during rush hour.   While some restrictions on when the lifts may occur already exist, peak rush hour has gotten longer and more commuters use the bridge each day. It's time for the Coast Guard to review the situation and determine whether extending these lift restrictions would provide relief to commuters.  You can read the letter I recently sent to U.S. Coast Guard Admiral David Throop.

HONORING PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH
￼
It was an honor to pay my respects and celebrate the legacy of a great man and president, George H.W. Bush, at the Capitol last week. He was a remarkable statesman, World War II veteran, devoted husband and father, and a man who dedicated his life to public service and leading with character.

HELPING SOUTHWEST WASHINGTON RESIDENTS
Mr. Arlin Brown of Vancouver was rated 80% disabled by the VA due to his exposure to Agent Orange. Since July 2016, he’s been trying to increase his disability to 100% due to his prostate cancer and Parkinson’s diagnoses; he reached out to our office for help because the dispute process was taking so long. 

We contacted the VA on Mr. Brown’s behalf to ensure the process was moving forward as swiftly as possible. Finally, the VA’s review was complete and Mr. Brown was bumped up to 90% disabled, which was supplemented with Individual Unemployability, giving Mr. Brown full benefits.

Are you having trouble with a federal agency?

If you or someone you know needs assistance with a federal agency, please contact my Vancouver office at 360-695-6292, or through my website jhb.house.gov. While we can't guarantee an outcome, we will try our best to assist in any way we can.

￼
Dear Friends,

Martha and I have joined the rest of the nation in mourning over the loss of a faithful servant, President George H.W. Bush. He was truly a great American. This week, we have spent time reflecting on his strength of character and his devotion to our country and his loved ones. 

￼
It was a privilege to attend the funeral honoring a president, patriot, and faithful friend – President George H.W. Bush. Delivering his father’s eulogy, President George W. Bush said, ""Through our tears, let us know the blessings of knowing and loving you, a great and noble man."" I will treasure my memories of President George H.W. Bush and his sense of humor, kindness, and thoughtfulness. Martha and I will dearly miss him and are truly blessed to have known and worked for him.

Remembering a Truly Great American
￼
The train engine in Air Force one colors was painted in North Little Rock at the Union Pacific facility, and it transported President George H.W. Bush home to his final resting place in College Station,Texas. I spoke with Harris Faulker on Fox News about how fitting that the last ride is with the Union Pacific 4141 train. Listen to my interview here. 

Toy Drive for Our Arkansas Children 
￼
Rodney's Cycle House has hosted the Toys for Tots Foundation's Toy Run in Little Rock for the past 34 years and this year was no exception. Thank you, Rodney (pictured above), for helping put gifts under children's Christmas trees year after year. Find out more about this generous organization here. 

Lighting the Menorah
￼
Happy Hanukkah to all Arkansans who celebrate the Festival of Lights! ‬I was grateful to be a part of the 28th year of lighting the menorah at Centennial Bank in Little Rock with Rabbi Yosef Kramer, Rabbi Pinchus Ciment, Governor Asa Hutchinson, and First Lady of Arkansas Susan Hutchinson.

Honoring our Heroes at Wreaths Across America
￼
I was humbled to decorate tombs at the Arkansas State Veterans Cemetery in North Little Rock with holiday wreaths for Wreaths Across America. I saluted the volunteers and honor the memories of the brave men and women who wore the uniform.

“A day that will live in infamy”
￼
On Friday, we reflected on “a day that will live in infamy” as President Franklin Roosevelt famously called the attack on Pearl Harbor. What began as another peaceful day in Hawaii became one of the worst days in American History.
Navy Water Tender 2nd Class Clarence Lockwood and Seaman First Class Henry Tipton, both of Arkansas, were assigned to the battleship USS Oklahoma. The USS Oklahoma was moored at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor, when the ship was attacked by Japanese aircraft, killing 429 crewmen, including Lockwood and Tipton.
Earlier this year, their remains were finally identified and accounted for after 77 years of analysis. Their lives have become a symbol for the determination and heroism of the American people and our warriors.
We are all reminded of the lives lost that day and the sacrifice of their entire generation to rid the world of one of the most evil alliances ever created.
Thank you for taking time to keep up with the work I'm doing on your behalf. If I can be of any assistance to you or your family, please reach out to my office at (501) 324-5941 or Hill.House.Gov. 

Sincerely,

“We know to his family he was a loving and caring father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. To his country, he was a devoted public servant who fought to defend our freedoms and led the nation at the end of the Cold War and at the fall of the Berlin Wall.”
“After graduating from college, he went to Midland, Texas, kind of an improbable place to go in those days, but he wanted to get involved in the oil business.”
“He later, after his successes in Midland, Texas in the Permian Basin, which continues to be one of the greatest reserves of oil and gas in the United States, he went on to Houston and grew his business and ultimately, as I said earlier, ran for Congress.”
“Even though Texas was an adopted home for him, Texans loved and embraced him, as we did the entire Bush family. We were privileged to have President Bush as one of our own.""
“He once said, ‘I’m a Texan and an American. What more could a man ask for?’ I don't think anyone could have said it better.”
“Throughout his time in public service and even afterwards, he could have moved anywhere in the world, but he chose to live his life in Texas, and in the warm embrace of the state and the people he loved.” 
“President Bush felt a kindred spirit at Texas A&M University, choosing it first to bear his legacy through his presidential library and a graduate school of government and public service, and then later to be his and Barbara Bush's final resting place.” 
“President Bush, I think, identified with the university's unique culture, including its inculcation of patriotic values and the emphasis it places on hard work and public service.”

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend, 

This week, we said goodbye to an American hero. President George H.W. Bush was honored at the United States Capitol where thousands came to pay their respects. Thank you to President Bush for all that you did for our great nation.

Please read about my week below: 

F-35s Coming To Tyndall
This week, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson announced Tyndall Air Force Base as the future home to three squadrons of F-35 fighter jets. These squadrons of F-35s are the future of the Air Force and will strengthen our national security, while reinforcing the role of our airmen at Tyndall Air Force Base. It’s clear the Air Force recognizes the importance of investing in Tyndall as a part of our defense strategy and we are working to get the base back to mission ready capability as soon as possible. Bringing these next generation warplanes to Tyndall is in line with our efforts to rebuild a modern and state-of-the-art Air Force base post-Hurricane Michael. I look forward to working with the defense community to bring these squadrons in for a landing in our community.

Working With VA Secretary Wilkie
￼ 
On Friday, I met with Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie regarding the future of implementation of the VA MISSION Act, including the Department’s commitment to working with the Senate and the House during this period. The Secretary also discussed the importance of ensuring our veterans are able to seek transplant care, an initiative I was able to get signed into law through the MISSION Act. 
Keeping Our Students Safe On Monday, I joined Congressman Paul Mitchell of California in introducing H.R. 7209, the School Resource Officer Act. Every day in schools across our country, school resource officers carry out the critical job of serving and protecting our children. Unfortunately, many school systems do not have the resources to employ a permanent resource officer. The School Resource Officer Act is an important component in changing this. By streamlining resources and working with local law enforcement, we can ensure that all of our schools have proper security and remain safe havens for our students. Click here to learn more.

Greetings,
This week, Americans paused to honor the life of former President George Herbert Walker Bush. His love for America and calm, steady leadership secured him a special place in the memory of every Texan. He was an extraordinary man, who will be remembered for living his life committed to principles and values larger than himself. Now, President Bush and his beloved Barbara are together at last with their daughter Robin, and enjoying a well-deserved rest from their labors. May God bless the memory of President George H.W. Bush, and the legacy of service that he and Barbara instilled in generation after generation of the Bush family.
I have long supported criminal justice reform, and believe in reducing mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenders, and providing greater opportunities for offenders to be rehabilitated. At the same time, I do not believe we should be granting early release to violent offenders. That is why I drafted an amendment that would exclude violent offenders from being released early. I'm happy to report that, after working closely with the White House and the sponsors of this bill, they have decided to accept my amendment. This new version of the bill resolves my concerns, and is one that I wholeheartedly support and cosponsor. With these necessary improvements, I believe the Senate should take up and pass this important legislation. I look forward to working hand-in-hand with the White House and the bill sponsors to make sure that happens. Read my full statement here.
On Wednesday, I joined my colleagues Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), and John Kennedy (R-La.) in introducing the WALL Act. This bill would fully fund the border wall along the southern border by closing existing loopholes that provide illegal immigrants with federal benefits and tax credits, without affecting the benefits and tax credits used by Americans. The overwhelming majority of Texans and Americans want to see the border secured, and I have long called for building a wall as a necessary step in defending our border and stopping the flow of illegal immigration into our country.
In the weeks after Hurricane Harvey made landfall, Congress passed the Cruz-Cornyn-Rubio bill, which provided crucial tax relief for hurricane survivors. An important part of this bill eliminated the tax penalty for hurricane survivors who wanted to withdraw from retirement accounts to pay for the costs of repairs from storm damages. Retirement account withdrawals must be made by December 31, 2018 – a deadline that is quickly approaching. I strongly urge my fellow Texans, if you are still in the process of rebuilding and recovering from the ravages of Harvey, to contact your tax advisor or for more information go to the IRS website at irs.gov. I am encouraged by the progress we have seen in the Texas communities that were affected by Hurricane Harvey, and will continue working each day to ensure Texas rebuilds stronger than before.

Remembering President George H.W. Bush:
 
As the nation mourns the loss of President George H.W. Bush, may we remember him for the man of character and integrity that he was. President Bush taught us all what it means to be an American first before any political party or ideology and to serve our fellow citizens. George H.W. Bush was kind and decent to all and yet faced questions about whether that meant he was not a tough enough president. In our polarized times, it seems we need more of his temperament, more of his decency, and more of his sense of humor. 
 
If his funeral sends a message, it is that Americans really can put aside our differences and come together for the good of the country. Thank you, Mr. President, for giving us such an excellent example of a life well lived.

From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:
Good Afternoon,
This week in Congress,a grateful nation paid its respect during President George H.W. Bush’s state ceremony in the United States Capitol Rotunda.
￼
Honoring the Life of President George H.W. Bush
Revered as one of America’s last great soldier-statesman, George H.W. Bush’s life was defined by his service to our nation. Thousands came to honor the late President at the United States Capitol. President Bush’s unrivaled character allowed him to guide our nation with integrity, vigor, and grace and he will be remembered not only for his numerous contributions to our society but also for the kindness he showed to others. Thank you for your service to our country. Rest In Peace, President Bush.
Advocating on Behalf of Our Dairy Farmers
For several years, dairy farmers have sustained low milk prices. Though there are many factors that have contributed to this struggle, recent trade challenges in critical markets have made the problem worse. That is why I co-signed a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture to increase USDA’s tariff mitigation program payments to better account for the significant damages dairy farmers have incurred. Dairy Farmers play a major role in Pennsylvania’s economy and I support developing a plan that reflects the struggles that these hard-working families have faced due to retaliatory tariffs.
Taking Action to Support Rural Farmers and Businesses
I joined a group of my colleagues in sending a letter to the Small Business Administration to voice my concern regarding the SBA proposed rule on the Express Loan Programs and Affiliation Standards. These rules would effectively limit rural American businesses from accessing needed capital to grow and expand. In the 115th Congress, I proudly supported H.R. 4743, the Small Business 7(a) Lending Oversight Reform Act to enhance oversight of SBA’s loan programs. I will continue to support legislation that puts the interests of our growers and local businesses first.
Keystone College Receives USDA Loan
I am pleased to hear that Keystone College qualified for, and received, a loan from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) that will undoubtedly improve the university’s ability to serve its students.
￼
USDA’s Community Facilities Direct Loan Program helps rural small towns, cities, and communities make critical infrastructure developments to support economic prosperity. As a major employer and economic anchor in rural Northeastern Pennsylvania, Keystone College has had a $150 million impact on the region’s economy in the past 10 years. Keystone will use this loan to restructure its debt, improve its financial position, and benefit the college’s 1,523 students. I look forward to watching Keystone College utilize this loan to continue their hard work in improving economic opportunity and jobs in PA-10.
Lackawanna Trail High School Battles for State Championship
For the first time in Lackawanna Trail High School’s history, the Lions took a trip to Hershey Park Stadium for the state “Single A” football championship. Taking on the Farrell Steelers on Thursday, the Lions entered the game with a 14-1 record. Both teams put on a show put it was the Steelers who ultimately took home the title with a final score of 55-20. Though their bid for the championship has come to an end, the Lions should be proud of their commitment to the sport and their tenacity on the field. Congratulations on a historic, and well earned, post-season!
End of Insurance Period Information for Producers with Excess Moisture in Fields
Due to the frequency of rain and resulting flooding in Pennsylvania this year, I have been contacted by producers in PA-10 concerned if they will be able to get into their fields prior to the end of the insurance period on December 10. USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA) has a fact sheet as a reference for those producers suffering the effects of excess moisture. Along with this guide, growers are encouraged to reach out to their crop insurance agent for additional information on claims made for crop losses.

News from Representative Bradley Byrne
  
￼
ABOUT BRADLEY | HOW CAN I HELP | CONTACT BRADLEY | WANT TO RECEIVE MY UPDATES?
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
Our nation came together last week as we mourned the loss of a truly great American. No matter our race, religion, creed, or political party, we were drawn toward the light that was President George H.W. Bush.  
His life spanned nearly one hundred years of American history and was dedicated to serving the United States.
I had the honor to pay my respects to President Bush in the Capitol Rotunda and attend the funeral service held at the National Cathedral last week. It was the most moving church service I have ever attended. The testimony shared by everyone there spoke to a life well lived and firmly grounded. 
￼ 
He loved life and loved the people he spent it with. As his son, President George W. Bush, said at the service, “The idea is to die young as late as possible. … As he aged, he taught us how to grow old with dignity, humor and kindness -- and, when the good Lord finally called, how to meet Him with courage and with joy in the promise of what lies ahead.”
President George H.W. Bush will be remembered as a true American leader: someone who served totally, cared deeply, laughed fully, and loved completely.   
Pearl Harbor Day 
￼ 
Friday marked the 77th anniversary of the Attack on Pearl Harbor. 
At 7:55 AM local time, the attack commenced. At its end, 19 ships were destroyed or damaged, hundreds of aircraft were lost, and over 2,300 American service members were killed. 
We remember their sacrifice, and the service of all our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who fought in WWII. For the freedoms we enjoy today, we thank you. 
Red Snapper Update 
We had some great news this week from NOAA regarding Red Snapper!  
Even though we are getting close to Christmas, it's never too early to think about the next Red Snapper season. NOAA Fisheries published a new rule to increase the annual catch limits and annual catch targets for the Red Snapper fishery in the Gulf of Mexico. 
This increase from NOAA shows exactly what those of us on the Gulf Coast have known for years: the health of the Red Snapper fishery is incredibly strong.  
Under the proposed rule, the total catch limit for recreational Red Snapper fishing in the Gulf of Mexico would increase from 6.7 million pounds to 7.4 million pounds, a 10.45% increase.
Last year, I worked with Senator Richard Shelby and other Gulf Coast congressmen to secure a full Red Snapper season for Alabama’s recreational fishermen. 
These latest numbers will further drive us to continue fighting for greater state control over the Red Snapper fishery and a full and adequate Red Snapper fishing season. 
Coast Guard Authorization Bill 
 ￼  
On Tuesday, President Trump signed the Coast Guard Authorization Bill into law, authorizing funding and setting policy for the Coast Guard.  
This is critical as they carry out their mission to keep our waterways and coasts safe.  
Special thanks to the men and women serving right here in our area in the U.S. Coast Guard Sector Mobile and at the Aviation Training Center. 
In Case You Missed It!

Photo of the Week  
￼ 
It was great to be at the Capitol Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony Thursday night on the West Lawn of the Capitol. Rebecca and Laura were able to join me for this festive tradition making it even better! 
What's Ahead  
This upcoming week in Washington could be the last legislative week of this year, this Congress, and this Republican majority.  
The big priority for the remainder of the year is to secure funding for the rest of the federal government. The deadline to pass a new funding bill is December 21st. Thankfully, we have passed funding for almost 75% of the federal government already, including critical funding for our military. 
The focus now is on ensuring our borders are protected, and that means including money in the funding bill for President Trump's border wall. That is a priority for me, so I will be working hard to see our border secured.

Dear Friend, 
This week I was very honored to attend a ceremony in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol Building honoring the life and legacy of our 41st President, George H.W. Bush. It was a beautiful ceremony, and the thousands of people who came to the Capitol to pay their respects is a testament to the great influence he had on our country.
During this very difficult time, our prayers remain with the entire Bush family as we mourn the loss of an American hero and statesman. His impact on our country as a WWII vet, Congressman, CIA Director, Vice President, and President cannot be understated. 
￼ 
The body of President George H.W. Bush lies in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol Building.  
  
THIRD ANNUAL MIDDLE GEORGIA CONGRESSIONAL BREAKFAST 
On Wednesday this past week, Senator Johnny Isakson and I were honored to host the 3rd Annual Middle Georgia Congressional Breakfast in Washington, D.C. The event brought together over 100 Middle Georgia civic leaders and Air Force Leadership to highlight the positive impact Robins Air Force Base and the greater Warner Robins community have in Georgia and to our military as a whole.
I’d also like to thank U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment Bob McMahon for taking the time to speak to the group. It was a great event all around, and I look forward to continuing to work with the Middle Georgia community to bring more jobs and economic development to the region.
￼ 
Thank you to everyone who could make the trip to D.C. for the Third Annual Middle Georgia Congressional Breakfast.

Friends, 
 
As a nation, we came together last week to say farewell to a beloved patriot and hero, President George H.W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States. Renee and I join our great country in mourning the passing of President Bush, and we continue to pray for peace and comfort for the Bush family. 
 
Last week, President Bush’s casket lain in state in the rotunda of the United States Capitol surrounded by the Honor Guard representing each branch of the U.S. military. Many gathered from around the country to celebrate his life, including his family, led by President George W. Bush – his son and our 43rd president – the Supreme Court Justices, the Joint Chiefs, members of the former President’s cabinet, three former Vice Presidents and his former political rival and good friend, Bob Dole. As your Congressman, I was honored to attend this important ceremony on your behalf. 
 
It was a moving experience – one that will stick with me for a lifetime.
 
Before starting a career in politics, President Bush served as the Navy’s youngest pilot during World War II. He earned the Distinguished Flying Cross, which would be enough legacy for any American. But that’s where his story merely began. He then served two terms as a U.S. Congressman from Texas, the Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in the People’s Republic of China, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). 
 
￼
 
From 1980 to 1988, he served as Vice President under the great President Ronald Reagan. And in 1988, Bush became the 41st President.
 
During his presidency, Bush navigated America through the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. President Bush served our country with an uncommon humility and made monumental contributions to freedom around the world.
 
When I was a student at Myers Park High School, I volunteered on his first presidential campaign. It was an incredible experience that helped guide me and fuel my interest in public service, and led to me running Students for President Bush at UNC Charlotte. In 1992, President Bush came through campus as part of his nationwide train tour for his presidential campaign. I’ll never forget it — we gathered a ton of supporters to cheer him on, and the crowd of students erupted when President Bush appeared from the back of the train to wave to all of us. 
 
I find myself in awe of President Bush’s commitment to a lifetime of selfless service and his devotion to his family. President Bush and his wife, Barbra, were married for 73 years. For decades after leaving public office, President Bush showed the country how to be a man of character while living life to its fullest.
 
As I reflect on his life of service, I am reminded how grateful I am to serve you. I’ll continue to strive to live up to President Bush’s example and belief that, “there could be no definition of a successful life that does not include service to others.” 
 
 
Until next week, 
￼
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)

Many gathered from around the country to celebrate his life, including his family, led by President George W. Bush – his son and our 43rd president – the Supreme Court Justices, the Joint Chiefs, members of the former President’s cabinet, three former Vice Presidents and his former political rival and good friend, Bob Dole. As your Congressman, I was honored to attend this important ceremony on your behalf. 
 
It was a moving experience – one that will stick with me for a lifetime.
 
Before starting a career in politics, President Bush served as the Navy’s youngest pilot during World War II. He earned the Distinguished Flying Cross, which would be enough legacy for any American. But that’s where his story merely began. He then served two terms as a U.S. Congressman from Texas, the Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in the People’s Republic of China, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). 
 
￼
 
From 1980 to 1988, he served as Vice President under the great President Ronald Reagan. And in 1988, Bush became the 41st President.
 
During his presidency, Bush navigated America through the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. President Bush served our country with an uncommon humility and made monumental contributions to freedom around the world.
 
When I was a student at Myers Park High School, I volunteered on his first presidential campaign. It was an incredible experience that helped guide me and fuel my interest in public service, and led to me running Students for President Bush at UNC Charlotte. In 1992, President Bush came through campus as part of his nationwide train tour for his presidential campaign. I’ll never forget it — we gathered a ton of supporters to cheer him on, and the crowd of students erupted when President Bush appeared from the back of the train to wave to all of us. 
 
I find myself in awe of President Bush’s commitment to a lifetime of selfless service and his devotion to his family. President Bush and his wife, Barbra, were married for 73 years. For decades after leaving public office, President Bush showed the country how to be a man of character while living life to its fullest.
 
As I reflect on his life of service, I am reminded how grateful I am to serve you. I’ll continue to strive to live up to President Bush’s example and belief that, “there could be no definition of a successful life that does not include service to others.” 
 
 
Until next week,

Honoring the Life and Legacy of an American Hero



This week I joined with the rest of the country in honoring the life and legacy of President George H.W. Bush. President Bush was a patriot who dedicated his life to serving our nation and I was humbled to have the opportunity to pay respects to this great leader, first in the Capitol Rotunda with my daughter Cecelia and later at the funeral service in the National Cathedral.

             ￼  

At Wednesday's service we heard the deeply moving words of his son President George W. Bush and others whose lives he had touched. Click here or on the image below to watch Wednesday's beautiful service.

Remembering Pearl Harbor


On December 7, 1941 our nation was attacked. We will never forget the American men and women who lost their lives at Pearl Harbor. It is also a time to remember the brave men and women have defended our nation throughout the years against those who threatened the freedoms and values we hold dear. Please join me in honoring all the brave American servicemen who perished on that fateful day.

The Tenth District Comes to DC



On Tuesday, I had the opportunity to get a sneak peak of the UNC Asheville Singers performance at Walter Reed Army Medical Center when they stopped by my DC office. Cecilia and I loved hearing you sing!!

￼

On Thursday, I was blessed to pray with Pastor Andrew Brunson, his family, and some of my colleagues in the House and Senate. Pastor Brunson, who is originally from Black Mountain, North Carolina, was wrongfully imprisoned by the Turkish government for over two years. He was finally able to return to his family this October and I am so thankful for his safe return. Click here to watch the speech I delivered on the House Floor calling for his release. To read the letter I sent with 154 of my House colleagues to President Erdogan of Turkey demanding his release please click here.

CNN 

Please join me in praying for the family and loved ones of the Marines involved in Wednesday's deadly midair collision off the coast of Japan. The brave men and women of the U.S. military put their lives on the line every day to help keep our nation secure and I am deeply saddened by this loss.                                              


Asheville man remembers time President George H.W. Bush visited his home

WLOS 

In 1992, Roy Harris invited President Bush to his home to come talk to his young daughters about the importance of education. A couple of months later that is exactly what the President did. This touching story is just one of the many ways President Bush will be remembered not only as a great leader but also as a kind and decent man.

Remembering President George H. W. Bush
 
 
It was a solemn week in D.C. as the entire nation mourned the loss of President George H.W. Bush. Thousands of people came to see President Bush lie in state and celebrate his extraordinary life. From serving in the Navy to serving in the Oval Office, he was a true patriot and selfless public servant. He loved his family and cared for his friends deeply. One quote from President Bush's inauguration, which his son read at his funeral, particularly struck me: “We cannot hope to only leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank account. We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend, a loving parent. A citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood, and town better than he found it."" RIP, 41.

Honoring President George H.W. Bush
￼
My heart is heavy over the passing of George H.W. Bush, an exemplary man and patriot whose service to his country ranks him among our most beloved Presidents. President Bush served at the highest levels of our government while setting an unmatched example as a loving husband and father. His legacy will continue to grow after his passing.

Rest in peace, Mr. President.

NASA Day on the Hill
￼
I had a great discussion with my friend, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine on Tuesday. He answered many questions I and my Space Subcommittee colleague Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson had about current NASA projects and initiatives. Afterward, I was able to introduce Administrator Bridenstine at NASA Day on the Hill. 
￼
While there, my colleague Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (pictured on right) and I had the treat of meeting NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei (pictured in middle) as well as speaking with other NASA employees about the exciting work being done to advance America’s leadership in space.

Recognizing Lamar Smith
I enjoyed attending the portrait unveiling of my great Texas friend and colleague, Science, Space and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith of San Antonio. 
￼
The painting will appropriately hang in the committee hearing room where so much has been accomplished for our nation’s space program. I was proud to serve as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Space over the last four years under his leadership.
Meeting over Hurricane Funds
I met with officials from FEMA, HUD, SBA, and OMB on Thursday over concerns about Duplication of Benefits and Low to Moderate Income (LMI) requirements for access to Hurricane recovery funds. It is critical that those affected by Hurricane Harvey are able to get the assistance and funding necessary to put their lives back together.
￼
 Trip to Mexico City
 I was honored to accompany a Congressional delegation to Mexico City for the inauguration of Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. We met many government officials as well as Mexican business and industry representatives to discuss border security and trade. Texas is the largest trading partner with Mexico of any state, and I am looking forward to working with President Lopez Obrador to advance trade policies which benefit the U.S. and Texas.
￼
Remembering Pearl Harbor
On the morning of December 7, 1941, the skies over Pearl Harbor turned black with smoke as American soldiers fought hundreds of Japanese aircraft as they dropped their bombs on our Pacific Fleet. 
￼
As President Roosevelt stated, “a sleeping giant” was awakened that day, and America soon proved to the world that our commitment to freedom could not be sunk with our battleships. This week, we remember all who were lost 77 years ago and the incredible courage displayed by our brave service members that fateful day and the years that followed.

A Date Which Will Live in Infamy
 

""Yesterday, December 7, 1941—a date which will live in infamy—the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan."" - President Franklin D. Roosevelt

On Friday, we reflected on the sacrifices of the 2,403 military men and women who lost their lives during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor 77 years ago. A turning point in America's history, pushing America to declare ourselves part of the second world war. 

It is in these times that America has been wounded, where from the shadows,  we emerge in pride and dignity for our country. We owe a great deal of gratitude to those who lost their lives, were injured in the attack, and those who then answered the call to defend our nation against foreign attacks. 

This day serves as a reminder for us to be grateful for our freedoms that so many have defended before us. We live in the greatest country on God's earth and should not take our liberties for granted. We remember these heroic individuals who were part of the Greatest Generation.

#Remembering41
This week, Americans watched as we honored the life and legacy of President George H.W. Bush, a devoted family man, veteran, and 41st President of the United States. He was one of only 35 individuals to lie in state in the United States Capitol building, and is now in his final resting place in Texas.  
Thank you President George H.W. Bush, for your lifetime of dedicated service to our beloved homeland. Please join me in continuing to pray for the entire Bush family during their time of mourning.
￼

As always, I'd like to remind you to connect with me on social media so you can receive frequent updates on the work I am doing in Congress through Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

The Last President from the Greatest Generation

￼

Dear Friend:

This week was dominated by the passing of President George H.W. Bush – the last President to have served in WWII. I believe our nation lost an extraordinary leader and I have spent some time reflecting on what his life has meant both to our nation and to me personally. My most significant memories of the late 41st President were from Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm (1990-1991) where I served as an officer with the Marines in a light armored infantry battalion.

President Bush understood the cost of war from his own experiences in WWII and demonstrated his skills as a commander-in-chief by recognizing the value of building up enough combat power to overwhelm the Iraqi army – then the 4th largest army in the world – to quickly break their will to fight, decisively defeat them, and ultimately liberate Kuwait.

He also understood the art of diplomacy as few do, given his background as the former Ambassador to the Peoples Republic of China and to the United Nations. He skillfully put together a coalition of 34 nations and united them under a singular principle: “this aggression will not stand.”

President Bush was also a man of great character. I think the best example of this is a heartfelt letter he wrote following the loss of his daughter, Robin, to leukemia when she was just three years old. The letter concludes with:

""But she is still with us. We need her and yet we have her. We can't touch her and yet we can feel her. We hope she'll stay in our house for a long, long time.”

See the full text of his letter here.

We will all miss him. 

Next week will be a busy one in Washington, D.C. with critical votes on everything from the reauthorization of the Farm Bill to a Homeland Security Appropriations Bill.

Finally, I invite you to stay in contact with me via my website, Facebook or Twitter. See you around the district!
 
Sincerely, 
￼

ABOUT DAVE | ISSUES | TOURS & FLAGS | STUDENT CENTER | SERVICES | CONTACT
Friends,
On November 30, 2018, we lost an American hero. President George Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st President of the United States and father of the 43rd President of the United States, dedicated his life to serving our great nation. A trained diplomat and naval aviator, President George H.W. Bush navigated our country through some of the most tumultuous times in our history. 
Hailing from New England, young 41 enlisted into the U.S. Navy upon graduation from high school in 1942. As a lieutenant in the Japanese Bonin Islands, President Bush's aircraft was hit by flak during an attack and crashed. After floating for hours on a raft, President Bush was rescued by the submarine USS Fishback. Over the last week, we have learned that this experience profoundly shaped President Bush's outlook on life, leading him to question why God had spared him and not others. 
While still in the Navy, President Bush married Barbara Pierce in 1945. Together they had six children, President George W. Bush, Robin, Governor Jeb Bush, Neil, Marvin, and Doro. After earning his bachelor's degree from Yale University in 1948, President Bush moved his family to Odessa, Texas as he ventured into the oil business. In 1966, President George H.W. Bush was a self-made millionaire and won an election to the U.S. House of Representatives. 
President George H.W. Bush was a successful businessman, a Member of Congress, an Ambassador, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, United States Envoy to China, Director of Central Intelligence and Vice President under President Ronald Reagan. Even before being elected President, Bush had been on the forefront of history making enormous strides in opening the doors for diplomatic relations with China and tackling matters of national security. During his tenure as Vice President, Bush assisted President Reagan to successfully navigate the waters of a politically divided Congress. 
President Bush assumed office on January 20, 1989, to become the 41st President of the United States. During his time as President, President Bush led the United States to the end of the Cold War, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union. He never once boasted about these tremendous diplomatic feats. President Bush was the same man that he was on Saturday night that he was at church on Sunday morning, and I will always admire him for that. 
The life and legacy of President Bush will be defined by his goodwill and friendship. In his late years, some of his best friends were once his harshest political rivals. From President Bill Clinton to Senator Bob Dole, President Bush put personal qualms and politics aside to form firm friendships, which is an inspiration for us all. 
President George H.W. Bush was a family man, war hero and a statesman. I was humbled to attend the funeral honoring the life and legacy of President Bush. To quote President George W. Bush's eulogy, ""When the history books are written, they will say that George H.W. Bush was a great President of the United States -- a diplomat of unmatched skill, a commander in chief of formidable accomplishment, and a gentleman who executed the duties of his office with dignity and honor.""
Thank you, President George H.W. Bush, for showing Americans what it means to serve with love and lead with courage. You will be dearly missed, but your legacy is eternal. 
Dave

December 9, 2018
Dear Friend,  
The celebration of President George H.W. Bush’s life and lasting contributions to our nation took center stage last week, causing a shift in the Congressional calendar.  I was honored to be able to attend the funeral, and pay my respects to his family.  It was a very moving tribute to a man who will be remembered for his service, patriotism and love of family.  
As a result of the calendar changes, we passed a temporary extension of the budget and other important programs such as the Violence Against Women Act and the National Flood Insurance Program.  This provides a few more weeks to reach consensus on these matters.  Please be assured that I will continue to work in a cooperative manner to ensure effective governance and responsible spending while prioritizing those items which are most vital to our community.
Please continue reading for highlights of my work on your behalf last week!  
Fighting for our Nation’s Heroes 
Last week, I had the distinct pleasure of speaking to the VA’s COVER Commission, which hosted an important meeting at James A. Haley Hospital this week. The Commission was created by a bill I authored, the COVER Act, for the express purpose of evaluating alternative and complementary evidenced-based therapies to be provided to Veterans by the VA. It was born out of my belief that one size does not fit all, especially when it comes to an issue as sensitive as addressing the mental health needs of our nation’s heroes. I was encouraged by the dialogue and look forward to reviewing the Commission’s findings.
￼ 
Additionally, on Friday we honored the memory of those brave men and women who lost their lives during the attack on Pearl Harbor. We must never forget their service and sacrifice – truly the Greatest Generation!
￼ 
Facilitating Economic Success 
I have been a vocal skeptic of the tariffs imposed on various countries because of my concerns that they would ultimately hurt consumers.  However, I believe in giving credit where credit is due.  It is hard to argue with results, and the most recent concession by China to drop its 40% tariff on the import of American-made automobiles is a huge win. I remain confident that a final US-China trade deal can be reached, optimistic about the next 90 days, and look forward to an agreement that ensures an enforceable level playing field for American innovators and businesses.  
Additionally, recent reports  indicate that home values throughout the Tampa Bay area are expected to rise slightly higher than the national average next year, signifying the health of our local economy.  While this is great news for homeowners, it does highlight the need for us to continue efforts to ensure affordable housing for vulnerable populations.  Additionally, it is critical that we reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)- failure to do so would be catastrophic to our housing market.  
Ensuring Access to Quality Healthcare 
This local news report certainly contains disturbing news about the increase in uninsured children in Florida.  What the article doesn’t mention is that the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is fully funded and received the longest extension in history, being fully funded until fiscal year 2027.  The legislation which made this possible included a provision of mine that protected and assisted Florida CHIP’s full-pay plan.  In Florida, all children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP coverage, with subsidized and unsubsidized CHIP plans based on family income, with some plans as low as $15 a month.  I will continue to work with state leaders to ensure that families are aware of these options.
￼ 
Last week I was also pleased to begin reviewing the recently released report by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar suggesting ways we can build upon recent efforts to lower the costs of delivering high quality healthcare to Americans. This is a critical issue, and I look forward to exploring his ideas in greater detail.   
Additionally, the information presented in the Tampa Bay Times’ report related to the spike in death rates over the last three years at the John Hopkins All Children’s Hospital Heart Institute is extremely concerning.  As the sponsor of the Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act of 2017, I have had the opportunity to speak with countless families who are coping with congenital heart defect.  Their stories are truly heartbreaking.  We want to ensure continued investment in critical research that offers hope to these patients and families.  However, we must also ensure that best practices are utilized when treating these high risk patients.  I will certainly be working closely with appropriate officials to examine the causes of this disturbing trend and identify potential solutions. 
Protecting our National Interests and Global Security 
The House recently passed H.R. 4591, the Preventing Iranian Destabilization of Iraq Act, introduced by Rep. Adam Kinzinger. This bill will make sanctions imposed on foreign entities that threaten peace, stability, economic reconstruction, humanitarian assistance, political reform, or democracy in Iraq, official. It also allows visa denial and entry into the United States for those committing these awful acts against Iraq. Furthermore, the bill requires the President to research and report to Congress whether certain entities and individuals meet criteria to be labeled as foreign terrorist organizations, or face sanctions. Under the bill, The Department of State must establish and maintain a list of armed groups that receive support and influence from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps.
Constituent Corner 
As a new feature of this newsletter, each week I am going to highlight a local story of how my team and I advocate for the needs of our constituents.   A constituent in Tarpon Springs did not realize he needed to obtain a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prior to constructing a dock on his property.  Initially, the constituent was told that the dock would have to be disassembled until a permit could be granted.  The constituent contacted my office several weeks ago and asked for help.  A member of my team reached out to the Corps and requested a meeting at the property to discuss potential solutions.  My staff member attended the meeting last week, and a permit has now been issued.    This is just one example of the work we do each and every day.  Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you. 
Highlights from Around the District 
I have a great team, both locally and in Washington, D.C.  When I am in Washington, members of my team are working each and every day to provide excellent constituent service and to be my eyes and ears on the ground as they attend community events.  Here are just a few highlights of their efforts this week.
Bob, a member of my district staff, attended a Pearl Harbor Remembrance Celebration 
￼ 
Dan, also a member of my district team, attended the Grand Opening of Springhill Suites in Wesley Chapel.  Its great to see how much our community is growing!
￼ 

Rob, my Outreach Director and Veterans Liaison, participated in the ribbon cutting ceremony for the National Church Residences in New Port Richey.  It is vital that we continue to support investment in affordable housing for vulnerable populations.
￼ 
Rob also attended the kick off for the Healthy HOP program in Tarpon Springs.  This innovative initiative will provide free transportation for seniors who need help getting to and from their medical appointments. Click here to learn more.   
Summer, my Deputy Chief of Staff, participated in the YMCA's annual prayer breakfast at Spartan Manor.  It is great to see so many people in our community coming out to support such a good program.

Thank you for reading this week’s update. Feel free to share this e-newsletter with friends and encourage them to sign up! 
Additionally, I hope everyone observing Hanukkah is enjoying a happy and safe celebration.  Remember, you can always stay in touch with me via email, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.   Sincerely, ￼  Gus Bilirakis

Celebrating the Life and Legacy of President George H.W. Bush
President George H.W. Bush was a great American patriot, dedicated public servant, tireless humanitarian, and caring family man. I was humbled to attend his funeral and celebrate the life and legacy of our 41st president.
Kris and I join the nation in mourning President Bush's passing and send our condolences to the entire Bush family. You can watch President George W. Bush's moving eulogy of his father here.

Remembering Army Sergeant Jason McClary
On December 2nd, Army Sergeant Jason McClary of Westmoreland County succumbed to injuries he sustained a week earlier when his vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device in Ghazni Province, Afghanistan.
Sergeant McClary was a patriot who gave his life serving our country. His death serves as a sobering reminder of the sacrifice members of our armed services and their families make every day to keep us safe here at home.  
Kris and I extend our heartfelt condolences to Jason's wife, sons, and all those who loved him.

Stopping Deadly Fentanyl Imports
Far too many Americans are dying from heroin that is laced with Chinese fentanyl. This week, the Trump administration secured an initial commitment from Chinese President Xi Jinping to crack down on the production of fentanyl and all fentanyl-like drugs. I applaud the president for this important, potentially life-saving development.
In recent years, the emergence of fentanyl has significantly contributed to the lethality of the opioid epidemic. Just two milligrams of fentanyl is enough to kill the average adult, and estimates have shown two-thirds of opioid overdose deaths in Pennsylvania involve fentanyl.
While this week's news is a good step forward, we have to do more to stem the tide of the opioid and heroin epidemic. Congress should strengthen the administration's hand in its negotiations with China by passing my bipartisan Blocking Deadly Fentanyl Imports Act, which punishes countries that fail to implement and enforce internal controls on fentanyl production.
￼
￼
Speaking with the Journal Editorial Report
Last week, I joined the Wall Street Journal's Paul Gigot on the Journal Editorial Report to discuss various issues of the day. Specifically, we talked about the renegotiated NAFTA, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). I do not support this agreement in its current form, but am eager to work with the administration to move us towards freer trade. We also discussed the need for a debate regarding U.S. military involvement in Yemen, and our relationship with Saudi Arabia following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. You can watch our full conversation here.

Supporting Infrastructure Across Pennsylvania 
I am pleased to announce that two major federal grants have been awarded for infrastructure projects in both Southeast, and Southwestern Pennsylvania.
The first grant, totaling $15 million, will be used to expand the capacity of Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. Specifically, it will finance improvements that make travel in the city easier for millions of commuters and visitors, and help to accommodate increased traffic from the Schuylkill Yards project.
The second grant, totaling $20 million, was awarded to Butler County to improve Route 228. This 26-mile economic thread is the County's primary link between southern Butler County, and Shell Chemical's $6 billion ethane cracker plant in Beaver County. Currently, there are several transportation challenges along the route, such as inadequate capacity, an excessive number of accidents, and lack of access to key employment centers, schools, and residential neighborhoods.
The awarded grant funds will realign and widen the Balls Bend and Haines School-Commonwealth sections of Route 228 to four lanes, including adding turn lanes, medians, connecting access roads, and pedestrian/bicycle facilities.

Dear Lindsey,
Remembering George H.W. Bush
￼ 
This week our country mourned the loss of President George H.W. Bush. He was an amazing person who had a lifetime of public service. President Bush was a loving husband, father, grandfather, and friend. He served with distinction as a pilot in the U.S. Navy during WWII and went on to succeed at the highest levels of business and government before serving as our 41st President of the United States. Prior to that, he served as Vice President under President Ronald Reagan, Director of the CIA, and as a Congressman from Texas. He led a full life, and we will be forever grateful for his service to our country. 
￼ 
I often think back on this photo that sits in my office and the strong example President Bush set for me. A man of high character, 41 spent his life committed to serving our country with decency and humility. May we never forget his selfless service to our nation.

Strategic investment in our rural communities is essential to supporting existing infrastructure and ensures residents in these communities have the up to date resources. The money awarded today will provide critical assistance to a project that will allow La Harpe to build a new water treatment plant, enabling them to provide higher quality drinking water to over 1,200 residents. I am grateful to Secretary Perdue, State Director for USDA Rural Development Doug Wilson, and the USDA for their commitment to supporting rural development projects in central and west-central Illinois. I have no doubt this investment will leave a meaningful impact on the La Harpe community.

USMCA Signing
￼ 
Farmers, manufacturers, and workers in Illinois’ 18th District rely on open export markets with Mexico and Canada to move their product and remain competitive across the globe. The signing of the USMCA last week is a positive step towards an improved trilateral trade agreement with our neighbors and is welcomed news for the agricultural and manufacturing industries in Illinois who have been hurt by the recent trade uncertainty caused by tariffs. As I have stated in the past, an updated NAFTA must include Mexico and Canada, and I applaud the Trump Administration for bringing them together on this agreement. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee to ensure that the USMCA serves in the best interest of the farmers and workers across central and west-central Illinois.

I was granted the opportunity to join the House Foreign Affairs Committee to question Ambassador Jeffery, the U.S. Department of State's new Special Representative for Syria Engagement.

REMEMBERING 41

This week, a grateful nation honored and remembered our 41st president, President George H.W. Bush. 

President Bush lived a life dedicated to our great nation. Looking back on his life, it's truly remarkable to see how many ways he served our nation. He was a pilot in the Navy and he flew combat missions in World War II. He went on to represent his home in Congress then served as Ambassador to the United Nations, Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in China and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Finally, he served as Vice President then President of the United States. 

￼

It's easy to see that he will leave a legacy of leadership and service that will inspire Americans forever. However, even more honorable than his service to our nation was his dedication and love for his family and beloved wife Barbara. 

I believe his son, President George W. Bush, said it best when he said, ""Dad taught us that public service is noble and necessary; that one can serve with integrity and hold true to the important values, like faith and family. He strongly believed that it was important to give back to the community and country in which one lived. He recognized that serving others enriched the giver's soul. To us, his was the brightest of a thousand points of light.""

Votes in the House were canceled this week as Americans from across the nation paid their respects to the president in the United States Capitol. In the Capitol, President Bush's casket laid upon the catafalque constructed in 1865 for President Abraham Lincoln as he laid in state.

Congressman Smith's E-news: December 8, 2018 
￼  This photo was taken on Monday, December 3 as former President George H. W. Bush's casket arrived at the U.S. Capitol to lie in state. 
 Remembering President George H. W. Bush  
This week, we said goodbye to former President George H.W. Bush after his death at age 94 at his home in Houston. At the time of his wife’s death in April of this year, he and former First Lady Barbara Bush had been married for 73 years, which is the longest presidential marriage in history. President Bush will be remembered for many things, chief among them his governing during the collapse of the Soviet Union and his leadership during the Gulf War.  I appreciate President Bush for his leadership in negotiating and signing NAFTA. Despite being ratified by Congress during the Clinton administration, NAFTA had already been signed when President Clinton took office. In fact, President Bush was one of the earliest and most vocal proponents of free trade to lead the United States.   He believed countries with strong trade ties were less likely to go to war and that economic development was shared by all parties when barriers to trade were lifted. Nearly half of all agricultural products exported from Nebraska, worth around $3 billion annually, are consumed by Canada and Mexico under NAFTA. Its replacement, the USMCA, was signed by the United States, Canada, and Mexico on the same day President Bush passed.  President Bush’s entire life was characterized by humility and selfless service to his country. He served as a Navy pilot in the Pacific Theater of World War II during which he flew 58 combat missions. On one sortie, he was forced to bail out of his badly damaged aircraft. He was rescued several hours later, but the other two members of his crew did not survive. In 1967, President Bush was elected to Congress where he served until President Nixon appointed him Ambassador to the United Nations. He also served as Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office to China and Director of Central Intelligence, both under President Ford.   President Bush served as vice president under President Reagan for eight years before being elected president himself in 1988. Throughout his presidency, the United States faced a number of challenges to which President Bush rose with the honor, even-temperament, and respect we should all seek to emulate in our day-to-day lives.   I was honored to pay my respects as former President George H. W. Bush’s body laid in state at the U.S. Capitol and to attend his funeral service at the National Cathedral. Eulogies delivered by his son, former President George W. Bush, and others highlighted a number of lessons we should remember as a nation moving forward. My wife and I will continue to keep the Bush family in our prayers as they celebrate the life of a great man who served his country with distinction. 
Sincerely,
￼

12/8/18 13:52,American Hero," 
￼ 








Here are a few things from this week: 
  
1. American Hero 
  
￼ 
  
President George H.W. Bush was a skilled leader who showed tireless dedication to our nation during some of our most trying times. George and Barbara's sacrifice, service, and love for our country was unmatched. Bonnie and I were honored to join the Bush family to pay our respects to 41.

2. Bringing Together HBCUs & Business Leaders 
  
 ￼ 
  
As a member of the HBCU Caucus, one of my top priorities is increasing engagement between the business community and our education centers. This week, we had an open and candid conversation between Morehouse University and Georgia business leaders, and it was great to hear everyone's insight and ideas.

3. Relief For Georgia Farmers 
  
￼ 
  
Georgia's agriculture industry was devastated by Hurricane Michael. Senator Isakson and I are doing all we can to help our farmers get back on their feet. If you were impacted by Hurricane Michael, remember to register with FEMA before the December 13th deadline.

Dear Friend,  This week the United States laid to rest a president who served the country he loved in more capacities than could ever be expected of one man. We commemorated and celebrated the life of a war hero, Congressman, Ambassador, CIA Director, Vice President, and President of the United States. This week we said goodbye to President George H.W. Bush...KEEP READING HERE


WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH

￼ 
Yesterday was the 77th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. To honor the occasion, WWII Air Force veteran Lloyd Fitzwater, one of three remaining WWII veterans in Potosi, presented a memorial wreath to honor all those we lost on the day that will forever life in infamy. 

￼￼
Honored to speak at the Missouri Farm Bureau's annual meeting and receive the Friend of the Farm Bureau award. The theme was 'gratitude' and I'm especially grateful to represent the hard working men and women who feed and clothe the world. 
￼ At the Farm Bureau's annual meeting, Wyatt Wilson was named the first ever ambassador from Douglas County! Wyatt is a 2018 graduate of Gainesville high school and now a freshman at Missouri State University. Congratulations Wyatt, we are all very proud of you!

Congratulations to the Hayti Indians football team, the new Class 1 State Champions! This week they capped off a perfect season and shutout Lincoln 44-0 to capture the first state championship in the program's history. (📸by David Jenkins, Standard Democrat) 
￼  Great to see the John J. Pershing VA Medical Center break ground on the new urgent care facility. It will add nearly 10,000 square feet and increase access for veteran patients with multiple new exam rooms. 


THIS WEEK IN DC
￼

I was honored to attend the beautiful memorial services for President George H.W. Bush in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda and at the National Cathedral. They were beautiful ceremonies honoring a dedicated public servant and a life well lived.

￼ 
I was thrilled to join President Trump in the Oval Office as he signed the Coast Guard Authorization Act. It supports our men and women of the Coast Guard and allows the historic Delta Queen to resume operation.

￼

When Mike Janchyshyn contacted my office saying his family would be in D.C. for his retirement ceremony from the Army, we knew we had to make it special for them. I was thrilled to be able to help the Janchyshyn family into the White House. What better way to celebrate 20 years of dedicated service in the Army than by being able to see where our Commander in Chief lives?

Congress needs to hear from you. What are YOUR priorities for 2019?

Dear Friends,  Given the ongoing political turmoil that has gripped our country, it's more important than ever that we remain engaged and knowledgeable of current events.

When we empower ourselves to seek out the truth with verified, factual reporting, we are better equipped to make crucial decisions and create positive change.     
Happy reading and all the best,   ￼

Manafort, Cohen, and Individual 1 Are in Grave Danger
Robert Mueller is closing in on the president and all his men.
By Ken White, attorney and former federal prosecutor, The Atlantic
￼
Federal prosecutors filed three briefs late on Friday portending grave danger for three men: the former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort, the former Trump fixer Michael Cohen, and President Donald Trump. In an age when Americans usually get mere squibs of breaking news from Twitter, Facebook, and red-faced cable shouters, many started their weekend poring over complex legal filings and peering suspiciously at blacked-out paragraphs. The documents were stunning, even for 2018. 
In brief No. 1, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office argues that Paul Manafort breached his cooperation agreement with the government by lying to the FBI and the Special Counsel’s Office in the course of 12 meetings. The brief oozes a level of confidence notable even among professionally hubristic prosecutors: Mueller says he’s ready to present witnesses and documents, and that he gave Manafort’s lawyers an opportunity to refute the evidence but they could not. Mueller is sure he has the receipts.

The inside story of death and survival as the Carr Fire's tornado of flames stormed Redding — and changed firefighting in a warming California
By Lizzie Johnson, The San Francisco Chronicle
Death blew east on a savage wind, driving flames over foothills and across a river, spitting glowing embers and scrubbing the earth bare. 
It was coming for Don Andrews. 
His bulldozer’s windows shattered, flinging glass into his face. The blue-green shards were everywhere: on the floor, inside his helmet, in his skin and eyes. He was alone and blinded. The firestorm shook the ground and roared as loud as a passing train. 
I’m not going to survive this, he thought.

Louisiana School Made Headlines for Sending Black Kids to Elite Colleges. Here’s the Reality.
T.M. Landry, a school in small-town Louisiana, has garnered national attention for vaulting its underprivileged black students to elite colleges. But the school cut corners and doctored college applications.
By Erica L. Green and Katie Benner, The New York Times
BREAUX BRIDGE, La. — Bryson Sassau’s application would inspire any college admissions officer. 
A founder of T.M. Landry College Preparatory School described him as a “bright, energetic, compassionate and genuinely well-rounded” student whose alcoholic father had beaten him and his mother and had denied them money for food and shelter. His transcript “speaks for itself,” the founder, Tracey Landry, wrote, but Mr. Sassau should also be lauded for founding a community service program, the Dry House, to help the children of abusive and alcoholic parents. He took four years of honors English, the application said, was a baseball M.V.P. and earned high honors in the “Mathematics Olympiad.”  The narrative earned Mr. Sassau acceptance to St. John’s University in New York. There was one problem: None of it was true. 
“I was just a small piece in a whole fathom of lies,” Mr. Sassau said.

It Happened One Night . . . at MGM
When Patricia Douglas was raped by an MGM salesman at a 1937 studio party, the 20-year-old dancer filed charges, taking on Hollywood's most powerful institution. Today, as Douglas breaks a 65-year silence, the author exposes the perjury, bribes, and smear tactics used to destroy her.
By David Stenn, Vanity Fair
""What,” asked Jacqueline Onassis, “are we going to do next?” It was September 1993. She had just edited Bombshell: The Life and Death of Jean Harlow, in which I solved the long-standing mystery of how Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s beloved Blonde Bombshell died suddenly and inexplicably at 26. (Unbeknownst even to herself, Harlow had been suffering from kidney failure since she was 15.) Now, over lunch at the Peninsula hotel in Manhattan, I told Jackie of an intriguing topic I’d stumbled onto in my Harlow research. A month before the star’s death, in 1937, a dancer named Patricia Douglas had been raped at a wild MGM party thrown by Louis B. Mayer. Instead of bartering her silence for a studio contract or cash, Douglas went public with her story and filed a landmark lawsuit. One person I interviewed told me, “They had her killed.” 
I didn’t believe that, I told Jackie, because, though MGM was then the world’s most powerful movie studio, with its own railroad and in-house police force, it would never have gone to such an extreme. Jackie smiled and said, “Well, why don’t you find out what did happen? You’re the only person who can, David.”  To read the complete Vanity Fair article, please click here.

Dear Lindsey, 
On Monday, I announced that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has issued a proposed rule that lowers prescription drug costs and increases transparency surrounding Medicare Parts C and D. 
In May 2018, I joined Congressman Doug Collins (GA-09) to introduce the bipartisan H.R. 5958, the PHAIR Pricing Act of 2018, to lower drug costs to Medicare recipients at the point of sale. The new rule includes language from this bill. 
￼ 
Medicare recipients deserve transparency when utilizing their life-savings. Prescription drug prices should not be decided behind closed curtains and the final cost should not be almost equal to 50 percent above the negotiated price. The road to fixing America’s prescription drug market may be long, but I commend the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for taking this important step. 
It is my mission in Congress to make affordable, accessible healthcare and prescription drugs readily available to Central and South Texans. 
As always, please let me know if there is anything I can do to better serve you. To contact any of my offices in South Texas or in Washington, D.C. click the ""contact me"" icon above.   
Please click “sign up for my newsletter” to register for updates to learn more about how I am serving the 15th District of Texas. I look forward to seeing you soon in Washington or back in Texas.

Weekly Update: A Legacy of Honor By Congressman Rob Wittman December 8, 2018  Hail to the Chief we have chosen for the nation, Hail to the Chief! We salute him, one and all. Hail to the Chief, as we pledge cooperation In proud fulfillment of a great, noble call.  This week, the nation mourned the loss of our 41st president, George Herbert Walker Bush. A man who indeed fulfilled his great, noble call to serve with integrity, courage, and honor.  President Bush’s list of achievements was impressive to say the least: Navy pilot, congressman, Ambassador to the UN, Republican National Committee Chairman, Head of U.S. Liaison Office in China, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Vice President, and finally President of the United States. He was America’s Commander-in-Chief to serve in the military during combat.  Mr. Bush, a top negotiator on the international stage, approached the changing world with a view that was pragmatic rather than ideological. Under his leadership, the Berlin Wall, a symbol of communist oppression, fell. In Latin America, Mr. Bush restored free elections in Nicaragua, ultimately leading to the Sandinista government being voted out of power. In the Middle East, the United States successfully kept Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, protecting global stability.     However, as I stood in the Capitol Rotunda surrounded by family and friends of the Bush’s, Vice President Pence, and my colleagues, I remembered something else the president brought to American politics: civility. Although our president almost three decades ago, Mr. Bush’s voice of bipartisanship and humility remained strong and his dedication to our country unwavering. He once said, “When the really tough choices come, it's the country, not me. It's not about Democrats or Republicans, it's for our country that I fought for.” 
￼

In my life, I have tried to replicate this behavior. The only way to get real change is to put your pride aside and work on the issues that matter – regardless of party lines. Here in Congress, I always try to work across the aisle to get the things done that are important to my constituents. Mr. Bush’s voice of civility and diplomacy will be missed.

Winston Churchill once said, “We make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we give.” President George Herbert Walker Bush contributed so much to our great nation, dedicating his life to public service. As we remember our 41st President of the United States, we remember a patriot, a man of virtue, a class act.

Rest in peace, Mr. President. Your legacy lives on and will continue to inspire future leaders.

Congressional Report

Dear Friends, 
This week, I attended the Inauguration Ceremony of new Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in Mexico City. I also provided district media and members of the community with updates on current topics including trade, border security and appropriations impacting the district. 
In the district, my staff attended several events, including the Fifth Annual Lamar Bruni Vergara Trust IMPACT Economic Development Forum and presented several Congressional Certificates of Recognition to different outstanding constituents throughout the district. 

I have also included a video from fema.gov that talks about steps you can follow to ensure you are taking the necessary fire-prevention precautions this holiday season. 

This week, we remember President George H.W. Bush and the incredible legacy that he leaves behind. His unyielding leadership, commitment and servitude to his family and to our country will be matched by none. My heartfelt condolences go to the Bush family during this difficult time. 

As always, please contact one of my offices if you need assistance with any federal agency.

Congressional Report

Dear Friends, 
This week, I attended the Inauguration Ceremony of new Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in Mexico City. I also provided district media and members of the community with updates on current topics including trade, border security and appropriations impacting the district. 
In the district, my staff attended several events, including the Fifth Annual Lamar Bruni Vergara Trust IMPACT Economic Development Forum and presented several Congressional Certificates of Recognition to different outstanding constituents throughout the district. 

I have also included a video from fema.gov that talks about steps you can follow to ensure you are taking the necessary fire-prevention precautions this holiday season. 

This week, we remember President George H.W. Bush and the incredible legacy that he leaves behind. His unyielding leadership, commitment and servitude to his family and to our country will be matched by none. My heartfelt condolences go to the Bush family during this difficult time. 

As always, please contact one of my offices if you need assistance with any federal agency.

Weekly Review




December 3

Technology and the Workforce: This weekend, I had the chance to read through a portion of the Jobs Lost, Jobs Gained report by the McKinsey Global Institute. It predicts that, by 2030, technological breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and robotics will displace as much as a third of the US workforce.
Let me say that number again...one third of the American workforce will be displaced as a consequence of technology. Many of us worry about immigration, but the big upheaval in our lives on the employment front is going to come through technology...and it’s something all of us should work to be prepared for.
The saying is that the only constant in our lives is change. These statistics underscore this. They also underscore how important lifelong learning is, and will be over the years ahead. Gone are the days of one place of work over our working lives, instead it’s predicted that each one of us will hold a succession of different jobs over the course of our lives. That’s in fact something that I’m looking square in the eyes come January 3rd!
What I’ve furthermore found interesting in thinking about this report is how this is not the first time the U.S. has gone through a major shift in the composition of employment. Click here to read more.

Offshore Drilling Update: A quick update on offshore drilling…
I suspect you already saw the news last Friday, but in case you didn’t, the National Marine Fisheries Service authorized permits under the Marine Mammal Protection Act for five companies to begin seismic surveys in the Mid-Atlantic, from Delaware to central Florida.
This obviously includes the offshore waters of South Carolina.
I have made my stand here in opposition based on my belief in the importance of federalism. Ultimately, this was never a debate about whether one was pro or con on offshore drilling but rather a question of whether or not one believes all decisions should be made in Washington.
As I said repeatedly back in the primary, one is with only two choices when nearly every mayor and city council of the coastal towns that you represent in this 1st Congressional District come to you with formal proclamations stating their opposition to offshore drilling and exploration. You can either say, “you don’t know what you are talking about...” or “it is legitimate that you have a point of view in deciding the way that your communities grow and develop. This was always particularly the case, given that their opposition had little to do with the offshore issue and everything to do with where the infrastructure was going to go to support offshore operations. For this, back in the primary, I was castigated for being against the president… Click here to read more.

President George H.W. Bush's Funeral: I was at the National Cathedral today for the funeral service for George Bush. It was inspiring in many different ways, given the very full life that our 41st President lived.
But may I tell you a more local story that I think says everything about the former president’s remarkable sense of duty and service?
Our second son, Landon, about a year ago decided to write a host of living legends in hope that they might offer him wisdom. His question to each of them was: what would you say to yourself at age 20 if you could indeed go back in time and give yourself wisdom?
Long story short is that the only legend to write back was former president H.W. Bush.
I have included a copy of that letter below.
It says everything about the class, decorum, humility, and compassion that marked the president’s service that he would respond as he did.
So many great things were said today. Jon Meacham began his eulogy telling the story of Bush as a young navy airman at the age of 20 being shot down and praying for deliverance. Those prayers were answered, and in many ways, the rest of President Bush’s life reflected his thanks for that deliverance and his service became part of his own answer to the question any survivor asks himself: why was I spared when others were not?
The former Prime Minister of Canada, former Senator Simpson, and Reverend Russell J. Levinson Jr. spoke eloquently on President Bush’s remarkable legacy of service.
Former President W. Bush gave a spectacular eulogy on his life and service, and I thought so much of it that I will include it in the Friday post later this week….
But what I was struck by today was the way that those great words matched perfectly with the simple letter this former president had sent my son in March of this year. It is a reminder again of how the little things in life can be reflections of the great things that were celebrated on a day like today, and how those little things can make such a big difference in others’ lives.

Economic Warning Signs: We have another warning sign before us.
Not that any normal person is into studying yield curve numbers, but our yield curve is flattening.
Historically, this has not meant good things - and has, in most cases, served as a harbinger of bad things coming in the economy. In fact, almost without exception, flattening yield curves have meant that a recession will soon be on the way.
If this happens, the anticipated trillion dollar deficits that our federal budget will soon see will grow exponentially. This will occur at the very time when many people’s wallets and pocketbooks get hammered with a downward turn in the economy.
There’s certainly no crystal balls on what come next, but there are signs and this is an important one.
Specifically this Tuesday, the yield curve hit its flattest level since before the most recent recession.
The interest rates for 1 month Treasury bonds have jumped up above the interest rates for 1 year Treasury bonds. This is technically called an inverted yield curve.
This isn’t normal and here’s why.... Click here to read more.

December 7  President Bush's Eulogy of his Dad - President Bush: I promised earlier this week to send President Bush’s eulogy for his dad and do so now.   I could not more strongly agree with everything he said with regard to living life to the fullest, humility on the journey, the importance of service, family, and faith…and the joy to be found in a good covey rise.   Life is indeed short, and the parable of the talents says that we are to make the most of the time that we do have here on this Earth. President Bush certainly did, and the demonstration that he lived in a life well-lived is inspirational and well-encapsulated in the words below.   Take a listen; it will brighten your Friday….

REMINDER - FILL OUT YOUR FAFSA
 Did you know that completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) significantly increases the odds of students continuing their education—especially among low-income and minority students? Studies show that 90 percent of high school seniors who complete FAFSA attend college directly after high school, compared to just 55 percent of seniors who do not complete the form. Last year, only 48 percent of Colorado high school seniors completed the form, leaving $47 million in federal financial aid unused.
The 2019-2020 FAFSA form became available October 1, 2018 and students are encouraged to fill it out as soon as possible. Here are seven tips before you fill out the form and the FAFSA form can be accessed here.

REP. JEFFRIES ELECTED DEMOCRATIC  CAUCUS CHAIR

READ
 
Last week, Rep. Jeffries was elected by his colleagues to serve as Democratic Caucus Chair, the fifth-highest ranking position in House Democratic leadership. In the most competitive race of the day, Jeffries prevailed with a 123-113 victory. Not only does this make the Congressman one of the youngest members in leadership today, it also marks the first time two African Americans (incoming Majority Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina being the other) have ever served simultaneously in top House leadership positions. Rep. Jeffries looks forward to continuing his advocacy on behalf of constituents in Brooklyn and Queens as Democrats take the majority.

Hakeem Jeffries Emerges as New Face of House Democrats
 
 
 
At a leadership table of septuagenarians, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York has just emerged as the Democrats’ face of generational change.
 
Mr. Jeffries, a 48-year-old Brooklynite with a golden tongue, was elected by his fellow Democrats on Wednesday to the relatively obscure position of chairman of the House Democratic caucus. It is the No. 5 leadership spot, but Mr. Jeffries is now on the fast track, with the potential to make history as the first black speaker of the House.
 
“Hakeem represents the leading edge of a new wave of Democrats,” said Steve Israel, the former New York congressman and onetime chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “I think he tapped into a sense in the caucus that the next generation of leaders needs to begin crystallizing.”

Honoring the memory of President George H.W. Bush
George H.W. Bush may have been the only person ever elected President of the United States primarily by being nice. I had the honor of serving as his Secretary of Education and have dozens of handwritten notes from him—as do, I suspect, hundreds of Americans. His presidency is increasingly admired for his courage and restraint: for unifying Germany, for making hard decisions that balanced the budget, and for challenging aggression in Kuwait with decisive but measured military action. America is fortunate to produce leaders who bring out the best in us, as President George H.W. Bush did.
Honey and I were honored to attend President Bush’s memorial service. It truly was a celebration of a remarkable life and of the life of our country. Presidents Trump, Obama, George W. Bush, Clinton and Carter were there. The tributes were eloquent and moving, especially George W.’s pausing to reflect upon how President Bush lived his life, which is a wonderful lesson for all of us about how to try to live our own lives.  
 
￼
 
 
In 1991, I persuaded President Bush to use a computer for the first time. We were in his private office next to the Oval Office in the White House. This was well before most people had ever heard of or used the internet.
 
 
 
￼
 
 
I had the opportunity to share my memories of our 41st President on Fox News and spoke on the floor of the United States Senate about George H.W. Bush’s legacy.  
 
 
 
Agreement between President Trump and China to control deadly fentanyl will save thousands of American lives
This week, President Trump reached an agreement with Chinese President Xi in which China will make fentanyl a controlled substance, meaning those who manufacture and try to sell this deadly drug to the United States will be prosecuted. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that can be 100 times stronger than opioid prescription pills, and almost all of it coming into the United States is produced in China. This drug is the source of the greatest increase in opioid overdoses and deaths in our country, and resulted in the deaths of 77,000 Americans last year alone.
Last month, I led a congressional delegation to China where, at the urging of U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad, I discussed this proposal with Chinese officials and made fentanyl and the opioid crisis the primary point of our visit. I talked with Ivanka Trump about our trip and encouraged her to get the White House to make this a priority, and she understood that this would save lives and help thousands of Americans. I also urged President Trump to ask the Chinese to continue working with us to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States. As President Trump said, the deal reached this week is a “game changer,” and he deserves great credit for persuading China to make the selling of fentanyl subject to the maximum penalty under Chinese law.
President Trump posted the following tweets on this agreement:

Introducing Tennessean A.B. Culvahouse, Jr., at his confirmation hearing to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Australia
￼
Click here to watch me introduce A.B. to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
It was my privilege to introduce Tennessean A.B. Culvahouse, Jr., at his confirmation hearing to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the Commonwealth of Australia. He is the most accomplished lawyer I know, and I do not know many public servants more accomplished than he is. That might sound like an extravagant claim, but I mean it sincerely. He had the great advantage of being born and raised in Ten Mile, Tennessee. A.B. became legislative counsel to Howard Baker, our former senator for Tennessee who later became majority leader of the United States Senate. He was counsel to President Ronald Reagan while he was in the White House. He became counsel to both John McCain and Donald Trump during their presidential campaigns as they began to consider vice presidential selections. And in the midst of all of that, he has been the chairman of one of the world’s largest law firms, O’Melveny and Myers. All of these activities have established him as enormously well-qualified for this position. I’m more than a little jealous that he is the Tennessean who gets to be the Ambassador to Australia.
￼
I spoke on the Senate floor this week about my good friend, Bob Corker. While I am looking forward to working with Senator-elect Marsha Blackburn, as Peyton Manning said, I wish Bob would serve until he was 100 years old. It's been a privilege to serve with him, and I look forward to watching what has to be one of the best upcoming shows in town, which will be whatever Bob Corker decides to do next.

This week is Computer Science Education Week, and I celebrated with a visit to a computer science class at Plymouth High School.
To highlight the amazing opportunities STEM education and computer-based skills bring to our future Hoosier workforce, I paid a surprise visit to Ms. Moore’s cybersecurity class and announced the winner of the 2018 Congressional App Challenge.

It was an honor to congratulate Kobe Johnson for his hard work, ingenuity, and innovative spirit that helped him create his winning app, “Homework Helper.”
I was impressed by the hard work and dedication shown by each student who participated this year, and I’m grateful for the opportunities Hoosier students have not only to learn about computer programming but also to showcase their talent through this competition.
￼
I also visited students at New Paris Elementary this week to speak to them about freedom, democracy, and the things that make our country strong.
These fourth and fifth grade Hoosiers have some amazing teachers and school administrators who are putting them on the path to success.
It was an exciting experience to hear from them and answer their thoughtful questions about my work in Congress. I got a peek at our future this week, and it is certainly looking bright.
DAY OF INFAMY
￼
On December 7th, 1941, our country was changed forever.
Yesterday marked 77 years since the attack on Pearl Harbor. On this solemn occasion, we remember those who gave their lives on that day of infamy.
We honor all who answered the call to defend our freedom and democracy when our way of life was under threat, and we reflect on all that they gave to our country.
I want to thank the brave men and women who serve – past, present, and future – because our great nation is strong, resilient, and free because of their sacrifices.

Remembering President George H.W. Bush
Today, on this National Day of Mourning for President George H.W. Bush, we reflect not only on what he has done for our country, but the extraordinary man he was. Although I did not personally know him, having been on this earth during his extraordinary lifetime has been a great honor. As our president, he was a very respectable man, but he did so much more. He served our country as our Vice President, Congressman from Texas, CIA Director, Ambassador and – more importantly – as a father and a friend.  
President Bush wasted no time in answering the call to serve our country, he joined the Navy right after he graduated high school after the attack on Pearl Harbor. President Bush will forever be known as the youngest naval aviator of World War II when he joined the Navy at age 19; and even after he was shot down, he continued to serve on behalf of our nation. When he was honorably discharged from the Navy, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his heroism and achievement. I personally would have liked for him to be my commander-in-chief while I served during Vietnam because of his experience and knowledge of the battle field. He took a self-financed visit to Southeast Asia to tour the U.S. positions during the Vietnam War; but most importantly, he was proud of our nation at a time that many were not. President Bush is one of the greatest examples of why we must remain committed to taking care of our servicemembers and veterans.  
It is also well known that President George H.W. Bush had a warm and caring heart, best exemplified by his actions over the years. During his time in the White House, he recognized more than 1,000 people for making a difference in their communities through his Daily Point of Light Award. This movement, and his term “a thousand points of light,” gave new life to volunteerism, which inspired so many to do good in their communities and across the country. The president also joined President Clinton in a disaster relief partnership after the tsunami devastated Southeast Asia in 2004. In 2011, President Bush rightfully received the Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama in recognition for his public service.  
President Bush was also a friend to many and he knew how to have fun. I remember Dana Carvey, who impersonated him on Saturday Night Live, ended up being a good friend to the family. Dana spoofed him, but not in a way that was disrespectful. Both the president and the first lady enjoyed Dana’s impersonation of him so much that they invited Dana to the White House; from then on the two became good friends. President Bush was the same man whether the camera was on or off, and he exemplified what is was to be a gentleman to others and his wife. It has been an honor for me to serve in the same House, “the People’s House,” that the president served in early in his career. I hope many will use President George H.W. Bush’s life as an example for their own, for he was a rare public servant that I hope inspires more people to follow his example in the future. My wife and I continue to extend our deepest sympathies to his family during this time of mourning, and I know our country will never forget the great legacy of 41.  
Feel free to contact my office if I can be of assistance to you or your family.

SIGNED INTO LAW FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT
￼ 
Lindsey - 
Florida’s environment is a non-negotiable priority - central to our economy, quality of life, and most importantly, the health of every family. The well-being of the Everglades, our beaches, our waterways and other ecosystems impact everybody that lives in Florida. 
The good news is that we are making progress: 
The President just signed my bill into law, called the Jupiter Island Land Transfer Act, to ensure that the habitats of endangered turtles and other animals are preserved by expanding the Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge. Being good stewards of our environment begins with strong conservation efforts and protecting our environment is critical to our businesses and livelihoods.

Good news inside:



Dear Friend:
Welcome to your weekly update. As always, you can learn more about these and other legislative issue at my website: upton.house.gov. 
Announcement of $20M grant for US-31 
The good news we promised: The US-31/I-94 project finally got the federal funding needed this week to complete the project. On Thursday, our office announced that the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) was awarded a $20 million discretionary grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to complete the US-31 relocation project from Napier Road to I-94 in Berrien County. 
For years, we have been working diligently with local, state, and national leaders to get this done. The DOT has long-said ‘hang on, help is on the way’ and this week that help finally came. Completing this project will ensure Southwest Michigan remains a hub for economic competitiveness, jobs, and growth now and into the future. 
Learn more here or do a deeper dive below: 
WSJM: Upton talks US-31 funding project MLive: $20M federal grant funds completion of U.S. 31 link to I-94 South Bend Tribune: Funding secured to complete U.S. 31 connection to I-94 in Berrien County Herald-Palladium: A long road ahead WSJM: US-31 to be expanded to I-94 Moody on the Market: U.S. Department of Transportation finally produces funds to finish US-31 to I-94 Fox17: M-Dot awarded $20M to complete US-31 connector to I-94 WOODTV8: Feds give $20M to connect I-94 and US-31 WSBT22: U.S. Department of Transportation awards M-Dot grant to finish U.S. 31 in Berrien County
Strong and steady job growth
According to the Department of Labor, the unemployment rate remains at the lowest point since 1969 at 3.7% in November for the third month in a row.
The U.S. economy added an additional 155,000 jobs in November.
This follows a year of growth for our country. Wages are also on the rise for workers and it is making a real impact for families across Southwest Michigan.

Remembering President George H.W. Bush
On a more somber note, we remembered the life and legacy of President George H.W. Bush this week. This is an individual who leaves behind a powerful legacy as a war hero, statesman, and consummate public servant. Above all else, he was a dedicated family man. A husband, father, and grandfather whose faith guided his life in everything he endeavored. 
The WWII generation often spoke to the rest of us about the character and standing of our nation. President Bush’s passing certainly reminds us what we desire in our leaders: compassion, honesty, grit, and a duty to try and do the right thing.
I knew President Bush well from my days in the Reagan White House. His office was right around the corner from mine. In fact, his was among the first congratulatory calls on my first election win. I also fondly recall campaigning with him in New Hampshire, and traveling together on Air Force One and Two. Never a day he let his country down. 
He now joins his wife Barbara in eternal peace. Amey and I joined with all Americans this week in celebrating his life and mourning his passing. 
Have a great weekend and God bless,
￼
Fred Upton

 Saying Farewell to 41
Last Friday, the Nation was saddened by the passing of George H.W. Bush. President Bush had a lifelong dedication to public service, serving in the military, Congress, the foreign service, the intelligence community, and ultimately the White House. His life touched us all, including me. In my time in the Army, I had the honor and privilege of supporting his Secret Service detail. While we all mourn his passing, we must all aspire to be more like George H.W. Bush. The President put it best: “America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle. We as a people have such a purpose today.” As the memorials to the President conclude this weekend, please join me in keeping the Bush family in thoughts and prayers and reflect upon how to follow his example and espouse his values in daily life.

FAQ (What folks have been calling/texting my office about this week)
Q: What is the latest update on the Farm Bill?  A: The Farm Bill negotiations have officially concluded and Conference Committee is waiting for the Congressional Budget Office score before releasing the exact details on the final bill. Although it has been a very slow process I am very excited about the final piece of legislation. I look forward to delivering on my promises and giving rural America an updated Farm Bill that works for everyone.

New North American trade agreement heads to Congress
The United States, Mexico, and Canada reached a tentative agreement to strike a new North American trade deal, and President Donald Trump has given Congress six months to approve the measure. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), would replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Jonesboro, told Talk Business & Politics he doesn’t think the agreement will be decided during the lame duck session of Congress, but it could be considered in the first couple of months after the New Year.

NW Arkansas Democrat Gazette
Bush's state ties recalled; Arkansans note his visits, encouragement

U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford, a Republican from Jonesboro, who served as an explosive ordnance disposal technician in the U.S. Army, helped with security when then-Vice President Bush was traveling.
In that capacity, he was able to observe Bush up close.
While they never spoke, Bush made it clear that he valued the security team's work.
""There was eye contact and head nods, you know, just gestures that he was aware we were there. ... There was a sense of appreciation and a kindness from him,"" Crawford said.
Crawford left the military in 1989, just as the Bush presidency was beginning. The voters in 1988 chose well, Crawford said.
""The historic perspective shows that he was a phenomenal commander in chief. He had all the credentials and handled it probably as good or better than anybody in my lifetime,"" he said.

Dear Friend,

We've heard from many of you regarding the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) announcement on coastal barrier protection. As you may be aware, USACE is working closely with the Texas General Land Office (GLO) to study the feasibility of constructing coastal storm risk management and ecosystem restoration (ER) projects along the Texas coast. 

On October 26, the study team released a Draft Report and Environmental Impact Statement detailing a Tentatively Selected Plan (TSP) that employs a ""multiple lines of defense"" strategy, combining structural, natural, nature-based, and non-structural measures to provide resilient, robust, and adaptable solutions to promote life-safety based on local site conditions and the values of the coastal community. 

If you'd like to learn more about the plan, visit coastalstudy.texas.gov to review the coastal barrier plan and offer comments on the proposal; the comment period ends on January 9, 2019. The study team will also be hosting public meetings in our area:

Tuesday, December 11, 2018 (5:30 – 9:00 p.m.)
Winnie Community Building
1301 Park St.

Sincerely,
￼
Randy K. Weber
  

GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH
George H. W. Bush was one of our great statesmen. His conviction and principle were evident in all that he did. His love for his nation was bested only by his love for his family.

Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Bush 41 joined the Navy and became one of the youngest pilots. He went on to serve in the House of Representatives, as Ambassador to the UN, Envoy to China, Director of the CIA, Vice President to Ronald Reagan, and finally as our 41st President. In each of these roles, he acted with prudence and sound judgement.

For decades, he served our nation honorably and with distinction. GOD bless the Bush family, friends, and former staffers during this difficult time.

To attend his ceremonies in Washington was an absolute honor. This great and good man brought our nation together and quieted some of the divisiveness, which is on display all too often. We have a lot to learn from his mission and his life.

As he arrived at his final resting place in College Station, with Barbara and Robin at either side, he was finally home.

Fair winds and following seas, Mr. President.

McKinley Talks Criminal Justice Reform, Opioids With Local Law Enforcement 
This week we had a productive meeting with leaders from local law enforcement agencies in Monongalia County. We discussed the drug crisis and criminal justice reform proposals in Congress. We are searching for solutions to help reduce the overdose death rate that continues to rise in West Virginia. This was an opportunity to hear about the impact this is having every day in our state from the people who see it firsthand. I look forward to bringing their ideas back to Washington.

DOE Releases Study On Ethane Storage Hub
This week Secretary Rick Perry announced the release of a new study by the Department of Energy detailing the potential for a petrochemical hub located in the Appalachian region. The reports reaffirmed what we have been saying for years- we need to capitalize on the resources we have in West Virginia and Appalachia, while using our natural gas liquids to attract manufacturing, investment, and jobs. 
We thank Secretary Perry for his leadership and for working with us to highlight the potential and need for an ethane storage hub in Appalachia. Not only is it good for our region, this is good for America. West Virginia and surrounding states are poised to become a leader in petrochemicals and manufacturing, but we need the necessary infrastructure to make it work.  Click here to read more

West Virginia will be receiving $40 million through the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Better Utilizing Investment to Leverage Development (BUILD) Grants.  $20 million will go toward the Tucker County expressway project along Corridor H while $20 million will go into the Berkeley Spring bypass project on U.S. Route 522. These grants are given to states, regions, and communities through need and the potential impact it could have on the area.
This is a much needed investment that will make West Virginia roadways more safe and efficient. By investing in infrastructure, we will be able to put people back to work and continue to help our booming economy.   Click here to read more 

McKinley Remembers Pearl Harbor 
This week we remember devastating events at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, “A day which will live in infamy.” Each year fewer and fewer Americans are left who actually remember or were a part of Pearl Harbor. It is up to the rest of us to carry on the memory of the Americans killed there, and the attack that spurred America to action and changed history forever.

On my weekly ""Capitol Hill Report,"" I spoke with Mike Peterson of KMA Radio in Shenandoah and Dale Wegner of the Sac Sun in Sac City about President George H. W. Bush, the Farm Bill and the newly-signed trade deal with Mexico and Canada (USMCA).  
Q&A: From Judiciary to Finance 
Q. Did you achieve what you set out to do in four years as chairman of the Judiciary Committee? Q. Looking ahead, what priorities will you pursue as incoming chairman of thye Committee on Finance? 
Quick Links
President George H. W. Bush led an incredible life. He served with distinction as a naval aviator in World War II, flying 58 combat missions. He represented his community and neighbors as a congressman. He built bridges as an American diplomat in China. He helped keep our nation safe as the head of the Central Intelligence Agency. He honorably served as vice president to President Ronald Reagan before leading our nation as America’s 41st president. He will be remembered not only for his professional achievements, but for the warmth and kindness he showed to his friends and political opponents alike. President Bush will be missed, but his life and service to our nation will be remembered.

KCRG: Grassley Remembers President George H. W. Bush 
After Iowans contacted me with concerns about the skyrocketing price of the anti-allergy prescription drug device EpiPen, I began a years-long oversight effort into why it happened and how to fix it. I found that Mylan, the distributor of EpiPen, misclassified the drug as a generic, cheating taxpayers out of billions of dollars. With Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, I introduced the Right Rebate Act of 2018. It would close a loophole in Medicaid that has allowed pharmaceutical manufacturers like Mylan to misclassify their drugs and overcharge taxpayers. The legislation would also provide the Department of Health and Human Services with additional authorities to ensure drugs are properly classified. It’s a significant step forward to fixing some of the problems in our health care system that have allowed pharmaceutical manufacturers to price gouge taxpayers and consumers for too long.
I wrote to the Justice Department’s Inspector General and the FBI Director seeking answers about the Bureau’s raid on the residence of a whistleblower who reportedly disclosed information about the Clinton Foundation and the Uranium One transaction. I asked about the FBI’s awareness of the protected disclosures made by the whistleblower, the basis for the raid and whether any of the material seized during the raid was classified. Whistleblowers have exposed waste, fraud and abuse in just about every industry and agency in this country. Congress must take action to make sure they're protected, that includes oversight of matters whistleblowers report and how agencies treat America's truth tellers. 
Health and Human Services (HHS) Assistant Secretary for Family Support Lynn Johnson sent me a letter in response to an October 15 inquiry I sent urging her to implement recommendations from an HHS Office of Inspector General report that would help foster children who are prescribed psychotropic medications. Ensuring children in the foster care program are safe and receiving the proper treatments and support is critical. Iowa has a particularly high rate of foster children being treated with psychotropic medication and it’s imperative the state and federal government monitor treatments to make sure they are receiving the proper care. 
Post of the Week

Every VP, except for Gore & Biden, currently have a bust in the Senate surrounding the chamber. The custom started from a resolution in 1866. Pictured is the bust of George H. W. Bush who served as president of the Senate for 8 yrs. He will be remembered for the public respect he brought to public service by setting such a good example and being an ethical & moral leader. Pres. H. W. Bush was a selfless public servant throughout this life.

The Washington Rundown 
There is just one week left before the end of Open Enrollment on HealthCare.gov.  Scroll down to read more on Open Enrollment.  This week, Congress passed a two-week funding extension, pushing back a partial government shutdown deadline to December 21.  The funding measure covers about 25% of federal government operations that aren’t yet funded by full-year appropriations (the other 75% of government agencies are already funded for FY 19 and aren’t subject to any shutdown).  Disagreement remains surrounding President Trump’s proposal for $5 billion for a border wall that he originally said Mexico would pay for.  State election officials continue an investigation into North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District race, in which campaign officials allegedly tampered with and destroyed mail-in absentee ballots from voters.  The News & Observer reports, “What we know (and what we don’t)” about the NC-09 election fraud allegations.  Congressman Butterfield continues to call for a full and thorough investigation before certifying the outcome of the election.  An unfairly influenced election could result in a different outcome or a new election.  House Leadership announced that a Member of Congress from NC-09 may not be seated before the investigation results are complete.

Post Bulletin: Alleged fraud clouds North Carolina’s 9th District vote. Is a new election possible? 
RALEIGH, N.C. — North Carolina has held special elections to fill vacant congressional seats when, say, a member has resigned. But, if the State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement calls for a new election for the 9th Congressional District, it will apparently be the first time in N.C. history that alleged fraud has caused voters to go to the polls a second time to decide the same congressional race.
Fraud has caused some rematches in local elections in the state, said Gerry Cohen, who drafted election laws during his 37 years — 1977 to 2014 — as special counsel for the N.C. General Assembly. But, he said, this would “absolutely be the first time for a congressional election.”
*** 
The state’s three congressional Democrats, meanwhile, have called on the state board to not certify the election until it could “guarantee that the outcome of this election reflects the will of the voters and (ensures) accountability for any misconduct.”
The statement signed by Alma Adams, David Price and G. K. Butterfield also endorsed the calling of a new election if “investigations produce clear evidence of voter fraud.” 
  
Charlotte Observer: North Carolina leaders react to President Bush’s death 
RALEIGH - North Carolina leaders are remembering former President George H. W. Bush following his death Friday night. 
Gov. Roy Cooper ordered flags lowered to half-staff at state facilities in honor of the passing of the nation’s 41st president. Bush was 94.
*** 
Congressman G. K. Butterfield offered his condolences on social media. 
“I join the country in mourning the loss of President George H.W. Bush,” he said in a tweet. “He led a life of public service with dignity, honor, and respect. Prayers to the Bush family as we reflect on a life well lived.”
  
Pacific Standard: MEMBERS OF A CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY IN NORTH CAROLINA ARE DEVASTATED AFTER A SANCTUARY DWELLER'S DEPORTATION 
The Trump administration has deported an undocumented North Carolina man who had been living in a church basement sanctuary space for nearly a year. 
Samuel Oliver-Bruno, whose wife and son remain in the United States, was arrested the day after Thanksgiving, during what he was told would be a routine appointment with U.S. immigration authorities. At the meeting, he was being fingerprinted for what he anticipated would be an application to have his deportation deferred at a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Morrisville, North Carolina.
*** 
""We believe the actions taken by ICE and USCIS in Mr. Oliver-Bruno's apprehension are extremely concerning and deserving of scrutiny,"" North Carolina Representatives G. K. Butterfield and David Price, both Democrats, said in a joint press release late last week.

REMINDER: 40 Days to Get Covered 


￼
Dear San Franciscan, 
Did you know health insurance can be cheaper than your cell phone bill? In fact, 80% of people can find plans for less than $75 per month. Covered California is the only insurance marketplace in California where eligible consumers can receive financial assistance to help pay for their health insurance. 
Key Dates: 
• December 15, 2018: Deadline to sign up for coverage starting January 1, 2019. • January 15, 2019: Last day consumers can sign up for coverage starting February 1, 2019. 
  ￼ 
Californians currently enrolled can use Covered California's “shop and compare” tool to see if there is a health plan that could work better for you in 2019. Current members may also qualify for a different amount of financial help than last year. Enrollees have until January 15th to change their plan for 2019. Individuals with special qualifying life events can enroll at any time of the year and Medi-Cal enrollment is also year-round.

Almost nine years ago, with the signing of the Affordable Care Act, America added a new pillar of health and economic security to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The ACA has delivered historic progress expanding coverage, lowering costs and improving benefits for every American – no matter where they get health coverage. 
￼ 
March 21, 2010: Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Two days later, President Obama signed the legislation and the ACA officially became law.

Dear Friend, 
The nation will always remember the life and legacy of President George H.W. Bush. View my remarks reflecting on the 41st President of the United States here. 
Land and Water Conservation Fund
I hosted a bipartisan press conference last week calling for the reauthorization and full funding of the crown jewel of conservation programs, the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). I joined my fellow LWCF champions in both the House and Senate to fight and save this vital conservation program before the end of the year.
I also gave a speech on the Senate floor stressing the importance of this crucial conservation and recreation program that protects Colorado's public lands.

Energy Innovation Grants Awarded to Colorado Universities
I recently announced with my colleague Senator Michael Bennet that the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) awarded Colorado School of Mines and the University of Colorado Boulder over $2 million. This grant aims to continue their cutting edge work in innovative energy technologies. I have always advocated for continued research and development programs and will continue to do so because of the enormous benefits these programs bring to Colorado. 
Bipartisan Legislation to Help Improve Veterans' Health Care
I joined several of my colleagues this week to introduce bipartisan legislation to help improve veterans’ health care by increasing collaboration among federal agencies and authorizing the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop technologies that solve complex data challenges. This bill will help provide world class care to our veterans by leveraging cutting-edge technologies at our National Labs. I’m proud to lead this bipartisan effort and I will make sure the collaboration between the Department of Veterans Affairs and our National Labs continues. 
Full Legislation is available here. 
Receiving the Guardian of Small Business Award
Colorado small businesses are crucial to the economy and to our communities and I am proud to be a voice for them in Congress. I appreciate the National Federation of Independent Business recognizing my hard work for the small business community by awarding me the Guardian of Small Business Award from the President and CEO Juanita Duggan. 
￼ 
Working to Extend the Secure Rural Schools Program
I sent a bipartisan letter to Senate leadership recently urging the reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. I am pressing for an extension of the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) Program in any end-of-year legislation so that the schools, libraries, and jails will continue functioning in their counties. 
View letter here.

Attending the State Funeral for President George H.W. Bush 
This week I had the honor of attending the State Funeral for President George H.W Bush in Washington. 
Though we did not always agree on policy matters, I found his record of service to our country and commitment to civility inspiring. I hope all Americans will join me in reflecting on the true values of public service. We must strive, as he did, to put our country before narrow self-interests. My thoughts are with the family and friends of President Bush during this difficult time. 
Meeting with Former U.S Ambassador to Cambodia William Heidt 
This week I met with William Heidt, who recently stepped down as the U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia.

I’ve enjoyed a close relationship with Ambassador Heidt throughout his service in Cambodia. I appreciative his service, and am grateful for his shared commitment to ensuring that the Cambodian people are afforded basic human rights, including religious freedom and fair elections.

Each week hundreds of constituents contact my office to share their views on a variety of topics. I have recently received many messages from constituents expressing their concern over the high cost of EpiPens. Below is a portion of my response to those messages:  
  
“The rising cost of EpiPens is preventing many Americans from accessing the life-saving medication they need.  Sadly, the EpiPen is just one of many examples of rising prescription drug costs that have contributed to making healthcare less accessible and more expensive for American families. 
In 2016, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a hearing with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Mylan, the pharmaceutical company that significantly increased the price of the EpiPen.  At the time, Mylan had raised the base price of an EpiPen two-pack from $100 in 2009 to more than $600. 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved a generic version of the drug. However, the price is the same as the Mylan version.  Although the FDA says that it has no control over how private companies set their prices, I believe that approving more authorized generic versions will put pressure on manufacturers to lower the costs of their drugs. 
During my time in Congress, I have continuously supported legislation aimed at bringing prescription medication costs under control, especially for low-income families.  As a community psychologist and member of the Affordable Medicines Caucus, I understand the importance of supporting legislation that will increase access to health care and allow individuals to live longer, healthier lives.    
I will work with my colleagues to find ways to make prescription medications, including the EpiPen, more affordable and accessible for all Americans.” 
  
If you have written in to me, please continue to do so. If you have not, I encourage you to share your views and concerns with me, as it is the best way for me to find out which issues you care most about.   You can find out how to contact me on my website by clicking here.

Lame Duck Session and President  
Lame Duck is a mid-1760s English phrase that was first applied to U.S. politics in the 1860s.  In the lexicon of politics, a “lame duck” is a politician that has not been re-elected or is leaving office at the end of the current term, but is still serving out the remainder of the term.  In the literal sense, it refers to a duck which is unable to keep up with its flock, making it a target for predators. 
 A “lame duck session,” is used to describe either a House or Senate session which reconvenes in an even-numbered year following the November general elections to consider various items of business. 
In U.S. politics, the period between a November general election and the swearing-in of officials early in the following year is commonly called the lame duck period. It typically lasts from the early November general election until the oath of office is administered to new Members of Congress early in the following January.
Regarding the presidency, a president is considered a lame-duck during the period between a successor being elected and the inauguration of this newly-elected president. It typically lasts from the early November general election to the Presidential Inauguration held during the third week of the following January.

REMEMBERING 41
This week, our nation came together to remember and celebrate the life of President George Herbert Walker Bush – an American hero and patriot from the Greatest Generation. I had the honor of being able to pay my respects and attend his memorial at the National Cathedral in Washington. This was the first state funeral service I have attended, and it is honestly a bit hard to put into words how powerful and humbling of an experience it was.
President George H.W. Bush was a remarkable leader who led a life of duty, purpose, and conviction. He was the last of the presidents to wear a uniform and serve in combat, but his contributions to our nation didn’t end there. A World War II Veteran, President, Vice President, Congressman, UN Ambassador, CIA Director, Husband, and Father – he devoted his life to country and family. 
The true embodiment of service and leadership, President H.W. Bush made his mark on America and the world. His memorial services throughout the week showed just that. 
How amazing it was to see our country come together to mourn and reflect on his life. Families stood in line for hours to pay their respects in the Capitol, people crowded the streets of Washington D.C. and Texas to say goodbye, and many shared stories with loved ones. Even the sheer range of distinguished officials, foreign dignitaries, and government representatives who joined together to lay our former Commander-in-Chief to rest was truly moving.
A touching service for a remarkable man. His leadership, love of country, and dedication to family will be his lasting legacy. Rest In Peace, Mr. President.  
￼ 
“I will keep America moving forward, always forward, for a better America, for an endless enduring dream and a Thousand Points of Light. This is my mission, and I will complete it.” – George H. W. Bush 

WEEK IN REVIEW 
￼
To start off this week's From the Front... I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nation’s capital, including the Sears family of Bentonville and James and Lisa Brown of Van Buren. Safe travels back to the Natural State.
I am very excited to announce that Arkansas will receive $25 million in funds from the U.S. Department of Transportation to complete work on the Bella Vista Bypass, a critical segment of I-49. The funding news is a game changer that will transform and modernize our local transportation system to support Arkansas families and the growth of our state. This investment, which I have tirelessly advocated for, will increase travel safety, decrease congestion, create jobs, and enhance the economic vitality of our region. I am grateful to Secretary Chao for listening to the concerns I brought to USDOT, and for moving this important and long overdue project forward. Learn more about the investment here. 
In more good news, the Senate passed the REAL ID Act Modification for Freely Associated States, legislation I cosponsored and helped pass in the House. The legislation reforms current law to allow the Marshallese and other citizens of Freely Associated States to obtain a permanent driver's license or personal identification card. This common sense solution will help ensure that Marshallese residents in Springdale have the tools needed to further empower themselves and pursue opportunity in our region. I look forward to seeing the legislation swiftly signed into law by President Trump. 
￼
Businesses are the backbone of our local and national economy, and it’s crucial that we advocate for policies that help our hardworking entrepreneurs flourish. It was a pleasure to welcome several AR-3 chambers of commerce to DC this week. Members from the Rogers-Lowell, Bentonville, Fayetteville, and Siloam Springs Chambers, as well as representatives from the Arkansas World Trade Center and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce came together to discuss legislative work and priorities. We talked about a range of issues, including infrastructure, appropriations, trade, tax cuts, regulations, and my work on the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform. I appreciated their time and will continue working to advocate for policies that grow economic opportunity in Arkansas’s Third Congressional District.  
I then had a meeting with Senator Boozman, officials from the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality to talk about stump dump fire issues in Bella Vista. In good news, recent test results from the EPA showed that there is no elevation of chemicals in the area. That being said, my office will continue to carefully monitor the situation to ensure the safety of residents and the surrounding area.
￼
Our community is full of opportunity, and it was great to speak with Florentine Domroes and Inga Trautmann who are students from Germany that are currently studying at Arkansas high schools for the year. The exchange program is run through the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Education and seeks to promote a reciprocal understanding of government and relationships between Germany and the U.S. They said that they have learned a lot during their time living and studying in Springdale and Greenwood! I also met with Andreas Schwarz, a member of the German Parliament, to talk about my work as Chairman of the Budget Committee and the U.S. appropriations process.
￼
I wrapped up the week by receiving the 2018 ‘Innovator in Biotechnology’ Award from the Biotechnology Innovation Organization! The title recognizes members who support innovation and lifesaving scientific research throughout the United States. The biotechnology and life science industries are an important part of our nation’s economy and provide high-skill, high-wage jobs in the health, energy, and agriculture sectors. Arkansas’s biotechnology industry provides nearly 7,000 jobs across 639 establishments. It’s an honor to receive this award, and I will continue to be a champion for Arkansas’s biotechnology community.
As many of you know, I am the Chairman of the United States Military Academy Board of Visitors. This weekend, one of the greatest rivalry in sports will take it to the football field again. The annual Army-Navy game will be held in Philly on Saturday, and I can’t wait to see how it plays out.  I have to say it: Go Army! Beat Navy!

Foxx Report
 
This week, the House was in recess to honor the life and mourn the death of George H.W. Bush, an incredible American patriot and leader. At age 18, Bush enlisted in the Navy to defend our country after the attacks on Pearl Harbor (77 years ago today), flying 58 combat missions as an aviator in WWII. In his long career of public service, he wore many hats—House Representative, Ambassador to the UN, envoy to China, CIA Director, Vice President to Ronald Reagan, and our Commander in Chief. 
He lay in state at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda from Monday evening to Wednesday morning so our country could pay him special tribute. Deeply grateful for his passionate service to our country, it was an honor to personally pay my respects and salute this American patriot. My prayers remain with the Bush family; may God be close to their hearts in this difficult time.

Preserving our National Parks
At the conclusion of every two-year Congress, all introduced bills expire. Before we reach that expiration date on January 3, we should finish our bipartisan initiative to preserve national parks that have fallen into disrepair. The National Park Service (NPS) has been unable to keep pace with maintenance needs of our parks due to infrastructure aging beyond its intended life cycle and inconsistent funding. As a cosponsor of the National Park Service Legacy Act, I wrote a letter to House leadership to request that legislation on this issue be brought to the House floor for consideration before the end of the year. Read the letter here or click the image below.

Today we remember Pearl Harbor and the 2403 military members and civilians who lost their lives. We also honor and remember the brave heroes who defended our country in WWII and preserved the freedoms threatened by that attack.
What’s Coming Up?
Next week, the House will return to tie-up loose ends on legislation that is still pending in the 115th Congress, including the Farm Bill and government funding for agencies that are operating under last year’s funding levels.
Sincerely,

Crookston in 1905 – Polk County
Dear Friends,
 
This week, Americans mourned the passing of former President George H.W. Bush. His dedication to service and the class he demonstrated during difficult times will be fondly remembered. In Minnesota, I joined with veterans and community leaders in Montevideo to celebrate the contribution of late-veteran Steven Williams, who left $2.8 million to help build a new veterans home in town. At the event, I shared my intent to fight for federal funding for this veterans home during the 116th Congress. I also met with agriculture producers and press to share updates on the timing and key provisions included in the Farm Bill for Minnesota. The House is expected to vote on the Farm Bill Conference Report next week, and I expect strong bipartisan support to take it through to the President’s desk.
 
Sincerely,
￼ Congressman Collin C. Peterson

Underpaid GI Bill Benefits
Last week, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced to Congress that it will not reimburse student veterans who were underpaid due to computer issues at the agency. In response to this news, my office is working to make sure my constituents receive the education benefits they earned. Since last week, I have helped two student veterans receive reimbursements in their benefits. If you received lower than usual education benefits from the VA, please reach out to my district staffer Meg Louwagie at Meg.Louwagie@mail.house.gov.
 
Separately, my office had several productive discussions with the Fargo VA this week which resulted in the continuation of a successful PTSD management program. According to several veterans from the 7th District, programs like these are one of the most critical components of mental healthcare. As always, I encourage veterans and Veterans Service Organizations to use my office as a resource in the event that future healthcare concerns arise.
 
Donation Announced for Montevideo Veterans Home Project
￼
 
On Wednesday, the Minnesota Department of Veterans Affairs and partners hosted a press conference to announce a $2.8 million donation to support the proposed veterans home project in Montevideo. The details of the donation, made by late-veteran Steven Williams, were announced by his brother James Williams. These funds will support the construction of the planned 72-bed facility that hopes to break ground in autumn of 2019. I attended this event to offer my support for the project. I will be advocating for federal funding matches to construct new veterans homes in Montevideo and Bemidji. I wish to express my gratitude to Mr. Steven Williams and his family for this generous gift to our veterans.
 
Talking Farm Bill in Moorhead and South St. Paul
￼
 
This week, I held two meetings with state farm groups and agribusiness in Moorhead and South St. Paul to talk about the Farm Bill. I told them that we are very close to a final deal and I expect that we will have the bill filed early next week. We discussed the bill’s provisions for dairy producers, who have been particularly hurt by the depressed farm economy. We also talked about changes to commodity programs, the conservation title, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Looking ahead to next week, I anticipate the bill will have broad bipartisan support and we’ll finally be able to get this done and on to President Trump’s desk to become law.
 
Sugarbeet Growers Meet in Fargo
￼
 
The Minn-Dak Farmers Cooperative, American Crystal Sugar, and the Red River Valley Sugarbeet Growers Association held their annual meetings in Fargo this week to discuss the 2018 harvest and their outlooks for 2019. I gave the groups an update on sugar provisions in the 2018 Farm Bill and the work that remains to enact the 5-year bill. Sugar is an important crop for our part of the country and I will continue to support the Farm Bill Sugar Program that ensures Americans will always have a reliable source of sugar products. Cold temperatures delayed harvests and caused some growers to lose portions of their crop this year. Congress should support sugar producers by enacting the 2018 Farm Bill and moving to resolve trade disputes with Canada and Mexico.
 
Former President George H. W. Bush: 1924 – 2018
￼
 
On Thursday, December 6th, former President George H.W. Bush was laid to rest in Houston, Texas. This week, I joined a resolution that will be formally introduced in the coming days to honor his memory and service to the American people. He was a statesman, a patriot, and a family man. I admired President George H.W. Bush for the civility he displayed while he served his country. After President Bush’s unsuccessful reelection bid in 1992, he left the following note for the new President in the Oval Office which speaks to his character:

Todd County Farm Bureau

My staff aide Grant Herfindahl attended a Todd County Farm Bureau meeting in Browerville last Saturday. Bad weather prevented me from attending in person, so I spoke to the group over the phone about the progress that is being made to pass the Farm Bill. One of my top priorities for this farm bill is adding provisions to stem the loss of small dairy farms in my district. Hard-working dairy farmers need and deserve a better price insurance program than the Margin Protection Program (MPP) currently provides and new provisions in the 2018 Farm Bill will rework programs that help small and medium sized dairies. I also answered questions on topics including as suicide and opioid addiction, immigration reform, and Amish buggy safety.
 
Governor-Elect Tim Walz Visits Hallock
￼
 
My staff attended Governor-elect Tim Walz’s public listening session at Far North Distillery near Hallock this week. The participants had a range of issues to discuss related to agriculture. I look forward to working with my former colleague in addressing some of those issues in the new Farm Bill.
 
Northwest Regional Development Commission Meeting
￼
 
The Northwest Regional Development Commission hosted its annual meeting in East Grand Forks this week. My staff heard the Commission talk about their need to expand their senior assistance programs as rural populations age. This commission developed programs that service 21 Minnesota counties from Hallock to Hancock. For more information on the Commission’s programs for seniors, or to see if they serve your community, call 1-800-333-2433.
 
Highway 2 West Manufacturers

My staff aide LeRoy Stumpf attended the Highway 2 West Manufacturers meeting hosted by Textron Specialized Vehicles / Arctic Cat in Thief River Falls. David Towley from Bemidji State University discussed ways to develop a culture of safety leadership, and the other presentation was about changing the perception of manufacturing. Folks discussed ideas to encourage an interest in manufacturing because only 3% of our youth claim to see their future in manufacturing.

Agricultural Trade Projections for 2019
According to the USDA’s Economic Research Service, the U.S. consistently sells more farm goods than it purchases, but the outlook for 2019 indicates what could be the smallest surplus since 2007. The value of exports has increased since 2016, but the value of imports has risen at a slightly faster rate, leading to a declining trade balance. This is further compounded in Fiscal Year 2019 by significant declines in projected exports to China.

After moving to Minneapolis in 1869, he learned the flour-milling business and helped introduce roller mills that could crush Minnesota's spring wheat into high-grade bread flour. Upon his death in 1899, the Pillsbury-Washburn Flour Mills Company was the largest in the world.

This week in Congress
December 7, 2018

• Government funding extended 
• Seeking answers from the VA 
• Application deadline extended 
• Typhoon Yutu recovery updates
• Opportunities
• Legislative Highlights
 
 

Former President George H.W. Bush lay in state in the Rotunda of the United States Capitol this week. With other Members of Congress and thousands of the public, I paid my respects there to our 41st President, who is remembered as an unassuming man of the highest integrity and deepest patriotism. As Vice President, Bush visited Saipan in 1985, making him the highest-ranking U.S. government official ever to set foot in the Northern Marianas. He was laid to rest at the George Bush Presidential Library at Texas A&M University on Thursday.
 

Government funding extended

Congress enacted a two-week funding extension on Wednesday to cover the seven FY2019 appropriations bills still awaiting enactment. Friday, December 7, had been the deadline for action, but ceremonies at the Capitol surrounding the passing of former President George H.W. Bush gave a reason to delay until December 21. The real sticking point continues to be President Trump’s insistence on $5 billion for a border wall. Disaster relief for the Northern Marianas and those areas affected by Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the wildfires in California could also be acted upon -- a goal that I continue to work on in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle to address the post-Mangkhut/Yutu recovery needs of our islands. 
 

Seeking answers from the VA

On Friday, members of the House Committees on Veterans Affairs and Education and the Workforce asked Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie whether his department will make retroactive payments to student veterans affected by delays in implementing the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act. The Act, known as the Forever GI Bill, made two changes to the way the monthly housing allowance (MHA) is calculated for student veterans. One change requires the MHA be calculated based on the zip code of the campus where the student attends classes. The second change requires the MHA be based on the Department of Defense’s reduced basic allowance for housing (BAH). These provisions were to take effect on August 1, 2018. Issues with the VA computer system, however, delayed implementation until December 2019. In the interim, VA stated it would pay MHA rates at the uncapped DOD BAH rates and would eventually make back payments to student veterans who received less than required by the Forever GI Bill. Our letter points out that the VA is only addressing impacts of delaying the change in the MHA rate. Questions remain about how the agency will resolve underpayments to students who would have received a higher housing allowance under the Forever GI Bill calculation. And we want answers. 
 
 
 

Application deadline extended

Due to the devastation caused by typhoons Mangkhut and Yutu, and the ensuing power outages and extended school closures, we have decided to extend the deadline for aspiring young individuals to apply for a congressional nomination to the U.S. service academies. The new deadline is Friday, December 14, 2018. Young men and women who are interested in an exceptional college education at no cost and are committed to serving our country have seven additional days to apply. There are openings for appointees from the Northern Marianas at the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy, and the U.S. Military Academy for next year’s incoming class. As your Congressman, I may make nominations, but the final selection among nominees is made by academy admissions officials. They look for strong grades, high SAT or ACT scores, physical ability, and leadership potential. Service academy graduates receive an officer’s commission and must serve for five years. More information and an application form are available at https://sablan.house.gov/serving-you/academy-nominations, and at your local congressional office. 
 

Typhoon Yutu relief updates

Dear  , 
This week marked a solemn moment in history following the passing of President George H.W. Bush as we reflected on his lifetime of service to others. May his life and legacy guide us all in our commitment to those who we are elected to serve. Now as much as ever, I remain committed to my sworn duty to serve and represent the hardworking people of eastern Connecticut in Congress. 
Here with my weekly update on a few important issues from this week.

An Update for Homeowners with Crumbling Foundations 
Last week, the Connecticut Foundation Solutions Indemnity Company, or the “captive” insurance company, announced that they had received the first round of state bonding money to assist homeowners with crumbling foundations. This money will be used for homeowners to submit a claim which, if the captive approves, would allow the homeowner to receive financial assistance to pay for a crumbling foundation repair. 
This “milestone moment” is a step in the right direction and my office has been working closely with the captive and the State of Connecticut to make sure that this money is available as expeditiously as possible. It’s important to note that homeowners know that any remaining uninsured losses are still covered by the federal property casualty loss tax deduction that I helped to secure from the IRS.

Introducing CT-First 
On Monday, I was proud to join Heather Gates, president and CEO of CHR in Enfield to announce CT-First, an initiative created to address the high need for behavioral mental health services and addiction treatment in our communities. The program is made possible by a $4 million federal grant that will be used to enhance the services at CHR. The funding will enable them to earn certification as a community behavioral health clinic and expand access and services to people with substance abuse disorders. The clinic will have the resources to hire overnight staff, additional recovery coaches and implement critical programs that weren’t possible before this funding. Additionally, CHR will launch an agreement to liaison with the VA and other veterans groups to better provide care for veterans in our region in need of treatment. 
The addiction epidemic is national crisis that requires the attention of every level of our government. CT-First is a step that will make meaningful change in our communities, and I look forward to a continued partnership with CHR as we work towards improving access to mental health care at home and across the country.

Protect Yourself from Phishing Scams 
Approaching the holiday season, the IRS has reported a surge in email phishing scams, and it’s important to know how you can protect yourself from these unlawful solicitors. Phishing attacks will use email or fraudulent websites to solicit private and sensitive information by posing as the IRS. It’s important to remember the IRS doesn’t initiate spontaneous contact with taxpayers by email, and to remain vigilant if you receive an email with subjects like “IRS Important Notice” or “IRS Taxpayer Notice”. 
If you receive one of these emails, you can report it by forwarding it to phishing@irs.gov.

Dear Lindsey,  
Mourning a Humble Public Servant 
This week, Americans mourned the loss of former President George Herbert Walker Bush, who never tired in his dedication to our nation and his fellow Americans. From his heroic service during World War II to his time as Commander in Chief, he always put country first and is an example of a truly humble public servant. It was moving to pay my respects to President Bush as he lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda on Tuesday, and I was honored to attend his funeral at the National Cathedral on Wednesday, where I heard touching words and warm memories from his many friends and family. My parents hosted Mr. and Mrs. Bush at their home in New Hampshire on several occasions and I recall fondly the kindness and humor they both displayed. My heart goes out to the entire Bush family, who while grieving at this difficult time can be incredibly proud of the enduring legacy left by their beloved patriarch.

Remembering Pearl Harbor 
I was honored to join veterans and their families this morning to give remarks at the Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day Commemoration Ceremony at the New Hampshire Veterans Home. Seventy-seven years ago, our country was shocked and saddened by the horrific attack that took place at Pearl Harbor. We will never forget the valor and patriotism of the more than 2,300 sailors, soldiers and civilians who died on that terrible day, and we will forever honor the sacrifice of all our service members and their families.

Strengthening Workforce and Educational Opportunities  
It was great to see Congressman-Elect Chris Pappas and education and business leaders at the New Hampshire College and University Council’s (NHCUC) Forum on the Future in Manchester this morning, where I gave remarks on the deep connection between higher education and small business in the Granite State. I’m excited to continue my work in the new Congress to strengthen our workforce and educational opportunities in New Hampshire.  
￼

Increasing Accountability in Government 
I’m proud to join with my colleagues and Democracy Reform Task Force leader, Congressman John Sarbanes, to unveil H.R. 1, a package of legislation on voting rights, campaign finance and ethics reforms. We must increase accountability for elected officials, get dark money out of politics, and restore confidence in government. The American people deserve meaningful reform.  
Here to Serve You 
As your Representative, my most important responsibility is supporting Granite Staters when they need help with federal agencies. I was contacted by Robin Munson of Amherst, who had an issue of concern regarding a representative fee owed to her by the Social Security Administration (SSA). My staff worked with SSA and helped resolve Robin’s situation. If my office may be of assistance with a problem you are experiencing, please reach out to my staff at 603-226-1002 so we can learn how we may help.
As always, please do not hesitate to reach out to any of my offices if you have questions, concerns, or ideas. I love hearing from you! Thank you for everything you do to make New Hampshire such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise a family. Have a great weekend!
Sincerely,                                       ￼

Press Release of the Week [1 of 2]: A National Day of Mourning: Remembering George H.W. Bush
 
 
Rep. Loudermilk (R-GA) issued the following statement in honor of today’s National Day of Mourning in remembrance of former President George H.W. Bush: 

“Today marks a National Day of Mourning in remembrance of former President George H.W. Bush, but in reality we celebrate a man’s life spent dedicated to public service. From an early age, his life story almost reads like a great fiction novel. From the time he enlisted in the Navy as a young man, after the attack on Pearl Harbor during WWII, to his days spent dedicated to humanitarian efforts across the world after his political career, President Bush’s life is to be honored, studied, and celebrated.

Congressman Biggs, along with many of the cosponsors, released the following statements:

“It is the diplomatic right of any sovereign nation to choose where their capital is located; and, for 67 years, Israel has recognized Jerusalem as their capital. I applaud President Trump for moving the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem a year ago, and my good friend Rep. Andy Biggs for commemorating this seismic event between the United States and Israel.” – Congressman Barry Loudermilk (GA-11)

Remembering President George H.W. Bush
This week, the country said goodbye and celebrated the extraordinary life of President George H.W. Bush. 
President Bush was a true American patriot who leaves behind a distinguished legacy of statesmanship, kindness, and service. Tom and I join a grieving nation in mourning the loss of a life well-lived, and take solace that he is once again with his beloved Barbara. 
Throughout his life, President Bush committed himself to making our country better. In particular, I always enjoyed his self-deprecating humor and, on a personal level, my family is very grateful that he signed the Americans with Disabilities Act into law, making it much easier for families like ours and people who experience disabilities to be included in this country. 
President Bush was a man who got along with people even when they disagreed, he was a leader with the capacity to change his mind, and he believed in the possibility of compromise. I hope that his is an example we can all strive for as we honor his life and memory. He will be missed. 
With every good wish, 
￼ 
Senator Maggie Hassan 
What the Senator is Working On
Fighting for New Hampshire
Senator Hassan and Senator Shaheen introduced a bill to protect small businesses from burdensome internet sales tax collection requirements resulting from a recent Supreme Court ruling.

Senator Hassan, Senator Shaheen, and Congresswoman Shea-Porter also announced a grant for $7.5 million to rehabilitate the Main Wharf at the Portsmouth Market Street Marine Terminal.  This grant from the Department of Transportation will support Seacoast businesses and economy.  Both as Governor, and now as Senator, Senator Hassan fought for this much-needed funding. 
This week, Senator Hassan’s legislation to help the Department of Homeland Security better identify potential terrorist threats passed the Senate. Read more here. 
Senator Hassan introduced a bipartisan bill with Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) to encourage ethical hackers to come forward with information they find about vulnerabilities in our government networks.

77 Years Later 
￼ 
On this day in 1941, 2,403 Americans lost their lives in the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. 77 years later, we remember and honor their sacrifice. 
Remembering 41 
￼ 
This week, our nation observed a National Day of Mourning for the passing of President George Herbert Walker Bush. President Bush served this nation in a multitude of roles and always faithfully. From his military service during World War II, his service in Congress, his ambassadorship, his time leading the Central Intelligence Agency as Director, his service as Vice President, and finally his presidency, he dutifully faced many of the 20th Century challenges of our country. He leaves a legacy of public service. As Americans, we are grateful for the leadership his life demonstrated and that he is now reunited with his beloved Barbara. 
￼ 
President Bush was laid in state at the U.S. Capitol, and I was honored to pay my respects on behalf of Central Washington. 
The Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman Post Office Building 
￼ 
President Trump has signed H.R. 5504 into law, which officially designates the postal facility at 4801 West Van Giesen Street in West Richland as the ""Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman Post Office Building."" Sergeant Schmieman served in the U.S. Marine Corps 2nd Raider Battalion before he was killed in a plane crash on July 10, 2017. It is an honor to recognize Sergeant Schmieman for his honorable sacrifice. He served to protect our freedom, and I know this Post Office will mean a lot to his community as a reminder of his dedication to our country. Read more here. 
A Pivotal Step 
￼ 
Last week's signing of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) was a pivotal step to strengthen the trading relationship between the three nations. Yesterday, I met with the Canadian Consul General Brandon Lee and expressed my hope for ratification of the USMCA by Congress, as well as Canada's Parliament and Mexico's Congress. Even then - there will still be more work needed. We must return to the table with Mexico and Canada to resolve the ongoing matter of 232 steel and aluminum tariffs and the retaliatory tariffs on our agricultural products. 
Wallet Wise Winners 
￼ 
Congratulations to the 2018 winners of the Congressional App Challenge in Central Washington, Kennewick High School 11th graders, Nikhil Devanathan and Aiden Arends. Nikhil and Aid's winning app, Wallet Wise, creates realistic scenarios to encourage users to maintain a budget over a 12-month period. I am pressed by the technical know-how, creativity, and persistence demonstrated by everyone who submitted apps to this year's competition. Our high school students are the innovators tomorrow, and Central Washington can be proud to cultivate the success of these hard-working young people. Learn more about this year's winners and participants here, and click here for more information about the App Challenge.

George H.W. Bush
This week, we said farewell to former President George H.W. Bush. President Bush was an outstanding man and an honorable President. He will be remembered for being a war hero, a patriot, a family man, and someone who stood up for the values and ideals of our beautiful nation. 

41 was a pioneer of U.S. foreign policy, helping us shape and improve many of our relationships abroad. He helped bring an end to the Cold War and led us to victory in the Gulf War. He was bold, compassionate, and always put his country first. My deepest condolences and prayers go out to the Bush family for their loss. Rest in Peace 41.

LTC Apprenticeships
Last month, we recognized National Apprenticeship Week for its critical importance to educating young professionals on new and affordable career pathways and helping close the skills gap in Wisconsin and throughout the country. Institutions all across the United States have been implementing apprenticeships into their education programs in an effort to bring awareness to workforce training. 

Lakeshore Technical College (LTC), located in the Sixth District, currently serves 210 students in 10 different apprenticeship programs. Recently, LTC was named in the top three for Best Colleges for Adult Learners in the country. Their successful apprenticeship program is yet another achievement they can add to their list of accolades. Students that participate in apprenticeships through LTC are able to attend classes at LTC and participate in on-the-job training at work sites, all while still being paid by their employer.

In Congress, I have been working to bring more awareness to the value of apprenticeships. This past summer, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education Act for the 21st Century was signed into law to help bring support to workforce training programs such as apprenticeships. I cosponsored this legislation to help close the skills gap and open up more opportunities for workforce training programs in the Sixth District. Click here to read the article written by LTC President Paul Carlsen and to learn more about LTC's progress.            

Income Growth
Incomes throughout Wisconsin are on the rise and poverty levels have shrunk over recent years as the robust economy has provided Wisconsinites with a boost. Recent data published by the U.S. Census Bureau cites that household incomes in the majority of Wisconsin counties has risen in the past couple years. 

Additionally, 13 counties reported a positive change in poverty rates as many Wisconsinites who were once in dire straits have recovered in recent years thanks to an economy that has brought jobs back to the United States in record levels. Over the past few years, median household income increased by an average of about $3,200 in 15 of the state's 72 counties, while 69 counties saw a decline in the family poverty rate. 

Its great to see an economy that is repaying Wisconsinites for their hard work.

Dear Neighbor,
We care about ensuring America is able to lead the world in the next generation of clean energy technology in order to combat our world’s changing climate.
There are currently too many financial barriers for a new technology or company to break into the market – hindering American ingenuity and goal of clean energy dominance.   To remedy this we introduced the Energy Sector Innovation Credit Act.
This bill will:
	•	Stop picking winners and losers in the energy sector by rewarding one form of technology over the other.
	•	Guarantee the tax credit is phased out over time to prevent taxpayers from propping up unprofitable or inefficient energy technologies. The tax credit also scales down as production scales up.
	•	Reward efficiency as the tax credit is only applied to the value of the energy when it is sold, so unneeded power is not financially rewarded.
	•	Ensure energy technologies cannot double dip by claiming existing incentives along with this proposed tax credit.
By ensuring our energy innovation is fast, disruptive, cutting-edge and good for consumers, we will be the leader in clean energy globally.
As always, please reach out to our office if you need assistance. Our door is always open.
Until next time,
￼
Tom

Happy Friday –  
It’s that time of the week once again. I’m wrapping up my work in D.C. and preparing to head home to Arizona’s Fifth District for a couple of days. I’m so grateful for the opportunity to serve our district, but I can’t wait to come home – especially for some warmer weather.
Commemorating the American-Israeli Alliance 
￼ 
This week, I led a House resolution, cosponsored by 42 members, to commemorate the one-year anniversary of President Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. See the press release with quotes from many of the members who signed onto this resolution.  
I also wrote an op-ed, published in the Times of Israel, to celebrate the spirit of the anniversary. Click this link to read.  
This milestone signifies our commitment to our ally. I thank my many colleagues who joined me in this resolution. 
Listen - New Podcast Episode 
￼ 
I was pleased to interview the Founding Editor of the Times of Israel, David Horovitz, for the podcast this week. David had some terrific insight into the American-Israeli alliance, as well as the political and geographical realities facing Israel at this time. Click the logo above or this link to listen to a fantastic interview. 
In Memory of President George H.W. Bush 
￼ 
This week, our nation mourned the loss of our 41st President, George H.W. Bush. Earlier in the week, President Bush was laid in state under the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol, where I had the opportunity to pay my respects to this man.  
Listening to Mr. Comey 
￼ 
Before James Comey’s deposition before the House Judiciary Committee today, I wrote an op-ed for Fox News on the importance of his appearance. He is the heart of the anti-Trump, Mueller investigation, and Congress deserves answers to the questions we have for him. Read the piece here. 
Thank You, Chairman Smith 
￼ 
I’ve had the honor of serving with House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology Chairman Lamar Smith during the 115th Congress. He is retiring after this year, and his presence in this body will be dearly missed. I attended the unveiling of his portrait earlier in the week.
Happy Hanukkah 
￼ 
To all celebrating this week in Arizona’s Fifth District, Happy Hanukkah! I was privileged to join many in the East Valley on Monday night to celebrate the significance of this week.
Thank You for Your Service 
￼ 
It was an honor to help send off the U.S. Army Reserve’s 98th Expeditionary Signal Battalion on Sunday. I enjoyed meeting our country’s brave men and women. Thank you for your service! We are praying for your safe return.
Merry Christmas from the U.S. Capitol 
￼ 
The Capitol Christmas tree was lit last night. I attended the short tree-lighting ceremony with other Members of Congress and our families.

12/7/18 16:28,Helping veterans grow their small businesses,"￼
Hi there,
I wanted to send you an update that our bill to strengthen veteran-owned small businesses unanimously passed the Senate! I'm excited about this, especially for the tens of thousands of veteran-owned small businesses in Virginia that could benefit.   This bill would allow veterans who own small businesses to acquire property and equipment that the government no longer has a use for by adding veterans to the list of those who are eligible for federal surplus personal property, which already includes women and minority small business owners.    You can read more about the bill here >>  This will help veteran entrepreneurs grow their businesses, create jobs, and lower costs. We owe the brave men and women who have tirelessly served our nation our support as they transition to civilian life.      
Sincerely,

Dear Friend,   
At President George H.W. Bush's home in Kennebunkport, Maine, there is a sign with four letters: C-A-V-U.  Aviators know what this means.  Ceiling and Visibility Unlimited. 
As the country mourned the loss of our 41st President this week, perhaps we learned more about the remarkable life of George H.W. Bush than during his presidency.  There was a sense in America during his tenure that he came from an elite life of privilege.  That perception in no way captures the fullness of this man’s journey. 
The President began his adult life as a college student at Yale.  A star baseball player and high-achiever, a certain unlimited horizon was before him.  But he chose to leave Yale and enlisted on his 18th birthday to serve in WWII. 
He joined the Navy and became a fighter pilot.  On a mission to destroy a Japanese radio tower, his plane was hit by flak.  With fire sweeping over the wings, he kept flying, dropped his bombs, and turned back over the ocean.  Ordering his crew to hit the silk, he dipped the plane to allow their escape before he jettisoned himself.  As the wind caught him, he gashed his head on the tail of the plane and plunged towards the sea.  Exhausted and bleeding, he climbed onto a raft.  Remarkably, a submarine spotted him, and he was rescued.  None of his other crew survived.   At his funeral, it was remarked that he often asked why he was spared, and his crewmen were not.  He wanted to live a life worthy of their sacrifice.  The war over, he left behind other options on Wall Street, and he and Barbara moved the family to Texas to make their way in the oil business.
As I sat during the funeral at the Washington National Cathedral, a faith-based liturgy based upon the Christian tradition of the Bush family, I had these reflections: “The music is beautiful, timeless, and triumphant, bespeaking of nobility.  America is gritty, tough, but the death of a President reminds us of our capacity for sacrifice and beauty.""  The author of his biography, Jon Meacham, remarked that President Bush was the ""last great soldier-statesman...a founding father of the 20th century,” who would say, “Tell the truth, don't blame people...stay the course.""  Former Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson added, “Loyalty--it coursed through his blood.  Loyalty to his country…loyalty to his friends.""  His son President George W. Bush said that he taught the family that public service was noble and necessary.
The night before the funeral, I went to the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol to pay my respects to the President as he lay in state.  I just happened to go at a time when the Bush family was entering. Security had cleared the area so that the family could have a private moment.  However, President George W. Bush insisted, “No, let the public stay.”  The family greeted everyone present. The President shared some kind words with me, and then he looked at us and said, “Don’t cry. If you cry, I’ll cry.”   That moment captured the moving duality of the funeral.  There was a formality, dignity, and reverence, as world leaders and five Presidents gathered to pay their respects.  The music soared, prayers lifted.  But it was also intimate and personal.  A family grieved the loss of their father, and friends told of their close relationship—an American public liturgy.   
Although his presidency was only one term, upon reflection, some incredible things happened during that period of time.  The First Gulf War was executed with absolute precision through an impressive international coalition of the willing and with minimal loss for America.  The Berlin Wall fell.  He signed the Clean Water Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
Comedian Dana Carvey hilariously caricatured him (they also became friends), mocking the expressions “thousand points of light” and “stay the course.”  Maybe we didn’t fully understand back then.  Now we do.
Stay the course.  Be one of the Thousand Points of Light.  Ceiling and Visibility Unlimited. 
   Sincerely, ￼  Congressman Jeff Fortenberry

 Visiting Montana Soldiers Deployed to Afghanistan
￼ WATCH highlights from my visit to Afghanistan
As a member of the Defense Appropriations subcommittee, I recently traveled to Bagram Air Field to visit with deployed soldiers from the Montana National Guard and to receive an update on U.S. progress in Afghanistan. The 495th Combat Sustainment and Support Battalion, headquartered in Kalispell, has almost 70 men and women forward deployed and is helping to protect our national security as part of Operation Freedom’s Sentinel and the NATO Resolute Support mission.  It was a great honor to spend a few hours with these brave soldiers, and to bring them a small taste of Montana ahead of the Christmas season. Each soldier received a challenge coin, a bag of beef jerky from Bozeman, and fresh homemade cookies. During our time together, the troops shared their experiences thus far—mission successes in every part of the country, as well as a few personal anecdotes from the recent Brawl of the Wild.  During our trip, I also had a chance to speak with the allied Commander in Afghanistan, General Austin Miller. General Miller conveyed a clear message that terrorists groups such as Al Qaeda and ISIS would be able to strike the United States homeland, were it not for our forward deployed forces. The U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, John Bass, also shared these concerns, and discussed the Administration’s efforts to facilitate a peaceful settlement in the country.  I will continue working to ensure that our men and women in uniform are equipped with all of the necessary resources to be victorious through overwhelming force against those who would do us harm. Thank you to all of our service members and veterans for your selfless sacrifices to this great nation.   Please share your thoughts.
Best Wishes, 
￼
Steve Daines United States Senate

Dear Friend, 
This week, I joined my colleagues in the Capitol Rotunda and at Washington’s National Cathedral, and a nation in mourning, to pay my respects to the late President George H. W. Bush. I also led a letter with 96 of my colleagues urging the House Committee on Education and the Workforce to act swiftly to investigate, address and hold a hearing to review allegations of pregnancy discrimination at the Memphis XPO Logistics warehouse and usher in national legislation to protect pregnant workers, wrote to the federal regulator of motor coaches after Monday’s fatal accident involving an Orange Mound youth football team, noted that the December 15 deadline is looming for signing up for coverage at HealthCare.gov, participated in the Judiciary Committee’s deposition of former FBI Director James Comey, remembered Creole Chef Gary Williams, noted the passing of Collierville Municipal Judge William Craig Hall, announced a $11.8 million grant for Head Start, scheduled four appearances on MSNBC, moved my Washington office, offered Capitol Historical Society 2019 calendars and made a health tip about getting a timely flu shot. Keep reading to learn more about my week and follow me on Twitter and Facebookto see more updates as they happen.    
Paying Respects to the Late President George H. W. Bush  Calling for Hearing on XPO Logistics Labor Practices  Seeking answers about Fatal Bus Crash in Arkansas  Flagging Open Enrollment Now Available at HealthCare.gov   Questioning former FBI Director Comey  Remembering Creole Soul Food Chef Gary Williams  Noting the Passing of Collierville Municipal Judge William Craig Hall  Announcing $11.8 Million Head Start Grant  Appearing on MSNBC Tonight, Saturday, Sunday and Monday  Moving My Washington Office   Offering U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars    Signing Up for “Congress On Your Corner” and this e-Newsletter   Weekly Health Tip   Quote of the Week  


Paying Respects to the Late President George H. W. Bush 
On Monday, I joined my colleagues in the Capitol Rotunda to pay my respects to President George H.W. Bush and, on Wednesday, I attended his state funeral at Washington’s National Cathedral. President Bush presided over the end of the Cold War, expelled the Iraqi army from Kuwait, signed the Americans with Disabilities Act and Clean Air Act, and upheld the traditions and expectations of his high office with dignity and grace. The World War II fighter pilot, Congressman, Ambassador, CIA Director, Vice President and President served his country with distinction. The last of the “greatest generation” presidents, he volunteered for service in World War II and was the country’s youngest Naval aviator. At the funeral, I had the opportunity to talk with former Vice President Al Gore about his experience as an investigative reporter at The Tennessean, and to my Congressional Class of 2006 colleague Gabby Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly. I suspect President Bush, known for his compassion, visited with Gabby during her long convalescence in Houston after the assassination attempt in 2011. President Bush’s 1989 visit to Memphis and speech from the front lawn of The Commercial Appeal on Union will be long remembered.His was a life well lived. 
Calling for Hearing and Investigation into XPO Logistics Labor Practices 
￼ 
On Tuesday, my colleague Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and I, joined by another 95 members of Congress, urged the House Committee on Education and the Workforce to hold a hearing on alleged unfair labor practices, including pregnancy discrimination, of XPO Logistics, which operates in Memphis and in 22 other states. Many of the allegations featured in a New York Times expose occurred in Memphis and were brought to my attention by employees who came to my office. In our letter, we asked the committee to consider national legislation to protect pregnant workers such as the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. Shortly after releasing our letter, XPO Logistics announced it was undertaking an independent investigation of recent complaints and implementing a new policy toward pregnant employees. This appears to be a step in the right direction but I intend to continue closely monitoring progress on this issue to ensure the company’s proposals are implemented and that Congress enacts laws to prevent future pregnancy discrimination. 
Seeking Answers about Fatal Bus Crash in Arkansas 
On Monday morning, I learned about the terrible accident that took the life of 9-year-old Kameron Johnson and injured more than 40 other children returning home to Memphis from a youth football game in Texas. I wrote to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which regulates motor coach transportation to ask for details about its oversight of the bus company. I also expressed my condolences to Kameron’s family and my hope for a speedy recovery for all those injured and their loved ones.  
Flagging Open Enrollment Now Available at HealthCare.gov   
￼  
Open enrollment for 2019 HealthCare.gov insurance plans is now under way. This year, open enrollment runs only through December 15, a week from tomorrow. I will be making use of every possible means to make my constituents aware that the time available to sign up has been limited again this year compared to the enrollment periods during the Obama Administration -- six weeks shorter than it was in 2016. Listen for my public service radio announcement that encourages signing up. For more information on signing up for health care, see Healthcare.gov.    
Questioning former FBI Director Comey 
￼
On Friday, the Republican Majority still in control of the House Judiciary Committee held a last-chance hearing behind closed doors at which just a few members questioned former FBI Director James Comey. Director Comey was consistently professional and fulsome and answered my questions. In January, under new leadership, you can expect the Committee on which I serve as a senior member to conduct substantive oversight of the Trump administration and fulfill duties it has been shirking.  
Remembering Creole Soul Food Chef Gary Williams 
I was saddened to learn of Chef Gary Williams’ passing on Thursday. Williams, a New Orleans native, was one of Memphis’ renowned chefs, known for his gumbo, crawfish etouffee, catfish with grits and greens and for his engaging smile as he worked the kitchens and glad-handed diners at his DejaVu and Krewe of DeJavu eateries. He loved Memphis and Memphis loved him back.  
Noting the Passing of Collierville Municipal Judge William Craig Hall 
On Sunday, longtime Collierville Municipal Judge and lifelong Collierville resident William Craig Hall passed. Judge Hall was my classmate in law school, was always fair-minded and he was a heck of a nice guy. I extend my sincere condolences to his family, his many friends and to the people of Collierville whose lives he touched.  
Announcing $11.8 Million Head Start Grant 
￼ 
I was pleased to announce on Thursday a Department of Health and Human Services grant of $11.8 million to the Shelby County Board of Education for its Head Start programs. Head Start is one of the best programs for young children whose parents have limited means. Its proven record shows it gives these children a shot at the American Dream.
Appearing on MSNBC Tonight, Saturday, Sunday and Monday 
I am scheduled to appear on MSNBC four times in the next four days. I'll be on ""The Last Word"" with Lawrence O'Donnell tonight at 9 p.m., ""AM Joy"" with Jonathan Capehart at 10 a.m. on Saturday, ""Live with Alex Witt"" at 11 a.m. on Sunday and again on ""The Last Word"" at 9 p.m. on Monday.  
Moving My Washington Office  
This week, I moved from the fourth floor to the first floor of the Rayburn House Office Building. Seniority has its advantages and the new office, at 2104 Rayburn, will be more convenient for visiting constituents. My phone number remains the same: (202) 225-3265. 
Offering U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars   
￼  
My office has a limited number of 2019 U.S. Capitol Historical Society calendars available. If you would like to receive a calendar, please complete this form on my website. Due to the rules of the House, I can mail calendars only to residents of Tennessee’s 9th Congressional District. Please feel free to share this email with other residents of the 9th District who may be interested in receiving one but who do not receive my e-Newsletter.   
Signing Up for “Congress On Your Corner” and this e-Newsletter   
￼   
I enjoy meeting regularly with constituents in the district and helping get answers for them to questions about dealing with federal agencies. If you are interested in attending one of my “Congress on Your Corner” events, you can sign up hereto receive notification as soon as the next event is scheduled.   
For those who haven’t participated in a telephone town hall, it’s easy to sign up for them by using this form.     
If you would like to receive this weekly e-Newsletter, or share it with others, you can do that with this form.   
Weekly Health Tip 
￼  
Each week, I share a health tip in the hope of promoting a healthy lifestyle for residents of the 9th Congressional District. As always, it is best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine or lifestyle.   
This week is National Influenza Vaccination Week which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established to remind people of how important it is to get vaccinated against the flu during the holiday season and that there’s still time to get your flu shot this year. I’ve gotten mine. So far this flu season, rates of flu-like illness remain low but the CDC still encourages flu shots since the flu kills tens of thousands every year.  You can view the CDC’s flu shot recommendations here. Use this CDC tool to review surveillance reports for flu cases and to find a location in your neighborhood where you can get vaccinated. 
Quote of the Week  
￼  
“We're a nation of community, of thousands and tens of thousands of ethnic, religious, social, business, labor union, neighborhood, regional and other organizations, all of them varied, voluntary and unique. This is America: the Knights of Columbus, the Grange, Hadassah, the Disabled American Veterans, the Order of Ahepa, the Business and Professional Women of America, the union hall, the Bible study group, LULAC, ‘Holy Name’ — a brilliant diversity spread like stars, like a thousand points of light in a broad and peaceful sky.” -- George H. W. Bush, accepting the Presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention in New Orleans, August 18, 1988  
As always, I remain Most sincerely,

￼   ￼ ￼ 
￼ 
Friends,
This week our country lost a patriot and dedicated civil servant. President George H.W. Bush, from his service as a Navy pilot in 1941 to his time in the oval office, was a statesman through and through.  
￼ 
He was a gracious man, and his service to his country will never be forgotten. It has been a somber week on the Hill, but Laina and I were humbled to have the opportunity to pay our respects to President George H.W. Bush and attend his service in D.C. on Wednesday.

One thing this week reminded me is that when we pass, it is not where we stood on a particular issue that will be remembered. Rather, we will be remembered for how we treated others and how we made them feel. It is evident to any student of history that President Bush will be named among an exceptional class of statesmen who will be remembered for their character rather than their title.

Fighting for Farmers
￼ 
(Click the photo above to watch my reaction to the 90-day trade truce) 
China has long not played by the rules, and it’s about time that they start. They reject loads of sorghum and wheat for arbitrary reasons. For 14 years they’ve kept US beef out of their market for no reason, while they exceed their legal level of subsidies by $100 billion in support to their farmers.
I am hopeful that this 90day period will allow us to restructure the way we trade with China and level the playing field. 
But the real test will be what comes from these negotiations in the next 90 days, and if we can hold China accountable to an agreement. My track coach always used to say, “don’t tell me, show me,” and so far, we’ve gotten a lot of talk from China, but very little actual change. 
I think the White House has heard our farmers loud and clear that, while they support holding China accountable, we need to be moving towards an agreement. Farm bankruptcies in Kansas are up a multiple of six just in the last three years. Farm country needs stability and certainty out of this trade agreement
  

Pentagon Community Partnership
Program
￼
This week Fort Riley and the City of Manhattan were honored at the 2018 Army Community Partnership Awards. Fort Riley’s partnership with the City of Manhattan was one of seven U.S. Army installations and neighboring communities that were awarded for their partnership that enhanced Army readiness, modernized Army processes, and improved business reform while building strong community relationships.
Fort Riley and the City of Manhattan received the award for their Intergovernmental Support Agreement for the bulk purchasing of road salt utilized during severe weather. Not only will this arrangement benefit the Flint Hills region, but will also save Fort Riley roughly $90,000 annually. 
I was proud to attend the award ceremony at the Pentagon.

Meeting with 
Army Leaders
On Thursday, I addressed a group of Army Senior Sergeants Major who were visiting Capitol Hill as part of their professional military education. They traveled to D.C. to further understand the relationship between Congress and the Army and how that relationship translates into their current position.   
It was my honor to discuss the role our office has in working with the military, and the way Congress works with military leadership to ensure they have the tools necessary for the US to remain strong and our citizens safe here at home and abroad. It’s important to also recognize these fine men and women and their decades of service. These are some of the best and brightest men and women when it comes to national security, generally taking 20 years of service to attain this rank. The men and women I met with have been proven great leaders, and it was such a privilege to sit down with them and thank them for their service and discuss the significant opportunity they have in helping shape policy.

 
 Honoring the Apollo 8 Mission 
I also had the unique opportunity to meet and learn from some of my childhood heroes this week. The Cosmosphere, in Hutchinson, hosted NASA astronauts and mission control staff as part of its EarthRising Celebration, honoring the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo 8 Mission to the Moon. I had the distinct pleasure of helping to welcome NASA officials to Kansas and hear from them on the success and challenges of the Apollo 8 mission as well as celebrate the continued success of The Cosmosphere.
￼ 
The Cosmosphere not only preserves NASA and space exploration history but works to spread the love of space and science to students across the state. The center recently received a federal grant to take its mission control consoles to Smithsonian affiliate museums, schools and Challenger centers through 2019 to allow students a hands-on learning opportunity and insight in the world of space exploration. 
  

TUNE IN: Army v. Navy
￼
Tomorrow Army and Navy will face off in their 119thannual football game. The longstanding rivalry will start at 2:00 PM CT on CBS, and this year Army will be sporting the Big Red One patch. Army will be playing in uniforms that pay tribute to the WWI soldiers of the 1stInfantry Division, and I couldn’t be prouder to see the Big Red One displayed on the field. 
Go Army, Beat Navy! 
  

A Day That Shall Live In Infamy
  
￼ 
As you know, today is the anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. On December 7th 1941, the Japanese attacked the U.S. Naval Base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. On that day, 21 U.S. ships were sunk/severely damaged, over 188 U.S. aircraft destroyed, and most importantly we lost more than 2,400 American lives. Today, 77 years later, we come together to honor those service members and civilians that lost their lives in the horrific attack on our nation. 
  
To many, this devastating attack feels like yesterday. 
  
Hunting season is in full swing
I was able to get a full day of hunting in with my son-in-law and a couple of my friends last weekend. Many of you know how much I love to hunt and fish, and it was great to be back in Kansas doing what I love best, enjoying the beautiful outdoors and putting down a record number of mallards.

Long’s Short Report – Protecting Table Rock Lake homeowners with a common-sense solution
By: U.S. Rep. Billy Long
Ever since Table Rock Lake began filling in 1958, land owners have been building permanent structures near the water. Now, 60 years later, the Army Corps of Engineers has changed boundary lines, adversely affecting these improvements, some of which are 60 years old. These changes are affecting homeowners and businesses, but I’m hard pressed to see how these structures that have stood the test of time have now been deemed injurious to the lake and need to be removed before mowing and dock permits can be renewed or title to real property can be transferred upon sale. Property owners are being required to remove essential structures such as retaining walls, steps and decks on their land. Again, we’re talking about retaining walls that have been there 40, 50 or 60 years in some cases. The Corps is denying homeowners and businesses necessary permit renewals for mowing or dock slips to try and force removal of these structures. The issue, however, is that many of these structures are essential to these homes. Removing these structures in some instances would not even be feasible and in some cases impossible.
The most common complaint I get from homeowners is how many of these so-called “issues” were never issues in the past while permits were routinely approved by the Corps for decades. Property owners around the lake who purchased their homes years ago had no difficulty applying for permit renewals on a routine basis. Now, however, homeowners that are trying to update or sell their homes or apply for standard permit renewals are shocked to learn the Corps is requiring these essential structures be removed before they can close on the sale of their real estate or renew dock and mowing permits.
The Corps has their job to do, and over the years have done an excellent job of managing a myriad of priorities for the lake. Public relations, however, has never been their strong suit, and I’m always flummoxed as to why. When the Corps comes to see me I always say, “How can I and my constituents develop a better relationship with you?” As one of one my predecessors, Congressman Mel Hancock, often said, “People should thank me more for the bills we don’t pass than for the ones we do.”  With that caveat, it’s with strong regret that I believe the only common-sense solution to this problem, that affects so many of my constituents, is legislative action.
After months of discussions, I recently introduced a bill, H.R. 7126, that would protect homeowners on the lake from being forced to remove their existing structures. Specifically, this bill would grandfather certain structures that were in place before the finalization of the last Table Rock Lake Shoreline Master Plan in 1976. It would also guarantee the property owners the necessary amount of land to keep their structures and prohibit the Corps from taking these structures into account when issuing permits for their property.
As I’ve always believed, it makes no sense to force homeowners to remove these essential structures that have been in place for decades. The most commented upon item in my Washington office is a simple sign that reads, “Bring Back Common Sense.” H.R. 7126 would be a common-sense solution that I will work hard to ensure is passed.

Senator Collins Delivers Remarks at BIW’s Start of Fabrication for the Future USS Patrick Gallagher
￼
U.S. Senator Susan Collins delivered remarks and joined in cutting the first piece of steel at the start of fabrication ceremony for the USS Patrick Gallagher (DDG 127).  The event took place at BIW’s Hardings Fabrication facility in Brunswick.   
￼
Introducing Senator Collins, BIW President Dirk Lesko told the gathering that she was instrumental in securing funding for DDG 127. “From her influential position on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Collins gained nearly $1.5 billion needed to fully fund this ship,” he said.   “It is so exciting to be part of the front end of a long and challenging process that defines why ‘Bath built is best built’ is not just a slogan, but a way of life,"" said Senator Collins during her remarks.  ""And just as with your co-workers at Bath, your skill, commitment to excellence, and perhaps most important, your hearts, go into every ship that begins here.""    In March, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Richard V. Spencer announced that DDG 127 would be named after Lance Cpl. Patrick “Bob” Gallagher. 
￼
Lance Cpl. Gallagher immigrated to the United States from Ireland in 1962 and joined the Marine Corps in 1966, where he served in the 3rd Marine Division in South Vietnam.  He was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions on July 18, 1966, when he selflessly threw his body on an incoming grenade, shielding his fellow Marines.  He was able to throw the grenade away from his unit before it exploded.  Lance Cpl. Gallagher was killed in action one year later on March 30, 1967.     “Navy ships sail the globe and, where necessary, sail into battle.  They demonstrate the strength of American power and resolve.  It is fitting, therefore, that our ships bear the names of individuals who have displayed uncommon valor, notable commitment, unwavering sacrifice, and extraordinary service in support of these missions,” Senator Collins continued.  “I am certain that the namesake of DDG 127, Lance Corporal Patrick Gallagher, will inspire you as you build this magnificent ship in his honor.” 
￼ 
Endocrine Society Recognizes Senator Collins with Diabetes Champion Award
￼ 
On World Diabetes Day, Senator Collins received the Endocrine Society’s Diabetes Champion Award for her work to promote research and prevention efforts on behalf of those with diabetes.  Senator Collins is the co-chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus.  “On behalf of the Endocrine Society, we wanted to thank you for all your support—and everything you’ve done—to help patients with diabetes and advance the field of endocrinology,” said Dr. Rob Lash, the Chief Professional and Clinical Affairs Officer of the Endocrine Society.  “This is actually our first Diabetes Champion Award.  It’s because you and the other leaders of the Congressional Diabetes Caucus have been so outstanding working in a bipartisan way to make this happen,” added Mila Becker, the Chief Policy Officer of the Endocrine Society.  “And we are so grateful that you were able to reauthorize the Special Diabetes Program.”  Senator Collins worked with her colleagues to secure language reauthorizing the Special Diabetes Program in a government funding bill earlier this year.  A number of notable developments can be attributed to the Special Diabetes Program, including progress on an artificial pancreas system, which will reduce costly and burdensome diabetes complications and improve quality of life for those with the disease, and other cutting-edge research promising to change the future of diabetes.

At New Balance in Norridgewock, Senators Collins and King and Representative Poliquin Celebrate New Defense Contract Supporting Hundreds of Maine Jobs
￼
Senators Susan Collins and Angus King and Representative Bruce Poliquin visited the New Balance plant in Norridgewock in celebration of New Balance’s new contract with the U.S. military to produce athletic footwear for our military recruits domestically.  The Senators and Representative toured the production line and congratulated New Balance employees and leadership.  Senators Collins and King and Representative Poliquin played a pivotal role in making the contract possible by securing language in the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act requiring the Pentagon to consider athletic footwear subject to the Berry Amendment, which states that the U.S. military must purchase 100% American-made gear when possible.  “The men and women of America’s armed forces exemplify the best of our nation’s values, and the men and women of New Balance exemplify the best of our nation’s manufacturing heritage,” said Senator Collins.  “I am so proud of the hardworking New Balance employees in Skowhegan, Norway, and Norridgewock who have kept the ‘Made in America’ label alive and well in the footwear industry and have proven that there is no challenge that American workers cannot meet.”  Click HERE to learn more.

Ribbon Cutting Ceremony at Front Street Shipyard in Belfast
￼
Front Street Shipyard held a ribbon cutting ceremony for Building 6, the company’s new 22,000 square foot facility.  Senator Collins congratulated the company’s leadership and employees and received a tour of the addition to the yard.   “My partners, employees, and I are all grateful to everyone who’s made Front Street Shipyard's growth possible since we started the yard in 2011,” said JB Turner, president and general manager of Front Street Shipyard.  “We’ve had help from the Belfast City Council, Androscoggin Bank, MTI, and SBA to secure the land and funding for our new building. And we’ve had tremendous support from Senator Collins in finding both regional and federal resources to develop our business and grow our team of craftspeople.  We hope to give back to Maine’s economy by helping to establish our state as a globally recognized destination for yachts and their crews.”   Established in 2011, Front Street Shipyard’s team of more than 100 experienced boat service professionals use both advanced composite construction and traditional boat building techniques. 
￼
Recognizing Home Care & Hospice Month at MaineGeneral in Augusta
￼ 
November was Home Care & Hospice Month, a time to honor nurses, home care aides, and other medical professionals who make a difference in the lives of patients and their families every day.  Senator Collins, the Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, delivered the keynote address at an event hosted by MaineGeneral HomeCare & Hospice to recognize its skilled, dedicated staff.  MaineGeneral currently employs more than 200 individuals who care for more than 700 patients daily.    “MaineGeneral HomeCare & Hospice delivers exceptional care every day – to hundreds of patients a day,” said MaineGeneral Health President & CEO, Chuck Hays. “Our staff is committed to providing the best patient-centered services possible, helping patients stay in their homes where they want to be.  This is an outstanding team and we’re pleased to have Senator Collins join us to honor our employees for their hard work, long hours, long distances travelled, and most importantly, for their dedication to providing compassionate, skilled care.”  Click HERE to learn more.

Sanford Rug Manufacturer’s Trade Application Approved Following Advocacy from Congressional Delegation, Paving Way for Expansion and Job Growth
Maine’s Congressional Delegation applauded a decision by the Foreign-Trade Zones (FTZ) Board to provide a tariff exemption for Sanford-based Flemish Master Weavers, one of Southern Maine’s largest manufacturing employers.  Senators Collins and King and Representatives Pingree and Poliquin strongly pushed for the tariff exemption on yarn the company uses to produce area rugs, which will help it compete against foreign businesses.  In November 2016, Maine’s Congressional Delegation sent a letter to the FTZ Board calling for the approval of the company’s application.    Johan Moulin, the President of Flemish Master Weavers, said, “This Board approval of our application to keep rug production in Maine resulted from more than three years of intense work by our Senators and Representatives, the Governor, the City of Waterville, the Central Maine Growth Council, our attorney and consulting firm and many others…In this time of political division, all of them strove together to achieve a positive result for the people of Maine as well as for Flemish Master Weavers.”   Flemish Master Weavers has eleven high-speed looms and fully automated packing and finishing operations. The positive decision by the FTZ Board could allow the company to increase employment as part of a 72,000 square foot building expansion.   Click HERE to read more.

Senator Collins Applauds Significant Decline in Veteran Homelessness
The number of veterans experiencing homelessness in 2018 decreased by 5.4 percent since last year according to a study released by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  HUD also reported a nearly 10 percent decline among female veterans experiencing homelessness.    The findings build on an encouraging decline in veteran homelessness that is largely attributed to the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program.  As the Chairman of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee and a member of the subcommittee that funds the Department of Veterans Affairs, Senator Collins has fought to ensure continued funding for veterans homelessness programs, including the HUD-VASH program.     “Veterans have sacrificed so much to protect our freedoms, and we have a duty to provide these courageous men and women with the benefits and resources they have earned through their service,” said Senator Collins.  “We must continue to build on the tremendous progress we have made to ensure that in the land of the free, there will always be a home for the brave.”   Since 2008, more than 90,000 VASH vouchers have been awarded, including 238 vouchers in Maine.  As a result of Senator Collins’ efforts, homelessness among veterans has declined 48.9 percent since 2008.￼

Vermont High School Students Invited to Share Their Views on the 'State of the Union'

￼

In January, the president will give his State of the Union speech to Congress, to outline his priorities for the coming year. And for the ninth year, I am inviting Vermont high school students to submit short essays describing what they think are the most pressing issues facing our country, and what they would do to solve those issues. I am always very impressed with the thoughtful essays that are submitted on a variety of topics and from different viewpoints. I will invite the twenty finalists to join me for a lively roundtable discussion at the Vermont Statehouse, and will enter their essays into the Congressional Record – the official archive of Congress. The deadline to submit an essay is January 9, 2019. I hope you consider writing an essay!

A Crisis in Child Care

￼

Parents in Vermont and throughout our country struggle to find high-quality and affordable child care, especially in rural areas. Without decent child care options, the very idea of economic opportunity is an illusion, as many parents cannot join the workforce or continue their education. And yet, three out of four parents in Vermont say they cannot find or cannot afford child care. It is long past time to join much of the rest of the world and provide universal access to high-quality and affordable child care. Taking care of children and providing options for parents must be one of our very top priorities as a nation. And to do that, we need a well-trained and well-paid child care workforce.

The Trump Administration Must Provide Student Debt Relief, as Promised 

Congress passed the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program specifically to make college more affordable for people who dedicate themselves to public service after graduating. The program was supposed to benefit people who become teachers, first responders, service members and other occupations that serve our communities. Instead, nearly 90 percent of people who applied for relief have been denied. That is unacceptable. Our job is to make sure that everyone who is eligible for this program receives the debt forgiveness they have earned. I have urged the Department of Education to do exactly that. I am enormously frustrated that Trump’s Department of Education has reduced oversight of the companies that receive nearly $1 billion in taxpayer funding each year to service those loans. Our job must be to make college more affordable, not pad the pockets of companies making huge profits on the backs of students.

Keeping Vermonters Warm This Winter

￼

Many Vermonters are wondering how they will keep their homes warm this winter. While federally funded fuel assistance is critically important, there simply isn’t enough help for everyone who needs it. That’s why the United Way of Lamoille County’s Firewood Project is so inspiring. The Firewood Project brings together community volunteers to cut, split and deliver free fire wood to those who need it most. This is an innovative way to stretch limited fuel assistance dollars, and to make sure Vermonters can heat their homes throughout the winter months.

Vermonter Bill McKibben Headlines Town Meeting on Climate Change

￼

The reason I held a Solving Our Climate Crisis town hall earlier this week is pretty simple. Unless we take bold action to address climate change and transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy, I fear very much that the world we leave for our kids and grandkids will be in much worse shape than the world we live in today. Next Congress, I will be working on legislation that addresses the scope of the climate crisis, creates tens of millions of jobs, and saves American families money -- all while holding the fossil fuel companies accountable for the enormous damage they have done to our planet and our climate. Our job is to be bold, to think very big, and to go forward in a moral struggle to protect future generations.

Helping Vermonters Get a Fresh Start

Old criminal records prevent many Vermonters from obtaining jobs, securing housing or pursuing educational opportunities. The State of Vermont allows for some convictions and dismissed charges to be wiped from your record after a certain amount of time has passed. Vermont Legal Aid will host a free criminal record “expungement” clinic on Friday, December 14 from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. at the Winooski Community Justice Center at Winooski City Hall.

Dear friends,  It was with heavy hearts that we returned to work on Monday mourning the loss of the 41st president of the United States, George H.W. Bush, who passed away at his home in Houston, Texas, on Dec. 1, at the age of 94.  President Bush’s passing is a loss not only for America, but for all mankind who love freedom and liberty. He sacrificed for the country he loved in every way one could. As a solider, a public servant and a patriarch, President Bush represented the best of America.
￼
We spent much of the week paying tribute to this American patriot and selfless public servant. On Monday, I joined the Bush family, Vice President Mike Pence, cabinet members, justices of the Supreme Court and my Congressional colleagues to pay final respects to President Bush at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, where he lain in state until Wednesday morning.   On Tuesday, I honored the life of President Bush in a speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I talked about the patriotism and strong character of the late president as well as my personal relationship with him, including the numerous occasions that he campaigned for me during my political career.  President and Mrs. Bush were and always will be an unforgettable first family. I was honored to serve and work with them. Dianne and I extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to the Bush family.  Robins Air Force Base Breakfast  On Tuesday, U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, U.S. Representative Austin Scott and I welcomed our friends from Middle Georgia to the third annual Robins Air Force Base congressional breakfast in Washington, D.C.  Robins Air Force Base is home to the Air Force Reserve Command, the 78th Air Base Wing and Air Logistics Complex, and the entire U.S. fleet of Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) aircraft. Robins Air Force Base plays a critical role in our national security and as a part of Georgia’s military strength.   We’ve received good news this year about the future of Robins, with new hiring initiatives to fill the necessary jobs, and I appreciate the issues set forth and the attendance by so many stakeholders. We’re going to make sure that our mission is enhanced and that we fully utilize that mission, and we are here to help.

December 7, 2018   Dear  @gmail.com, 
This week, our nation mourned the loss of former President George H.W. Bush, who passed away last Friday night. Our 41st President was a good, decent, and honorable man. He was a hero and a patriot, and he will be missed by the grateful nation he served and loved. 
￼ 
My personal memories of President Bush are from a different era and time in Illinois. The president held a rally at the 1992 Illinois State Fair in Springfield – a must-stop location for national politicians back then. I remember the crowd in the Coliseum was fired up. 
￼  ￼ 
As a first-time candidate for Congress, I was allowed to speak before President Bush took the stage. I was shocked when he mentioned my name later in his remarks. We both went on to lose that election, but that moment in time is seared in my memory. I am grateful that he allowed me to be part of that event. 
One enduring part of President Bush’s legacy will be the importance he placed on national service and volunteerism. Throughout his life — as a naval aviator during WWII, a congressman, an ambassador, CIA Director, Vice President and eventually President of the United States — Bush understood that improving our country and the world requires each of us to take an active role in helping others. He believed that, through “a thousand points of light,” we as a nation could care for each other and lift each other to newer and greater heights. 
In that spirit, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize two of those points of light: Chris Deaville of Rantoul and Karly Schley of Wood River. Chris and Karly are both are members of the U.S. Coast Guard and each were members of the honor guard who stood watch over President Bush this week in the U.S. Capitol.  
I would like to thank Chris and Karly for their service and the example that they set. But most of all, I would like to thank President Bush for his service and for inspiring a generation of Americans to make our world a better place.

This Week in Congress
 FreedomWorks' Member of the Month
Last week, I was honored to be named as FreedomWorks' Member of the month for December. I will continue to be a vocal advocate for smaller government and our constitutional principles. You can read more about their announcement here. 
 ￼ 
 
 EPA Rollback of Obama-era 
Emissions Rule
For eight long years, President Barack Obama waged a War on Coal that devastated West Virginia communities and killed thousands of jobs. The so-called “Clean Power Plan” was directed at ending coal power generation. As unemployment skyrocketed and coal mines closed, President Obama and his allies in Congress focused bankrupting the coal industry. 
This weeks announcement of a rollback of Obama-era regulations is welcomed relief for the West Virginia coal industry and all Americans. 
President Donald Trump is keeping his promises to West Virginia by continuing to roll back this extreme Obama-era environmental regulation. I will continue to work with President Trump to defend our West Virginia way of life and create jobs. You can read more about the EPA's announcement here. 
Honoring Our 41st President
￼ 

This week our nation mourned the death of our 41st President, George H.W. Bush. President Bush served as our nation's Commander-in-Chief from 1989 until 1993. Before that he was Vice President from 1981 until 1989. He was also Director of the CIA, Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office to the People's Republic of China, United States Ambassador to the United Nations and a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Prior to becoming a Member of Congress, President Bush enlisted in the U.S. Navy after the attack on Pearl Harbor. As the youngest Navy pilot during WWII, he flew fifty-eight missions. During one his missions in the Pacific theater, his plane was shot down by the Japanese and was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service.
I hope this week all Americans were able to reflect on the life and legacy of President Bush and he unwavering commitment to public service.  
   
Capitol Christmas Tree Lighting
￼ 
Yesterday evening, this year's Capitol Christmas Tree or ""The People's Tree"" was lit. The tradition was started in 1964 by then-Speaker of the House John Mc  and each year the tree comes from a different state. This year's tree came from the Willamette National Forest in Oregon.
West Virginia provided the Capitol Christmas tree in 1970 and 1976. Both came from the Monongahela National Forest.

 Remembering President George H.W. Bush 
￼ 
I join the nation in honoring the life and legacy of President George. H.W. Bush, a true son of America who lived an extraordinary life of service, grace, strength, and character. He embodied what it means when we say the ""Greatest Generation."" 
President Bush will be remembered by the world for his enduring strength that brought an end to the Cold War, his extraordinary commitment to serving others through his thousand points of light, and his beautifully written letters. He was truly a great man who lived a giant life.
It was an honor to attend President Bush's arrival ceremony at the United States Capitol, and on Wednesday, his funeral service at the Washington National Cathedral. I am so blessed to have met President Bush while serving his son President George W. Bush in the White House. I am praying for the entire Bush family at this difficult time. I know his beloved angels Barbara and Robin are welcoming this hero in Heaven. May He Rest in Peace.

Remembering Pearl Harbor 
￼ 
Today we remember the attack on Pearl Harbor 77 years ago. We will never forget the heroism of the men and women who fought and died at Pearl Harbor, and may we always strive to honor their sacrifice. To learn more about the attack on Pearl Harbor and to hear incredible stories from survivors, click here. 
2018 Congressional App Challenge Winners 
 ￼ 
Representative Peter Welch (D-VT) and I are excited to announce that Seth Albertus and Dalton Benjamin – students at Northeastern Clinton Central School in Champlain, NY – have been named the winners of the 2018 Congressional App Challenge! Their hard work and innovation has earned them the honor of showcasing their winning app in the U.S. Capitol for visitors from around the world to see.
Training in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics) is essential for preparing students for the high-skilled careers of tomorrow, and this great achievement is proof of the valuable work being done by the teachers at Northeastern Clinton Central School. Seth and Dalton were able take computer science classes made possible in part by the Upward Bound Grant Program, and I am pleased my office was able to help secure this important funding.

Great American Defense Communities Class of 2019 
￼ 
The North Country has been selected as a member of the Association of Defense Communities Great American Defense Communities Class of 2019! Our district is home to more veterans than any Congressional district in New York, and has a close, long-standing relationship between the community and Fort Drum – the proud home of the 10th Mountain Division. I was pleased my office could provide a letter of support for this selection and congratulate our community on a well-deserved honor. Click here to read more about this important news. 
Keeping Seniors Safe this Holiday Season 
￼ 
Gathering with our loved ones during the holidays presents us with an opportunity to enjoy treasured moments with family, get a much-needed break from the stresses of work, and reflect upon the blessings we’ve enjoyed all year. For many, the season is an exciting time full of gift giving and travel. Unfortunately, the holidays also invite scammers and criminals looking to take advantage of innocent people, including our senior citizens. 
My office fields calls every year from seniors and their families who suspect they may have been the victims of a scam. I compiled some best practices to help keep the seniors in your life safe during what should otherwise be a joyous time of year. Click here to read my full post on Medium. 
Celebrating 50 Years of Service to the Crown Point Fire Department 
￼ 
Francis Cook’s career with the Crown Point Fire Department has spanned 50 incredible years. I proudly presented a Congressional Record certificate to recognize him for this important milestone. First responders like Francis are critical to public safety across our district, and our community is grateful for Francis's half century of service!
Crown Point Distinguished Young Women Event

I was honored to attend the 33rd annual Distinguished Young Women event in Crown Point. The Distinguished Young Women program is a national scholarship program that helps high school-aged girls achieve their full potential. Congratulations to all of the applicants and thank you for hosting me!

Sun Community News: Stefanik: Bush possessed ‘extraordinary sense of service and selflessness’ 
As the week of funeral ceremonies for former President George H.W. Bush draws to a close, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-Willsboro) recalled the president as a selfless, caring individual whose legacy will view him favorably.  While serving as a young staffer in former President George W. Bush’s White House, Stefanik said the elder Bush would visit and take time to introduce himself to junior staffers. That meant a lot to the team, most of whom were in their early 20s.

SERVING YOU  |  MEDIA CENTER  |  LEGISLATIVE WORK  |  OUR DISTRICT
 
December 7, 2018
 
 

Dear Friend, 

This week, our country bid farewell to a great American. President George H. W. Bush embodied our country’s highest ideals of service and devotion to a cause greater than yourself. As a young man, who was born into privilege and who came of age during World War II, George Bush was told over and over again to stay in school and let others fight the war for him. 

Instead, he answered the call to serve. As the youngest pilot in the Navy, he commanded the largest bomber plane in the Pacific fleet. He survived after being shot down and later earned the Air Medal, two Gold Stars, and the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service. 

At the end of the war, George Bush left his native New England for Texas where he would start a family with his beloved wife, Barbara. After nearly two decades of success in business, he once again felt called to service. Whether a diplomat, Congressman, CIA Director, Vice President, or President, George H. W. Bush always served the country he loved with honor, dignity, and grace. 

Few Americans will ever know the joys of public service as well as President Bush did. My thoughts are with his entire family. 

$20 Million for Pell Bridge  

The Claiborne Pell Bridge is an iconic example of Rhode Island’s unparalleled architecture. The longest suspension bridge in all of New England, it first opened to traffic between Newport and Jamestown nearly 50 years ago. Nearly 27,000 vehicles cross the Pell Bridge each day, making it a critical piece of our state’s infrastructure. 

Like other bridges and roads, however, the Pell Bridge has been in need of improvements for some time now. That’s why I’m pleased that I worked with my colleagues in the Congressional Delegation to deliver $20 million in new federal funding this week for improvements on the ramps and roadways that service the Pell Bridge. 

This critical funding will meet one of Rhode Island’s most pressing infrastructure needs. It will strengthen our economy, make it easier to move goods and services, and enhance the quality of life in our state. 

I’m looking forward to seeing this money get put to work. Not only will this project rebuild and improve the layout of the ramps and roadways leading from Aquidneck Island to the Pell Bridge, but it will also open 30 acres of land for redevelopment in the City of Newport. That’s real progress for our state, and I’m going to continue fighting in the weeks and months ahead to ensure we bring back even more federal resources for Rhode Island. 

Bump Stocks  

Last week, we learned that the U.S. Department of Justice is preparing to announce new regulations banning the sale of bump stocks that can turn semi-automatic rifles into the functional equivalent of machine guns. These devices were used in the October 2017 mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas. They have no legitimate purpose. It should not have taken the Department of Justice more than a year to act, but this appears to be a step in the right direction. 

In order to permanently end the threat that bump stocks pose to public safety, however, Congress must take action. The Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act, which I’ve introduced in the U.S. House, will stop, once and for all, the sale of bump stocks. My bill has 175 co-sponsors in the House and 41 in the U.S. Senate, where Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) is leading the fight to pass this bill. Both chambers of Congress should take up this legislation and pass it as soon as possible. 

New Office  

This week, my Capitol Hill office moved locations. We are now located in Office #2233 in the Rayburn House Office Building. I hope you will drop by when you are visiting our nation’s capital. 

If there is anything that my staff or I can do to serve you, please do not hesitate to let me know. You can reach me via email at David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov or call my office at 729-5600.

12/7/18 11:34,Blaine's Bulletin: Honoring the Life and Legacy of President George H.W. Bush,"￼ 
December 7, 2018

BLAINE'S BULLETIN

With temperatures near freezing in Washington D.C., thousands of Americans waited in hours-long lines for the opportunity to pay their final respects to President George Herbert Walker Bush this week. Lying in state in the United States Capitol rotunda is a rare honor afforded to a select few Americans who served our nation. President Bush, the forty-first President of the United States, earned the honor at least eight times over. 
His son, President George W. Bush said it best, “Dad taught us that public service is necessary; that one can serve with integrity and hold true to the important values, like faith and family.” As a young man, George H.W. Bush’s call to serve superseded his personal ambitions. On his 18th birthday, he enlisted in the United States Navy, becoming the youngest Navy pilot during WWII.
After his service in the Navy, he headed back to the United States where he married Barbara Pierce and attended Yale University. As the longest married presidential couple in American history, the tale of George and Barbara has become one of America’s most cherished love stories. George and Barbara’s love endured through personal tragedy, professional successes, and public defeats, all while keeping faith and family at the center of their lives.
With five children in tow, George H.W. Bush continued to answer the call to serve as a United States Congressman from Texas, Ambassador the United Nations, Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office to the People’s Republic of China, and Director of the CIA. His deep understanding of international relations was unmatched, forging critical relationships with foreign nations across the globe and earning worldwide respect.
In 1980, President Bush put his own personal ambitions aside as he became President Ronald Reagan’s running mate. As Vice President of the United States, he provided vital counsel to President Reagan, securing international wins throughout the President’s two terms. Steadfastly loyal to President Reagan, George H.W. Bush was elected President in 1988. Possibly the most qualified man to ever serve as President of the United States, he continued his work on consequential diplomacy across the globe.
As President he had the weight of the world on his shoulders, yet his family continued to be at the center of his universe. President Bush’s last words on Earth were “I love you, too” to his beloved first son, namesake and the 43rd President of the United States. To the entire Bush family, a mourning nation stands alongside you. We all gain some comfort in knowing he is now reunited with his beloved wife Barbara and their daughter Robin. In death as in life, his extraordinary goodness and love of country and family will be a guiding light for Americans and people across the world.
We can all learn valuable lessons of service and selflessness thanks to the shining example of President Bush. This week, America has lost an honorable man who exemplified the greatest generation through his faithful commitment to our nation and to his loving family. Leaving a legacy of conservative leadership, as Jon Meachum said, George Herbert Walker Bush “made our lives and the lives of nations freer, better, warmer, and nobler.”

12/7/18 11:30,Baldwin’s Bipartisan Bill to Support Small Business Investment Passes Congress,"Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email


￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
This week, bipartisan legislation authored by Senators Tammy Baldwin and Marco Rubio (R-FL) that will increase the amount of start-up funding for small businesses passed the Senate. The Senators' Spurring Business in Communities Act passed the House earlier this year and now heads to the president’s desk to be signed into law. 
“Small businesses are the engines of our Made in Wisconsin economy and if we increase the amount of start-up funding in our state, we can create new jobs and grow our economy,” said Senator Baldwin. “Wisconsin has lagged in business start-up activity and I have worked to change that. This legislation will help carry on Wisconsin’s proud history of entrepreneurship and innovation by providing more support to our small business start-ups, and I’m looking forward to the President signing this bill into law.”
According to the Kauffman Foundation, one of the country’s leading entrepreneurship advocacy and research organizations, Wisconsin ranked last in business start-up activity in reports released in 2017, 2016 and 2015. 
Senator Baldwin’s Spurring Business in Communities Act will allow more Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs) to form and invest in Wisconsin and other under-licensed states to ensure government financing for small businesses does not disproportionately benefit areas already dominated by financial services.  
Specifically, the bipartisan legislation will: 
	•	Exempt SBIC applicants from under-licensed states like Wisconsin from full capital requirements
	•	Give first priority to new applicants from under-licensed and under-financed states
	•	Establish annual reporting requirements on the Small Business Administration’s progress toward increasing the geographic dispersion of SBICs
Read more about Senator Baldwin’s bipartisan Spurring Business in Communities Act and her efforts to grow our Made in Wisconsin economy here.

12/7/18 11:29,Yet Another Blow to Hardworking Americans,"￼ 
￼
  
Dear Professor  ,
Yesterday, I opposed Kathleen Kraninger's nomination to be the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). 
Rhode Islanders deserve a qualified leader at the CFPB who will look out for their interests. Ms. Kraninger is not that person. 
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, I helped create the CFPB to give Americans an agency focused on protecting consumers from unfair and abusive financial products and services. Through 2016, the CFPB had provided $11.8 billion in relief to 29 million people impacted by unscrupulous financial services companies. However, for the past two years, the Trump Administration has drastically undermined the CFPB, clearly putting special interests and Wall Street ahead of hardworking families. 
I fear that Ms. Kraninger will continue this trend. During the confirmation process, she could not identify a single instance where she disagreed with the Trump Administration's policy of protecting powerful financial interests instead of consumers. The process clearly showed that she lacks the necessary qualifications and expertise for this position, as she has absolutely no financial regulation, banking, or consumer protection experience. 
While Ms. Kraninger was confirmed by a vote of 50 to 49, know that I will continue to fight every attempt to weaken the CFPB and its mission to protect hardworking Americans. 
Sincerely,
 
Jack Reed
United States Senator

The Lessons of Pearl Harbor Salute: President George H.W. Bush Worth a Read: “In the Middle East, Russia is back” Keeping the Government Open
 
The Lessons of Pearl Harbor
Today we mark the 77th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor.   I am very gratified that so many organizations, like the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars, take the time to remember Pearl Harbor Day and those who paid the ultimate sacrifice.
But, unfortunately, we are seeing a noticeable shift from the large-scale commemoration activities that marked earlier Pearl Harbor Day services. And, sadly, there will be even fewer Pearl Harbor survivors than in the past as time claims more survivors every year. 
But we cannot – we must not – let their heroism fade from the memories of Americans, especially our young.
I also believe there is another important lesson for us:  Pearl Harbor should remind us all of the high price of unpreparedness.  Peace through strength must be our guiding principle! That is why I have worked to ensure the strength of our Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines is unmatched.
It is never too late to learn more about the “Date Which Will Live in Infamy”, and I would encourage you to visit the Library of Congress’ resources here.
 
Salute: President George H.W. Bush
I had the privilege twice this year of attending memorial services at Washington National Cathedral, a month or so ago, for Senator John McCain, and this last Wednesday, for former President George Bush.
The service was an emotional three hours, to say the least!  And, while there was focus, and particularly camera focus on the president and his predecessors, most prominent was the key role of the Armed Services:  the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the uniformed pallbearers, the color guard, the incredible Marine Band, those who sang in the beautiful cathedral, served as ushers, paid tribute in a very special way to our nation, former Commander-in-Chief and to our form of government.
All of those who spoke, spoke beautifully, often with humor, told of our former president's life: Jon Meacham, the wonderful author, Brian Mulroney, former Canadian Prime Minister, former Senator Alan Simpson, and Bush's own minister from Texas. Former President George W. Bush delivered the eulogy for his father.
Being witness to this farewell was certainly a day I will never forget!
 
Worth a Read: Liz Sly’s article in the Washington Post, “In the Middle East, Russia is back,"" detailing Russia’s efforts to influence critical U.S. allies in the region.
 
Keeping the Government Open 
Yesterday, I introduced legislation that will keep a portion of the government open for the next two weeks as Congress continues its work on spending bills for FY 2019. Politico reported on yesterday’s action with:
“More than a day before the drop-dead deadline, Congress has completely cleared the continuing resolution that will postpone this Friday's shutdown threat for two more weeks. Speaking to a nearly empty chamber, retiring House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.) at noon called for passage, with Speaker Paul Ryan serving as presiding officer. Senate action quickly followed.”
H.J. Res. 143, the Continuing Resolution (CR) is a stopgap measure that will extend government funding until December 21, 2018. This CR is a clean extension of funding, which affects about 25% of discretionary funding for government operations.
As you may know, under my leadership, Congress approved a number of critical spending bills that provided $1 trillion or 75% of all annual discretionary funding prior to the end of the fiscal year –an achievement that has not occurred in twenty-two years.
You can read more about this important achievement and the impact the legislation will have on New Jersey here and here.
You can see the text of the CR here.

The Nation Mourns the Loss of President George Herbert Walker Bush
A week ago today, America and the world lost a great patriot, a humble servant, and loyal friend. George Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st President of the United States, enlisted as a naval aviator on his 18th birthday, and continued to serve his country and others for the rest of his life. He would go on to become a Congressman, envoy to China, Ambassador to the United Nations, Director of the CIA, Vice President, and, finally, President. Jon Meacham, the president’s biographer and friend, appropriately characterized his incredible life, declaring, “George Herbert Walker Bush was America’s last great Soldier-Statesman, a 20th century founding father.”
￼
Richard Burr Welcomes President George H.W. Bush to Greensboro, NC in 1992
In 1992, I ran for the House of Representatives for the first time. Then-President Bush was kind enough to come to North Carolina for an event with someone he hadn’t met, who had never run for office before. It was raining, and he was running for president himself, but there he was with a smile on his face and pep in his step, eager to help the next generation who wanted to serve. Neither of us fared well that year, but neither of us took that as an excuse to give up. He continued to try to make America better, and impart wisdom, integrity, and humility to anyone who was smart enough to listen or lucky enough to receive one of his famous hand-written notes.
In his inaugural address, the 41st President said, “We cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank account. We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend, a loving parent, a citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood and town better than he found it. What do we want the men and women who work with us to say when we are no longer there? That we were more driven to succeed than anyone around us? Or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had gotten better, and stayed a moment there to trade a word of friendship.” Let this call to service be the lasting legacy of President George Herbert Walker Bush. May he rest in peace.

12/7/18 10:54,Enroll For 2019 Health Insurance,"The Durbin Report: A message from Senator Richard J. Durbin
￼ 


Fellow Illinoisans, 
Despite the sabotage efforts of President Trump and the frenzy in Washington over health care, I want to make it clear that health insurance on the individual market is open for business and the deadline to enroll is fast approaching.  You have until Saturday, December 15th to enroll in a plan and get covered for 2019. 
Approximately 350,000 Illinoisans get their health insurance on the individual market, and thanks to the Affordable Care Act, eight out of ten people qualify for tax credits or financial assistance that lowers their monthly premiums to between $50 and $100. 
￼ 
We are all just one accident or diagnosis away from a serious medical condition and the financial challenges that come with it.  Having health care for you and your family provides an essential peace of mind.  I know, I’ve been there. 
The Affordable Care Act has brought health insurance to more than one million Illinoisans, provided protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and ended insurance discrimination based on medical history, gender, and age.  There’s more work to be done to strengthen health insurance coverage and lower out-of-pocket costs, and I will continue to fight to support patients in need and the providers that serve them. 
Sign up for 2019 health insurance today at healthcare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596. 
Sincerely, 
U.S. Senator Dick Durbin

￼ 


Here’s something you don’t hear often: the cost of health care coverage in New Jersey is actually going down! That’s right. Rates for many New Jersey plans in the Healthcare.gov marketplace are cheaper for 2019 than they were in 2018.      But you can’t get these savings if you don’t enroll by December 15th.  Go to Healthcare.gov now and sign up.  
￼  
If you or someone you know don’t get health benefits from your employer or through a federal program like Medicare, you must sign up for health insurance coverage by December 15th.  Go to Healthcare.gov now—every plan includes quality coverage for pre-existing conditions, prescription drug benefits, access to specialists and more.     Don’t wait.  The deadline is right around the corner.  Get online.  Make the call.    I’ve worked hard to protect the Affordable Care Act and Obamacare from Republicans who tried to take it away. 
And I’ll keep fighting to bring down the costs of prescription drugs and for the affordable, quality healthcare our families deserve.

Remembering President George H.W. Bush 
This week, communities across the world are remembering the life and public service of President George H.W. Bush, who was honored in a ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda, followed by a funeral service at the National Cathedral in Washington, DC. President George H.W. Bush will be laid to rest with his late wife, Barbara Bush, in College Station, Texas. The 41st President left a legacy of honorable public service, and his family and loved ones are in Jeff’s thoughts. 

Fighting for Lower Drug Costs 
The only people who don’t think prescription drug prices are too high are getting rich off of drug company profits. We pay far more – sometimes many times the cost – than people in other developed countries for the same medicines. Washington needs to stand up to Big Pharma’s lobbyists and put the health and financial well-being of the American people first.   That’s why Jeff introduced the Low Drug Prices Act, which would ensure that Americans aren’t paying more for their drugs than the median price per drug in Europe and Canada. Americans, whose tax dollars fund much of the cutting edge research behind new drugs, shouldn’t need to be forced between their medications and basics like food and rent.   Congress needs to stand up for Americans and demand that pharmaceutical companies stop overcharging for their products. 

Collaborating for Klamath Basin Water Solutions 
The Klamath Basin has struggled for years to find ways to protect the shortnose and Lost River sucker populations—whose survival impacts farmers and ranchers’ access to the water they need for their crops and livestock and local tribes’ treaty rights. On November 16, Jeff organized an emergency Sucker Science Summit in Klamath Falls, where scientists shared updates on the health of the sucker populations, and stakeholders discussed near-term solutions to improve sucker survival until long-term solutions take effect.   Through his work on the Appropriations Committee, Jeff secured $10 million of funding for farmers to align water demand with supply, and is working to make sure that Klamath Tribes receive critical funding to scale up efforts to restore healthy sucker populations. The summit produced additional ideas that Jeff and stakeholders are exploring. 

Improving Oregon’s Earthquake Resilience 
According to recent studies, scientists predict that there is a significant chance that the Cascadia Subduction Zone will experience a major earthquake in the next 50 years. In order to make sure Western states like Oregon are prepared for “The Big One,” Jeff recently worked with his West Coast colleagues to move forward the bipartisan National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act, which passed in the Senate by a unanimous vote. This bill is now headed to the President’s desk to be signed into law. This critical legislation will enable earthquake-prone communities to improve their infrastructure and complete hazard and risk assessments, which will help them better prepare for any upcoming earthquake. It will also continue key investments in developing early warning systems, which could be key to saving lives in a major Pacific Northwest earthquake.

Hello Lindsey,

This week our nation mourned a true patriot, President George H.W. Bush. While we might not all have agreed on every policy, what we can agree on is that President Bush served our nation with distinction in many roles, including as a Navy pilot in World War II, as a Congressman, an Ambassador, CIA Director, Vice President, and President. 

I was glad to join my congressional colleagues to honor his life at the National Cathedral yesterday.

￼

President Bush befriended Republicans and Democrats alike and sought common ground to move our country forward. I hope we can remember his commitment to service and the need to treat each other with respect.

It is a privilege to serve you and your family in Congress. If you ever have any thoughts or concerns you’d like to share, please feel free to contact me here.

Be well,

￼
Gohmert Response To Letter From Mr. Gaspard of the “Open Society Foundation” re: Mr. George Soros 
WASHINGTON, D.C. - In response to a letter from Mr. Gaspard of the “Open Society Foundation” regarding Mr. George Soros (attached below), Congressman Louie Gohmert issued the following statement:  “Mr. Gaspard, with the misnamed Open Society Foundation, has been very diligent to condemn opinions or allegations about Mr. Soros’ activity. Yet, he surely knows that in his interview with Steve Kroft on December 20, 1998, Mr. Soros as a mature adult verified that he had no sense of guilt about the role he played in Nazis’ confiscation of property from the Jewish people during the Holocaust. As a very mature adult, if Mr. Soros had deep regrets about what he did when he was 14 years old and apologized, I would have nothing but sympathy and admiration. Were he ever to do that in the future, I would still have those same warm, respectful feelings.
“Instead, Mr. Soros statement went on to say that if he weren’t there, someone else would have been in his role.  Those are things HE said, that HE admitted as an adult. Any person with any sense of empathy for his fellow human beings would regret the part they played in assisting the Nazis.
“Mr. Soros also admitted in that same interview regarding his financial dealings that, ‘I cannot and do not look at the social consequences of what I do.’ That’s breathtaking.
“My remarks were not anti-Semitic; the Israeli government itself stated last year that it did not mean to ‘delegitimize criticism of George Soros, who continuously undermines Israel’s democratically elected governments by funding organizations that defame the Jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself.’
“As for any attempt to invoke fear of violence or violence itself whether against Mr. Soros or anyone whomsoever, I have spent an adult lifetime working in our justice system to try to ensure that anyone who takes justice into his or her own hands must answer to that justice system. If a person who sent a bomb to anyone came before me as a judge for sentencing, I would have no problem assessing a significant time of incarceration. In that manner, the rest of us can maintain our freedom of speech, a God-given right enumerated in the very First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Freedom of speech should not be undermined by heavy-handed attempts to stifle criticism.”

Dear Friend,
￼
This week, I went down to the Senate floor to pay my respects to a great statesman, president, husband, and father.
  President George H.W. Bush had the best qualities of his generation, the Greatest Generation. He stood up straight, took responsibility, shared the credit, and took the blame.
 When the Soviet Union collapsed during his presidency, he exemplified the best of American diplomacy and helped steer Eastern Europe toward democracy. From World War II naval pilot to president of the United States, George H.W. Bush's example and service made a world changing difference.
 You can watch the full remarks here and read the excerpts below:
 “Certainly in Missouri, we claim part of the Bush family. His mother grew up in Missouri. The Walkers were from Missouri, and he treated Missouri like it was one of the states that he was connected to by relationship. His Uncle Herbert, along with his grandfather and later his Uncle Herbert and the rest of the family, would go in the summer to Walker's Point, named after that Missouri part of his family, just like the Walker's Cup is named after that part of his family. The impact of his mother is pretty great. I heard the president talking the other day on an interview with Jenna Bush about who he would look for when he got to heaven and that was a couple years ago, I think and he said, well, if Barbara has gone there first, I think the right answer would be, I'm going to look for her first. But then he said, and I think my mom and my dad. He said their daughter that they had lost when she was three, Robin, but his mother was an important part of his life. And you could tell that in talking to him or his children that remembered their grandmother and you could see a lot of what she taught him in him. …
 “Another part of his upbringing was sort of the upbringing of in many ways the best values of that World War II generation. Stand up straight, take responsibility, share credit, take blame. Those were all part of who George Herbert Walker Bush had become. That idea that you should do what you're supposed to do; that idea of the importance of service to others. …
 “And then, Mr. President, the collapse of the Soviet Union. We have just enough time now to look back and I've heard many others in the last few days talk about how that could have gone so badly wrong for all of the other countries that were trying to emerge from the domination of Russia and the Soviet Union. But George Herbert Walker Bush on the phone, reaching out, talking to leaders, seeing the things that had just been predicted by the West Germans themselves to be impossible, that somehow East Germany could become part of West Germany is exactly what happened. The President encouraged, stood beside, went out of the way to be sure that Helmut Kohl, the leader of West Germany, had the kind of support that he and his government needed to reach out and bring this country that had been isolated for 40 years, this part of the country back into the country, that all of these East European countries that were emerging from Soviet domination had a chance to move from domination to democracy. That would not have happened the way it happened if somebody less prepared and less capable had been there.”
 
Sincere regards, 
￼

12/6/18 14:53,Be Prepared For Winter Weather,"Dear Friend,
 This week inclement weather is expected to arrive in the district. The National Weather Service is forecasting a wintry mix of snow and freezing rain, both of which can make getting around dangerous. Let’s all be cautious as we move about.
Keeping a few things in mind can help us all stay safe, should the weather take a turn for the worse.
Before driving, make sure to give yourself enough time to melt or remove any snow or ice that may have formed on your vehicle. Drive a little slower than normal and be cautious of ice that may have formed on the roads. Give yourself plenty of room between you and the vehicle in front of you so that you have ample space and time to stop when needed.
Due to the wintry mix, ice that may form on power lines could cause power outages, so make sure you have your batteries and generators ready, just in case.
As always, prepare, be safe and look out for your neighbor.  

Best Regards,     
￼

Congresswoman Alma S. Adams, Ph.D.

SERVING OUR VETERANS
Dear Friend,
Washington’s First District is home to more than 40,000 veterans. Given all they have done for us, we must ensure that our local veterans receive the best health care and benefits.
My office works with veterans to help communicate with and navigate through our federal system. During my time in office, we have helped more than 192 veterans gain access to quality health care and helped retrieve $1 million in back pay. I recently advocated on behalf of Bill, a terminally ill Air Force veteran whose appeal was being delayed. Bill was awarded over $200,000 in back pay for his stage IV cancer resulting from Agent Orange exposure. It also sparked systematic action, producing a nationwide review of all terminally ill veteran records.
If you need assistance, please do not hesitate to contact my Bothell office at (425) 485-0085. Although I cannot guarantee a particular outcome, we are always ready to listen to your concerns and work to find a solution. Here are some actions we routinely take to assist veterans:
Veterans Health Administration
	•	       Assistance with scheduling an appointment
	•	       Assistance with getting authorization to use the Choice Program
	•	       Clarifying notices from the VHA
	•	       Connecting veterans with a patient advocate
	•	       Helping with the authorization of emergency treatment outside the VHA
Veterans Benefits Administration
	•	       Connecting veterans to a local Veterans Service Officer
	•	       Clarifying notices from the VBA
	•	       Walking veterans through the appeals process for denied claims
	•	       Cutting red tape to get long overdue appeals processed
	•	       Helping veterans access their military records or a DD214
	•	       Assisting veterans navigate the VA home loan program
	•	       Helping manage debt that the VA should rightfully be paying
Department of Defense
	•	      Assisting veterans appeal a DFAS decision
	•	      Clarifying notices from DFAS
As always, I am here to help you. If you have questions or comments about the topics that matter most to you, I encourage you to contact me through my website. You may also keep up-to-date on what I’m doing by following me on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.
Sincerely, 
Suzan

Dear Friend,  Texas and America’s hearts are heavy with the loss of a true patriot, a great president and one of the most decent men ever, George Herbert Walker Bush. George and his wife Barbara never let the pressures of their chosen lives take away their humanity. They lived their lives purely and respectfully, serving as shining examples to us all. George is now in Heaven with Barbara and their 4 year old daughter Robin by his side.   This week, it was an honor to pay my respects to former President Bush as he lay in state in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. This honor is reserved for our nation’s greatest public servants and the catafalque, the platform his coffin rested upon, has been used since Abraham Lincoln lay in state in 1865. I was moved by the outpouring of love and support from thousands of folks across America who came to DC to pay tribute to this iconic American. It is a true testament to his leadership and love of family, faith and country. Even as the most powerful man in the whole world, he never, ever lost his humanity. ￼  Former President George H.W. Bush lies in state in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda   I’m honored to represent you in Congress.

Dear Friend,
President George H.W. Bush’s funeral at the National Cathedral yesterday was an important moment for the country to honor his life of service and reflect on America’s democratic values and leadership at home and abroad.  I was proud to represent the citizens of the Tampa Bay area and honor the achievements of President George H.W. Bush.  He served during a tumultuous time, including the bloodless and hopeful end to the Cold War.  On behalf of my neighbors, I was also proud to cosponsor a resolution to honor the life of President George H. W. Bush, and his service to our country. 

￼

I traveled to the former East Germany and Czechoslovakia in 1990 after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Velvet Revolution.  There I witnessed firsthand how the United States under President George H.W. Bush was directly engaged with those nations during their transition away from Soviet influence.  Importantly, Americans were free to travel and interact with the people there.  President George H.W. Bush’s wisdom and the respect he engendered from our allies and the world ensured that American legal and economic experts, along with businesses, could be present to directly aid the countries as they transitioned to greater freedom and personal economic opportunity.

￼

Our nation will remember President George H.W. Bush as a patriot, who saw his duty and was dedicated to his country.

Sincerely, 

Kathy Castor

One of my goals as a United States Senator is to create and foster an environment where young Kansans interested in STEM can receive a quality education and enjoy robust career opportunities right here at home.
As part of this mission, I hosted NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and NASA Astronaut Don Pettit this past weekend in Wichita to speak with students interested in STEM and space exploration. Over 150 Kansas students, educators and families heard from Astronaut Pettit on his path to becoming an astronaut and his many missions to the International Space Station. Astronaut Pettit shared exciting stories from his time in space and encouraged students to “find their frontier” and chase after their dreams. I am certain that we had numerous future scientists, engineers, mathematicians – and even astronauts! – in the room with us. 
Events like this are important as we work to inspire and train the next generation of inventors and innovators. And through my positions as a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, I’m committed to making certain we support agencies, projects and programs that increase opportunities for our young people so that they can have rewarding, meaningful careers right here in Kansas.

Poll: U.S. Mexico-Canada Agreement
Hoosiers,

Last week at the G20 summit in Argentina, President Trump signed the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. According to the White House, this renegotiated NAFTA trade deal with Canada and Mexico aims to benefit America's workers, manufacturers, farmers, and businesses by incentivizing billions in new auto production, increasing market access to farmers and ranchers, safeguarding America's intellectual property against foreign competitors, and putting small and medium sized businesses first. You can read more about the trade deal here.

Question of the Week: Do you support this renegotiated trade deal?

[_] Yes.
[_] No.
[_] I don't know.
[_] Other (share your thoughts).

Take the poll here.

Dear Friend, 
The world lost a true statesman this week with the passing of former President George Herbert Walker Bush. President Bush personified class, importance of family values, and above all a long commitment to public service on behalf of Texas and our nation. You can read my full statement here. 
I sat down with NPR’s All Things Considered to honor the life and legacy of former President Bush, which you can listen to here.

Team Castro attended the Ingram Hills Neighborhood Association Holiday Party this week where good food and music was shared by all; joined Cyber Signing Day in San Antonio at the United States Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology #NICEK12 conference to recognize talented students who recently joined teams with local cyber firms; and participated in the City of San Antonio’s Immigrants and Health Care Convening session on the public charge with other folks that share similar interest and concern.
￼ ￼

Hispanic Caucus 
It was an honor to be elected Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for the 116th Congress. You can read my statement here. 
Continued Family Separation 
I’m deeply concerned about reports that the Administration may have resumed separating families under a false premise that they are protecting children from ‘criminal’ parents. Congress needs answers on the standards and the evidence this Administration is using to designate certain parents as ‘criminals’ and whether this is just cover to resume the Administration’s cruel and xenophobic position towards immigrants. You can read my full statement here.  
Protecting Mueller 
It’s clear that the Special Counsel’s investigation is working and we must protect him and his investigation so the American people can get the truth they deserve. Here is my statement on this week’s developments as Mueller submitted his sentencing memo for General Michael Flynn.  
You can also listen to my NPR’s All Things Considered interview where I discussed Michael Cohen’s guilty plea last week.  
As Congress continues to address issues that directly affect San Antonians’ daily lives, I want to hear from you. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or questions for me by calling my office at 210-348-8216 or reaching out online through my website, castro.house.gov.

Dear Friend, 
Free trade needs to be fair trade and farmers received several pieces of good news last week on that front. 
President Trump announced that negotiations with China have taken a major step forward. Because of some very important concessions from China, the President struck an agreement that he won’t raise the tariffs on Chinese goods while negotiations continue. As a result, China has agreed to purchase a “very substantial amount of agricultural, energy, industrial, and other product from the United States.” These purchases are designed to reduce the trade imbalance between our two countries and put us in a much better position than we have been for quite some time. 
Most importantly, China has agreed to begin purchasing US soybeans immediately. Prices have surged. This is welcome news across rural America. Meanwhile, negotiations with President Xi will continue in the hopes that China will quit ripping off our country. We continue to play the long game knowing that the best deal isn’t going to happen overnight. 
Closer to home, the trade “long game” is just about over and it looks like a win. 
President Trump, along with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. It replaces NAFTA, which had put the US at a disadvantage in several key areas. 
The new agreement will increase market access for America’s farmers and ranchers, incentivize billions in new auto production, install new protections to safeguard America’s intellectual property against foreign competitors, and create a new chapter to benefit America’s small and medium sized businesses. 
The President kept his promise to deliver a new agreement and getting his counterparts in Mexico and Canada to the table to sign the agreement was a huge win for America. The ball is now in Congress’ court and I hope we will act quickly in the new year to ratify the agreement. 
Trade is critical to North Missouri and these developments are huge. Our farmers, ranchers, manufacturers and businesses are one step closer to having the certainty and market access they need. We’ve still got a long way to go but I am committed to helping us get the best possible trade deals we can get. With a little patience, I think we can even out the imbalances and right the ship. 

Sincerely,
￼ 
Sam Graves

RUTHERFORD ROUNDUP
For December 5, 2018

Dear Friends, 
Today our country observed a National Day of Mourning for the loss of our 41st President George Herbert Walker Bush. His legacy as a father, husband, decorated veteran, public servant, and leader is a shining example of the best our nation has to offer. His devotion to our country was matched only by his dedication to his wonderful family.
President Bush built an incredible record of service and accomplishment, serving in the Navy, the House of Representatives, the CIA, as Vice President, and ultimately as President. But more importantly, he was a man of tremendous character and humility who fought for justice, freedom, and peace throughout his career and life. I hope each of you took time in recent days to celebrate a life well-lived, mourn his passing, and reflect on the exceptional values that President Bush’s words and deeds demonstrated. May he rest in peace.

Our Coastal Communities Must Be Protected
￼ 
I was disappointed to see NOAA Fisheries announce their approval of five Incidental Harassment Authorizations, or IHAs, that could allow five companies to conduct seismic testing off our Atlantic Coast – the first step to offshore drilling. I am very concerned about what this may mean for our vulnerable marine mammal populations and other marine life, but I also have many questions about how this will impact naval operations and training missions that operate off the East Coast. We have very little information on what this would mean for our national security, the health of our recovering fisheries, or our coastal economies. Not to mention that any data collected about oil and gas reserves off our coast would be proprietary, meaning neither the public nor government officials would have access to this information.
Last June I led a bipartisan letter with 104 of my colleagues requesting that Interior Secretary Zinke not approve seismic airgun blasting in the Atlantic Ocean. Click here for a link to that letter. Please know I will keep fighting to stop unnecessary threats to our economy and our security off our coast.

Improving Veteran Job Readiness Programs Honors Their Service
￼  
Although Veterans Day has come and gone, we are reminded that we must not put our gratitude, our patriotism, and the needs of our veterans on the shelf until next November comes around. Each of us, and especially those of us in Congress, must keep focused on the many challenges our veterans face and maintain our commitment to their needs all year long. One such challenge is the transition from service to civilian life, which can be a difficult adjustment for service members and their families. I recently wrote an op-ed for Military.com where I discuss the importance of improving transition assistance programs, which can do more to help those who sacrificed so much for us. To read the op-ed in its entirety, please click here.

JAXPORT Receives Continued Federal Investment
 ￼ 
Last month, the Army Corps of Engineers awarded JAXPORT $46 million in additional federal funding to continue the progress on its deep draft navigation project. I have been fighting relentlessly for sustained investment in this project and this good news signifies a major victory for our region. JAXPORT is a significant economic engine supporting tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic output. Read more about this exciting news here. 
  
 ￼ 
Using Innovations to Keep Troops Safe 
￼ 
As Co-Chair of the bipartisan Congressional Modeling and Simulation Caucus, I have the opportunity to support emerging technologies that strengthen our national security. Last week at the annual Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation, and Education conference, I witnessed the cutting edge developments that are improving the education and training for our servicemembers. These technologies help prevent future disasters like the collisions of the USS McCain and USS Fitzgerald. 
We secured $111 million in federal funding for training facilities at Mayport that will prepare the Littoral Combat Ship crews as these mission critical ships continue to enter the fleet. I am encouraged by Vice Admiral Brown’s comments in the story below and am committed to working with the Navy to ensure our sailors have the best technology, methods, and training available to ensure successful and safe missions around the world.
To read more about improving these training standards, please click here.

Honoring Local Heroes
￼ 
I had the privilege of attending the Jacksonville Beach Police Department Award Ceremony to honor Patrol Corporal William Eierman, K-9 Officer Benjamin Gray, and Patrol Officer Jason Murphy for their selfless service to our community.
Corporal Eierman received the Medal of Valor and Law Enforcement Purple Heart for his heroic actions on August 8th of this year when he was shot twice while engaging a shooter near a local establishment. Officers Gray and Murphy also received the Distinguished Service Award for the bravery they displayed on the same evening. Their remarkable actions most likely saved the lives of fellow officers and civilians they are sworn to protect. On behalf of a grateful community, I want to thank Corporal Eierman, Officers Gray and Murphy, and the entire Jax Beach Police Department family for what they did that evening and for what they do every day to help keep Northeast Florida safe.
  
￼ 
Snapshot: Recent Photo Highlights
￼ 
I attended the 16th Annual JAX Chamber Military Appreciation Luncheon and heard an inspiring message from Vice Adm. Mary Jackson. Congratulations to Capt. Clarence Hill who received the RDML Kevin F. Delaney Hall of Fame Award, which honors veterans who have positively impacted our communities. 
  
￼ 
I was honored to speak at the 2018 Celebration of Valor in Jacksonville. In partnership with the Jacksonville Jaguars Foundation, the City of Jacksonville’s Military Affairs and Veterans department awarded $50,000 in community grants to eight local veteran serving organizations.

The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is America's most successful conservation program. LWCF expands opportunities for outdoor traditions like hunting, camping, and fishing that are among the pillars of Western culture. In New Mexico, LWCF has helped preserve many treasured places-including the Valles Caldera, Ute Mountain, and Valle de Oro National Wildlife Refuge-that power our thriving outdoor recreation economy.
However, despite our best efforts to save LWCF, congressional inaction allowed the program to expire earlier this year. I am doing everything in my power to permanently and fully fund LWCF before the end of the year. I recently joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers and conservation leaders at the U.S. Capitol to express how critical this program is for New Mexico. I hope you can take a moment to watch and share my remarks.
￼ 
VIDEO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich joins Democratic and Republican lawmakers and conservation leaders to stand up for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, November 29, 2018.
LWCF has built a proven track record over the last half century as a successful program. The broad support LWCF has from both Republicans and Democrats is a testament to how well the program has worked all across the nation. We must renew it to continue protecting our drinking water, providing public land access, and funding neighborhood parks, soccer fields, and baseball diamonds for our children.    We have lots of things that are worth debating in Congress. LWCF is not one of them. We need to get permanent reauthorization and mandatory, full funding for LWCF across the finish line to ensure that the outdoor places we all treasure will be protected for future generations to enjoy. 
Sincerely,
￼
MARTIN HEINRICH United States Senator

Today marks the national day of mourning for former President George H. W. Bush, who passed away last week at the age of 94. But as we mourn his loss, we should also celebrate his distinguished service to our country.  
￼ 
President Bush’s public service began many years before he became the 41st President of the United States. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor inspired him to enlist in the Navy on his 18th birthday and become the nation’s youngest naval aviator. 
He went on to serve as a Texas member of the U.S. House of Representatives, the ambassador to the United Nations, an envoy to China, director of the CIA, and as Vice President for eight years before winning the presidency.  
President Bush was a man of great integrity whose dedicated life of service to his country and devotion to his family should inspire us all. Our nation will always be grateful for his legacy.

Dear Friend,                                                    
It’s official: the holiday season is here! Like many Americans, you may be thinking about what gifts to get your loved ones this month. Perhaps something they’ve always wanted. Perhaps something especially thoughtful. Maybe something you think that they need. 
￼
As you start your holiday shopping during this busy season, don’t forget about something that we all need for a happy and healthy 2019: health care coverage. 
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace is up and running, and there are only 10 days left to sign up for health insurance for the coming year. If you don’t get health insurance through your employer, Medicaid, Medicare or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, you can find a high-quality, affordable health care plan that works for you through the ACA marketplace. 
And this isn’t a holiday purchase that will break the bank: many health plans in the ACA marketplace have premiums that are $50 to $100 per month, and 8 in 10 people will qualify for financial assistance.
If you’re new to the health insurance market place or have questions, you can visit healthcare.gov to learn more about plans that might work for you and your family’s budget. You can also visit any Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC), like La Red in Georgetown, that are committed to finding plans and providers tailored to fit your lifestyle. 
￼
Recently, I visited La Red and saw firsthand how staff, who are experts at navigating the health insurance marketplace, are working directly with Delawareans to help them find a plan that fits both their health needs and budget. If you’re in Seaford, Milford or Georgetown, you can call them directly at 302-855-1233. 
Do you live in Kent County or New Castle County? No problem. There are other FQHCs all around the First State! For a comprehensive list of where you can go for direct help, click here. 
Don’t forget: Saturday, December 15th is your last day to enroll through the marketplace for 2019. So as you buy your presents and spend time with friends and family, remember there is no better gift than knowing you are covered for year ahead. 
Every family in the First State and across our country deserves access to high-quality and affordable health care, and it’s one of the wisest investments you can make. This holiday season, help your family and loved ones find coverage that works for them so that everyone can have a happy and healthy New Year.

In Memoriam
President George Herbert Walker Bush was our last combat veteran to serve in the highest office in the land. He was one of the finest members of the Greatest Generation, entering public service following a decorated career as a Navy pilot in World War II.
I had the privilege to meet President Bush. Despite our policy differences, he was a very gracious and kind person.  
Back in 1989 when he was president and Washington's own Tom Foley was House Speaker, he visited Spokane to celebrate our state's centennial. He flew across the country to the hometown of the speaker of the opposite party, and celebrated alongside him and other Washingtonians. And keep in mind, our state went for Dukakis! His devotion to bipartisanship and mutual celebration was truly extraordinary.  
￼  President Bush with House Speaker Tom Foley in 1989 (courtesy of WSU) 
Last week I invited a freshman Republican from Texas into my office. He will be moving into my former office, 425 Cannon, as we go into this next Congress. It was great to get to know a new Member of Congress and welcome him to our deliberative body. 
In the spirit of our 41st President, I hope we can work together to build an economy and national security apparatus of which we can all be proud.  
Rest In Peace, Mr. President.
  
Sincerely, 
￼
Denny Heck

NEWS FROM WASHINGTON AND ACROSS WEST TEXAS
Dear Friend, 
As we near the end of the 115th Congress, it is imperative we finish strong, passing critical legislation before the year’s end – included in that is the 2018 Farm Bill and the final government spending package. 
President George H. W. Bush 
My heart grieves with my friend, President George W. Bush, and his family over the passing of his father, George H. W. Bush. 
President 41 was a great American and one of the most decent men I’ve ever met. He reminded us over the years that loving families are the fabric of a strong nation. He also taught us that public service is a noble calling and that being a gentleman and a politician do not have to be mutually exclusive. 
America is better because of his humble leadership, strong character, and selfless commitment to God, family, and country. 
￼
Farm Bill Agreement 
I am pleased that we’ve reached a bipartisan agreement in principle on the 2018 Farm Bill. This legislation will be tremendously helpful for our farmers, ranchers, and rural America because it significantly strengthens the agriculture safety net, makes important investments in rural infrastructure, and improves other aspects of the Farm Bill.
I am deeply disappointed that the Democrats and Republicans in the Senate made little effort to improve one of the largest welfare programs in the country, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which, in its current form, has trapped millions of Americans in a cycle of government dependence. 
Even so, it was imperative we closed the deal in order to provide our producers with the economic certainty they so desperately need and so we don’t have to start over in the 116th Congress with Democrats writing the Farm Bill in a Pelosi-led House. I expect the conference report to pass both the conference committee and House and Senate chambers within the next two weeks.  
￼ 
No Budget, No Recess
Over the past twenty years, Congress has failed to meet its most basic responsibility to fund the government on time. In fact, between 1977-2017, Congress enacted over 170 stopgap spending measures referred to as continuing resolutions, leaving our military in limbo, creating uncertainty in the markets, and costing taxpayers billions of dollars.  
Last week, to prevent Congress from adjourning until it passes a budget, I introduced bipartisan legislation, the No Budget, No Recess Act, with my colleague from Washington State, Congressman Derek Kilmer. This legislation would hold Congress to the same standards as the American people, ensuring that they do their job before they go home. 
￼
Stronger Trade 
With more than 95% of the world’s population and 80% of the world’s purchasing power outside the United States, economic growth and job creation for West Texas and our nation increasingly depend on expanding U.S. trade and investment opportunities in the global market.
I commend President Trump for negotiating from strength, ensuring that our producers and manufacturers are treated fairly, and I look forward to reviewing the USMCA with my colleagues in the 116th Congress. Read the Washington Time’s write up on the ceremonial signing here. 
Cotton Capital of the World 
I am proud to see West Texans fill critical U.S. Department of Agriculture Cotton Board positions as appointees! Julie Holladay of Lubbock, Jeffery Posey of Roby, Steven Olson of Plainview, Jason French of Snyder, and Brett Schniers of Wall have been appointed to the Cotton Board as members and alternate members.
Secretary Sonny Perdue said the following of their appointments: “The Cotton Board carries out research and promotional activities that help cotton compete in domestic and foreign markets, improve fiber quality and lower production costs. I want to thank these board members for the time and effort they have committed to serving the cotton industry.""
With our region being the cotton capital of the world, our Cotton Board representatives bring the experience and knowledge needed to advocate for and voice the needs of cotton producers throughout the nation.  
￼
Please know, it is an honor to be your Representative. Feel free to reach out to my office and let me know how I can best serve you.

Open Enrollment Ends on December 15
A MESSAGE FROM CONGRESSMAN STENY H. HOYER  
I wanted to share the following video message with you regarding the 2019 open enrollment season. There are less than two weeks left in open enrollment. Marylanders have through December 15 to sign up for a new health insurance plan or make changes to their current plan. Some plans may have changed and many Americans are finding cheaper coverage and more choice this year, so be sure to visit MarylandHealthConnection.gov to pick a plan that works for you and your family.  
Nine in ten Marylanders who sign up for health insurance through MarylandHealthConnection.gov qualify for financial assistance. Free, in-person assistance is available throughout the Fifth District. Find assistance near you by clicking here.  
￼ 
As always, I encourage all Fifth District residents to continue to share their concerns and insights with me by contacting my office or connecting with me on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.    
Sincerely Yours,   ￼  Steny H. Hoyer

November Update
 

￼
￼
Every year in November, we take time to honor the brave men and women who have sacrificed so much for our country. This year, I was able to honor and celebrate our veterans and servicemembers in a number of ways. I participated in the opening of the new Lincoln County Veterans Resource Center, a resource for veterans along the coast who face a unique set of challenges living in rural, more remote areas. In Salem, I had the honor to welcome home the brave men and women of 3rd Platoon, G Company, 1-189 Aviation from their recent deployment to the Middle East where they conducted over 80 medical evacuations. After putting their civilian lives on hold for a year, these servicemembers have finally reunited with their loved ones. I was also able to speak with students at Molalla River Middle School during the holiday about the importance of Veterans’ Day. It’s so important that our next generation never forget the sacrifices our veterans have made to protect our American values and our freedom.

Don’t forget: it doesn’t have to be Veterans’ Day to thank the brave men and women who protect our country!

Did you know? The United States Library of Congress (LOC) receives millions of books every year, and often receives so many copies of the same book that they do not have the space to store them all. As a result, the LOC created a Surplus Book Program, where institutions like schools and public libraries are able to receive these surplus books to add to their own collections. For months, my staff and interns in my Washington, D.C. office have taken on a “heavy lifting” project selecting and shipping hundreds of books to Mount Angel Abbey Library to add to their collection. This month, I stopped by the library to see all of the books we’ve been able to send, and help add a few to the shelves.

At the end of the month, we passed the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018, which includes legislation that will keep the Newport air facility permanently open. Due to budget cuts, the Newport air facility, which handles half of the emergency response calls on the Central Oregon Coast, was nearly closed a few years ago. Newport, which is part of our 5th district, is home to one of Oregon’s three deep draft ports, the state’s largest-grossing commercial fishing fleet, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Pacific Operations Center, Oregon State University research personnel and vessels, and a robust recreational and sport fishing industry that is critical to the local economy. The bill we passed includes a provision that guarantees the Newport air facility will stay open and serve Oregon’s coastal communities into the future.

It has been more than two years in the making, but we finally cut the ribbon on the Highway 101 improvement project in downtown Tillamook this month. Safer and more efficient, these changes have totally changed the face of the town. This new downtown is also the home of Tillamook’s growing and vibrant business community. Thank you to the Tillamook Chamber of Commerce for taking me around earlier this month to meet the business owners who are continuing the tradition of innovation in this community. Congratulations, Tillamook, I look forward to seeing what more is to come.

An outsider passing through Depoe Bay might not know that the World’s Smallest Navigable Harbor hosts one of our coast’s most vibrant charter and recreational fishing fleets. Right now, however, silt in the harbor is slowly making it impossible for boats to access the local fuel dock. Due to the silt, the fuel dock is only usable for a few hours each day, and even that period is quickly shrinking. My office, along with all your elected representatives, has been working to secure US Army Corps funding to get the harbor dredged and keep our fishermen on the water. I had the opportunity to visit the harbor toward the end of the month and get an update, and I am very pleased to announce that we were able to secure the desperately needed funding to dredge both the harbor and the check dam.

Make sure you and your family have health coverage for 2019! The open enrollment period – when you can sign up for health insurance – ends on December 15, 2018 and is only six weeks. That is half the length of the enrollment period of years past. Whether you already get coverage through the exchange and want to make a change to your plan, or you're looking to get covered for the first time, December 15th is a hard deadline for everyone, so don't wait! Visit healthcare.oregon.gov today to enroll in a new plan or make changes to your current plan.

Newsroom
District
 
Friends,  Following the Thanksgiving recess, my colleagues and I returned to Capitol Hill to act on a pile of unresolved, but necessary, legislation. In Connecticut, I have been busy meeting with constituents and hearing from them about issues that should be addressed before the end of the legislative session.
￼
Rep. Himes touring Community Health Center, Inc.’s new location at 22 Fifth Street to hear about how federal resources can support community care centers.
Community Health Center, Inc. Grand Opening  Earlier this year, Congress passed with my support a budget that includes $7 billion in funding for Community Health Centers nationwide. Many of those funds will be used to supplement renovation and construction costs so that management personnel can grow and modernize their facilities. In Connecticut, we are beginning to see the payoff of investments like this with the opening of Community Health Center, Inc.’s (CHC, Inc.) Stamford facility. To better serve the Stamford community, CHC, Inc., will move its primary medical and behavioral health services to its new facility at 22 Fifth Street, which will offer more exam rooms, community spaces, and significant technological upgrades. I am hopeful that these new resources will help CHC, Inc., continue to deliver quality, affordable, patient-centered coverage. 

Greenwich High School Civics Discussion Like you, I have been disturbed by the decline of civility in political debate. This nasty strand of political discourse has turned off many young people from engaging in the political process. Our schools and classrooms should offer a safe forum for students to exchange ideas, receive feedback on their opinions, and learn to communicate effectively. On Monday, Republican State Representative Fred Camillo, State Representative-Elect Stephen Meskers, and I took questions from a Civics class at Greenwich High School about legislation that they would like for us to support in the Connecticut General Assembly and the House of Representatives, respectively. It is vital that we continue to give a voice to young men and women, and I was proud to hear from these students about their bold ideas to move our country forward.   
I look forward to meeting with my constituents and hearing from you about the issues that impact you. If you would like to schedule a meeting or make me aware of an upcoming event in the Fourth Congressional District, please visit my website here. If it is possible for me to attend, one of my staff members will follow up regarding my availability.  
Sincerely, Jim

From the Hill to the Mountains
Statement on the Passing of President George H.W. Bush 
Gayle and I were so heartbroken to hear of the passing of President George H.W. Bush. The President dedicated his life to our country through his patriotism, his public service and humanitarian efforts. He was a man who put country and citizens before party and politics and will be remembered as one of the greatest presidents in our history. It was truly an honor to know him and call him and Barbara friends. While our nation will mourn his loss, and pray for the entire Bush family, I will find joy in the knowledge that he is now in heaven with Barbara, the woman he loved more than anything else in this world. West Virginia will be praying for the entire Bush family and thanking them for the legacy President Bush has left on our nation and the entire world.
  
Honoring Our Veterans on Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day 
The surprise attack on December 7, 1941, was a monumental event not only in American history but in all of world history.  It awakened a “sleeping giant,” as some Japanese leaders feared. It gave every man, woman, and child in America a personal stake in a global war over the very survival of human civilization. Millions of brave souls boarded planes and ships to join the fight.  At home, brave Americans entered the factories and shipyards to supply the war effort, sacrificing to support their family members who were fighting for the freedom of the world.
These Americans, our “greatest generation,” persevered, but they did so with the same firm belief in the greatness of America, with the same love of country greater than of life itself.  America became, and remains, a free nation under God because of such men and women.
President Franklin Roosevelt said in his address before Congress that the attack on Pearl Harbor would be “a date which will live in infamy.”  In 77 years we have never forgotten.  We must make sure that each year, and more importantly every day, that we remember those past sacrifices and the ongoing sacrifices being made to protect our homeland and to secure our freedom.
Let us also pay special tribute to the men and women from our great state who served in World War II, and in every American conflict.  Our home state has mined the coal that forged the steel that built the great ships and tanks that Americans have served on.  West Virginia has given much, and we have much to be proud of.  
  
Encouraging West Virginians to Get Covered During Open Enrollment Period 
While the ACA is not perfect, the number of uninsured West Virginians has decreased by 56% as a result of the Affordable Care Act and the Medicaid expansion. Every West Virginian deserves access to quality and affordable healthcare. I encourage those without health insurance coverage to visit www.healthcare.gov  during the Open Enrollment Period to find a plan that works for them and their families. 
The Affordable Care Act Open Enrollment Period ends on December 15, 2018. West Virginians can register for health insurance coverage by visiting www.healthcare.gov/get-coverage/ or call 1-800-318-2596.

Challenging the Mobility Fund Coverage Map 
Senator Manchin (D-WV) submitted to the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) a formal challenge to Mobility Fund Phase II initial eligible areas map. The data Senator Manchin submitted proves the coverage map released by the FCC does not accurately depict broadband coverage throughout West Virginia. Senator Manchin was the only member of Congress to submit a formal challenge. 
The data I submitted last week proves what every West Virginian already knows to be true: there are too many areas throughout our state that still lack reliable broadband coverage. West Virginia faces unique challenges when it comes to providing broadband access, and the first step to fixing that is making sure these maps accurately reflect coverage on the ground. This map determines who is eligible for a portion of the $4.5 billion that will be made available later this year, and I will continue fighting to ensure every community in West Virginia has the reliable, affordable broadband access they deserve.
To view the eligible areas map released by the FCC click here.

If you or a family member are on Medicare, I wanted to remind you that open enrollment closes at the end of this week.   The next three days are when seniors can change their prescription drug plan or Medicare Advantage coverage for 2019.     This once-a-year window gives Medicare recipients the opportunity to select a new plan based on annual changes in cost, coverage options and available providers or pharmacies. 
The enrollment period began on Oct. 15 and ends this Friday Dec. 7.    Everyone with Medicare is eligible for prescription drug coverage, regardless of income and resources, health status or current drug expenses. Seniors who are happy with their current coverage do not need to do anything.   Seniors may sign up or update their plans in two ways:   1) Phone: Call 1-800-MEDICARE. Seniors should have their Medicare card, a list of drugs they use and the name of their pharmacy on hand to get immediate help in choosing a plan.   2) Online: Go to Medicare.gov to review prescription drug coverage options.   The Medicare program can often be confusing, so please do not hesitate to call my Sarasota office at 941-951-6643 or my Bradenton office at 941-747-9081 for assistance with open enrollment.   More details on Medicare Open Enrollment are available online in the U.S. Government Medicare handbook.     Vern

With Voters’ Revolt Against Tax Hike Bill, Time to Restore SALT is Now
￼
If you look at the map, and add up the numbers, there were few things clearer on this November. The states that got stuck with paying the bill for the federal Tax Hike Bill last year, the states where gutting the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction had the biggest impact on their pocketbooks, revolted. 

I joined Congressman Bill Pascrell, Ramsey Mayor Deirdre Dillon, and members of the Ramsey Borough Council at the Ramsey salt depot to officially launch the bipartisan fight to reinstate the SALT deduction in the new 116th Congress. 

I look forward to working with my new colleagues in Congress to stop double taxation, actually cut taxes for northern New Jersey, kill the New Jersey-targeted political games coming out of the IRS, and prevent more people and businesses from moving out of Jersey to the Moocher States.

The full video of our event can be found HERE.

You can find The Record’s reporting on the event HERE.

This Veterans Day, Securing Housing & Saving 84-Year-Old Veteran $145,000 a Year 

In honor of Veterans Day, I visited former Specialist 3rd Class Ronald Mitchell at the Paramus Veterans Memorial Home. Earlier this year, I helped Ronald access veterans housing after he lacked the appropriate documentation.

Ronald reached out to my office to help him access the veteran home benefits he had earned through his service in the United States Army in Germany in the 1950s. At the time, he was staying at a nursing facility that cost him approximately $400 per day, or about $145,000 a year. Admission to the Paramus Veterans Memorial Home requires proof of military service and Ronald's copy of his service documents were destroyed in the flooding during Hurricane Sandy. 

After contacting multiple agencies and previous employers, my office was able to produce the necessary forms through the National Archives to prove Ronald’s service and he moved into Paramus Veterans Memorial Home in September of this year.

To me, there is no commitment more sacred than the one to those who have bravely served our nation. Ronald bravely served our country overseas in Germany, I am proud to help him and make sure he gets the same care as when he took care of us during his time in the military.

If you are having trouble with your veterans benefits or a federal agency, contact my office HERE.

In Face of Growing Opioid Crisis, Helping Mahwah Secure Competitive $300,000 Federal Grant 

With more than 40,000 deaths per year, the opioid crisis in this country is devastating our families, neighbors, and communities. New Jersey is not immune. In 2017, we lost 2,221 New Jersey mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters to this terrible epidemic. Six of our friends and family every single day. One of our neighbors every 4 hours. It shouldn’t be this way.

I joined Mahwah Police Chief James Batelli, Ramapo College President Peter Mercer, and local community health experts to celebrate Mahwah securing a $299,360 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to combat the devastating opioid abuse epidemic.

We need to do more. I am proud of Mahwah for being one of only two New Jersey towns to claw back this competitive grant back from Washington to battle the crisis head on. At the event, I also thanked our brave first responders, who are on the front lines of this epidemic fighting to keep our communities safe and healthy.

The full video of our event can be found HERE.

In Wake of Pittsburgh Tragedy, Visiting Synagogues and Emphasizing Increased Security
￼
In the aftermath of the deadly attack on worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, PA, I visited congregations across North Jersey to mourn the devastating tragedy and reaffirm the Fifth District’s commitment to combating anti-Semitism and protecting houses of worship.

At Congregation Keter Torah in Teaneck, I joined Dr. Mort Fridman, President of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), to pledge to continue working to secure grants for temples and synagogues to better protect our community. 

I also joined Senator Cory Booker and Congressman Bill Pascrell at a vigil for the Pittsburgh victims at the Kaplen Jewish Community Center on the Palisades in Tenafly, and attended a vigil at the Jewish Community Center in Paramus alongside Senator Bob Menendez and congregations from across North Jersey.

I am proud that synagogues and religiously-affiliated nonprofits across the Fifth District clawed back nearly $2 million in grants, including $150,000 for Keter Torah, from the Department of Homeland Security’s Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP). These grants help protect our families and communities from growing threat of anti-Semitism and violent extremism.

The safety and security of our places of worship is a bedrock American value. I am committed to working across party lines to make sure that all Americans can observe their religion free from fear. 

Video from my visit to Congregation Keter Torah can be found HERE.

Demanding Action at Vernon Waste Pile
￼
Dumping potentially contaminated waste next to Vernon's water wells is a threat to our community. I visited the Waste Mountain on Silver Spruce Drive in Vernon with Mayor Harry Shortway, Freeholder Herb Yardley, and other town officials to survey the site and document my findings to send back to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). Simple testing of the waste mountain would provide critical information on its safety for the community.

We need discrete environmental testing, which I believe is necessary to assess any chemical compounds or contamination. I’ve written to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the Governor’s office because a simple test could prove if the water is safe. The people of Vernon deserve an answer. 

I am very concerned for the safety and health of the residents of Vernon, and I will continue to fight for their clean water by pushing officials in New Jersey and Washington to deal with these ongoing potential public health issues.

A copy of my letter to Catherine McCabe, Commissioner of the New Jersey DEP, can be found HERE.

A video of my visit can be found HERE. 



Running and Raising for Charity for Thanksgiving at Upper Saddle River 5K
￼
On Thanksgiving morning, before digging into a great turkey dinner with my family, I joined more than 2,000 runners for the 20th annual Upper Saddle River 5K Run. The event benefited the Upper Saddle River Ambulance Corps and the Upper Saddle River Fire Department, as well as local charities like the Boys and Girls Club, the Center for Hope and Safety, the Upper Saddle River Education Fund, and the “Extra Mile” Scholarship Foundation.

This time of year, we should all be thinking about what we can do for others. This race was a great way to make an impact on our community. It was great to see everyone coming out on Thanksgiving morning to show their support for these important causes.

Thank you to the Upper Saddle River Police Department and the Fire Department for giving up their time on Thanksgiving morning to make sure runners were safe and the race went smoothly.

Accepting “Legislator of the Year” Honor from the New Jersey State PBA
￼
Earlier this month, I was proudly received Legislator of the Year award from the 33,000 members of the New Jersey State Police Benevolent Association (PBA).

Our police officers are heroes. They deserve our deep appreciation for their work and deserve our full support for everything they do to protect our communities from crime and Lone Wolf terror.

That’s why I will continue to do everything I can in Congress to make sure our law enforcement and first responders have the resources they need to keep us safe and keep themselves safe, including clawing back more of our federal tax dollars for our first responders.

More information on the work I’m doing in Congress to have the backs of our law enforcement and first responders can be found HERE. 



Helping Out the Applebee’s Lunch Rush on my ‘Josh on the Job’ Tour

I joined the staff at Applebee’s in Paramus to wait and bus tables for lunch as part of my “Josh on the Job” Tour. 

Applebee’s in Paramus has been a neighborhood institution since opening in 1994. With great food and a welcoming staff, Applebee’s also provides a great opportunity for how so many in our country to get their first job or their start in a small business.

There is nothing small about the impact of small businesses on the North Jersey economy. They’re the key to strong economic growth. In Congress, I will continue to fight to lower taxes, cut red tape, and invest in New Jersey infrastructure, so that small businesses like Applebee’s can come, stay, and thrive here.

Beatty led effort to make Buckeye State first in the nation to recognize “Rosa Parks Day”
 Last night, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) held her Community Leaders Forum, “Footsteps: We All Have a Role to Play.” The Forum recognizes the courage and legacy of “the Mother of the Modern Civil Rights Movement,” and provides an important venue to discuss the ""Power of One,"" its continuing importance to Central Ohio and the nation, as well as on the legislative work of the upcoming 116th Congress. Special guests Andrea Davis Pinkney, author of Boycott Blues: How Rosa Parks Inspired a Nation; Joanna Pinkerton, President and CEO of the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA); Andrew Ginther, Mayor of the City of Columbus; and Dr. Michael Drake, President of The Ohio State University, joined Beatty at the Forum held at the Fawcett Event Center Auditorium. 
 
“Rosa Parks forever changed the world. She was the embodiment of the ‘Power of One,’” Beatty said. “Her life and actions on that historic December day is a touchstone moment for me and so many Americans—not to mention people across the world. By sitting down, Rosa Parks stood up for what is right and just.” Beatty continued, “It is our collective responsibility to honor Rosa Parks and the ‘Power of One’ by following in her footsteps. We all have a role to play.""
 
Ginther, Drake, Pinkerton, and Pinkney echoed Beatty’s message, highlighting how they too are walking in the footsteps of Rosa Parks and living the “Power of One.” During the Forum, Ginther made a surprise announcement that High Street, between Broad and Gay Streets, would be renamed “Rosa Parks Way” in honor of Parks and to celebrate the kickoff of the 15-year anniversary of Ohio’s Rosa Parks Day.
 
Beatty’s Community Leaders Forum coincides with the State of Ohio’s annual observance of “Rosa Parks Day,” a statewide tribute first conceived by then-State Representative Joyce Beatty. In 2005, Beatty wrote, advocated, and won unanimous support for a bill to designate December 1st as “Rosa Parks Day” in the Buckeye State. Her piece of legislation was signed into law by former Governor Bob Taft and made the State of Ohio the first state in the nation to recognize “Rosa Parks Day.”

Dear Neighbor,

This is just a quick reminder that my office is accepting internship applications for the spring semester until Monday, December 10th! 

Working in a Congressional office can be an incredibly rewarding and exciting experience. An internship provides an excellent opportunity to gain valuable experience, and observe first-hand how our government operates. 

Interns in the Washington office draft constituent correspondence, attend briefings and Congressional hearings, and prepare memoranda for me and members of my staff. Interns in the District Office conduct research, assist with constituent casework and draft correspondence. Interns in both offices assist with answering phones, data entry and general office systems operations. Interns are an important part of my staff.

Interns are accepted throughout the year on a part-time basis, and priority is given to college-level students from the 11th District. Selection is based on an applicant's general office and computer experience, interview, and a short writing sample. Please submit a cover letter, resume and a brief writing sample to the office of your choice.

The application deadline for the spring semester is December 10th. Please email your information to:

Dear Friend, 
With less than two weeks left of the open enrollment period to sign up for health coverage, now is the best time to compare plans and find the best one for you. 
Why is it important to get covered?
Health care is expensive. Without coverage, families can face extreme financial burdens for unexpected illnesses and injuries. The cost of a three-day hospital stay averages $30,000. Health coverage helps to ensure that your family can afford a health care emergencies and that one bill will not send you into bankruptcy. 
In addition, the vast majority of those seeking coverage through healthcare.gov qualify for some form of financial assistance. Last year, approximately 80 percent of those using healthcare.gov found plans for $50-$100 per month.  
￼ 
Need help enrolling? Free help is available via healthcare.gov and through a toll-free Consumer Call Center at 1-800-318-2596 where trained operators are available to assist with comparing plans, enrollment applications, and determining eligibility. In addition, you can look for in-person assistance by clicking here. 
There is a shorter enrollment period this year. With the deadline of December 15th fast approaching, please take the time to ensure that the health of your family is prioritized during the upcoming year and enroll in health coverage.

Remembering President George H.W. Bush
￼
Statement from Congressman Cook:

""America lost a statesman and true patriot. President Bush spent his entire life in service to our nation. His service began as a naval aviator during World War II and continued as a Congressman, Ambassador, CIA Chief, Vice President, and President. Even after leaving office, Bush continued to serve through his tireless work to raise money for disaster relief and other charitable causes. America will never forget President George H.W. Bush's steadfast leadership and unwavering commitment to our nation."" 

On Monday, a eulogy ceremony was held in the Capitol to honor and remember former President George H.W. Bush. Our nation's 41st president is now Lying in State in the Capitol Rotunda until Wednesday, December 5, for the public to come inside and pay respects. A funeral service for President Bush is planned for Wednesday at the Washington National Cathedral before he is flown back home to Texas for a funeral on Thursday at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston. President Bush will then be laid to rest at the site of his presidential library on the campus of Texas A&M University beside his wife of 73 years, Barbara Bush, and daughter Robin, who was 3 years old when she died of leukemia in 1953. President Bush lead an admirable life of service to the American people and will be remembered for generations to come.

Dear Friend,

Health insurance can protect you when a serious accident or illness occurs and provide preventative care. Did you know that the average cost for a three-day hospital stay is $30,000? Or that a broken leg can cost up to $7,500? Health insurance helps protect you from unexpected costs like these, and coverage could be more affordable than you think.     

November 1st marked the start of HealthCare.gov’s open enrollment period for 2019 coverage.


From now until December 15, you can purchase a plan or renew your coverage through HealthCare.gov. Once you sign up, you will get coverage that starts on January 1, 2019.

Here are four facts you need to know about enrolling in coverage or renewing your coverage:

	•	The open enrollment period for HealthCare.gov for 2019 ends on December 15. The open enrollment period is only 45 days. Beat the rush and sign up early.
	•	Coverage could be more affordable than you think. That’s because financial help is available. During last year’s enrollment period, 8-in-10 people qualified for financial help.
	•	If you had coverage through HealthCare.gov for 2018, make sure to head back to update your information and compare your options for 2019, by December 15. Every year, plans and prices change. You may find a plan that fits you better, for cheaper.
	•	Free help is available. If you have questions about signing up or want to talk through your options with a trained professional, free help is just a call or click away. The Call Center is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week – call 1-800-318-2596. Or visit https://localhelp.healthcare.gov where you will find organizations in your area that have trained enrollment assisters.
Take the time to learn about your options. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact my office.
Remember, I am here to work for you. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to e-mail me, call my office, or connect with me on Facebook and Twitter.
Sincerely,
￼
Bill Foster

Update from  
Congressman Peter DeFazio 
   
No More Time to Waste 
In 2016, policymakers at the Paris climate talks commissioned the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to conduct research on the impact that global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels would have on the planet. In October, the IPCC released their alarming findings: we only have twelve years to significantly curb carbon emissions in order ensure that global warming does not exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius. Even a half degree above 1.5 degrees Celsius would considerably worsen droughts, flooding, fires, and other extreme weather events, which in turn would exasperate global poverty, harm public health, damage the economy, spur large migration flows, and cause massive environmental damage that may not be reversible. 
Additionally, thirteen U.S. federal agencies – including the Environmental Protection Agency – jointly published a climate report on November 23. This report, the National Climate Assessment, makes clear that every region of the country is already experiencing the detrimental effects of climate change, and it warns that “[f]uture impacts and risks from climate change are directly tied to decisions made in the present.” The report also predicts that, by the end of this century, global warming will damage the U.S. economy even more than the Great Recession did. The Trump administration released the report on the Friday after Thanksgiving, hoping it would be ignored. President Trump said he didn’t believe his own administration’s findings.  
Despite what President Trump tweets, the IPCC and U.S. reports cannot be ignored. I have long believed and emphatically stated that climate change is an existential threat to the planet. We need a bold, dramatic change in policy to address the growing threats. 
In the November election, voters sent Congress a strong message that they demand immediate action to combat climate change. I will support any committee that would implement ambitious new ideas to address the threat of climate change head-on. I look forward to continuing work with my colleagues on an agenda that includes a massive federal investment in new technologies, a radical reduction in greenhouse gasses, and other bold ideas.
A decade ago I was one of the first sponsors of a bill to cap, regulate, and reduce emissions. I was also an original member of the first Climate Change Caucus in the House. But with climate deniers still in control in the White House and Senate, we need renewed energy and activism to achieve real change. You can be sure I will continue to do everything in my power to advance effective legislation that reduces carbon emissions and other greenhouse gasses.
  
Fighting for Working Families 
Earlier this week, General Motors announced plans to eliminate 14,000 jobs, or 15 percent of its workforce, and halt production at four U.S. plants. I am appalled that GM has taken its massive savings from the Republican tax plan, totaling over $500 million, and not only failed to invest in new American jobs but put thousands of hardworking Americans out of work. The federal government has given a wealth of support to GM over the years, from the 2009 auto industry bailout to the recent Republican corporate tax cut costing Americans $1.5 trillion. Yet GM has taken that money and invested it in factories abroad, as well as spent over $10 billion in stock buybacks – double what their recent job cuts will save.
Furthermore, last week House Republicans attempted to push yet another partisan tax package to the House floor, which would have added an additional $53 billion to the deficit this year and made dozens of changes to the poorly written tax law that Republicans pushed through last December. To be clear, I support changes to improve this terrible tax law and provide real relief for hard-working Americans. However, this most recent tax package would do nothing to address the staggering inequality exacerbated by the GOP’s tax law, which was a massive handout to millionaires and huge corporations that left American workers behind and exploded our national debt. If Republicans were serious about addressing the mess they’ve made with their tax law, they would work across the aisle on these technical corrections rather than give another handout to big business.
In fact, another corporate handout could not be more poorly timed. According to a recent report from the St. Louis Federal Reserve, the total wages of American workers are lagging further behind corporate profits than they ever have before. As seen in the graph below, while the two increased evenly from 1947 through 2003, workers’ wages have remained relatively stagnant for the past 15 years while corporate profits have skyrocketed.
￼  
The report shows that workers have become much more productive in recent years, but companies haven’t been sharing their profits with the employees who make them possible. Further, despite rising health-care costs, companies continue to shift more and more of these expenses onto workers. Instead of granting pay raises to workers or improving employee benefits, corporations have selfishly enjoyed their massive $1.5 trillion tax cut by spending $1 trillion in stock buybacks, not to mention the additional funds they have put towards inflating CEO bonuses and sending factories and manufacturing plants abroad.
Meanwhile, American families have paid the price. One in four American families skip doctor visits for fear of medical costs. Low-income families spend half their monthly income on child care. A quarter of workers make less than $10 an hour, below the federal poverty line. Thirty percent of individuals in Lane County alone pay over half of their income on rent.
I oppose the GOP tax law, and I will continue to introduce common-sense fixes to refocus our economy toward supporting working Americans. I also support closing tax loopholes that reward multinational corporations like GM for moving abroad. In fact, while Republicans promised their tax bill would bring jobs back to the U.S., it has instead encouraged multinational corporations to move overseas to avoid paying U.S. taxes. 
That’s why I introduced H.R. 6015, the Per-Country Minimum Act, to require the international tax rate to be applied on a per-country basis and eliminate the Republican tax break that encourages factories to move abroad. Last week, I was pleased that Senate Democrats introduced a companion to my bill. 
We simply cannot afford to enrich corporate interests while working families are struggling to make ends meet. From ensuring manufacturing jobs remain in the United States to supporting tax changes that actually benefit working Americans, you can be sure I will never stop fighting for American families and against corporate greed.
  
Protecting Special Counsel Mueller 
On November 7, President Trump forced Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign, installing Sessions’ chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, as Acting Attorney General. Throughout Sessions’ tenure, President Trump made clear that he was unhappy with Sessions’ decision to recuse himself from overseeing Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s attempts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Because of Sessions’ recusal, oversight of the Mueller investigation fell to Trump-appointed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. 
President Trump’s decision to appoint Whitaker, who has publicly stated his opposition to the Mueller investigation and declared it a “witch hunt,” is a blatant attempt by the president to sideline Rosenstein and undermine the Mueller investigation. So far, Whitaker has yet to recuse himself from the investigation. This is absurd. Special Counsel Mueller must be allowed to complete his investigation free from political influence, including from President Trump.
That’s why I am a cosponsor of H.R. 5476, the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, which would protect Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation by ensuring that the Special Counsel can only be removed by the senior most Department of Justice (DOJ) official not recused from the matter. This legislation would also prevent the president from installing an acting Attorney General who could then fire the Special Counsel at the president’s request. Additionally, if the Special Counsel is fired, H.R. 5476 would provide the Special Counsel with a 10-day window to seek expedited judicial review to determine whether the firing was for good cause. If the judicial panel determines that the firing was not for good cause, the Special Counsel’s removal will not go into effect.
I was pleased to see the Senate version of this legislation pass the Republican-led Senate Judiciary Committee in April. However, while the Committee’s action was a step in the right direction, the bill still needs to pass the full Senate and the House. Encouragingly, Senator Jeff Flake has committed to holding up votes for judicial nominees in the Senate in order to force a vote on this legislation, and House Democrats are currently working to include language to protect the Mueller investigation in the Fiscal Year 2019 spending bill that must pass before Congress adjourns. 
You can be sure I will continue to speak out against Republicans’ dangerous attempts to discredit the Mueller investigation by trying to undermine public trust in our law enforcement and intelligence agencies. 
  
Defending Voting Rights  
and Ending Voter Suppression 
During the recent mid-term elections, contests across several states were plagued by blatant voter suppression efforts, many of which disproportionately affected low-income and minority voters. Voter suppression is an embarrassment to the democratic values we hold in the United States, and they must not be allowed to continue.
Voters should not be forced to wait in line for hours. They should not have to contend with faulty voting machines that break or miscount their votes. They should not be subjected to onerous registration laws that disenfranchise them, such as the suppression efforts against Native American tribes in North Dakota. Yet, voters across the nation face issues like these every Election Day.
In fact, the United States is consistently ranked as having one of the worst levels of electoral integrity of any Western democracy. That’s downright embarrassing. 
Thankfully, in a recent study ranking states by ease of voting, Oregon was ranked number one as the easiest state to vote in. That's why I am a strong supporter of Oregon's system of mail-in ballots and automatic voter registration, which increases voter turnout and eliminates the voter suppression efforts that come with physical polling places and opt-in voter registration.
I believe more states should follow our example, which is why I’m a co-sponsor of the Vote By Mail Act and the Automatic Voter Registration Act. I’m also a co-sponsor of several bills that would protect and improve voting rights across the United States, such as the Voting Rights Advancement Act, the Voter Empowerment Act, and the Redistricting Reform Act.
The right to vote is a foundation of our democracy. I have—and always will—fight for every American citizen to have access to free, fair, and transparent elections.

As someone who was born and raised in Northeast Ohio, I cherish my memories fishing and swimming in Lake Erie. Knowing the Great Lakes hold a special place in our hearts, Kelly and I made sure to share with our children the beauty and many benefits of the Lakes. 
Aside from the obvious recreational benefits the Lakes offer, the Great Lakes constitute the largest system of surface freshwater on Earth. Our Lakes generate more than 1.5 million jobs and $60 billion in wages annually. Congress must continue to protect this critical resource so our future generations can reap the same benefits. 
In Congress, I am known as the ""Great Lakes guy."" I am a proud champion of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI). This program provides vital funding to federal agencies and local communities to restore the Great Lakes ecosystem and economic health of the Great Lakes region. The GLRI funds important efforts to combat Harmful Algal Blooms on Lake Erie and keep aquatic invasive species, like Asian carp, out of the Lakes. 
We all know that the Great Lakes are a national treasure. Yet year after year, no matter who is in the White House, funding for the GLRI is either proposed to be slashed or eliminated altogether. After another successful year of securing the full $300 million for the GLRI, I am proud to lead yet another effort to secure robust funding for the GLRI in the upcoming fiscal year. 
Do you support the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and my efforts to preserve and protect our Great Lakes?

Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke  New York's Ninth Congressional District
Fall 2018 Newsletter
Greetings,
Fall recess has been wonderful in New York’s Ninth Congressional District, from connecting with constituents, to visiting local businesses, and attending events across Brooklyn. I am back in Washington to continue my work on behalf of my constituents. Looking ahead to the 116th Congress, we will have one of the most diverse bodies of Congress in our nation's history; a more accurate reflection of our nation and a better representation of the priorities of the American people. I am working with my colleagues to ensure your voices are heard as we tackle issues such as housing, immigration reform, Medicaid and Medicare, and lowering prescription drug prices. As always, I encourage each of you to reach out to my office with any questions or concerns, where my staff can assist you. In this newsletter, you will find the latest legislative updates, as well as recent events and hot-button issues within our community. I am grateful for your continued trust and support.
Yours in Service,
￼
Updates from 'The Hill'
	•	Congresswoman Clarke and Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Cedric Richmond sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen calling upon her to desist from plans to move forward with the DHS proposed public charge rule. This rule would permit the Department of Homeland Security to deny green cards to those who received more than $1,800 in specified government benefits in a given year. These benefits include Temporary Assistance for Needed Families (TANF), Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), Social Security Income, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs. Click here to read the letter.  
	•	Congresswoman Clarke is an original co-sponsor of Representative Judy Chu's “No Federal Funds for Public Charge Act” (H.R. 7052), which would block funding for the proposed public charge rule. 
	•	Congresswoman Clarke is a proud original co-sponsor of H. Res 1110 to recognize the week of October 1st-October 8th 2018 as ""Smart Cities Week."" This resolution would support further research, development and adoption of technology designed to improve efficiency, connectivity, sustainability, and mobility in transportation, infrastructure, and workforce opportunities in American cities. Congresswoman Clarke and Congressman Darrell Issa (CA-49) launched the Congressional Smart Cities Caucus earlier this year to encourage lawmakers engage on smart cities and to think about how technology can improve their constituent's lives.  
	•	November 5, 2018 marked the 50th Anniversary of Shirley Chisholm's historic election to the United States Congress. In Ms. Chisholm’s honor, Congresswoman Clarke joined Congressman Hakeem Jeffries (NY-08) and other members of the New York Delegation to announce H.R. 7170. H.R. 7170 is a bill that would award Shirley Chisholm with the Congressional Gold Medal posthumously. This bill, similar to Congresswoman Clarke's bill, H.R. 4856 and its Senate companion bill S. 2467, would commemorate Shirley Chisholm's life and her contributions to our nation in the U.S. Capitol. Chisholm, the first Black woman and Caribbean-American legislator elected to the United States Congress, created a path for the Congresswoman and over 40 Black women who have served in Congress after her. It’s only fitting that her incredible life and living legacy honored. This bill is supported by the National Urban League, League of Women Voters and Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., among others. Congresswoman Clarke also introduced a bicameral resolution to honor Shirley Chisholm along with Congresswoman Barbara Lee (CA-13) and Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY). 
***Constituent Highlight***
Constituent, Maria Munyangire has been working with our office since August 2016. She is a mother of two who immigrated to the U.S. from the Democratic Republic of Congo seeking opportunities and a better life. After losing touch with her two sons, who she assumed were deceased, Maria fought through physical and mental health challenges to advocate for her sons. With the help of our office, led by Director of Constituent Services Mary Bishop, Maria was reunited with her sons Dennis and Jerry on October 2nd, 2018. Read her story:
""It feels as though a dream has come true. I haven't seen my boys in nineteen years, since one was two and the other two months old and I thought I would never see them again.""
Maria filed for her sons to come to the United States in 2015, but she was having difficulty getting her case expedited. Her lawyer suggested she reach out to the office of her member of Congress, where she first met Mary Bishop. Maria was admittedly broken and a bit hopeless. Her sons were taken and raised by her late husband's family, who changed their names and birthdates to conceal their identity. She had long been diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) derived from her experience losing her children in 1999, but recalled the warm environment of the office making her feel comfortable. ""I came here crying, not knowing what to do because they were in Kenya, living on the streets with no food and sick with pneumonia. I explained this to the office and they calmed me down and introduced me to Mary Bishop. She told me 'You're in the right place, we will help you get your children.' I didn't believe, but she never stopped encouraging me.""

￼ (Mary Bishop, Maria Munyangire, and sons Jerry and Dennis)
With the help of our office, Maria was pointed to resources that would help her case. She was able to use the church community in Kenya to get medical documents for her sons and get documentation regarding her own medical condition to make a case for expedition. Throughout every step, Maria kept in touch with Mary, who she said provided a sense of comfort despite the chaos. ""I usually came here whenever there was an update, I would say 'Today I'm going to bother Ms. Mary again'. All the time for two years, I felt like my life was just crying, crying, crying..."" Maria was worried that she would not be able to reunite with her sons before the eldest's 21st birthday. ""So, I came to Ms. Mary again to bother her. She helped.""
Our office made inquiries requesting that Maria's case be expedited by USCIS and by the National Visa Center and was successful. ""When [the office] told me my sons got visas, this was a miracle,"" Maria said through tears, ""I was overwhelmed with joy. I was happy and emotional, both together. Once they got visas, I got a little bit stronger, I began to work and with the help of my church and we raised money to get tickets for them Now they're here!"" Maria's sons arrived in the United States on October 2nd, two weeks before Dennis' 21st birthday. 
""I know this would not have happened without this office. My son would have turned 21 in Kenya and I would have been hopeless.""
Now that they've been reunited, Maria says that she wakes up grateful to be reunited with her sons. When asked what their goals are, Maria stated that she would like to get her High School Equivalency and work toward becoming a nurse. Dennis, 21, would also like to earn his High School Equivalency, get a part-time job to help his mother and ultimately become a stylist because he loves fashion. Jerry, 19, is unsure, but knows he wants to go to school and work. He's just happy to be reunited with his mother.
Our office will continue to work with Ms. Maria Munyangire throughout this life changing transition.
Congresswoman Clarke Presents SSG. Edward Mrozik a Congressional Gold Medal Replica
On March 21st 2018, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), our nation’s first intelligence agency preceding the CIA, was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for its service during World War II. There are fewer than 100 living members of this trailblazing organization and one of them is a constituent of the Ninth Congressional District of New York. Congresswoman Clarke was honored to present Staff Sergeant Edward Joseph Mrozik with a replica of the Congressional Gold Medal in honor of his service to our nation as a member of the OSS. Read more here.

The Congressional Award
The Congressional Award is the United States Congress’ award for young Americans and is Congress’ only charity. The program is non-partisan, voluntary, and non-competitive. Young people may register when they turn thirteen and a half years old and must complete their activities by their 24th birthday. The young people who receive this award represent the very best of our nation and embody the ideals that America was built upon; hard work, commitment, camaraderie, and service to mankind. This year, Congresswoman Clarke served as co-chair for the Congressional Awards in New York where she presented the award to over 30 scholars. Read more here.

Emergency Preparedness Training in Crown Heights
Congresswoman Clarke teamed up with the American Red Cross of Greater New York, Assemblywoman Diana C. Richardson (AD-43) and Assemblywoman Jaime R. Williams (AD-59) to host an Emergency Preparedness Training in Crown Heights. Crown Heights has a vibrant and rich history with many historic buildings. These buildings, though beautiful, have not been updated to suit the needs of today's families. These buildings are more susceptible to disasters due to issues like poor ventilation and lack of emergency access points. 
It's important to have an emergency preparedness procedure for your family to plan, execute, and recover from any disaster. For more information about emergency preparedness, please contact our district office. Click here for a full recap of the training.

Washington Highlights
Congresswoman Clarke joined Leader Pelosi, Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Bernie Sanders, and other Members of Congress for National Action Network’s Annual Legislative and Policy Conference in Washington, DC. The Congresswoman discussed priorities for the 116th Congress including lowering prescription drug prices, strengthening the middle-class, affordable housing, and more. 
￼ (Congresswoman Clarke speaking at NAN Conference in Washington, D.C.)
Congresswoman Clarke joined Congresswoman Maxine Waters for a roundtable discussion with student leaders on student civil rights. The Congresswoman is an original cosponsor of the Education Department Civil Rights Transparency Act (H.R.6537). This bill would hold Education Secretary Betsy DeVos accountable for any actions she takes to undermine students' civil rights.

P.S. 321 Family Friday
Congresswoman Clarke joined P.S. 321 William Penn School for Family Day this year. In addition to meeting with parents and educators, Family Day reaffirms our commitment to fostering an environment where parents, educators, and students play a collective and collaborative role in the development of our youth. Spending some time with our leaders of tomorrow prepares Congresswoman Clarke to be refreshed and renewed as she returns to the hustle and bustle of Washington.

Girl Scouts Troop 2010
The future is female. Congresswoman Clarke was invited to Girl Scouts Troop 2010's meeting in Sheepshead Bay to talk about what it means to be a woman in Congress. The girls enjoyed a vibrant discussion about their goals and how they can incorporate service into everything they do. From veterinarians to entrepreneurs, to Congress, girls can do anything! A record number of women from diverse backgrounds were elected to Congress, all with the common goal of making a difference on behalf of their constituencies. Maybe one of these troop members will come to Congress one day!

Important Constituent Information
USCIS
Use of Digital Tablets
On Oct. 1, USCIS began using digital tablets to administer the English reading and writing tests during naturalization interviews as part of the agency’s ongoing business modernization efforts. Although USCIS applicants already use digital tablets to sign or verify parts of their applications, this new approach expands tablet usage, allowing the device to be used for a greater portion of the application process. USCIS will continue to use the paper process on a case-by-case basis.
While the eligibility requirements and the subject material of the naturalization test have not changed, applicants are now using a stylus on a digital tablet instead of a paper application. Immigration Services Officers (ISO) will carefully instruct applicants on how to use the tablets before administering the tests:
	•	For the reading test, a sentence will appear on the tablet and the ISO will ask the applicant to read it.
	•	For the writing test, several lines will appear on the tablet, replicating the appearance of a piece of blank paper. The ISO will read a sentence aloud and ask the applicant to write it on the tablet.
Applicants will continue to take the civics test verbally, without the tablet.
 
Pilot Fee Payment Program at Two USCIS Los Angeles Field Offices may come to New York if successful
On Nov. 5, 2018, applicants, petitioners, or other requesters who are paying a filing fee at the Los Angeles Field Office and Los Angeles County Field Office will no longer be able to pay by money orders or cashier’s checks. They can still pay by check, debit card, credit card, or reloadable pre-paid credit or debit cards, which USCIS personnel will process through a new electronic system. USCIS is launching a pilot at these two field offices to test electronic payment processing, which will increase transaction security and reduce processing errors that could cause USCIS to reject applications and petitions. Beyond limiting the kind of payment USCIS will accept through this new system, applicants will not experience a change in how they pay their fees.
This internal transition is part of USCIS’ ongoing efforts to modernize its business practices, allowing USCIS field office staff to process applicants’ payments in a quicker, more secure online system. This will reduce processing errors on applications that would previously have led to rejection for non-payment. It will also increase security and traceability of payments for applicants.

12/4/18 11:22,Computer Science Education Week,"News from Representative Tom Emmer
￼

Dear Friend, 
This week is Computer Science Education Week!  
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields will only continue to grow in our workforce. In fact, today 58% of all new jobs are in computing.  
We must encourage the next generation to explore and innovate in order to meet the demands of future economy’s needs that we cannot yet predict. 
Since its inception, my office has participated in the Congressional App Challenge to encourage middle and high school students to develop their own software application (or, an “app”).   
Congratulations to this year’s Congressional App Challenge winners from Central Middle School in Norwood Young America: Josie Beneke, Kourtney Harms, Emma Hecksel, and Lauren Schmidt! 
Their app, ‘Lose it!’ is designed to manage the user’s weight. Those that use the app receive diet and exercise tips targeted towards weight loss. The app would also provide organic recipes and at-home exercises specifically for each unique user.  
Students like Josie, Kourtney, Emma and Lauren keep our nation moving forward to meet the needs of tomorrow’s workforce. Congratulations to these young Minnesotans! I look forward to seeing what they do in the future.  
Sincerely, 
￼

Remembering 41
Dear Friends,

This weekend, Dee Dee and I joined the entire Nation in mourning the passing of George H.W. Bush, an American patriot who served our country in capacities few others can ever claim: warrior, lawmaker, ambassador, Intelligence Chief, Vice President, and 41st President of the United States. His entire life embodied service to others, and he leaves behind a remarkable legacy of character and decency, especially in the manner in which he befriended political foes, reminding Americans that there is always more that unites us than divides us. 

Beyond his service to our country and alongside his beloved wife Barbara, President Bush was a tremendous father and role model for every American. As we remember his extraordinary life this week and honor him with a National Day of Mourning on Wednesday, I hope that we can all embody his spirit of service and his love for country and family. If you are in the Washington, D.C. area and would like to pay your respects, the U.S. Capitol Rotunda will be open to the public via the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) from Monday, December 3, 2018 at 7:30 p.m. until 7:00 a.m. on Wednesday, December 5, 2018. Please feel free to contact my D.C. office at (202) 225-4101 if you have any further questions. 

Our thoughts and prayers are with the entire Bush family as they mourn the passing of a true statesman. May his wise words remind us of the importance of public service, volunteerism, and charity: “No problem of human making is too great to be overcome by human ingenuity, human energy, and the untiring hope of the human spirit.”
￼

Committee Action
Last week in committee, the House Oversight and Government Reform (OGR) Committee tackled a few major issues. On Wednesday, we examined policies at the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and discussed how to form prison programs that contribute to the successful transition from inmate to civilian life. 

Unfortunately, systemic abuse is running rampant throughout the BOP, and its leadership is filled with bad actors, abuse, misconduct, and whistleblower intimidation. I was glad to have the opportunity to speak with Inspector General Michael Horowitz on his findings within the BOP. Click here to watch me speak with IG Horowitz and Acting Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons Hugh Hurwitz. 
￼

The following day, OGR held another hearing to discuss the effects and response of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the wake of the 2017 hurricane season. With Georgia having been hit hard by many of these storms, I was happy to hear from FEMA Administrator William “Brock” Long on the status of ongoing assistance. Our state still has many counties, farmers, and other individuals reeling from hurricanes like Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and I was encouraged by Administrator Long’s words and work in the face of these and other storms. Click here to watch me question Long on his preparation and future disaster response plans.

National Bible Week 
In celebration of National Bible Week, last Wednesday, I spoke on the House Floor about the impact of faith on my daily life as a pastor, a citizen, and a policymaker. I wholeheartedly believe that it is vitally important to recognize the essential role the Bible has played in the development of the history and culture of America and the world. I encourage you to listen to my remarks below. 
￼

Hice Helpers
Since coming to office, I’m proud that my team has hosted successful Mobile Office Hours events throughout each of the 25 counties that I represent. Holding these meetings in every corner of the district has provided another great opportunity to meet with local residents, elected officials, businesses, and organizations to hear what’s on their minds with regard to the Peach State and our Nation as a whole. These events provide you the chance to sit down with a member of my team to discuss your concerns, share their priorities, or seek help with a federal agency. 

This month, my constituent service representatives will be at the Greene County Chamber of Commerce on December 13th from 10:00 a.m. until noon and the AMVETS Post 10 in Athens on December 19th from 10:30 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. for those seeking assistance. I’m proud to have knowledgeable members of my team available to meet with you on a one-on-one basis to assist you during these upcoming events.

More Holiday Safety Tips
The holidays are known for time spent with the family. Whether you are out of town or at home for the holidays, it’s important to make sure you are taking the proper precautions when it comes to keeping your home safe. Nothing is worse than an unexpected fire due to the improper use of your holiday decorations. Make sure not to overcrowd your outlets when you are plugging in those Christmas lights, keep any flammable objects away from your fireplace, furnace, or space heater, and securely place your tree in an area that is far enough away from causing any damage if it were to fall.

It only takes a few easy steps to protect your home this season. To add that extra layer of protection and give you the peace of mind you need during this busy time, I encourage you to read more tips about holiday travel, cooking, fire safety, and communication courtesy of ready.gov.

The Week Ahead
For millions of people around the world who practice Judaism, Sunday marked the first night of Hanukkah. This beautiful celebration is manifested through public lightings of a menorah, oftentimes in public parks or outside synagogues in our neighborhoods. This year, after so much tragedy in Pittsburgh, I am certain that seeing the warm light of the menorah after the sun sets will be a heartening and uplifting inspiration. In America, there is the certain truth that we can come together to recognize and appreciate how faith, family, friends, and special traditions can bring light to the world. If you are celebrating Hanukkah or if you have friends and family who are, I wish you peace and joy this holiday season.  In the wake of President George H.W. Bush’s passing, the House has postponed votes and legislative business until Monday, December 10, 2018.   As always, I’m here to serve you. Please contact my office with any questions, comments, or concerns. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to keep track of upcoming legislation and events!  Sincerely,

Remembering 41
Dear Friends,

This weekend, Dee Dee and I joined the entire Nation in mourning the passing of George H.W. Bush, an American patriot who served our country in capacities few others can ever claim: warrior, lawmaker, ambassador, Intelligence Chief, Vice President, and 41st President of the United States. His entire life embodied service to others, and he leaves behind a remarkable legacy of character and decency, especially in the manner in which he befriended political foes, reminding Americans that there is always more that unites us than divides us. 

Beyond his service to our country and alongside his beloved wife Barbara, President Bush was a tremendous father and role model for every American. As we remember his extraordinary life this week and honor him with a National Day of Mourning on Wednesday, I hope that we can all embody his spirit of service and his love for country and family. If you are in the Washington, D.C. area and would like to pay your respects, the U.S. Capitol Rotunda will be open to the public via the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) from Monday, December 3, 2018 at 7:30 p.m. until 7:00 a.m. on Wednesday, December 5, 2018. Please feel free to contact my D.C. office at (202) 225-4101 if you have any further questions. 

Our thoughts and prayers are with the entire Bush family as they mourn the passing of a true statesman. May his wise words remind us of the importance of public service, volunteerism, and charity: “No problem of human making is too great to be overcome by human ingenuity, human energy, and the untiring hope of the human spirit.”

Committee Action
Last week in committee, the House Oversight and Government Reform (OGR) Committee tackled a few major issues. On Wednesday, we examined policies at the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and discussed how to form prison programs that contribute to the successful transition from inmate to civilian life. 

Unfortunately, systemic abuse is running rampant throughout the BOP, and its leadership is filled with bad actors, abuse, misconduct, and whistleblower intimidation. I was glad to have the opportunity to speak with Inspector General Michael Horowitz on his findings within the BOP. Click here to watch me speak with IG Horowitz and Acting Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons Hugh Hurwitz. 
￼

The following day, OGR held another hearing to discuss the effects and response of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the wake of the 2017 hurricane season. With Georgia having been hit hard by many of these storms, I was happy to hear from FEMA Administrator William “Brock” Long on the status of ongoing assistance. Our state still has many counties, farmers, and other individuals reeling from hurricanes like Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and I was encouraged by Administrator Long’s words and work in the face of these and other storms. Click here to watch me question Long on his preparation and future disaster response plans.
￼

National Bible Week 
In celebration of National Bible Week, last Wednesday, I spoke on the House Floor about the impact of faith on my daily life as a pastor, a citizen, and a policymaker. I wholeheartedly believe that it is vitally important to recognize the essential role the Bible has played in the development of the history and culture of America and the world. I encourage you to listen to my remarks below. 
￼

Hice Helpers
Since coming to office, I’m proud that my team has hosted successful Mobile Office Hours events throughout each of the 25 counties that I represent. Holding these meetings in every corner of the district has provided another great opportunity to meet with local residents, elected officials, businesses, and organizations to hear what’s on their minds with regard to the Peach State and our Nation as a whole. These events provide you the chance to sit down with a member of my team to discuss your concerns, share their priorities, or seek help with a federal agency. 

This month, my constituent service representatives will be at the Greene County Chamber of Commerce on December 13th from 10:00 a.m. until noon and the AMVETS Post 10 in Athens on December 19th from 10:30 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. for those seeking assistance. I’m proud to have knowledgeable members of my team available to meet with you on a one-on-one basis to assist you during these upcoming events.

More Holiday Safety Tips
The holidays are known for time spent with the family. Whether you are out of town or at home for the holidays, it’s important to make sure you are taking the proper precautions when it comes to keeping your home safe. Nothing is worse than an unexpected fire due to the improper use of your holiday decorations. Make sure not to overcrowd your outlets when you are plugging in those Christmas lights, keep any flammable objects away from your fireplace, furnace, or space heater, and securely place your tree in an area that is far enough away from causing any damage if it were to fall.

12/3/18 21:11,Protecting Our Communities from Catastrophic Fires,"Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email
￼ 
Dear Friend, 

Like you, I’ve followed with horror the wildfires that burned across California for the month of November. While they are finally contained, the Woolsey, Hill, Sierra, and Camp Fires destroyed tens of thousands of homes and acres, and far too many lives. More than two dozen people are still missing, and a staggering 88 people were killed. Even as we grieve with our neighbors in California, terrifying flash floods are causing even more damage. 

My heart goes out to all of those who have been affected, and I am tremendously grateful to the first responders and firefighters, including Oregonians, who have worked tirelessly to protect communities from the wrath of these catastrophic fires. Their bravery and courage is making a huge difference each day. 

In addition to on-the-ground emergency efforts, we need long-term strategies to limit the impacts of these violent fires. As our climate continues to warm, larger and more severe wildfires will break out more easily—and that means we can’t just rely on the same old fire prevention strategies. We need guaranteed funding and a massive effort to put people to work thinning our forests and making them more fire-resilient in order to stop cataclysmic wildfires—and barely-breathable air—from becoming a staple of western summers and autumns. 

That’s why I introduced the Wildfire-Resilient Communities Act, which would create a $1 billion fund to provide stability and allow the U.S. Forest Service to speed up and broaden the scale of its response to catastrophic wildfires. The bill also includes a permanent reauthorization of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program—which has proven effective in limiting fires in Oregon—as well as the creation of a County Stewardship Fund to provide counties with payments proportionate to the amount of federal land they contain. 

Communities are in dire need of the proper resources to protect themselves from these disastrous fires. Please know that I stand with communities at risk, and will continue fighting to fund the programs that keep them safe. 

All my best, 
Jeff

Kansas Common Sense  December 3, 2018
Hello,
 
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
Honoring the Life and Service of President George H.W. Bush President George H.W. Bush was a steadfast defender of freedom and liberty, from his time in the United States Navy to his many years of service in Congress, as vice president, and as our country’s 41st president. Our nation is grateful for his leadership through periods of conflict and uncertainty around the world. President Bush was a family man whose legacy of faith and service will live on. Robba and I offer our sincerest condolences to the Bush family and we pray that President Bush has been reunited with Barbara, his wife of 71 years, in Heaven.
Hosting NASA Administrator and NASA Astronaut for STEM Events in Kansas
On Saturday, I was honored to host NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine in South Central Kansas for a number events related to the aerospace industry in Kansas. During this visit, Administrator Bridenstine was able to clearly see our collective, vested interest in advancing the aviation and aerospace sectors and educating and training the next generation of STEM leaders and professionals.
Touring the National Institute of Aviation Research On Saturday morning, our first stop was at Wichita State University’s Innovation Campus where we toured the National Institute of Aviation Research (NIAR). Here, Administrator Bridenstine was able to see the innovative and groundbreaking work being done by Wichita State students and faculty to support the aerospace industry. WSU is a world-class example in educating students interested in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) with real-world, hands-on learning. 
 ￼ 
Hosting an Event for Students Interested in STEM and Space Exploration Following our tour at NIAR, we were at Exploration Place in Wichita were I hosted an event for students interested in careers and topics in STEM, space exploration and more. During this event, I was honored to be joined by Administrator Bridenstine as well as NASA Astronaut Don Pettit. We heard from Astronaut Pettit on his path to becoming an astronaut and the many expeditions he’s been a part of. I would like to thank CEO of WSU Tech Sheree Utash for moderating a panel discussion on opportunities in STEM, and the panelists for participating including Administrator Bridenstine, Astronaut Pettit, Superintendent of Wichita Public Schools Alicia Thompson and CEO of IdeaTek and Mayor of Buhler Daniel Friesen. 
One of my primary goals as a Senator is to create an environment in Kansas where young people who are interested in similar careers can receive a quality education and have robust career opportunities in Kansas following graduation. Events like this are important as we work to inspire and train the next generation of scientists, astronauts, researchers and more. 
 ￼ 
Attending Earthrising: The Celebration of Apollo 8 Saturday evening, following an afternoon tour of the Kansas Cosmosphere, it was an honor to speak at the 50th anniversary celebration of the Apollo 8 mission in Hutchinson. The honored guests included Apollo astronauts Jim Lovell, Walt Cunningham, Charlie Duke, Fred Haise, Jack Lousma and Harrison Schmitt. To so many of us, NASA astronauts like the distinguished few who came to Hutchinson this weekend are genuine American heroes. 
It always strikes me as I drive across Kansas when I see signs declaring the hometown of an astronaut. Astronaut Nick Hague, an extraordinary young man from Hoxie, will become the 4th Kansan in space this spring. He follows Steve Hawley of Ottawa, who flew five Space Shuttle missions, and Apollo-era astronauts Ron Evans of Topeka and Joe Engle of Chapman. One astronaut who didn’t fly in space but still made history was Kansas City, Kansas, native Captain Edward Dwight, who in 1963 became the first African American named to the astronaut program. Kansas has always had a pioneering spirit, and that was exemplified Saturday by our astronauts, engineers and manufacturers who contribute to the future of NASA space travel. Thank you to Jim Remar and Mimi Meredith for your leadership at the Cosmosphere, and for putting together a memorable event celebrating the Apollo 8 mission.

Finally, I want to thank NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine for making the effort to not only be here in Hutchison, but for his sincere interest in seeing firsthand how Kansans are making a difference in advancing space and science education, and for expressing NASA’s unequivocal desire to partner with Kansas. 
Chairing FTC Oversight Hearing on Data Privacy As chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Data Security, I held an oversight hearing of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Tuesday. In the subcommittee’s first hearing with all five new FTC commissioners since their confirmation this spring, we heard about efforts to meet their broad mandate to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive trade practices. The independent agency’s consumer protection mission includes protecting consumers from everything from robocalls, ticket bots, data breaches and beyond; and enforcing laws such as the Consumer Review Fairness Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.  
The discussion also included what federal consumer data privacy legislation should look like; as the main federal data privacy and security enforcer, the FTC’s input was valuable for our efforts to create a meaningful bipartisan bill. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues and the FTC to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive business practices and anti-competitive behavior.

Update on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) On Friday morning, President Trump joined Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto at the G20 Summit to sign the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement – a positive development for the country. This is a step in the right direction and should inspire the purchasers of our products, as well as those around the world, that America will continue to be a reliable supplier of top-line goods. I look forward to taking this agreement up in Congress where we can discuss its many provisions. 
Over the past year and a half, I have expressed directly and repeatedly to President Trump, Ambassador Lighthizer, Secretary Ross and my colleagues that we need more trade, not less. I have been clear that both Canada and Mexico – Kansas’ top two export markets – must be part of any final agreement. I appreciate the administration working to make certain these markets remain available to Kansas farmers, ranchers and manufacturers, providing them some much-needed certainty. 
Dedicating a Memorial to the Women of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion I was honored to take part in a ceremony on Friday for the dedication of a monument honoring the soldiers of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion. The memorial was designed and funded by the Buffalo Soldier Educational and Historical Committee and is now located in its permanent home in the Buffalo Soldier Memorial Park on Fort Leavenworth. The legacy of the 6888th is unique and special as the only all-female, all African-American unit in the Women’s Army Corps deployed overseas during World War II. I was particularly honored to meet several members of the 6888th who attended the ceremony – their continued commitment to their unit and their comrades inspires me and many. In recognition of their service, strength and sacrifice, I introduced Senate Resolution 412 in February honoring the members of this unit, which passed the Senate unanimously in October.  
 ￼
Breaking Ground on New Facilities for the 35th Infantry Division at Fort Leavenworth On Friday, I also participated in the combined groundbreaking ceremony for two major National Guard construction projects on Fort Leavenworth: the 35th Infantry Division Readiness Center and the Mission Training Complex Barracks. I was honored to be joined by Director of the Army National Guard Lieutenant General Timothy Kadavy and Kansas National Guard Adjutant General Major General Lee Tafanelli as we marked the occasion and all that it means for Fort Leavenworth.   
As a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies, I worked to fund over $51 million for both of the projects, which will increase the readiness of our Army National Guard in Kansas and Missouri. I’m pleased these projects are entering the construction phase and look forward to visiting them when they are complete. 
 ￼ 
Announcing Kansas Projects from the Army Corps of Engineers Work Plan In a big win for Kansas and the long-term sustainability of our water resources and infrastructure, two key projects were included in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers recently-announced work plan for FY2019. The first, funding for the Kansas River Reservoirs and Sediment Study, is one of only six new studies across the country that sets the stage for future Army Corps projects to systematically address key areas of need and risk of our 18 federal reservoirs in the Kansas River Basin and associated water resources. I’ve advocated for this study and it’s funding in 2016 and 2017, and I’m pleased to see this project launch in the coming fiscal year. 
The second, $18.5 million in federal funding for a flood protection project in Manhattan, is one of only five new construction projects across the country and is a critical development to protecting people in the Manhattan community for generations to come. I worked to include this authorization in the 2016 Water Resources Development Act, and it’s inclusion in the work plan is good news for many in the Manhattan region. 
Kansas depends on Corps of Engineers’ lakes for roughly 60 percent of its municipal and industrial water supply needs. These projects we championed will help secure the future of our water supply across a significant portion of the state and make certain our federal reservoirs and rivers can continue to support the fast growing populations near them with flood protection. To read more about these projects, click here. 
Voting to Assert Congressional Authority Over the Saudi-led War in Yemen It’s Congress’s constitutional responsibility to authorize when the American military engages in war. On Wednesday, I voted in favor of S.J. Res 54, a joint resolution denying American military involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen without Congressional approval. The passage of this resolution should help force a diplomatic resolution on the nearly four-year-long war and reduce the humanitarian crisis where 14 million Yemenis are on the brink of death from starvation. 
This isn’t the first time I’ve advocated for this measure. In March, I was one of five Republicans who voted to proceed to consideration of S. J. Res. 54, which failed 55-44. I have repeatedly expressed concern to the administration regarding the humanitarian impact of the siege of Hudaydah, Yemen, and have questioned the certification of Saudi compliance with American law. 
Speaking at Judge Holly Teeter’s Investiture Ceremony On Friday, I had the privilege of offering remarks at Judge Holly Teeter’s investiture in Lawrence, following her appointment and Senate confirmation to a seat on United States District Court in Kansas this fall. I met Judge Teeter for the first time when her name was put forward for the nomination – she is a person full of character, honesty and integrity. Coming into this position without a political agenda, Judge Teeter has a deep understanding of the job: to interpret the law as written and make sound decisions based upon the circumstances of each case. Judge Teeter will be a tremendous judge for the state of Kansas. 
Release of a Report on Veterans and Toxic Exposures This week, the National Academies of Sciences Committee on Gulf War and Health released a report that fulfills a mandate in my Toxic Exposure Research Act, which became law in December 2015. Their report confirmed what I have long believed and fought to rectify – that there are significant gaps in research related to the impacts of toxic exposure on servicemembers, their children and future generations. Nobody who serves this nation anticipates that their service will adversely impact the health of their family, yet far too often I hear from veterans who believe their exposure to a toxic substance during military service resulted in their children developing a health condition. It is positive news for our nation's veterans that the National Academies of Sciences concluded that more research is both necessary and feasible, and I will work to make certain these findings are acted upon by the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
Attending the Kansas Farm Bureau Annual Meeting On Sunday night in Manhattan, I attended the annual Kansas Farm Bureau (KFB) annual meeting, where KFB leaders from across the state come together to set the organization’s policies and goals for the coming year. This year is special, as it marks 100 years for KFB. Over the past century, KFB has played a crucial role in agriculture across Kansas and throughout the nation: KFB members display a commitment and dedication to preserving the way of life in rural Kansas and continue to be the leading voice of agriculture. I want to thank KFB President Rich Felts and Terry Holdren for inviting me to this year’s annual meeting to celebrate such a great milestone. 
At the banquet, I spoke about the importance of KFB to our state and to countless communities and organizations within it. In communities of all shapes and sizes, members of the KFB work tirelessly to support production agriculture, develop young men and women, contribute to their local economies, lead civic organizations and help give back to their neighbors and fellow community members. KFB has made an outstanding partner in my work, and our state is better off because of the many contributions of the organization.

Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends: 
I am deeply saddened to hear of the passing of President George H W Bush. An American hero, he loved his family and country and dedicated his entire life to serving both. His legacy of integrity, patriotism, kindness, and servant leadership is an example for us all. My heart goes out to my friend Jeb and the entire Bush family. Thank you for sharing your dad with us. Sandy and I are praying for you all.

______________ 
Last week, the House passed with my support H.R. 6777, the Settlement Agreement Information Database Act. This bill was introduced by my friend, Rep. Gary Palmer of Alabama. This bill improves government transparency by requiring all federal government settlement agreements be published and explained in an electronic, searchable database. American taxpayers deserve to know where their money is being spent. Closed door, private settlement agreements between the federal government and unknown parties are unacceptable. This bill is a great step towards the government transparency that Americans deserve. 
_______________ 
Tuesday, H.R. 6753, the Strengthening Healthcare Fraud Prevention Task Force Act, passed the House with my support. If signed into law, this bill will amend the Social Security Act to include the Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership (HFPP). This public-private partnership is a voluntary task force between federal and state governments, law enforcement, private health insurers, and health care anti-fraud associations. Healthcare industry leaders who work with Americans day in, day out, are the most knowledgeable in how to detect fraud and streamline services for patients. With their help, the government has improved its success rate in fighting fraud.  H.R. 6753 will give the HFPP the authority needed to better address fraud in our healthcare system. 
_______________ 
On Friday, President Trump announced that he, along with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, officially signed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) at the G-20 Summit in Argentina. This new trade deal builds on the decades-old NAFTA and is more-suited for the 21st Century. It provides Americans with the same economic prosperity achieved under NAFTA, but tackles many of the issues NAFTA did not, such as unbalanced trade deficits, lack of protection for technology, limited access to protected Canadian markets, low wage competition, and others. I applaud President Trump for his steadfast effort to fight for American workers and negotiate agreements that benefit Americans at home and on the world stage.

_______________ 
Thursday, I had the opportunity to meet with National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors from Ocala. We discussed the ways in which developments in the insurance and finance industries impact our constituents. Ensuring seniors receive the care they need and delivering on the government’s promises is a priority of mine. Social Security and Medicare are programs that represent promises to all Americans. These social insurance programs are designed to protect older Americans from certain risks, including a significant loss of earnings at retirement and necessary medical coverage. As insurance and finance markets continue to grow and change, the government needs to remain educated on these developments and how they will impact these programs and retirees.

Friday, marked the end of the 2018 Hurricane Season.  Yet, our fellow Floridians in the panhandle are still recovering from havoc wreaked by Hurricane Michael.  Many churches, nonprofit organizations and government entities such as Volunteer Florida continue to coordinate volunteer relief efforts to provide aid and assistance.  For more information on ways to get involved or donate, visit www.VolunteerFlorida.org.

Constituent Corner
A veteran from The Villages contacted our office regarding his chiropractic care. He had been receiving chiropractic care from a non-VA provider through the Veterans Choice Program, but his care stopped when his authorization period ran out.  The veteran had been experiencing delays in obtaining VA approval for a new authorization so that he could continue receiving the care.  Our office submitted an inquiry to the VA and within three days were informed that the VA had finalized a new authorization for the veteran to resume the chiropractic care.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.

Legislative Update
Last week, the House passed H.R. 4591, the Preventing Iranian Destabilization of Iraq Act, introduced by Rep. Adam Kinzinger. This bill will make sanctions imposed on foreign entities that threaten peace, stability, economic reconstruction, humanitarian assistance, political reform, or democracy in Iraq, official. It also allows visa denial and entry into the United States for those committing these awful acts against Iraq. These sanctions would expire in 2021. Furthermore, the bill requires the President to research and report to Congress whether certain entities and individuals meet criteria to be labeled as foreign terrorist organizations, or face sanctions. Under the bill, The Department of State must establish and maintain a list of armed groups that receive support and influence from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps.

12/3/18 18:18,The DeSaulnier Digest: Preparing for Democratic Majority,"
 
￼
￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ 

Dear Lindsey: 
As 2018 comes to an end, my colleagues and I are preparing for the new Democratic Majority that begins in January. Details on what we are doing to get ready and our priorities for the new Congress are included below. 
AT A GLANCE 
In this week's edition of the DeSaulnier Digest you will find updates on:  
	•	New Oversight reports on the impact of Republican policies on Contra Costa residents (Location: LEGISLATIVE UPDATE)
	•	What Democrats are preparing to do in the Majority (Location: IN THE NEWS ) 
	•	Wasteful spending at the Department of Defense (Location: IN THE NEWS)
Sincerely, ￼ Mark DeSaulnier Member of Congress 
LEGISLATIVE UPDATE 
Mark Releases New Oversight Reports on Impact of the Republican Tax Bill on Contra Costa Families 
As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (OGR), Mark is working to help hold Congress, the Administration, and the government accountable. In conjunction with OGR, Mark released two reports highlighting the negative impacts the Republican tax bill is having on Contra Costa homeowners and people with pre-exisiting conditions. Key findings from the two reports can be found below, and full copies are available at the links provided. 
Impact of Tax Bill on Housing in Contra Costa 
	•	About 53,000 homeowners in our communities will no longer be allowed to deduct their full property taxes;
	•	None of the approximately 160,000 homeowners will be allowed to claim deductions for interest paid on home equity loans taken for any reason other than home improvement; and
	•	30,000 homeowners will no longer be able to claim their full home equity interest deductions on federal taxes. 
￼ 
Impact of Policies on Individuals with Pre-Existing Conditions in Contra Costa  
	•	12,000 people in our district have pre-existing conditions severe enough that insurers may outright deny them coverage;
	•	Nearly 19,000 individuals between 50 and 64 years of age could lose federal protections against coverage denials and premium increases; and 
	•	As many as 403,000 individuals with employer-sponsored insurance may also be at risk of losing federal protections against premium increases and coverage denials.

Hello again,   I hope this newsletter finds you well.   Like many of you, I was touched by a number of the tributes to President George H.W. Bush after his passing over the weekend.  President Bush lived a life of patriotism and public service.   One example that struck me this weekend was a letter President Bush wrote to President Clinton and left for him in the White House. Here is the text:   Dear Bill,   When I walked into this office just now I felt the same sense of wonder and respect that I felt four years ago. I know you will feel that, too.   I wish you great happiness here. I never felt the loneliness some Presidents have described.   There will be very tough times, made even more difficult by criticism you may not think is fair. I'm not a very good one to give advice; but just don't let the critics discourage you or push you off course.   You will be our President when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well.   Your success now is our country's success. I am rooting hard for you.   Good luck -   George   This genuine civility and statesmanship is something we should all respect as Americans.   
￼ 
It’s been a busy couple of weeks since Thanksgiving. And it’s going to be a busy December. In Washington, DC, Congress is yet again working against the clock to avoid a partial government shutdown. More on that in a bit...but first, I want to focus on something that’s received and deserves a lot of attention. 
Righting a Wrong   As I mentioned in my newsletter a few weeks ago, I recently visited veterans at the UW-Tacoma to talk about how they’ve been coping without the GI Bill housing stipend payments they are owed. This is unfortunately part of a nationwide problem. Sadly, student-veterans at Olympic College and elsewhere are among the 340,000 veterans nationwide that haven’t received payments or have been underpaid because of a computer glitch at the VA. Some students have gone four months without a stipend and are falling behind in classes because they must choose between buying books and keeping the lights on. In some cases, student-veterans who are also parents are considering dropping out until the problem is fixed so they can make money to support their families.    The VA’s failure on this front is completely unacceptable. If you fight for our country, you should never have to fight for the benefits you’ve earned and deserve.   The problem got even worse last week. On Wednesday, the VA’s leaders hinted to Congressional staff that they might not reimburse veterans for the money they are owed.   I’m not willing to sit still and let that happen. After the news broke, I teamed up with Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii to demand veterans get the benefits they earned and deserved. We also called for an Inspector General Investigation into the causes of this problem and to identify who should be held accountable. Members of the House Veterans Affairs Committee also grilled the VA’s Undersecretary for Benefits at a hearing.   Within 24 hours the VA reversed course and made clear that every veteran will be made whole, but not until December 2019. Again - that’s not good enough. In the same announcement, the VA said they planned to delay the implementation of the Forever GI Bill, which is designed to help veterans afford college in areas where the cost of living is high. The VA’s computer systems are woefully out of date and incapable of processing a lot of the changes outlined in the Forever GI Bill. Citing the computer issues, the VA said they won’t fully follow the law until 2020.   Again - that’s not OK with me. So, Senator Schatz and I also demanded answers from the VA’s leadership about how they plan to upgrade their computers to be able to comply with the law. I’m going to push from my seat on the Appropriations Committee to make sure the VA has the funds to pay for upgraded computers to prevent this problem from ever happening again. The Inspector General investigation, in addition to holding people accountable, will help identify where investments are needed.   Veterans deserve better. If you have been directly affected by this, there’s a hotline that may be able to help: 1-888-GI-BILL-1 (1-888-442-4551). If that doesn’t work, let my team know and we’ll go to bat for you.
  
The Kitsap Sun has been reporting on this issue. The graphic below links to the most recent article: 
￼
  
Making our Government Work   Dysfunction in Washington, DC is not limited to the VA. Congress, too, is a real fixer-upper.  How bad is it? Congress is once again facing a funding deadline that could shut down important parts of the government before the end of the year. The original deadline is this Friday, but it is likely that will be temporarily extended to later this month because of the ceremonies honoring President Bush at the Capitol.   I’ve been banging the reform drum for a while now, and I will continue pushing until I see meaningful reform. For nearly a year, I’ve worked with a bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives as part of the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform.   I worked on some changes to provide more stability within the budget process with Rep. Steve Womack, the Chairman of the House Budget Committee. I recently brought him to our region where the federal government is the largest employer so he could see firsthand how many of our families and how much of our economy is impacted by government shutdowns.   I also worked with Rep. Jodey Arrington from Texas to introduce an amendment in the committee to try to make Congress more accountable. It’s called, “No Budget, No Recess.”   The idea is simple: if Congress fails to do its job of passing a budget resolution and passing appropriations bills by their deadlines, members of Congress should have to stay in DC to finish their work. Currently, the inability of Congress to do its job impacts folks in our community who work at Naval Base Kitsap, at the VA, at the National Park, and at other federal agencies - as well as local businesses that depend on them. Shouldn’t the impact be felt by members of Congress instead?  The proposal that the committee developed wouldn’t solve every problem, but it clearly would’ve meant progress. It would’ve reduced the likelihood of can-kicking by Congress as well as the threat of shutdowns. Sadly, despite our efforts, the committee’s progress was stymied last week because the leaders of both parties outside of the committee couldn’t agree on a deal to move the final legislation forward in the House and Senate. This was incredibly frustrating - it is the perfect example of why so many people are fed up with Congress.   Having said that, this was only the first bite at the apple. Already, I’m working with Chairman Womack and incoming-Chairman John Yarmuth to advance some of the ideas from this effort as stand-alone legislation in the House.  I’m committed to reducing the dysfunction in Congress. And I’m also committed to getting a handle on our nation’s long-term fiscal challenges. Please know that I’ll keep at it! 
Working For You   Here are some of the highlights from the last couple of weeks:  Connecting With Our Community   Last month, a bunch of students at North Kitsap High School asked me to come in and visit with them. Thanks for all the thoughtful questions, and thanks as well to Superintendent Laurynn Evans & Principal Megan Sawicki for taking the time to meet with me! Go Vikings. 
￼￼
Supporting Our Local Businesses   I recently visited Heritage Distilling Company for a Kilmer at Your Company visit. We talked about how craft distilleries are growing and creating jobs locally. We also discussed some things that Congress can do to support job creation in their industry.  
￼   Giving Back   I am thankful to live in an area where folks care for and look out for each other. Thank you to the team at the Rescue Mission in Tacoma and all the volunteers who showed up to make sure our neighbors had a warm meal on Thanksgiving!  ￼   Leading The Way Forward   Finally, last week while I was in Washington, DC, I was elected Chair of the New Democrat Coalition. Now at more than 90-Members of Congress strong, the New Democrat Coalition will push Congress to look at old problems through a new lens. We are laser-focused on growing the economic pie, creating jobs in every part of the country, and building an economy where businesses innovate and there are more economic opportunities for more people in more places. I’ve got some big ideas for the coalition to work on that will directly benefit our region. I can’t wait to get started.  ￼   That’s all for this week...As always, it’s an honor to represent you. Please don’t be afraid to get in touch if I can ever be of help.  Derek

Dear Friend,
With two weeks left of the open enrollment period for health coverage, now is the best time to compare plans and find the best one for you.
Why is it important to get covered?
Health care is expensive. Without coverage, families can face extreme financial burdens for unexpected illnesses and injuries. With the average cost of a three-day hospital stay hovering at around $30,000; many families are ill-prepared for a health crisis. Accidents and illnesses happen, and health coverage ensures that in the midst of a health care emergency, you and your family can rest assured that you will never be one medical bill away from bankruptcy.
Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, personal bankruptcies caused by exorbitant medical bills were cut in half. In addition, the vast majority of those seeking coverage through healthcare.gov qualify for some form of financial assistance. In fact, approximately 80 percent of those using healthcare.gov found plans for less than $75 per month.
Need help enrolling? Free help is available via healthcare.gov and through a toll-free Consumer Call Center at 1-800-318-2596 where trained operators are available to assist with comparing plans, enrollment applications, and determining eligibility. In addition, you can look for in-person assistance by visiting an local helper in your area.
There is a shorter enrollment period this year. With the deadline of December 15th fast-approaching, please take the time to ensure that the health of your family is prioritized during the upcoming year and enroll in health coverage.
Peace,
￼

Dear Friends, 
On Friday night our country received sad news. George Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st president of the United States, had passed away at the age of 94. He was a man of great character, integrity, and humility, who taught us to be a better version of ourselves. Most of all, he was a man who always displayed his boundless love for his family and friends.
From the skies of the Pacific as a young naval aviator to the Oval Office as a seasoned statesman, George Bush personified patriotism and dedicated his life to the service of his fellow citizens. He left this earth a better place than when he came to it. For that, he leaves behind a very grateful nation. I am comforted by my belief that he is once again reunited with his wife Barbara and their daughter Robin. I hope you join me in sharing the warmest of prayers to the Bush Family during their time of mourning. 
Rest in peace, Mr. President.

￼
President George H. W. Bush will Lie in State in the Capitol Rotunda. Following a short service at the U.S. Capitol, the former president will lie in state from 7:30 p.m. Monday to 7:00 a.m. Wednesday.
  
Below are some highlights from last week: 
Elected the Top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee 
Last week, I was selected by the House Republican Conference to serve as the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. I am incredibly honored by my selection and thank my good friend, Ed Royce, for his steady leadership as Chairman over the past six years. It will now be my mission to partner with Secretary of State Pompeo and my fellow colleagues to advance a foreign policy that promotes American leadership on the world stage. This is a humbling opportunity and I look forward to hitting the ground running on day one.
In fact, this weekend, l led a bipartisan Congressional Delegation to attend the inauguration of Mexico’s President-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and also met with incoming Mexican government officials to discuss U.S.-Mexico relations. As the Chairman of the U.S.-Mexico Inter-Parliamentary Group, I have long advocated for enhancing and strengthening this close relationship with our southern neighbor.

The Congressional Delegation included Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) and Representatives Henry Cuellar (D-TX), Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), Brian Babin (R-TX), Jim Costa (D-CA), Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX), Luis Correa (D-CA), Will Hurd, (R-TX), and Juan Vargas, (D-CA). I am giving thumbs up with Mexican House Speaker Mario Delgado and my friend, Congressman Cuellar. 
My Global Fragility and Violence Reduction Act Passes House 
On Thursday, the House passed my Global Fragility and Violence Reduction Act . I co-authored this critical legislation to reduce worldwide violence and improve international stability. Violence and brutal conflict costs the global economy over $14 trillion a year and creates environments where large-scale international responses are needed to stop the struggle and deliver humanitarian aid. This legislation directs USAID, the State Department, and the Defense Department to work with other relevant agencies in crafting an integrated strategy in a number of these ‘fragile states.’ The strategy would focus on preventing the total breakdown of government, while also denying terrorist groups the unstable, fertile territory from which they recruit. With our federal departments working in unison, we will be better positioned to eliminate terrorist safe havens, stimulate global stability, and avoid large-scale international interventions.
You can click here or on the image below to watch my speech on the House Floor in support of my legislation. 
￼ 
Condemning Russian Aggression 
I fully condemn the overtly aggressive and unlawful actions taken by Russia against three Ukrainian ships and their crewmembers. This belligerent act included illegally restricting free navigation through the Kerch Straight by ramming and opening fire against their ships, resulting in the injury and capture of its crewmembers. I join Secretary Pompeo in calling on Russia to immediately return Ukraine’s ships and detained citizens.
Russia's latest escalation underscores the importance of maintaining our comprehensive sanctions against Russia, Vladimir Putin, and his top oligarchs. Russia’s blatant and unlawful hostility against Ukraine and its sovereign territory must cease.
Given Vladimir Putin’s long-standing goals are to undermine the credibility of democracy and to sow discord globally, I urge our Ukrainian friends to be steadfast in the maintenance of their democratic processes and institutions. I stand with the Ukrainian people and our European allies’ efforts to end Russia’s destabilizing and unlawful behavior.

Legislative Update 
Last week, the House voted on a number of important pieces of legislation. Here are a few you may be interested in: 
	•	H.R. 5273 – the Global Fragility and Violence Reduction Act of 2018. This is legislation that I introduced with Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), which promotes more effective development in fragile and unstable countries, addressing the conditions that create safe havens for terrorists, criminal networks, and war lords. It also develops a global initiative aimed at preventing the root causes of violence and instability in countries around the world.
	•	H.R. 1567 – the United States-Mexico Economic Partnership Act. This legislation seeks to promote economic partnership and cooperation between the United States and Mexico.
	•	H.R. 4254 – the Women in Aerospace Education Act. This legislation will encourage universities applying for grants to incorporate aerospace engineering experiences into their teacher training curriculum and direct NASA to strengthen the promotion of NASA internship and fellowship programs towards women.
This Week, in light of the passing of President George H.W. Bush, there are no votes expected in the House. 
As always, I encourage you to visit my website, mccaul.house.gov, for more information on constituent services and legislative updates. Also, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to get the latest updates on my work in Washington and the 10th District of Texas.

Making Life Better for the American People
By Sen. John Thune 
 
I believe the 115th Congress, which began less than two years ago, just days before President Trump took office, will be defined as one of the most productive Congresses in recent history. It’s been marked by accomplishment after accomplishment, all of which have helped fulfill my goal of making life better for South Dakotans and the rest of the American people.  
 
While there’s certainly plenty of good news to share from our work over the last two years, things looked much different before Republicans took control of the House, Senate, and White House in 2017. Having that perspective helps underscore just how much this Republican-led Washington delivered in terms of real results for people across the country.

Dear Lindsey, 
President George H.W. Bush was a mentor and role model who instilled in me the qualities of strong leadership and a duty to serve others. I had the honor and privilege of knowing and working for President Bush for a number of years, starting in 1992 as the Executive Director for the Bush/Quayle campaign in Missouri. 

He was a humble and dignified leader who put his faith, family, and country above himself. He always remembered the small gestures of kindness―a note, a call, an encouraging hug―that left such an impact on others, including me. America has lost a hero whose spirit lives on in all those he touched.

￼
￼
￼
President Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on Friday in Argentina. This replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and includes the Wagner Language to enable countries to better fight human trafficking. This new agreement creates more balanced and fairer trade for American workers. I look forward to seeing the benefits of the USMCA in the years to come.

￼

My colleagues and I worked hard last week to fix a provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that would have required all non-profits, including churches, to pay taxes on employee transit benefits and parking. This provision raised serious questions about religious freedom and the 1st Amendment. By taxing our churches, religious schools, and charities, this provision effectively imposes a state income tax on organizations that are normally tax-exempt. This change would raise the operating costs of organizations meant to serve our community, and in turn negatively impact the very people in need of assistance. I am proud to say we fixed the issue, and these crucial organizations will continue to operate without unnecessary government regulation.
 
The House also considered a one-week extension of the National Flood Insurance Program last week, but this short-term solution is unacceptable. Many of you in Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District are impacted by floods every year, and it is eminently clear that we must reform our flood insurance programs, not just repeatedly extend them. I am working with the Financial Services Committee to root out waste, fraud, and abuse in other disaster recovery programs as well and ensure that funds go to people who truly need them. It is clear that these programs need major structural reforms, and I urge my colleagues to support more long-term solutions to these issues.
 
￼

It was a pleasure to meet with Penny Pennington, Principal, Incoming 2019 Managing Partner of Edward Jones last week on Capitol Hill. Edward Jones serves over 110,000 people in the 2nd District, and their South Campus is located right on Manchester Road. We had a great discussion about my work on the Financial Services Committee and how we can work together to make saving easier for low and middle-income families across the country.
 
￼

The dignity and freedom of so many people around the world is being challenged by oppressive regimes and non-state actors. The brave voices who speak against injustice are oftentimes silenced through persecution, imprisonment, and even assassination. Just two weeks ago, Syrian activist Raed Fares was assassinated. Mr. Fares founded a radio station when the Syrian civil war broke out to give the opposition a voice and highlight the suffering that Syrian President Assad has inflicted upon his own people. Last week, the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa discussed how best the U.S. can respond to human rights violations in Syria. We heard testimony from several witnesses describing humanitarian obstacles, the murderous Assad regime, and the exploitation of women and girls in the region. There is much more work to be done, and I will continue fighting for basic human rights and dignity across the globe.

￼  Ann Wagner Member of Congress

Wednesday, December 5, 2018 is the deadline to register for FEMA or SBA loans.

I am excited to take on this role, as I did in the previous two Congresses, and looking forward to working alongside Chairman Mike Crapo (R-ID). You can read my full statement here.   George H.W. Bush I joined Americans across the country, and people around the world, this weekend as I heard the news that former President George H.W. Bush had passed away. Our 41st president will go down in history as a committed public servant and a true statesman. My prayers continue to be with the entire Bush family. May the peace that passes all understanding guard their hearts and may His comfort cover our nation as we mourn President George H.W. Bush.  Sincerely, ￼  Tim

Post 9/11 GI Bill Payments
As you may already know, the VA has been experiencing delays in processing payments to recipients of Monthly Housing Allowances through the Post-9/11 GI Bill. These delays have stemmed from issues in implementing the changes outlined in the Colmery Act.
If you have experienced a financial hardship as a result of these delays or have yet to receive any payments through the Post-9/11 GI Bill--either as a first time applicant or re-enrollment--please contact my district office. 
Should you be interested in more information regarding this matter or require assistance with a federal agency, please do not hesitate to contact my district office at 714-559-6190.

P.S. I questioned VA Administrators about how they intend to fix this issue and keep our promises to veterans. Watch it here.

Dear Friend,  Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to read about some of last week’s highlights in Washington.    A Final Farewell to President George H.W. Bush  Texas and America’s hearts are heavy with the loss of a true patriot, a great president and one of the most decent men ever, George Herbert Walker Bush. George and his wife Barbara never let the pressures of their chosen lives take away their humanity. They lived their lives purely and respectfully, serving as shining examples to us all. George is now in Heaven with Barbara and their 4 year old daughter Robin by his side. From one former Naval aviator to another former Naval aviator, President Bush, may you have fair winds and following seas, sir. Thank you for making God’s world better. We have the watch. ￼  Rep. Pete Olson and Nancy Olson with President George H.W. Bush in Houston  Protecting Religious Liberty Across the Globe  ISIS and rebel groups in Syria and Iraq have waged a brutal war to eliminate religious minorities in the Middle East, including Christians and Yezidis who remain at risk. As a nation that values religious liberty, America provides humanitarian aid to those being persecuted for their religious beliefs. That’s why I voted for the Iraq and Syria Genocide Relief and Accountability Act, which will provide desperately needed relief to genocide survivors and hold perpetrators accountable. It authorizes the U.S. to support advocates helping threatened minority groups or seeking legal accountability for perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in Iraq and Syria. The bill passed both the House and Senate and now heads to the president for his signature. We must stand by survivors of these atrocities and help protect innocent people around the world from being persecuted for their religious beliefs.  Discussing Trade With Canada   I met with Canadian Senators Jane Cordy and Victor Oh and Members of Parliament Anthony Rota and Brian Masse, who were in DC as part of the Canada-United States Inter-Parliamentary Group. We discussed the importance of trade between our nations. Trade is the backbone of our economy, with 2 million trade related jobs alone. I look forward to working together to strengthen the relationship between our two nations. ￼  Anthony Rota MP, Senator Jane Cordy, Brian Masse MP, Rep. Pete Olson and Senator Victor Oh   NASA InSight Lands On Mars  Last week, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) achieved another milestone in space exploration. Their Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) spacecraft successfully landed on the surface of Mars after an almost seven month, 300 million mile journey. Over the next two years, the spacecraft will study seismic waves and heat deep below the surface of Mars, helping scientists learn about how celestial bodies like the Earth and the Moon were formed and prepare NASA to send astronauts back to the Moon and eventually to Mars. Click here to learn more about the Mars InSight Mission. I applaud the men and women of NASA who continue to achieve important milestones in helping us understand the universe we inhabit.   I’m honored to represent you in Congress.

NOVEMBER UPDATE

￼
Dear Neighbor,
As the holiday season gets underway, the spirit of generosity and compassion can be felt throughout the Inland Empire. I had the pleasure of joining two standout groups for their Thanksgiving food giveaways benefiting families in need in our communities. In Bloomington, Vida Life Ministries provided families with the ingredients to prepare their holiday meals. Every month, they help feed 158,000 individuals. In Pomona, the Vietnamese Community of Pomona Valley held a luncheon to help feed the poor. It was an important reminder that everyone can make a difference in the lives of others.
Sincerely,  
￼

SERVING OUR VETERANS

￼

After attempting to reach out to the Department of Veterans Affairs five times and being denied access to her benefits three times, Hansey, a proud Army veteran and resident of Pomona, contacted my office for assistance. We were able to help her secure thousands of dollars of hard-earned retroactive pay. If you or anyone you know could use a hand with veterans benefits, call my district office at 909-481-6474. 

STRENGTHENING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S PORTS AGAINST CYBERSECURITY ATTACKS

￼

When our ports are attacked, every business feels it--especially in the Inland Empire, where the logistics industry has created 23 percent of all new jobs since the Great Recession. That’s why after the 2017 cyberattacks shut down the Ports of Los Angeles and San Diego, I introduced the Strengthening Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Coordination in Our Ports Act. In October, a provision based on my bill was signed into law as part of the five-year authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). It’s an important step to shore up the nation’s maritime security and infrastructure and to protect jobs in our community. 

IMPROVING TRAINING AND WORKING CONDITIONS FOR 9-1-1 PROFESSIONALS

￼
During an emergency, 9-1-1 dispatchers are the first voice we hear and a vital connection to the help we need. As a former 9-1-1 dispatcher, I know how critical it is for these professionals to be prepared with the skills to organize emergency response every day. That’s why I co-authored an op-ed with Federal Communications Commission Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel to call on the Office of Management and Budget to ensure these public safety professionals have access to the lifesaving training and resources that keep our communities safe. That means when we call 9-1-1 we will receive the best assistance when we need it the most. You can read the op-ed HERE.

CREATING PATHWAYS FOR SUCCESS FOR OUR STUDENTS

￼

As the manufacturing industry in our district continues to grow, one of my priorities is making sure that our students are equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the careers of tomorrow. Last month, I held a roundtable at Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona with leaders from the life sciences and manufacturing industry and representatives from Chaffey College, Mt. San Antonio Community College, and the InTech Center to come up with solutions to address the shortage of skilled workers to fill jobs in our district. 

MILITARY ACADEMY APPLICATIONS ARE DUE DECEMBER 14TH

￼

Every year, I nominate students to our country's top military service academies through a competitive process for the opportunity to receive four years of tuition-free college. High school juniors and seniors, and recent graduates, are eligible to apply. The nomination application period closes on December 14th, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. PST. If you have any questions, please contact Marisol Guerra at Marisol.Guerra@mail.house.gov or call my district office at 909-481-6474. You can read our list of frequently asked questions HERE and download the application HERE. 

APPLY TODAY FOR THE 4TH ANNUAL YOUTH ADVISORY COMMITTEE

￼

Over the course of six months, my office hosts a program for high school students to acquire leadership skills in a professional environment. Students will have the opportunity to learn about the industries that are imperative to our local economy with an education-based experience to inspire our future leaders.

President George H.W. Bush
Our Nation Mourns the Loss of Our 41st President
￼
Our nation has lost one of our best in President George H.W. Bush. He was a true American patriot, always humble and gracious in everything he did. He served our country in many roles, but perhaps was most proud of being a husband and father. And as we mourn his loss, we should take comfort in knowing he is now reunited with his beloved Barbara. Rest in peace President Bush, and thank you for leaving America and the world a better place than you found it.
Today through Wednesday, President Bush will lie in state in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. First, there will be a ceremony in his honor today at 4:00 PM CT. Click here for more information on how to tune in.

Chairman Yoder Leading Efforts to Secure the Border
￼ ￼ Click here to watch Kevin on Fox Business
Border security used to be a bipartisan priority, and as Chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, I am leading efforts to restore that mindset. If we want to stop drug and human trafficking into our country, we need to fully secure our border. That takes a three step approach: physical barriers - including a wall, innovative technology, and increased manpower. My Homeland Security Appropriations bill invests in each of those three aspects, and I am working to get my bill signed into law. The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed with bipartisan support, requires that our border be secured. My goal is to fulfill the requirements of that law, and my hope is that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle can come together that achieve this in a bipartisan fashion.

PEPFAR Reauthorization
￼ President George W. Bush signing PEPFAR into law fifteen years ago.
On November 13th, the House voted to reauthorize and extend the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) for an additional five years. I was proud to support this legislation to support a proven program that is saving lives around the world. PEPFAR is a bipartisan program, started under President George W. Bush, that fights AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in the developing world.
Estimates show that PEPFAR has saved nearly 17 million lives since its implementation - 14 million people with HIV through lifesaving drugs and 2.2 million babies born HIV-free to HIV-positive mothers. When President Bush announced the program in his State of the Union Address in 2003, almost 30 million people in Africa had the AIDS virus, including 3 million children under the age of 15. Today, 13 countries are projected to control their AIDS epidemics by 2020. 
 
I was proud to support its reauthorization and I am confident that the extension of PEPFAR will save many more lives in the years to come.

Veterans Day Memorial Ceremonies in France
￼ Kevin lays a wreath at Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial outside of Paris, France to honor a fallen Kansas native, Private Ralph R. Beard, who lost his life in “The Great War.”
On November 10, with the world reflecting on the centennial of the Armistice of World War I, I was honored to lay a wreath at Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial, just outside of Paris, at the gravesite of Private First Class Ralph R. Beard, who served in the 309th Field Signal Battalion, 84th Infantry Division of the U.S. Army. Private Beard was a veteran of World War I and originally from Kansas who lost his life on November 1, 1918.
 
In addition to laying the wreath, I had the privilege of participating in a memorial ceremony with several of my House colleagues at Suresnes Cemetery to honor other Americans who lost their lives in World War I. More than 1,500 American Service Members and volunteers who lost their lives in World War I are interred at the cemetery along with 24 unknown dead from World War II. Bronze tablets on the walls of the chapel record the names of 974 soldiers missing in action. Originally serving as a temporary cemetery for the American Hospital of Paris in 1917 toward the end of World War I, General Pershing selected it as the first site of nine permanent American Cemeteries.
 
The ceremony and wreath laying at Suresnes coincided with other events held in France and throughout Europe to mark the centennial of the end of World War I. It was my honor to participate on behalf of the Third District.

Meeting with Representative-Elect Sharice Davids
￼
It’s important that after our elections we work together for the common good. It was nice to meet with incoming Congresswoman Sharice Davids last week in Washington, and I’m working to ensure the smoothest possible transition as she takes over. I wish her good luck in representing this district I love so much.

Third District Constituent Makes Forbes ""30 Under 30"" List
￼ Click here to watch the video of Kevin's floor remarks.
Hundreds of thousands of Americans live with Parkinson's Disease and the difficult symptoms that come along with it. Kansas City should be proud that one of our own, Erin Smith, a Shawnee Mission West High School graduate, is on the cutting edge of early detection with her app FacePrint. Forbes recently recognized Erin with a spot on their ""30 Under 30"" List for her accomplishments, and I wanted to recognize her on the floor of the US House as well.

Constituent Meetings in DC
Olathe School Board Member LeEtta Felter
￼ Kevin with LeEtta Felter and her daughter in his office in Washington, DC.
It was great to have Olathe School Board Member and Third District constituent LeEtta Felter stop by the office recently. LeEtta is a tireless advocate for students and schools in Olathe, and she is one of the many people who help make our local schools some of the best in the nation. We chatted about ways to improve education opportunities in Kansas and across the country, and I thanked her for her service to our community.  
￼
Overland Park Chamber of Commerce
￼ Kevin with the Overland Park Chamber of Commerce
I enjoyed visiting with members of the Overland Park Chamber of Commerce in D.C. this week. It's been my pleasure to work alongside the Overland Park Chamber over the last few years as we have partnered on efforts to help Overland Park's economy grow and thrive. We discussed issues like highway infrastructure and technical education - both of which are very important to the health of our local businesses. I am proud to have been a strong advocate for businesses in the Third District, and I am happy to report that our local economy is stronger now than when I first came to office.

Dr. Weir of the Institute for Advancing Medical Innovation at KU Med
￼ Kevin with Dr. Weir at the US Capitol in Washington, DC.
I was pleased to welcome Dr. Scott Weir to the Capitol, where he was participating in a science roundtable discussion with Members of Congress. Dr. Weir is the Director of the Institute for Advancing Medical Innovation at the KU Medical Center, where he is helping to drive American medical innovation in constant search of breakthrough cures and treatments. I have been proud to partner in this crucial effort with Dr. Weir and other researchers through my support of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Since 2015, we’ve increased federal investments in NIH by over 30%, and the research funded by that increase is going to help Americans live longer, healthier lives. I enjoyed chatting with Dr. Weir and hearing about some of the great work being done by KU Med.
￼
Around the District
US Military Service Academy Nomination Reception
￼ Kevin with the 2018 class of US Service Academy nominees outside his office in Overland Park.
As a member of Congress I’ve had many unique opportunities, and one of my favorites each year has been the US Service Academy Nomination process. Since 2011, I’ve had the privilege of nominating more than 200 students to a US Service Academy. This year was no exception. Last week, I held a reception to honor the 24 students and their families who make up my 2018 class of nominees. These students are the best of the best. Among this year’s nominees are licensed pilots, award winning debaters, National Merit Semi-finalists, student body officers, Eagle Scouts, nationally recognized musicians and athletes, and thousands of logged hours of community service, just to name a few. As I listened to the dreams and aspirations of each of these students I was invigorated with hope for our country and I was comforted as I looked into the eyes of our future leaders. I wish for each of them the very best and look forward to hearing of their great accomplishment in the service of our country.

Happy Hanukkah to everyone celebrating in the Third District and around the world. May this season bring you joy and happiness. Chag Sameach!
Facts of the Week
There have been a lot of news reports about the migrant caravan arriving at our southern border. Here are some facts to clear up some of the confusion about what our Border Patrol agents are facing, courtesy of the Department of Homeland Security:
 
1) There are 8,500 caravan members in Tijuana and Mexicali. There are reports of additional caravans on their way.
 
2) The overwhelming majority of these individuals are not eligible for asylum in the United States under our laws. Historically, less than 10% of those who claim asylum from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador are found eligible by a federal judge. 90% are not eligible.
 
3) Most of these migrants are seeking jobs or to join family who are already in the U.S. and have all refused multiple opportunities to seek protection in Mexico or with the UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. Seeking employment or family reunification are not grounds for asylum under our laws, or any international obligation. There are, however, legal ways to seek a job or to be reunited in the U.S.
 
4) The caravan members are predominately male. It appears in some cases that the limited number of women and children in the caravan are being used by the organizers as “human shields” when they confront law enforcement. They are being put at risk by the caravan organizers as we saw at the Mexico-Guatemala border. This is putting vulnerable people in harm's way.
 
5) At this point we have confirmed that there are over 600 convicted criminals traveling with the caravan flow. This includes individuals known to law enforcement for assault, battery, drug crimes, burglary, rape, child abuse and more. This is serious. Additionally, Mexico has already arrested 100 caravan members for criminal violations in Mexico. 
 
6) The use of nonlethal force to prevent further injury to border patrol agents and a mass illegal rush across the border on Sunday was acceptable under our laws. A similar show of nonlethal force was also used by the Obama Administration in 2013 in a similar situation. 
Third District Trivia 
The biggest issue Congress must settle on before the end of the year is passing my Homeland Security Appropriations Bill into law. The bill currently includes $5 billion for construction of 200 miles of new border barriers at the southern border. Do you know how many miles of our southern border currently feature border barriers? 
Send your answers to haley.brady@mail.house.gov and the first correct response will receive a shout out in next week's newsletter.

12/3/18 16:06,Have a minute?,"A message from US Senator Todd Young
￼ 


I join all Americans in mourning the passing of President George H.W. Bush – a man with an extraordinary record of service to our country. President Bush modeled exceptional character, humility, and resolve. He was a combat veteran, diplomat, and leader. As a naval aviator, he bravely risked his life in World War II. Before becoming Vice President and President, he served in the House of Representatives, represented our country in China and at the United Nations, and led the Central Intelligence Agency. During turbulent moments in our history, President Bush unified and steadied our nation and our allies in the pursuit of common purpose. He will be deeply missed, and I extend my sincerest condolences to the entire Bush family.
Failure to Pay Veterans Full Benefits 
According to reports, student veterans across the country are experiencing delayed or incorrect GI Bill benefit payments. This situation is unacceptable and needs to be rectified immediately. For veterans utilizing these benefits, it is often the only waythey are supporting themselves and their family. I understand the Veterans Administration (VA) is implementing changes and improvements to its information technology infrastructure, but this does not eliminate its responsibility to deliver benefits owed.   
That is why on Friday, I joined my colleagues in sending a bipartisan letter calling for an Inspector General investigation into the VA’s failure to pay our Veteran’s the full benefits they deserve. I intend to continue to play a very constructive role working with this administration to fix this problem and to ensure this is a top priority.
Talking Yemen, Border Security, Underpaid GI Bill Benefits on Morning Joe  
Last week on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, I discussed the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, the under payment of GI Bill benefits, and America’s border security.

￼  
Voting to End the World’s Worst Humanitarian Crisis  
I’ve studied the situation in Yemen as closely as anyone in the Senate, and I believe the best way to oppose Iran in Yemen and stop ballistic missile attacks on our partners is to bring all parties to the negotiating table, end the civil war, and address the humanitarian crisis.
Since March of 2017, I have worked to give the administration leverage with the Saudis to accomplish these outcomes. We must use all of that leverage immediately. Unfortunately, the administration has failed to fully utilize the leverage I have provided, and last week’s briefing with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis raised more questions than it answered.
Based on that history and those facts — as well as our national security interests and our humanitarian principles – I voted to support the Sanders/Lee resolution last week to direct the removal of U.S. armed forces from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen that have not been authorized by Congress.

Supporting our Hoosier Entrepreneurs

￼ 

Dear Friends,   It’s hard to believe that the end of the year is almost here.  With December upon us, I wanted to provide you with some important information about the impending December 15th deadline to sign up for 2019 coverage on HealthCare.gov.  Obtaining health insurance can provide you and your family with security and peace of mind and helps pay costs when you need medical care.  No one plans to get sick or hurt, but most people need to get treated for an illness or injury at some point, and health insurance helps pay these costs.  Before HealthCare.gov was opened, high medical bills, as the result of a serious accident or illness, had been a leading cause of personal bankruptcies in our country.  The number of personal bankruptcies has now been cut in half.  Many are surprised by how affordable coverage on HealthCare.gov can be, and most people can find quality coverage for less than $75 a month.  I made a commitment to make healthcare accessible and affordable for everyone.  I will continue to fight for that and to make sure people with pre-existing conditions keep their coverage.  Please visit my website at www.lamb.house.gov to learn more about my work in Washington. 
                                                                     Sincerely,                                                                         ￼                                                                       Conor Lamb                                                                      Member of Congress

President Bush lived a long life of service to our nation.  A World War II veteran and career politician, he was present for some of our nation's most pivotal moments in history. 
In one final show of respect, President Bush will ""lie in state"" in the Rotunda of the United States Capitol Monday through Wednesday.  This ceremony is a distinct privilege traditionally reserved for government officials and military officers to allow the general public to pay their last respects.  As we spend the next few days honoring our 41st President, may we remember his lasting impact on our great nation.  
* * *    
We are moving closer to the end of the year and working tirelessly in Congress to wrap up some of our final priorities.  One of those priorities is funding the government through the next fiscal year.  We are also working toward a compromise on the 2018 Farm Bill, which will provide much-needed support for farmers and the agriculture industry.   
Here's a look at a few of the highlights from my week:  
West Tennesseans in Washington
￼ 
I met with members of the Tennessee Hospital Association to discuss pressing issues such as support for rural hospitals and quality patient care. Among the members was JR Ross from West Tennessee Healthcare in Jackson. They have done impressive work providing quality healthcare services to our patients in West Tennessee. Thank you all for visiting! 
￼ 
I met with leadership from the Memphis Area Transit Authority (MATA). They gave me an update on the status of our public transportation system in the Memphis-area, including bus routes and rail trolleys. Thank you, MATA, for the work you do to benefit Memphis commuters! 
￼ 
I showed Sandy Drewry my office before her tour of the U.S. Capitol.  I always enjoy sharing my Washington experience with West Tennesseans. 
Around the Eighth District
￼ 
I spoke to the Gibson County Farm Bureau about the ways I am working to help Tennessee’s farmers and agriculture industry. West Tennessee has many farming operations, and I always want make sure our farmers have the support they need in Washington. Thank you to President Todd Littleton for inviting me!
￼  I had a great meeting at the National Hardwood Lumber Association in Shelby County. NHLA provides a number of valuable resources for hardwood lumberers and foresters, including a classroom where they teach people from all over the world how to effectively grade hardwood.

Dear Lindsey, 
Like the rest of the nation, I was saddened to learn of the passing of former President George H.W. Bush. He lived a life defined by duty, honor and service to his country – as a WWII pilot, Member of Congress, CIA director, Ambassador, VP, and as the 41st President. Even after he left office in 1993, he remained committed to service, setting an example for all those who worked with him, or have followed in service after him.  While party was important to him, he was a statesman who put country first. And in the sharp-elbowed world of politics, President Bush was someone who maintained a degree of kindness and decency that truly set him apart. This is an important lesson for all us in public office, and an example I will be thinking about over the coming days. 
In news closer to home, after a week in Washington, I had a really nice weekend here in the district.  I started Saturday morning at College of Lake County with our Stem Scholars program, exploring the chemistry and new photonics (laser) lab at the school. Next was our 29th Congress On Your Corner town  hall in Lake Forest with a lively crowd covering a broad range of topics. Yesterday I had the chance to attend a Court of Honor for 5 new Eagle Scouts in Lake Bluff.  And in the spirit of the season, I visited Round Lake Park Saturday evening for their Holiday Open House, and loved hearing the Murphy Elementry School 4th Grade Chorus perform. 
Please continue reading for some updates from the past week, including new legislation to support small businesses who employ National Guard members and military reservists, and to address ethylene oxide emissions. We’re also launching our second annual “Holiday Cards for Heroes” program to distribute cards to servicemembers stationed far from home this holiday season. 
HOLIDAY CARDS FOR HEROES 
￼ 
  
With some of the cards constituents dropped off in 2017. 
For the second year, we’re launching our “Holiday Cards for Heroes” program to collect cards for military servicemembers stationed far from home this holiday season.  
Constituents are invited to drop off cards at our District Office or any Neighborhood Office Hours event starting today through Friday, December 14. We’re open Monday through Friday, 9:00am – 5:00pm at 111 Barclay Blvd, Suite 200, Lincolnshire, IL 60069. 
Last year,we collected and distributed more than 200 cards with help from the United Service Organizations (USO). A personal, handwritten card is a much-appreciated way to say thank you to the Americans serving our country, offer words of encouragement, and share holiday cheer. I’m glad we can again facilitate this program to connect constituents and our service members.
   
SUPPORTING NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS AND MILITARY RESERVISTS 
Last week, I introduced bipartisan legislation to help small businesses when essential employees or small business owners are called up for service as part of their National Guard or Reservist duties. The bill would improve existing, yet underutilized, Small Business Administration programs offering loans and deferrals to help small businesses meet their obligations during an employee’s absence due to military service.
National Guard members and military reservists are an integral part of our armed forces and national defense. We should do everything we can to support their service. This bill makes current support programs at the SBA more accessible and efficient so more small businesses have support while members of their team fulfill their military service obligations.
Learn more about the National Guard and Reserve Entrepreneurship Act 
  
ADDRESSING ETHYLENE OXIDE EMISSIONS 
I joined with Sen. Durbin and other colleagues in the Illinois delegation to introduce legislation that would require the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to revise ethylene oxide (EtO) emissions standards for medical sterilization and chemical facilities, which have been the source of harmful emissions here in Lake County.  The bill also requires the EPA to notify the public no more than 30 days after it learns that the new standards have been violated.
The EPA needs to take all appropriate and necessary actions to protect our communities from the threat of ethylene oxide – a known carcinogen. Our bill would give the EPA 180 days to update its ethylene oxide emission standards based on the science because we cannot delay when it comes to the health of our families. The legislation would also require public notification for any emission violations to ensure local communities have the facts about the safety of their air. I appreciate the leadership of Senators Durbin and Duckworth, and the support of my colleagues on this important legislation. This is about our public health, and we need action now.
Learn more about our legislation on our website. 
  
NEIGHBORHOOD OFFICE HOURS 
This week, our constituent service representatives will be in Deerfield, North Chicago, Glencoe, Waukegan, and Northbrook. If you need assistance with a federal issue, from Medicare and Social Security to Immigration and the VA, please come see us!
View the full schedule on our website. 
  
WEEKLY WRAP-UP 
￼ 
  
We had a great turnout and engaged crowd at our most recent Congress on Your Corner at Rondout Elementary School in Lake Forest. This was our 29th public town hall so far this term. 
  
￼ 
  
For our second STEM Scholars event, we visited College of Lake County in Grayslake. The high school students enjoyed the hands-on experience in their chemistry lab and learning about photonics – the science of light.
  
￼ 
  
I was glad to be at the Christmas Tree Lighting in Round Lake this weekend. I really enjoyed seeing my friends in the The Murphy Elementary School 4th Grade Chorus perform! 
  
￼ 
  
I was glad to support the work of Staben House helping residents experiencing homelessness in Waukegan Township at their “A Home for the Holidays” gala.
  
￼ 
  
Congratulations to the Tenth District’s newest Eagle Scouts. Glad to join Troop 42 in Lake Bluff’s Court of Honor Ceremony over the weekend.

Come and Read It Report
Dear Texans, 
This weekend, America lost a great servant and I lost a great friend. George H.W. Bush epitomized everything wonderful about America and, like his country, he was tough, strong and kind. He changed the nation and he changed the world. 
Those who knew President Bush knew that his love for his country was only surpassed by his love for his family. This is a great loss for America, but I am comforted knowing that he has been reunited with his beloved, Barbara Bush, and is now with the Lord. My family and I will continue praying for the entire Bush family during this difficult time. 
The Economy 
Thanks to President Trump's pro-growth and pro-American agenda, the economy is booming: 
	•	Consumer spending was up at a strong 0.6 percent in October - the fastest pace in seven years!
	•	Incomes rose by the largest amount in nine months
	•	Our economy grew at an unrevised 3.5 percent in the third quarter.
Legislative Update 
This week: While we are back in Washington this week, we will operate differently that previously scheduled. Former President George H.W. Bush will lie in state in the United States Capitol Rotunda beginning today through Wednesday morning so that Americans are able to pay their respects. 
I have included some articles and releases you may find interesting located on the right side of this newsletter. It is an honor and privilege to represent the people of Texas’ 25th Congressional District and as always, please reach out to me with any issues and concerns that are important to you.
In God we trust,

Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and Thank you!
￼  Mary and I are looking forward to returning to Minnesota life, spending more time with our children, grandchildren, friends and neighbors.  
Dear Friend,  
As I prepare to leave Congress this coming January 3rd, I’m truly sorry to tell you that this will be our last issue of the Monday Report. Thank you for following our efforts over the past six years to establish new, better, more inclusive priorities consistent with America’s highest ideals of freedom, democracy, justice, and equality.   Returning to Congress in 2013 after a 32-year hiatus from my first period of service in the 1970’s, I felt better prepared than ever before to take on the job. Vanderbilt University and the University of Virginia agreed. In 2015, the Washington Post published their study naming me one of the Top Ten Most Effective Members of Congress, and the second most effective Democrat.   To get there, and best serve Minnesota’s 8th District and our great Nation, my staff and I approached our job in two big ways – “bold and aspirational,” and “fix things, solve problems, and get stuff done.” And we did so by reaching across the aisle in the spirit of bipartisanship. Every bill we passed, and virtually every success we had, came with a Republican partner and Republican support. 
On the bold and aspirational side... 
we worked hard to change the way we do politics, put a stop to endless wars of choice, and reorder our national priorities to put people first with universal, single payer health care, and more resources for good paying jobs, public education, medical research, the battle against climate change, and protecting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, just to name a few.  
￼ 
Click on the screen above to hear me explain our Restore Democracy Revolution. 
	•	Our Restore Democracy legislation established a blueprint for campaign and elections reform, getting secret, dark, toxic money from our politics, and putting Congress back to work on the people’s business – not campaign fundraising. 
￼  In September of 2013, TIME Magazine cited Republican Senator Rand Paul and me, along with Congresswoman Barbara Lee, for leadership in keeping the U.S. out of war with Syria. 
	•	Cited by TIME Magazine for leadership in stopping the U.S. from going to war with Syria, I was also proud to pass several successful amendments to Defense Appropriations bills that put a stop to the waste of millions of taxpayer dollars in the corrupt nation of Afghanistan. And just last spring, I was able to bring an amendment to the floor to zero out the Overseas Contingency Fund used to pay for endless wars of choice. We didn’t pass that measure, but the very fact that it was considered marked a major step forward. 
￼  This was the scene in front of the U.S. Capitol back in July as I joined some 60 other members of Congress in announcing the formation of our new “Medicare for All” Caucus. This photo shows Medicare for All Caucus lead, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, speaking about the fact that no one should be one health care crisis away from bankruptcy. 
	•	Along with several others, I took the lead in introducing a universal, single payer health care bill that has garnered some 200 cosponsors – up from a handful when we began the effort back in the 1970’s.
￼  1000-foot long Laker ships loaded with Minnesota Iron Range iron ore and other products from our region make their way from Lake Superior through the Soo Locks and into the rest of the Great Lakes chain toward the St. Lawrence seaway.  
	•	Working across the aisle with Republicans and Democrats from Great Lakes states, we stopped Administration budget cuts and fully funded the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI). And we laid the groundwork for a billion-dollar repair and refurbishing of the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan so critical to Minnesota’s iron ore, agriculture, and manufacturing industries. 
￼  It’s easy to get worked up for a good cause, as I clearly did at this press conference announcing introduction of the Butch Lewis Act to ensure that no retiree’s hard-earned pension would ever be cut – not by one dime! 
	•	Drawing nationwide attention to America’s pension crisis, we established the bipartisan Pension Protection Caucus, and put a stop to proposed cuts by the Central States Pension Fund that would have forced hundreds of thousands of workers to take hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to their hard-earned pensions.
￼  Click on the screen above to hear me address the “Life and Breath” rally in front of the U.S. Capitol. Hundreds of lung cancer survivors, family members and supporters joined our daughter Katherine and me and other members of our Congressional Lung Cancer Caucus for this event to point out that lung cancer is a national emergency. 
	•	Lung cancer is the deadliest of all the cancers and yet, lifesaving medical research to better prevent, diagnose, treat and ultimately cure this terrible disease is drastically underfunded. Establishing the bipartisan Lung Cancer Caucus, we passed amendments designating more than $6 million for new lung cancer research, and helped add hundreds of millions of dollars for cancer research at the National Cancer Institute.
On the “fix things, solve problems and get stuff done” side... 
we focused more specifically on Minnesota and the people we are so proud to serve here in the 8th Congressional District. 
￼   Cirrus Aircraft's incredible Vision Jet is the world’s first single engine, personal jet aircraft equipped with a parachute system that actually floats the aircraft safely to the ground if trouble arises. 
	•	Cirrus Aircraft in Duluth is expanding and adding hundreds of new jobs thanks, in part, to our Small Aircraft legislation that changed federal regulations to accommodate and encourage advances in small aircraft technology.
￼  Our office was instrumental in obtaining a $10 million TIGER transportation grant for the Port of Duluth back in 2015. The Port anchors the westernmost point of the entire 2,340-mile Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway system that connects Minnesota’s mines, businesses, manufacturers, farmers, and timber producers with the global marketplace. 
	•	Minnesota gets back less of the federal tax money we send to Washington than almost any other state – about 65 cents on the dollar – and I made it my mission early on to change that. Over the past six years, on our watch, 8th District communities, airports, ports, schools, parks and other facilities have received more than $1.3 billion in federal funds for worthy projects that create good paying jobs and enhance everyone’s quality of life.  
	•	Shortly after taking office in 2013, and pounding on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) doors from Washington to Chicago, I was able to convince the agency to give our Iron Range mines more time to comply with EPA haze abatement regulations – saving thousands of jobs by preventing lengthy and unnecessary shutdowns. 
￼  On what Cleveland Cliffs Chairman and CEO Lorenco Goncalves famously called “the day that changed everything,” White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough addresses the press after his visit to Virginia, Minnesota in December 2015 at my request. After meeting with Steelworkers, mining company leaders, business people and elected officials to hear how illegal foreign steel was damaging the Range economy, he brought President Obama on board in support of tough new tariffs, countervailing duties, taxes and enforcement measures. 
	•	When illegal steel dumping by China and other trade cheater nations put thousands of miners, transportation workers, and Minnesota Iron Rangers from all walks of life out of work in 2015, President Obama’s White House Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough, came to the Range at my request to hear from the people affected and see the damage for himself.
That day in December 2015 became known as “the day that changed everything.” With the Administration on board, we led the way as the International Trade Commission (ITC) established tariffs and taxes of up to 522% on illegal foreign steel – and by the end of 2016, thousands of miners and other Rangers were back on the job, long before the current President took office.  
	•	Land exchanges between state and federal governments must be approved by Congress, and I was able to pass several of these measures into law for the benefit of our Minnesota Indian tribes, counties, and communities. And with help from Republican colleagues, I was proud to shepherd the PolyMet land exchange bill through the House. That measure, which awaits action by the Senate, is critical to the success of PolyMet’s NorthMet project to bring hundreds of good paying jobs to the Iron Range while preserving and protecting our precious environment through the most rigorous environmental review process, and environmental rules and regulations, in the world.   
 ￼  Click on the screen above to hear my speech on the floor of the House urging passage of our North Country Trail Bill. 
Millions of Americans love our hiking trails – and the good exercise and camaraderie they offer. With that in mind, the House earlier this year unanimously passed my bipartisan bill (H.R. 1026) to incorporate some 400 miles of world class trails within the Minnesota Boundary Waters, the Superior Hiking Trail, the Border Route Trail and the Kekekabic Trail into the North Country National Scenic Trail. 
	•	With help from local and state officials, landowners, volunteers and other stakeholders, we’ve finished the trail with a new route that skirts 100 miles of environmentally sensitive wetlands and bogs that had been included under a previous plan. And as I made clear to my colleagues, this measure doesn’t involve any new dollars or take any land through eminent domain.
	•	What the bill does do is put the finishing touches on a unified 4,600-mile national hiking trail system that stretches from the plains of North Dakota through Minnesota’s Arrowhead all the way to the forests of Vermont, where it will connect with the Appalachian Trail.
Serving the great people of Minnesota’s 8th District, as well as our great state and nation, here in Congress has been an honor and privilege for which I will always be grateful. Thank you for being a part of that journey through our Monday Report.   Sincerely,  ￼

Measuring Progress in Afghanistan
￼ 
I recently led a bipartisan Congressional delegation to Afghanistan to meet with our military leaders and learn more about the complex and dangerous situation there. 
I'm convinced that our efforts in Afghanistan are as important as ever. While much has changed since I first deployed four years ago, too much remains the same. It’s clear to me that the security situation has deteriorated even further since I deployed there and the threats have evolved, with the emerging threat of ISIS-K and the Taliban taking footholds in new parts of country since the failed Obama strategy of drawdown five years ago. 
Our ongoing efforts in Afghanistan are necessary to ensure another 9/11 does not occur. I remain committed to supporting these efforts and to seeing a successful conclusion to America’s longest war. Right now, there is a sense of optimism and belief that reconciliation is within reach. Congress must provide oversight and ensure our troops have the resources they need to do their jobs.

Asking the Navy to Consider the U.S.S. Fort Wayne
￼  
The greater Fort Wayne area produces many key naval capabilities, and several national security leaders hail from northeast Indiana. In honor of northeast Indiana’s national security contributions, I’ve asked the Navy to consider naming a combat ship the U.S.S. Fort Wayne. 
Visit with Aimmie Jenkins

I enjoyed meeting with Aimmie Jenkins, a Case Manager at Shepherds House in Fort Wayne. She is the 2018 Elizabeth Dole Foundation Caregiver Fellow for Indiana, and we are grateful for all her work on behalf of Hoosier veterans and caregivers.

Remembering President George H.W. Bush
From the war-torn skies over the Pacific to the hallowed halls of the White House, George H.W. Bush led a life of extraordinary service and profound consequence. 
As a young Member of Congress, George H.W. Bush gained the affection of his colleagues and earned a seat on the powerful Ways and Means Committee. 
Guided by his wisdom, sound judgment, and unshakable faith in freedom, President Bush forged a lasting international order and ushered in an era of national peace and prosperity. 
President Bush was a man of unimpeachable character and integrity whose decency and kindness earned him the respect and admiration of the nation he served. He was a dedicated husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather whose love for his country was surpassed only by his love for his family.  
With President Bush’s passing, the United States has lost one its greatest statesmen. And while George H.W. Bush is no longer with us, his legacy lives on, forever enshrined in the hearts of the countless Americans he inspired and touched throughout the course of his storied life.

December 3, 2018

Dear Friend, 

Last month, it was an honor to lead a bipartisan delegation to the Middle East.  Members served Thanksgiving Day lunch to service men and women who are stationed at Camp Buehring, Kuwait.  This summer, more than 4,000 members of the Mississippi Army National Guard were deployed in support of Operation Spartan Shield.  We let them know that we are proud of their service and understand the sacrifices they and their families have made to protect our nation.  

￼

Representatives Ron Estes (KS-4), Roger Marshall (KS-1), Vicente Gonzalez (TX-15), Jenniffer Gonzalez Colon (PR), and I traveled to Uzbekistan, Djibouti, and Kuwait.  Our mission was to meet with embassy officials and with national defense leaders in order to understand the current posture and readiness of U.S. forces.  It was equally important to make sure our troops on the ground have the support they need to carry out their missions successfully.

PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP VISITS TUPELO


￼

Last week, President Donald Trump traveled to Tupelo where he was greeted by thousands of Mississippians at the Tupelo Regional Airport.  He shared with all those in attendance the great things happening in Mississippi and across America, including a booming economy and historic lows in the unemployment rate.  The last time a sitting president visited Tupelo was in 1934.  President Franklin Delano Roosevelt came to celebrate Tupelo becoming the first city to receive electricity through the Tennessee Valley Authority, a public utility.

WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN DESOTO COUNTY

￼

In the First District and across Mississippi, an effort is well underway to build a workforce that will meet the specific needs of our job creators.  Our community colleges play a critical role meeting the demand to support skilled trades education, including Delta Technical College.

￼

Recently, Delta Tech broke ground on a 50,000-square-foot facility at their Horn Lake campus in DeSoto County.  The facility will be used for hands-on training programs including welding, HVAC, electrician, cosmetology, as well as medical and dental assisting.  It is exciting to see more opportunities which will enhance the quality life for families and, at the same time, meet the needs of our employers.

Dear Friends, 
 
A lot has happened since the Nov. 6 General Election, and I want to update you with what’s been happening. I’m pleased to report that last week I was elected by my peers to be Secretary of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) – the conscience of the Congress. As Democrats assume the majority in the 116th Congress come January, I look forward to using my position in leadership to expand and maintain the CBC’s historic role as not only the conscience of the Congress, but also as a force pursuing policies that positively impact our communities every day – access to health care and affordable prescription drugs, criminal justice reform, gun safety, environmental protection and equal access to a quality education. I was also named last week the Southeast Regional Whip for the 116th Congress, which means it will be my job to help garner votes for important legislation that comes to the House floor. 
 
Global Citizen: Mandela 100: This weekend, I attended the Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100 in Johannesburg, South Africa, to commemorate the life and legacy of Nelson Mandela. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that included a site visit coordinated by the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. It provided me and my colleagues an opportunity to see how U.S. dollars are spent and how they affect South African communities, especially in regard to combating the spread of HIV/AIDs. Global Citizen’s goals of ending poverty and hunger, preventing discrimination against girls and ensuring access to necessities like clean water are all laudable. I’m proud to have played a small part in the fight this week.
 
Back in Washington: I have a busy week ahead in Washington. Not only are we conducting oversight of antitrust enforcement in Judiciary Committee, but we’re also holding hearings with the CEO of Google and the Secretary of Homeland Security. I look forward to holding both government and powerful corporations accountable to the American people. 
 
Veterans Tax Credit: The IRS is reaching out to veterans to inform them that they might be due a credit or refund because of the Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act that passed in 2016. The law affects veterans who received disability severance payments after January 17, 1991, and included that payment as income. For more, click HERE.
 
Open Enrollment Through Dec. 15: The Marketplace helps uninsured people find health coverage. Visit healthcare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596 to get covered. You can also visit Oakhurst Medical Center to apply or by calling 404-298-8998, press *(star). Plans offered through the Marketplace can change each year — things like premiums, cost-sharing and coverage. You might have changed, too — your income, household, health conditions, or prescriptions. Make sure your plan still meets your needs for the upcoming year. If it doesn’t, now is the time to change plans. Get Covered! For more information, visit: https://hankjohnson.house.gov/resources/healthcaregov.
 
As always, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to represent you in Congress, and I look forward to seeing you soon.

Thank you for subscribing to my E-Newsletter! This week I want to update you on a recent event I attended highlighting the work of Lancaster’s agricultural community, share some highlights from my recent visit with students from Columbia High School, and let you know about the latest assistance Pennsylvanians are now eligible for to help repair damage caused by the devastating floods this summer. 
I enjoy hearing from you and responding to your questions via email, phone calls, and letters. If you'd like to share your concerns or opinions with me, or if you have questions about legislation or specific votes, you can send me an email here. Since taking office almost two years ago, I've responded to more than 145,000 contacts from you. To stay up-to-date on my work in the district and Washington, be sure to follow me on Facebook and Twitter. You can also check out my YouTube page here where there are 100+ videos, many of which are direct responses to your questions. 
I'm extraordinarily proud of the casework my office has been able to provide for constituents. More than 3,200 cases have been completed, and more than $650,000 has been returned to individuals.

Pennsylvania Receives Federal Disaster Declaration
Recently our community experienced devastating flooding. I want to provide an update to share that this past Tuesday Pennsylvania received an official disaster declaration from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). This designation will allow state and local entities, as well as certain nonprofits, to begin accessing grants to help repair our infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, that were damaged during the floods.
Additionally, for residents who have had their homes affected, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has a program for single family housing repair loans and grants, called the Section 504 Home Repair Program. You can find more information about this program here. If you have any questions, please call my office at 717-393-0667. 
 
Thanksgiving Humane Table
￼ 
I was proud to attend an event honoring numerous farmers and producers throughout Pennsylvania's 16th Congressional district that have taken great strides to ensure animals under their care are humanely-raised. 
These producers are American Humane Certified Farmers, meaning they follow ethical, commonsense, and scientifically-demonstrated standards to implement the best humane practices for animals. These standards include ensuring animals have clean air, fresh water, and feed supply, in addition to providing safe housing, sufficient space, and the appropriate environment. Moreover, this certification requires sensible handling in all stages of life to avoid unnecessary stress or suffering.
I am thankful for the tireless work on behalf of Lancaster County's agricultural producers to supply our community with ample food, and I am especially thankful for the thoughtful care these certified producers take to ensure humane treatment of animals. 
 
U.S. Capitol Visit with Columbia High School Students
 ￼
On Thursday, my office had the pleasure of welcoming a group of students from Columbia High School to visit Washington, D.C. This visit was a follow-up from our last meeting in Pennsylvania where we discussed school safety, gun laws, bullying, and mental health. I believe it is important to have an open dialogue to discuss the issues facing our community and I was pleased to have the opportunity to meet with these students after they wrote to me requesting to speak about school safety. We had a very productive discussion and I invited them to visit our nation's capital to continue the conversation.

Wicker Participates in Roundtable With President Trump on Prison Reform
Mississippi Event Sheds Light on Repeat Arrests, Efforts to Help Nonviolent Offenders
On his recent visit to Gulfport, President Trump convened a roundtable discussion to highlight opportunities to reform our criminal justice system.  I participated in this important discussion, along with Vice President Pence, Sen. Lindsey Graham, Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, Gov. Phil Bryant, and other leaders in our state who are working to get these reforms right.
The need for prison reform stems from troubling recidivism rates, in which criminal behavior is repeated after a prisoner serves his or her sentence.  In 2016, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that nearly half of federal prisoners put under community supervision are re-arrested within five years.  The bureau’s study found that state recidivism numbers were even worse, with 77 percent of state prisoners re-arrested in the same time period. 
Like the President, I believe in a strong judicial system that keeps Americans safe and holds criminals accountable.  Our nation is governed by laws, and those laws should be enforced.  However, we cannot ignore the pervasive social and financial costs of crime, as well as our responsibility to address these challenges in our communities.  
A Focus on Rehabilitation
High recidivism rates reflect the difficulties that many prisoners experience when reentering society.  At the roundtable, the President heard from Mississippians who work in law enforcement, our courts, our prisons, and our faith communities about the need to help these individuals get back on their feet.  In working with prisoners every day, these dedicated Mississippians have seen firsthand how alternative sentencing and second-chance employment can help.  As Mississippi Department of Corrections Commissioner Pelicia Hall noted in our discussion, lowering recidivism rates could save the state $264 million over a decade.
In addition to cost savings, these efforts are important to supporting safe, drug-free communities.  For example, with support of private industries and job training in prison, individuals who pose no risk to others can find meaningful work in their communities after being released.  With the proper drug rehabilitation, they can overcome problems with substance abuse. 
I have been a longtime supporter of Mississippi’s drug court programs and have participated in a number of drug court graduations over the years.  These programs are designed to help nonviolent drug offenders turn their lives around, using strict judicial supervision and mandatory drug tests rather than jail time.  As the opioid epidemic continues in our nation, programs like drug courts are more and more important. 
Bipartisan Approach Gains Momentum
I am also eager to see the Senate work on a promising bipartisan bill for criminal justice reform. Known as the “FIRST STEP Act,” the legislation has the support of the Trump Administration and a strong majority in the House of Representatives, which overwhelmingly passed the bill earlier this year.  It has also earned the endorsement of many major law enforcement groups and faith leaders.  The bill would incentivize prisoners to demonstrate good behavior and work toward job skills.
More than 95 percent of the Americans currently incarcerated will eventually be released from prison.  Our society is better off as a whole if these individuals return to normal lives when they go home.  Educational and vocational pathways can help offenders leave their criminal records behind while building on new opportunities in today’s thriving economy.

This week, the House is scheduled to consider legislation that could provide funding for our southern border. It is my hope that the Republican leadership does not fold to Democrats and that we pass legislation that delivers on our promise to secure our border. Listen HERE for my interview with Todd Starnes for more info.

Border Crisis  
This migrant crisis that we are seeing at our border is what happens when we start talking about amnesty before we secure our border. Our current border crisis only highlights our past mistakes. Now we have migrants charging our border, hurting our law enforcement and using children as shields to enter our country illegally. We have a process for asylum. The violence that has been reported makes it clear many of these migrants are not willing to be apart of the process.

Remembering Arizona's Former Congressman Ed Pastor
Following the heartbreaking news of former Congressman Ed Pastor passing away, the Arizona delegation gathered on the House floor for a moment of silence. Former Congressman Pastor was proud of his heritage and the people he served. He was a true spirit of a gentleman, he included me and took the time to talk, to say hi, to smile and to laugh. His warm heart and dedication to serving Arizona will always be remembered.

Say ""No"" To Land Grabs
The American people are tired of the land grabs, especially those from the previous administration. This week, the Supreme Court ruling found the federal government has no authority to lock up private land for species that don’t habitat the land that is being locked up. In doing so, the Court wiped out the unconstitutional Court of Appeals decision and sent the case back to the 5th Circuit with specific instructions.

Week In Review
 This week, our country lost two incredible Americans. President George H.W. Bush and Congressman Ed Pastor will never be forgotten.   President Bush served the American people for over 70 years with leadership and integrity. He taught each of us how to respect others and work together through some of our nation's toughest times. We send our condolences to the Bush family, and thank them for sharing their loved one with us for so many years.   Congressman Pastor was a dean of our delegation. He was a bipartisan leader, who worked for every Arizonan. This Friday, the Arizona delegation and members of the House of Representatives held a moment of silence in honor of his legacy. We send our thoughts and prayers to the Pastor family during this time.   God Bless, and Rest In Peace Mr. President and Congressman Pastor.   ￼  The above picture shows the Arizona delegation standing together on the House Floor for a moment of silence in honor of Congressman Pastor.    ￼  Above shows the Arizona delegation meeting for a breakfast discussion in Congresswoman Debbie Lesko's office. From left, Rep. Biggs, Rep. Gallego, Rep. Lesko, Rep-elect Greg Stanton, Sentor Kyl, Rep. Kirkpatrick, and Rep. Gosar joined for coffee and discussion on how we can all continue to work together to best represent Arizonans.

Dear Friend,
I hope all of you had a safe, wonderful Thanksgiving with your loved ones. With the end of the year approaching, there's still important work to be done by Congress that imacts people's lives.. We passed an important -- albeit temporary -- extension of the National Flood Insurance Program, critical to homeowners across the nation.
 
We also passed the Action for Dental Health Act, which will go a long way in helping vulnerable and underserved populations access needed oral health care. Now, watch in the coming weeks for final appropriation and tax measures that should get addressed as well.
 
Have a great week and please let me know whenever I can be of assistance to you or your family. Join the conversation online by visiting my website, Facebook page, Twitter, and Instagram.

Sincerely,
 
￼ Erik Paulsen Member of Congress
Continuing the Fight Against the Medical Device Tax
The medical device industry is truly an American and Minnesota success story. In Minnesota, more than 35,000 people are employed at almost 700 medtech companies -- mostly small businesses that employ fewer than 25 people. The Medical Device Tax puts every one of these jobs at risk: when it was in effect, the tax killed more than 29,000 good paying jobs across the country. 
Most importantly, this harms patients who need treatments and cures. It's why I've focused so much time and attention to make permanent repeal of this tax a bipartisan priority.
That effort continued this week, as I sought to amend a tax bill under consideration by the House and add a provisioin that once again takes aim at the medical device tax. Making sure patients can access life-improving and life-saving technologies isn't a partisan issue. Republicans and Democrats agree this tax is bad policy. It's time we give our med-tech innovators the certainty they deserve.
 
A Visit to Grandview Middle School 
I recently had the chance to visit with Sixth Graders at Grandview Middle School in Mound. Their enthusiasm to learn about public service was palpable, and you could tell their teachers were doing a great job teaching them about government. Thanks to the folks at Grandview for having me!

Remembering President George H.W. Bush
￼  
America mourns as we lose a true American hero and true statesman, George Herbert Walker Bush. 
As one of the youngest Navy pilots during WWII, George H.W. Bush demonstrated remarkable patriotism and selfless humility. Through his steadfast leadership, President Bush guided our nation to the peaceful end of the Cold War, underscored with the demise of the Berlin Wall. May his profound legacy of public service serve as a reminder to all Americans, “We as a people have such a purpose today. It is to make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world.” 
Now he is reunited with Barbara, his beloved wife. I send my sincerest condolences to the Bush Family, who selflessly shared President Bush’s life with our nation for over seven decades. Rest in peace, Mr. President. 
Former President George H. W. Bush will lie in state in the Rotunda of the United States Capitol from Monday, December 3 through Wednesday, December 5, 2018. The Capitol Rotunda will open to the public from 7:30 PM on Monday and remain open until 7:00 AM on Wednesday. Anyone interested in paying their respects during the public viewing may contact our Washington D.C office at (202)-225-4276 for assistance. 
House Passes Bipartisan Fitzpatrick Government Reform Bill
￼  
The American people deserve a Federal Government that provides efficient, effective, and high-quality service. Unfortunately, the Federal Government ranks among the bottom of all U.S.-industries when it comes to customer satisfaction. The Federal Agency Customer Experience Act ensures that federal agencies collect voluntary feedback from individuals about their interactions with the government. By gathering user comments, agencies will be able to gauge customer service concerns and publicly report the feedback they receive.  The result is a win-win. The American public receives better services and customer care, while agencies achieve greater impact and ability to fulfill their missions.
Learn more about this effort to improve the Federal customer service experience HERE. 
  
Demanding Bipartisan Action to Save LWCF
￼  
Since its establishment over 50 years ago, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has promoted recreational activity and contributed to our nation’s robust economy, along with conserving our national parks, forests, and critical wildlife areas. This week, I joined Land and Water Conservation Fund champions in the House and Senate in a rally on the steps of the U.S. Capitol with conservation leaders and outdoor recreation advocates to demand Congress reauthorize and fully fund America’s most important conservation and recreation program, the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), before the end of the year.

Our Congressional Work Continues…
Dear Friend:
I appreciate you taking the time to read this brief update. It remains an honor for me to serve as your United States Representative in Washington, D.C.   With Thanksgiving now in the rearview mirror, I am back in Washington, D.C. where we continue our work in Congress on a wide range of issues of importance to our nation and to those of us in Colorado. This past week we voted on bills covering a range of topics from the annual funding of the U.S. Coast Guard to a bill on modernizing our federal technology management structure.  The most significant bill we voted on this week was the latest extension of the national flood insurance program. This bill, H.R. 7187, The National Flood Insurance Program Further Extension Act authorizes the National Flood Insurance Program until December 7, 2018. Absent this vote, the program was set to expire on November 30, 2018. This bill represents the seventh time now that we have had to vote to extend the existing national flood insurance program that is badly in need of a major overhaul. The House of Representatives passed a long-term measure, H.R.2874, The 21st Century Flood Reform Act, that provided much needed reforms to the program, over a year ago, but the Senate has simply not taken up any flood insurance bill for a vote. This is very frustrating that the House finds itself forced to take the time it could otherwise use to address other issues on behalf of the American people to keep passing these short term extensions. 

The other bills we voted on this week were not very controversial, but that does not mean they are not important to our nation. For example, we passed S. 140, The Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018. The Coast Guard performs many vital missions, such as search and rescue at sea, preventing seaborne drug smuggling, and maintaining navigation aids for our ports. Keeping it adequately funded is important to our nation so, I am pleased we passed this legislation on a bipartisan basis.

At the Military Personnel Subcommittee, which I Chair, the Department of Defense (DoD) made its first presentation on a major reform to the laws covering the mobilization of members of the National Guard and the Reserves. At present, there are about 400 different sections of law that were enacted piecemeal over decades that cover these mobilizations. This makes it very difficult administratively for the DoD and it frequently leaves service members confused and upset about how and when they will be paid. Revising and reforming these laws is a major priority of mine and I am pleased that the process is now well underway.

At a House Veterans Affairs Committee hearing this week, we followed up with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on an issue I wrote about in a Message from Mike in early November. The VA has shown that they have a problem making timely and accurate payments for living expenses to veterans under the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill. The VA announced how it plans to address this problem on Wednesday.

While I appreciate the VA making this effort to address the issue, I don’t believe their proposed solution complies with the requirements under current law! You can see in the clip below some of the questions I asked of the VA.

￼

Again, my real concern is protecting our veterans and making sure that those veterans studying under the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill receive their housing and living assistance on a timely basis. For me, this is just another example of why the new VA Secretary, Robert Wilkie, needs to clean house and fire incompetent bureaucrats at the Senior Executive Service level who have consistently failed to deliver the benefits that our veterans have earned through their military service. So far, Secretary Wilkie has refused to do so. Until these changes are made at the most senior echelons of management at the VA, the culture of bureaucratic incompetence at that agency will never change.

Finally, I invite you to stay in contact with me via my Website, Facebook or Twitter account. See you around the district!

Sincerely, 
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
The people of Alabama have had many wins, both on the gridiron against Georgia this weekend and here in Washington.  
In the next Congress, several members of the Alabama Congressional Delegation will be taking some prominent positions throughout the House of Representatives and the Senate. 
Senator Shelby will continue to serve as the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Rep. Gary Palmer was elected Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, the fifth highest ranking position within the Republican party in the House, and Rep. Mike Rogers will be the Ranking Member of the House Homeland Security Committee. 
 * * * 
I hope your Thanksgiving holiday was filled with friends, family, and good food as we took a moment to give thanks for the many blessings we have in our lives today. 
It was great to spend the day with my family, and I am thankful for every moment I spend with them. 
I am also thankful for the opportunity I have to serve you in the next Congress. 
With Thanksgiving and the first leg of Christmas shopping behind us, it is now into the final legislative stretch in Washington. 
As we round out the year, I remain committed to securing our borders through my 50 Votes for the Wall Act, enacting sound economic policy for a strong future in America, and rebuilding our military to combat international threats. 
Most importantly, I remain committed to you and all the people of Alabama. In all that I do in Washington, I keep the people of Alabama in mind and do everything I can to make sure the policies I support are the best for you.
Keep up to date with all the latest news from Washington through my Facebook and Twitter! 
Remembering George H.W. Bush 
￼ 
George H.W. Bush was an American hero and icon. Throughout his 94 years, he served our nation in so many ways, and he accomplished so much. Despite all of this, I think the life of George H.W. Bush is best summed up in a very simple phrase: he was a good man. May God be with the Bush family and a grateful nation as we mourn and remember a good man and an American hero.
President Bush will lay in state in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol starting on Monday, and a funeral service will be held at National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday. Wednesday will be a National Day of Mourning as we remember President George H.W. Bush. 
Illegal Immigration Update 
The caravan of illegal immigrants still marches steadily toward our southern border, and I wanted to give you an update on the status of my 50 Votes for the Wall Act. 
As of today, we have a total of 23 co-sponsors, and interest continues to grow. You can read the full text of the bill here. 
We must build the wall, reform our broken immigration system, and increase our border security. We cannot put our nation’s security or sovereignty in jeopardy by not acting.  
We must make sure the interests of American citizens are put first and that we continue to strive for safer neighborhoods, safer communities, and a safer nation. 
Friendly Wager 
￼ 
As you can see from the above picture, a legacy of winning is always a great thing to celebrate. 
This was me last year enjoying my Chick-fil-A meal provided by Rep. Drew Ferguson of Georgia after winning our friendly wager on the SEC Championship between Alabama Crimson Tide and the Bulldogs. 
I made the same wager with Rep. Ferguson again this year, so I'm looking forward to enjoying some more Chick-fil-a! What a thrilling football game it was, and I can't say enough about the heart of that Alabama football team, especially Jalen Hurts. What a great example Jalen is for so many young athletes out there.

National Adoption Month 
 ￼ 
November was National Adoption Month!
Adoption is such a loving option for many families throughout our country.  
I was proud to support preserving the adoption tax credit in tax reform last year, as we work to encourage adoptions.  
National Adoption Day was November 17, and it is appropriate that we celebrate the joys of adoption in the same month we give thanks for all our many blessings. 
There was some great news that came out just last Monday: Alabama families have set a record for most adoptions in 2018! 
Our families are perhaps the greatest things we can be thankful for around the holidays, and it is great to see Alabama making strides towards these loving choices. 
In Case You Missed It!

The National Christmas Tree was lit in spectacular fashion on a cold Thursday night at the White House. A nearly one hundred year old tradition continues! 
What's Ahead 
In Washington, we are entering the home stretch of the 115th Congress. It has been a long year filled with many victories for the people of Alabama, but there is still work to be done. 
Currently, around three-quarters of the government funded for next year, including the critical funding needed to rebuild our military. This was the first time in a decade that we have been able to reach this point on time and in a bipartisan way.
We still need to pass a Farm Bill that works for our Alabama farmers and foresters, ensure the national flood insurance program continues, pass a funding bill for the remaining portions of the federal government, and protect our Southern border.  
We must address funding for agencies like the Department of Justice, Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Homeland Security. I want to see a funding bill that reflects the need to rein in wasteful spending while also supporting programs and projects important to Alabama.
As we near the finish line, I am committed to trying to get a few more wins for Alabama and America before the next Congress starts.

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend,

On Friday, President George H.W. Bush passed away. Our nation grieves for the entire Bush family with the loss of President Bush. From Naval aviator, to congressman, ambassador, CIA Director, Vice President, and President of the United States, George H.W. Bush dedicated his life to humbly serving our country. In every aspect of his life, he worked to create a kind and greater nation. 

We should all strive to live like George H.W. Bush. He put it best in saying, ""be bold in your caring, be bold in your dreaming and above all else, always do your best."" Fair winds and following seas - may he rest in peace.

This week, we made progress in helping those most affected by Hurricane Michael and  worked to protect veterans' benefits. Please read about my week below: 

Ensuring Our Veterans Get Their Benefits
Recently, I introduced legislation to ensure that veterans continue to receive their GI benefits in areas affected by disasters such as Hurricane Michael. H.R. 7119 extends the amount of time that the Department of Veterans Affairs can continue to pay educational benefits to veterans when a school is temporarily closed. Veterans returning to civilian life need support and the GI Bill is a critical component in their transition. Following Hurricane Michael, I learned that some veterans were in danger of losing their educational benefits because their schools were unable to open and comply with federal regulations. It’s clear that these regulations fail to take into account the long-term devastation a hurricane like Michael causes. My bill ensures that veterans are able to continue working toward completing their degrees by extending time requirements to their benefit.

Fighting For Our Students
￼ 
Thank you to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for joining me in Bay County this week. We spent time at Cedar Grove Elementary School and then held a round table at Rutherford High School. We heard from students, teachers, and school administrators about Hurricane Michael recovery and discussed ways we can support our local school systems.
￼ 
Protecting Our Agricultural Producers This week, I joined with members representing areas across the southeast in advocating for adequate agricultural disaster funding in the wake of Hurricanes Michael and Florence. A bipartisan coalition of 28 members from Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, and Georgia wrote to Speaker Paul Ryan and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi urging House action on agricultural assistance by the end of the year. I’ve visited countless agriculture producers across the Second District and listened as they described the absolute devastation their operations suffered, and it’s clear that they need help. We will continue to make our case until their needs are met. Click here to learn more.   Mobile Office Hours  My district staff will be hosting Mobile Office Hours in Jackson and Gulf Counties this week. I encourage you to stop by to see how my office might be able to help you.  Monday, December 3, 2018 Gulf County  Time: 1:00PM-4:00PM CT Location: Wewahitchka Senior Citizens & Community Center, 314 North 3rd Street, Wewahitchka, FL 32465  Tuesday, December 4, 2018 Jackson County  Time: 9:00AM-12:00PM CT Location: 2929 Green St, Marianna, FL 32446  Thank you for your continued energy and enthusiasm, as reflected in your letters and Facebook posts.

December 2, 2018
Greetings,
This weekend, American hearts are heavy as we bid farewell to President George H.W. Bush. He will be remembered as a good and faithful servant to his country, whose great legacy of leadership and love of homeland became a family tradition, earned him the admiration of countless Americans, and secured him a special place in the memory of every Texan. Over his storied career, President Bush was a war hero and a businessman, a legislator and an ambassador. His time as Vice President prepared him well for the heavy burdens of that highest office, steering our nation through the fall of the Berlin Wall and the First Gulf War. Today, George and his beloved Barbara are together, enjoying a well-deserved rest from their labors.
On Tuesday, I voiced the concerns I’ve heard and share with many Texans across the state regarding technology companies engaging in censorship, in a hearing focused on examining the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) priorities in protecting consumers from privacy violations. During the hearing, I encouraged the commissioners to use their authority to address the concerns consumers have with technology companies, and to help provide transparency.
For far too long, the Ortega regime has operated with almost total impunity as it systematically repressed the people of Nicaragua, targeted political opponents for torture and murder, and aligned with hostile governments like Venezuela, Cuba, Russia, and China. As a result, hundreds of Nicaraguans have been imprisoned or killed. The regime exploited international loans to advance their policies. This week, I was grateful that my colleagues in the Senate passed my bipartisan bill, the NICA Act, to address the crisis occurring in Nicaragua, and ensure international loans will no longer be doled out to keep the regime afloat. This sends a strong signal to Ortega and his cronies that the U.S. will continue to increase pressure until they pursue meaningful democratic reform and human rights protections.
In the weeks after Harvey made landfall, Congress united to pass the Cruz-Cornyn-Rubio bill, which provided crucial tax relief for hurricane survivors. An important part of this bill eliminated the tax penalty for hurricane survivors who wanted to withdraw from your retirement accounts to pay for the costs of repairs from storm damages. But retirement account withdrawals must be made by December 31, 2018. That deadline is coming up quickly. I strongly urge my fellow Texans, if you are still in the process of rebuilding and recovering from the ravages of Harvey, to contact your tax advisor or for more information go to the IRS website at irs.gov. I am encouraged by the progress we’ve seen in the Texas communities that were affected by Hurricane Harvey, and will continue working each and every day to ensure Texas rebuilds stronger than before.

Walker Weekly Report
￼
On Friday, November 30th, our nation saw the passing of 94-year-old George H.W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States. President Bush, “41,” had a remarkable life of military and political service to our country. Flying over 58 combat missions in WWII, Bush was the youngest pilot in the Navy when he received his wings.
In 1966, Bush was elected to the United States House of Representatives from the 7th Congressional District of Texas. Later, he was selected by Ronald Reagan as his vice president. He served until 1989, when he successfully ran his own presidential campaign. We honor his history of public service and the many important accomplishments he achieved. We also honor and remember Barbara Bush, his wife of 73 years who preceded him in death on April 17, 2018. 
“No problem of human making is too great to be overcome by human ingenuity, human energy, and the untiring hope of the human spirit.” These words from George H.W. Bush remind us of the importance for public service, volunteerism, and charity. These thoughts help to guide us in Washington each day, and inspire us to introduce bills such as the LIFT for Charities Act and the Universal Charitable Giving Act.  This proposed legislation would insure that the work of churches and charitable organizations – so important and needed by many Americans – is not burdened by misaligned tax code and regulations.
Keep reading for the full update. Have a blessed week.
Sincerely, ￼ Mark Walker

HIGHLIGHTS
￼
My Legislation to Stop New Tax on Churches and Charities Added to Tax Relief Bill
Serving others is a cornerstone of our community – and was my motivation when I decided to run for Congress. This week, text from our legislation, H.R. 6460, the Lessening Impediments From Taxes (LIFT) for Charities Act was proposed as an amendment to H.R. 88, the Retirement, Savings, and Other Tax Relief Act by House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady. The inclusion of this text would help charities and churches across the country whose work and service would be hindered by new taxes and compliance fees. To do this, our legislation would eliminate a measure that requires charities, churches, and traditionally tax-exempt organizations to pay federal taxes on provided employee benefits.
We have made important strides to lessen burdensome regulations and taxes for American families and small business, but our work is not done. Every dollar a charity spends goes further than a government dollar. That’s why our focus has been to deliver policies that foster hope, opportunity, and prosperity. We have no better ally in that mission than the nonprofits that serve our communities without reservation, but with every bit of their complete devotion.

Remembering WWII Hero Hosea Wyrick of Burlington
This week, we also mourn the loss of another American hero, Hosea Wyrick, in our own community of Burlington. Hosea dedicated his 97 years of life to our country, serving with the 111th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron in the Air Force during World War II. For his heroism, he was awarded the Air Medal with eight clusters, two battle stars and a Purple Heart.
Hosea’s patriotism will never be forgotten as we celebrate his life and legacy. I recently had the privilege of presenting Mr. Wyrick a flag flown over the Capitol in his honor. Words cannot express our gratitude for his service and sacrifice, along with all of our veterans in the Sixth District.

This week, we also spent time focused on our criminal justice system, and paving a way to reform. As a co-sponsor to H.R. 5682, the FIRST STEP Act, this has always been a priority in Congress. This legislation takes important steps to reform a prison system that routinely turns low level offenders into hardened, repeat offenders. This legislation expands education and job training opportunities for prisoners, offering them a much-needed hand up to once again become productive members of society.
Aside from the FIRST STEP Act, we also spent time this week in the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform holding a hearing titled, “Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Management of its Female Inmate Population.” This hearing discussed BOP policies regarding female inmate needs and examined how to make such prison programs more successful for inmate transition to civilian life.
All Americans deserve a second chance and a path paved for redemption. There are 2.7 million children under the age of 18 that have an incarcerated parent. This statistic alone is good reason to push for sound reforms to restore families, create employment opportunities and bring faith back to those held in correctional facilities.

From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:
Good Afternoon,
This week in Congress,I, along with Representatives Doug Collins (R-GA) and David Cicilline (D-R.I.), introduced H.R. 7190, the Small Business Reorganization Act (SBRA).
Helping Small Businesses Restructure Debt
H.R. 7190 will streamline existing bankruptcy procedures and provide new tools to increase a small business’ ability to achieve a successful restructuring. The Small Business Reorganization Act is a tremendous step forward in streamlining bankruptcy procedures. By reducing unnecessary procedural burdens, enhancing oversight, and increasing the debtors’ ability to negotiate; we will ensure quick and successful reorganization and provide small business’ the ability to restructure in a way that meets their needs. I thank my colleagues for their work on the introduction of this bill.
Tobyhanna Army Depot Sees Major Overhaul
I learned that Tobyhanna Army Depot unveiled its latest modernization project, bringing a state-of-the-art working environment to its 3700 employees and adding more than 200 full time jobs.
￼
Monday’s ribbon cutting ceremony at Tobyhanna’s upgraded 30,000 square-foot facility marked the completion of a project 3 years in the making. One of the Depot’s major additions includes a high-tech electronics maintenance enclosure to test equipment and increase readiness across the Department of Defense. Tobyhanna Army Dept is one of Monroe County’s largest employers and I am proud of the work that has been done to bring diverse career opportunities to the area. Tobyhanna’s revamped space will undoubtedly improve logistical support for our warfighters now and in the future.
Tobyhanna Army Depot is looking to fill those 200 new jobs before the end of December. To see what is available and apply, click here.
Take the Broadband Speed Test
The Center for Rural Pennsylvania and researchers at Penn State University are collaborating to measure actual broadband access in Pennsylvania to better determine service needs. By taking an online broadband speed test, residents across the commonwealth can help map the current prevalence of high-speed broadband services in the state.
The challenges in providing broadband access to rural America is cost. It simply does not make sense for companies to make expensive investments in broadband infrastructure that will serve a relatively small number of customers. In order to change the incentive structure, I introduced H.R. 6871, the Rural Broadband Connectivity Act to make broadband deployment more affordable and comprehensive. Paired with my bill, the data gathered by the Center and their research partners at Penn State will have a major impact on future policy discussions that can effectively bring broadband access to more rural Pennsylvanians.
To help map broadband access in Pennsylvania and learn more about your broadband connection, take the test here.
End of Insurance Period Information for Producers with Excess Moisture in Fields
Due to the frequency of rain and resulting flooding in Pennsylvania this year, I have been contacted by producers in PA-10 concerned if they will be able to get into their fields prior to the end of the insurance period on December 10.
￼
USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA) has a fact sheet as a reference for those producers suffering the effects of excess moisture. Along with this guide, growers are encouraged to reach out to their crop insurance agent for additional information on claims made for crop losses.
Funding Directed to Assist Pennsylvanians Affected by August Flooding
President Trump declared that a major disaster exists in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and has ordered Federal assistance to supplement recovery efforts by the Commonwealth and local agencies affected by severe storms and flooding from August 10 to August 15, 2018.
Under the public assistance program, Commonwealth and eligible governments and certain private nonprofit organizations requesting aid can receive up to 75% of costs incurred in emergency work and recovery efforts. Repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms and flooding in the counties of Bradford, Columbia, Lackawanna, Lycoming, Montour, Schuykill, Sullivan, Susquehanna, Tioga, and Wyoming are eligible for federal assistance.
I am grateful for President Trump’s decision to issue a disaster declaration for much of Pennsylvania as a result of the floods that struck our communities in August. This declaration is a critical step of the rebuilding process that will unlock a tremendous amount of federal resources to support recovery efforts.  I look forward to more details on these contributions towards the recovery efforts and stand ready to work with officials from the Commonwealth and local governments to get our area back on track after these destructive storms.
Music Modernization Act Award
What a pleasure it was to meet with the Recording Academy and receive the GRAMMYs on the Hill Award for being a champion of music in the 115th Congress.
￼
I proudly supported the Music Modernization Act, the biggest update to music legislation in nearly 4 decades. This bill updates several key provisions of U.S. copyright law regarding music licensing and protections for music creators nationwide. Thank you for this wonderful award!

Dear Friends,

This week in central Arkansas and Washington was informative and productive as I met with job creators, our brave heroes, future leaders at Springhill Elementary School in Greenbrier, and others. 

It is also with heavy hearts that Martha and I mourn the passing of a loyal friend, mentor, and faithful servant, President George H.W. Bush. We lift up the Bush family during this time of grieving and honor the remarkable life and legacy of a strong leader and diplomat, a great father, and an American patriot.

￼
In our early careers, Martha and I treasured working President George H.W. Bush on his campaigns and the humbling responsibility of serving on his White House staff. We were grateful for his daily example of goofy humor, courtesy, friendship, and passion for writing handwritten thank-you notes. Truly, President George H.W. Bush and Mrs. Bush were the ideal neighbors, members of the PTA, and the answer to the question on that common form at school or work, ‘in case of emergency, please call..."" We loved him very much.

Sharing Personal Stories of President George H.W. Bush
￼
I joined Ana Cabrera on CNN Saturday night and shared personal stories of my interactions and experiences working with President George H.W. Bush. We mourn his death but celebrate his life. He was a man who possessed a volunteer spirit and that of service above self. Watch here. 

Visiting with Conway's Manufacturers 
￼
 I started off my week touring the Virco headquarters in Conway with Steve Presley, the Vice President and General Manager, and his leadership team. I had the chance to see how their 100 percent American made products were crafted before they are sent out to schools all over Arkansas and the country. We talked about how tariffs are impacting their facilities and how I can better help support our local manufacturers as their representative in Congress. 

Meeting with Future Leaders at Springhill Elementary
￼
On Monday, it was a joy to speak with Springhill Elementary School's third grade class about the job and responsibilities of Representatives in Congress. They recently finished their U.S. Government module and had a lot of questions for me ranging from what I do in my free time, my favorite presidents, and how I spend my days while I am in D.C. representing them. These Arkansas students from Greenbrier are an impressive group.  

Honoring our Veterans at the Nabholz Wall of Honor
￼
Top picture, left to right: Rep. Hill, Charles Nabholz (founder, Nabholz Properties), FR Anthony Robbins (St. Joseph's Parish), Greg Williams (CEO, Nabholz), and Brad Hegeman (COO, Nabholz). Bottom picture, left to right: Rep. Hill, Don Greenland (Strategic Growth Officer, Nabholz), Mark Berry (Adjutant General, Arkansas National Guard), and Charles Nabholz. 

It was an honor to attend the unveiling of the new Nabholz Corporation's Wall of Honor memorial. The wall displays the names of the veterans who have worked in their corporation since it was founded in 1949. Nabholz further demonstrated its strong support for our veterans by donating $10,000 to the REBOOT Alliance, which is dedicated to helping our heroes and first responders deal with the stress and challenges they might face following a traumatic event. 

Congratulations, Scott McLean
￼
Congratulations to my good friend and Arkansan, Scott McLean, for being honored with the Marie Interfaith Civic Leadership Award, which is given annually to recognize people whose work addresses community issues in Arkansas. Scott founded the re-entry ministry program called the Pathway to Freedom in 2011. This program's goal is to change prison culture, break the cycle of recidivism in Arkansas, and help ex-prisoners successfully adjust back into their communities. Watch here. 

Securing Our Borders
￼
On the Rio Grande River with U.S. Border Patrol Agents in Del Rio, Texas and with Val Verde County Sheriff Joe Frank Martinez along the Rio Grande River. 

Many of you have reached out with questions about the recent crisis on our Southwest border. I wanted to offer some additional background on this matter. After being briefed by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and reviewing documents from the Mexican government, it’s my understanding that each migrant in the caravan was offered asylum and a job in Mexico, but they all declined. Here are some additional myths and facts to provide clarity. 

I'm actively engaged on this issue, and in May of this year, I visited the southern border for the fourth time and met with border patrol agents, state and local officials, including the Val Verde County judge and sheriff. I continue to build my understanding of the strategic challenges we face and what the House can do to deliver on our promise to better secure our borders and protect our families. 

America is a nation of immigrants. We are the most generous and welcoming country in the world and we want people to come here, but the right way.

Arkansans are Focused on the Economy
￼
Over the last four years, I have heard from central Arkansans like you who have told me that they're focused on the economy and results in Washington. On Friday, I talked to Tom Keene on Bloomberg TV about the importance of bipartisan success on immigration, health care reform that's affordable, and trade opportunities that allow our job creators on Main Street to thrive. If you would like to watch, see here.  
 
Thank you for taking time to keep up with the work I'm doing on your behalf. If I can be of any assistance to you or your family, please reach out to my office at (501) 324-5941 or Hill.House.Gov. 

Sincerely,

Dear Friend, 
My fight for those impacted by Hurricane Michael continued this week as my colleagues in the Georgia Delegation joined me in sending a bipartisan letter to Speaker Paul Ryan, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee requesting legislative action by the December 7th government funding deadline to address damages to agriculture and our rural communities in Georgia impacted by Hurricane Michael.
Recent projections conducted by University of Georgia Cooperative Extension estimate the losses for Georgia’s agricultural industry caused by Hurricane Michael at $2.5 billion. This is the third consecutive year that Georgia’s farmers and communities have been hit by a hurricane, and it is imperative that farmers have assistance as soon as possible or we risk losing next year’s crop and severely impacting our agricultural-reliant communities and economies for years to come. 
You can click here to read our bipartisan letter, and please let us know if we can be of assistance to you or your family as you recover from this storm. 
  
PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNS NEW NORTH AMERICAN TRADE DEAL 
On Friday, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, President Donald Trump, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in Buenos Aires. 
President Trump promised to deliver a modernized North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that would be better for America’s farmers, businesses, and workers. I’m hopeful that this newly announced agreement will do just that and look forward to carefully analyzing the details of the agreement with my colleagues.

The United States and Canada share a very special relationship, and I am thankful for the opportunity to discuss the issues that impact us both and look for ways we can strengthen our partnerships even further.

Friends, 
 
As your Congressman, my responsibilities extend beyond our district and our borders. The United States and our allies face a growing list of threats from abroad – from Islamic extremism in the form of ISIS, to illegal immigration and drug trafficking along our southern border, to the aggressive actions of Russia across Eastern Europe and the Middle East. These threats to our way of life are real, as we’ve seen by the recent arrest of a dangerous MS-13 gang member who admitted to authorities that he traveled with the caravan of Central American migrants trying to qualify for asylum in our country.
 
The threats to our security continue to grow in scope and scale. That’s why I’ve made national security a top priority and why I serve as Vice-Chair of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly’s Ad Hoc Committee on Countering Terrorism. This is a critical leadership position on the OSCE, the world’s largest regional security organization.
 
￼
Representing the U.S. at an international gathering of parliamentarians. 
 
As part of my responsibilities, I’m hosting the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on Countering Terrorism – a member of the Greek Parliament – for a series of meetings, briefings and discussions with representatives from the United Nations, the National Counterterrorism Center, and other security-related agencies this week. We will discuss where OSCE participating States converge and diverge on policies to counter terrorism and violent extremism, as well as the state of transatlantic counterterrorism cooperation.
 
In addition, I continue to be a strong and vocal critic of Russian aggression on the world stage. I have repeatedly condemned Moscow’s actions against Ukraine, and I have supported increased pressure and sanctions. That’s why I wrote a letter to President Donald Trump last week supporting his strong leadership regarding the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and Russian aggression. Russia has broken the treaty, and the Trump Administration has been very clear that Russian noncompliance with the INF Treaty poses a grave threat to the security of our nation as Russia has shown an unwillingness to come back into compliance.
 
Earlier last week, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said, “The intelligence community assesses Russia has flight tested, produced and deployed cruise missiles with a range capability that are prohibited by the treaty. Russia has shown no sign that it is willing to acknowledge its violation, let alone return to full and verifiable compliance.”
 
The INF Treaty isn’t a one-way street, and we need to make it crystal clear that the United States will not tolerate Moscow’s brazen violations. We must show the United States remains committed to the reduction and prevention of the use of nuclear arms while condemning Russian violations in the strongest way possible in front of the international community. 
 
We cannot continue to allow our nation to be in a situation where we are bound by a treaty to which we are the only nation complying. I fully support the president’s leadership on this issue – to build a safer world, we have to play by the same rules.
 
 
Until next week,
￼
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)

Honoring the Life of President George H.W. Bush



President George Herbert Walker Bush was a patriot who dedicated his life to serving our nation. Beginning in his teens when he enlisted as a Naval Aviator during World War II, service that led him to being shot down over the Pacific, he always put country first. During his time as Vice President and later President, he was an impressive world leader advancing our values abroad and helping end the Cold War. Personally, I will never forget gathering a group of friends to go see President Bush at a campaign rally in my hometown of Gastonia during his 1992 reelection campaign.

Beyond his service to our country, President Bush was a tremendous father and role model for all Americans. Alongside his beloved wife Barbara, he raised a wonderful family and throughout his political career, President Bush led with such decency, always treating political allies and rivals with the same level of respect. Giulia and I join the rest of a grateful nation in praying for the entire Bush family as they mourn the passing of a true statesman.

My New Role in the 116th Congress



I am honored to have been elected to be the Republican leader of the House Financial Services Committee for the 116th Congress. I look forward to working with my colleagues—both Democrat and Republicans alike—as we continue to help families and small business right here in the Tenth District and all across the country. You can read my full statement by clicking here or on the image below.

￼

A couple of weeks ago I joined Bloomberg to discuss my candidacy to be the Ranking Republican on the House Financial Services Committee. There I had the opportunity to discuss what I hoped to achieve as Ranking Member during the 116th Congress and the importance of focusing on the families and communities that are impacted by financial services legislation. In addition, I shared my thoughts on a recent hearing with Fed Vice Chairman Randal Quarles on stress tests for banks and the need for new technologies to help banks address the challenges they are facing today. Click here or on the image below to watch the full interview.

America is Better Off



As we approach the end of the 115th Congress, it is a good time to reflect on the many positive things we have accomplished so far. Last December, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act became law, helping American families keep more of their hard-earned paychecks. Congress has also invested over $10 billion to address the opioid epidemic that has devastated our communities. Legislation has also been passed to help make our country safer and our communities stronger, including giving our troops their biggest pay raise since 2010. Click here or on the image below to learn more about why Americans are better off now.

What I Have Been Reading



3 US service members killed in Afghanistan roadside bomb blast; deadliest incident this year

Fox News 

Please join me in praying for the family and loved ones of the three American servicemen killed in Afghanistan earlier this week. Their service and sacrifice to this great country will never be forgotten. Every day I am thankful for the brave men and women of the U.S. military who put their lives on the line to defend our freedoms. 


Shelby to create Fallen Heroes Memorial, park

Shelby Star 

Our heroes deserve to be remembered for their service to their communities and to our country. Downtown Shelby is creating a Fallen Warriors Memorial that will honor local heroes like Shelby Police Officer Tim Brackeen who was killed in the line of duty two years ago. You can watch my tribute to Officer Brackeen that I delivered on the House Floor by clicking here.  


New nonprofit devoted to serving veterans

Lincoln Times-News 

Our nation's veterans have already done so much in their service to our country and yet many continue to serve their communities after their time in the military has ended. Local veterans Chris Duschel and Larry Cline are continuing to serve with their new nonprofit, the Veterans and Community Alliance, that helps repair vehicles for veterans and their families at little to no cost. I am thankful for the service of these two heroes first in our armed forces and now in the Tenth District community.

Promises Kept 
 
 
On Friday, President Trump signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement at the G20 Summit. The USMCA signing is another step toward a trilateral agreement that will open new export markets and provide much needed certainty to American businesses, farmers, and workers. I will continue to work with the Administration and my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee to pursue trade deals that include South Carolina's priorities and strengthen our economy.

The Care They Deserve
 
 
Ensuring our veterans receive the care they deserve is one of my top priorities in Congress. Horry County has the second largest veteran population in South Carolina, so learning that the Horry VA is taking steps to improve their services is great news! They just implemented electronic claim filing and a more efficient appointment system. My office is dedicated to helping veterans in the Seventh District with any problems they may be having with the VA. If you are a veteran and need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to one of my offices!

Recognizing National Bible Week
Last week, America celebrated the 77th annual National Bible Week. God’s word means everything to me. It has shaped the way that I live my life, and has helped me serve the people of the 36th Congressional District of Texas through two terms. Each year on the week of Thanksgiving we give thanks for the many blessings God has bestowed on each of our lives, but none shine more brightly than the book that has continued to weather the test of time and lead Christians for centuries. I feel privileged I could speak on the House floor on Wednesday about how much the Bible means to me.

Congratulating NASA on Mars InSight Landing
Congratulations to the NASA Mars InSight Team for successfully completing the incredible challenge of landing on Mars! After traveling 300 million miles over the past six and a half months, this NASA robotic lander (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, or “InSight”) will explore Mars’ crust, mantle and core. This is a giant step forward in our preparations to reach the goal of eventually landing humans on the Red Planet. Outstanding job!

Illegal Immigrants, Not Asylum Seekers
Economic migrants from Central America are abusing U.S. humanitarian laws, including our asylum policy. Many migrants are passing through safe areas of Mexico – where they have been offered asylum – to the U.S., where they can achieve their true goal of earning up to 12 times more than in Central America. We need constructive debate in Congress on how we can improve our humanitarian and immigration laws to truly aid those we can while keeping the interests of American citizens paramount.

“[w]hile they are often referred to as asylum-seekers, few of the migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador — the chief sending countries — are likely to end up winning asylum in the U.S., according to the study… Adults are most likely to come for better jobs, the researchers said. They can improve their incomes by 1,200 percent in moving from Central America to the U.S… [f]ew people who leave their home country … will move to Mexico because the average wage increase is only 10 percent.”

Photos of the Week
I was happy to show Judge Jacques and Leeza Blanchette (pictured below on left) as well as Judge Monte and Betty Lawlis (pictured below on right) around the U.S. Capitol this week. Judge Blanchette is the current county judge for Tyler County, which is my home county, and Judge Lawlis served as Tyler County's state district judge for many years. These good men serve their communities well, and it was a pleasure to visit with them and their wives while they were in town. 
￼
The Kent Family (pictured below on left) and Dow Family (pictured below on right) from Houston were also in town this week. It is always great meeting folks from home, and I am glad my staff were able to secure several tours for them while they were in Washington.

Friends,
In 1992, President George H.W. Bush came to Lake County fairgrounds on a campaign trip. As he was waiting in line to get his breakfast I asked if he would hold our son for a picture. He said ""sure"" and put down his plate and took our son in his arms. As Kelly was capturing the perfect picture, President Bush gently kissed Trenton on the forehead. A couple years later I had the pleasure of running into him again at a then Governor Voinovich birthday party. I asked if he could sign the photo. He said ""sure"" again. As he looked at the photo he laughed and recalled that I had used the photo in an ad for our campaign. 
No one had been better trained to be President. He had been a decorated Navy pilot, businessman, Congressman, Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, United States Envoy to China, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and Vice President, under Ronald Reagan. Most importantly, he was always himself. History will be kind to this respected elder statesman. 
￼
Last Saturday was Small Business Saturday - a day dedicated to supporting small businesses and all they do for our communities. I encourage all Buckeyes to continue to support our economy in Northeast Ohio by shopping locally this holiday season. 
￼
Since being elected to Congress, small business job creation and economic growth have been top priorities of mine. Small businesses employ millions of Ohioans and are a very important part of our workforce. I am always glad to visit small businesses in Northeast Ohio to chat with owners and workers about their goals, ideas and concerns and also about how we can continue economic growth in Ohio.
Small Business Success in Northeast Ohio
I recently toured Godfrey & Wing in Aurora, an industry leader for automotive, aerospace and industrial manufacturing in Northeast Ohio. Congress' pro-growth agenda helped Godfrey & Wing have the ability to purchase new equipment and renovate their offices. 
￼
Another local business which is a fast growing startup in our district is Chagrin Valley Soap & Salve in Solon. I always enjoy visiting this family owned business to see the production of USDA certified organic skin and hair care products. What started as one woman's hobby turned into a company that now ships products to every state in the U.S. and over 80 countries worldwide. It's wonderful to see this local company thriving. 
￼
Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to tour Ohio Industrial Sales in Twinsburg. Thanks to Congress' commitment to small businesses, Ohio Industrial Sales was able to give their employees holiday bonuses for the first time in their company's history. The company was overjoyed that they were able to reward their hardworking employees with well deserved bonuses. 
￼
I wholeheartedly believe America's small businesses and startups are the engines of job creation. I am pleased to share that two bipartisan, bicameral bills were recently signed into law which help startups succeed across America. After hearing from local small business advocacy groups and entrepreneurs, I joined my colleagues in supporting the Small Business 7(a) Lending Oversight Reform Act. This bipartisan measure ensures appropriate oversight of the Small Business Administration's (SBA) flagship loan program and improves access to capital for small business owners. In addition, the Small Business Investment Opportunity Act allows privately owned and management investment funds to invest in small businesses. Together, these measures ensure that small businesses and startups can secure affordable financing. 
We all know that government regulations and red tape can sometimes hinder small business growth, which is why I supported the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018, known as ""JOBS Act 3.0."" By a near unanimous vote of 406-4, my colleagues and I passed this common sense legislation to cut down on regulations that are holding back small businesses. This measure will help sustain 3% economic growth and ensure our hardworking small business owners in Northeast Ohio can compete in the global marketplace. 
￼
According to a recent National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Monthly Optimism Index, small business sentiment has reached incredible heights. The study conducted in August set a new record in the survey's 45-year history. I am proud of the pro-growth policies my colleagues and I have implemented to create this level of optimism. I will continue to work with local stakeholders, my friends across the aisle and SBA Administrator Linda McMahon to promote small business priorities in the 116th Congress. 
Dave

Defending our Border
 
 
This week, we saw members of the migrant caravan rush our border, assault our Border Patrol agents, and attempt to illegally enter our country by breaking through the existing barricades. This behavior was completely predictable as the caravan has already violently entered other countries .   There are 8,500 members in the moving caravan and we have confirmed there are at least 600 convicted criminals traveling among the group. These criminals have been identified by law enforcement and have a know history of assault, battery, drug crimes, burglary, rape, child abuse and more.   I believe our President made the right decision by deploying troops to the southern border. The United States will not apologize for defending our borders against those who are assaulting our law enforcement agents, and also those who wish to circumvent our laws to enter the country illegally. I applaud our brave men and women currently at the border working to ensure we keep Americans safe and uphold our rule of law.   In Congress, I have supported multiple bills that work to secure our borders. As the Vice Chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations, I have supported $5 billion in funding for the border wall. Additionally, I have supported legislation that eliminates the visa lottery, revises our annual immigration levels, mandates e-verify, ends catch and release, and closes the loopholes hurting our immigration system.   Border security is national security, and we must set politics aside when discussing the safety and security of our country. Secure the border, enforce the law.  
￼
  Mars Landing  It was a big week for NASA as they successfully landed the InSight Lander on the surface of Mars. InSight will remain stationary during the planned two-year mission and will collect data by capturing photos, allowing us to learn about the inside of Mars for the very first time.   President Trump's Administration has renewed its support for American space exploration and development and we are seeing major accomplishments from the hardworking men and women at NASA. As the former Chairman of the Space Subcommittee for five years, I understand the importance of America leading the rest of the world in space exploration.   National Cotton Council  This week, I had a productive meeting with members of the National Cotton Council. In our meeting, we covered many topics including the Farm Bill as well as supplemental assistance in response to the recent disasters that have made significant impacts on the cotton industry.

Keeping in Touch with You
I could not be an effective representative without hearing directly from Pennsylvanians about the issues that matter most to them and their families. As part of my longstanding effort to do just that, more than 7,500 constituents joined me for my 56th telephone town hall this week. During the town hall I answered questions from callers about everything from commonsense gun safety legislation to the administration's steel and aluminum tariffs.
I've done nearly 80 town halls across Pennsylvania since being elected to the Senate - in person, on social media, and over the phone. Telephone town halls are an especially helpful way to keep in touch with constituents when I am in Washington.
I appreciate every opportunity I get to hear directly from you, answer questions, and share my perspective on some of the most important issues of the day. I look forward to hosting more forums like this in the future. You can also follow me on Facebook and Twitter where I provide advanced notice of upcoming town hall events.

Remembering Air Force Staff Sergeant Dylan Elchin
It is with heavy hearts we learned this week that Air Force Staff Sergeant Dylan Elchin of Hookstown, Beaver County was killed while serving our country in Afghanistan. He was a Special Tactics combat controller with the 26th Special Tactics Squadron, and was deployed in support of Operation Freedom's Sentinel.
Those who served alongside Dylan recall his leadership in combat and dedication to the mission. He was a decorated airman having received the Bronze Star and Purple Heart, and was a Distinguished Graduate of Airman Leadership School. Simply put, Dylan is a Pennsylvania hero. Kris and I mourn his loss, and are praying for his family in this difficult time. His sacrifice will not be forgotten.
You can see a full list of Dylan's awards and decorations, and read more about him, here.

Protecting PA Jobs from the Administration's Misguided Protectionism
Over the past two years, congressional Republicans and the Trump administration have placed an emphasis on growing our economy - and the results speak for themselves. The historic tax reform and elimination of numerous burdensome regulations are encouraging businesses to invest and expand. We have an overwhelming demand for workers to fill open jobs, and wages are on the upswing. This is the strongest our economy has been in decades.
Unfortunately, I am worried that current trade policies being pursued by the administration could stunt the progress our economy is making, which is why I am doing all I can to reassert Congress's constitutional role on trade. Over the past week, I continued to help employers and workers burdened by the administration's tariffs on imported aluminum and steel, and goods from China. In the case of steel and aluminum imports, the Department of Commerce has a sizable backlog of tariff exclusion applications from businesses that maintain they cannot obtain essential products from domestic sources. Applying businesses deserve a swift answer on their application. In order to get to the root cause of these delays, I have joined with two of my Democratic colleagues, Senators Doug Jones of Alabama and Tom Carper of Delaware, to ask the government's auditor's to review Commerce's operations on this matter.
President Trump has also established three different sets of tariffs on Chinese goods. For the first two sets of tariffs, the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) developed a process for qualified importers to get tariff exemptions. Currently, there is no exclusion process for this third set of tariffs. This is unfair to companies that cannot obtain essential goods domestically. As such, I authored a letter requesting the USTR to develop an additional exclusion process. I was pleased that more than 30 other senators, from both sides of the aisle, co-signed my letter.
Finally, for the past few months, I have noted my concerns with the President's United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is meant to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). For free traders like me, the USMCA is a mixed bag of trade-enhancing and trade-restricting changes to NAFTA. Unfortunately, the benefits of these enhancements are more than offset by the trade-limiting provisions. I have implored President Trump to work to incorporate free trade ideas into the USMCA's implementing legislation and then work with congressional Republicans to pass it before the end of this year.
Allowing the USMCA to fall into next year puts its implementation into the hands of a Democrat-controlled House of Representatives. This will result in either a decidedly more protectionist USMCA or it could be stalled entirely. You can read more about my thoughts on this topic in a column I wrote for the Wall Street Journal here.

￼
Reevaluating Our Relationship with Saudi Arabia
As a great nation, we are challenged to maintain both our security and our values. Sometimes, our national security interests require us to work with regimes, like that of Saudi Arabia, that do not share our values and our views on human rights. This does not mean we can ignore atrocities committed by the governments of our allies.
This week's procedural vote to discharge the Yemen War Powers Resolution from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will rightfully prompt further conversation on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and our relationship with Saudi Arabia. However, it also affords the Senate an opportunity to have a broader debate concerning the appropriate balance between our values and maintaining our national security-based relationships.

￼
￼
Standing Up Against Russian Aggression
Vladimir Putin is a lawless autocrat who has no respect for the rights of his own people, let alone international laws and standards. On Sunday, Russian naval vessels unlawfully attacked three Ukrainian ships near the Kerch Strait in the Sea of Azov. During the confrontation, one Ukrainian ship was damaged, two were captured, and numerous Ukrainian sailors were injured.  
I joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues this week to condemn this violation of Ukraine's sovereignty, and backed a measure demanding the release of all Ukrainian sailors taken prisoner by Russia.
As a member of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, I have long condemned Russian aggression and supported Ukrainian sovereignty dating back to the Russian Aggression Prevention Act of 2014, which was introduced shortly after Russia illegally invaded Crimea. Since then, I've backed efforts to provide arms to Ukraine while supporting sanctions against Russia.
This week's blatant actions in the Kerch Strait are unacceptable and I stand ready to work with my colleagues and the president to assist our Ukrainian allies and punish Russian aggression.

December 2, 2018
Dear Friend,  
Last week was extremely busy as we continued our efforts to address all of the pressing legislative matters that require attention before the end of the year.  Chief among those priorities for our district is ensuring the continued availability of affordable flood insurance.  The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was set to expire at the end of November.  We passed an emergency measure to extend it for one more week, and the Senate also passed a bill to extend it until May of 2019. Many of my constituents rely on this program. The availability of flood insurance is critical to our local economy and the stability of our housing market. In 2017, the House passed a bill to reform and reauthorize this vital program for a full five years. Unfortunately, the Senate has not passed a long-term bill, forcing Congress to pass a series of short term extensions, which is simply unacceptable. I urge my Senate colleagues to prioritize this important issue and expedite passage of legislation to reauthorize the program for the next five years.  The extension until next week aligns this program with the upcoming deadline for passing funding for continued operation of the federal government.  I will continue to work on resolving both of these important issues over the next few days.   
Sadly, our nation lost a true public servant and the Bilirakis family lost a long-time friend this weekend. All those who were privileged to know him, understood that George H.W. Bush was a man of unwavering love of country and unapologetic commitment to his family. His impressive career includes decorated service in WWII, leadership in the intelligence community, and a steady hand as Commander in Chief during tumultuous political and economic times which culminated in the end of the Cold War and led to the first Persian Gulf War. Later in life, he worked tirelessly in a bipartisan fashion to raise money for domestic and international humanitarian aid. My thoughts and prayers are with his family as they celebrate his legacy of service, patriotism and generosity. May his memory be eternal!
￼ 
Continue reading for a brief recap of my efforts on your behalf last week! 
Advocating for Our Nation’s Heroes 
There has been a great deal of attention paid to the problems the VA is having with delayed GI bill payments to Veterans.  As I mentioned in last week’s newsletter, we have held oversight hearings, and are working to hold the VA accountable for this unacceptable situation while ensuring that every Veteran receives the benefits to which he/she is entitled.  Despite news reports that the VA would not be retroactively repaying Veterans, Secretary Wilkie issued a statement last week confirming that all Veterans will be fully compensated. Please be assured that I will continue to monitor this situation into it is resolved.   
￼ 
Facilitating Continued Economic Success 
New reports show that U.S. consumer spending and personal incomes continued to rise last month, which is yet another indication that our economy is headed in the right direction.  It is more important than ever that we continue to reduce the tax burden on the middle class and on small businesses, so that our economy continues to work for everyone!
Part of ensuring continued economic success is investing in critical infrastructure needed to sustain economic prosperity.  Florida has been ranked as the best state for broadband deployment by a newly released RStreet report. This shows how our state will lead the development of next generation Internet services which will bring additional jobs, revenue, and amenities to our area. As a member of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee, I have worked to increase broadband availability and affordability and am proud of our state’s leadership of America’s technological future.
￼ 
Promoting Good Public Health Policy 
Last week, I was happy to vote for final passage of the Action for Dental Health Act of 2018, which I co-sponsored. This important bill improves oral health education and dental disease prevention while reducing the use of the emergency room to treat dental pain. Oral health is a vital component of overall wellness. This bill, which is now headed to the President’s desk to become law, is a step in the right direction.
￼  
Last week, I was also proud to vote in favor of HR 6753, the Strengthening Healthcare Fraud Prevention Task Force, which passed the House. Earlier this year, a related measure I authored became law. My provision enhanced the civil and criminal penalties for Medicare and Medicaid fraud. With all stakeholders working together to reduce fraud, we can help ensure the long-term sustainability of these critical programs.
 ￼ 
Additionally, each November we recognize Diabetes Awareness month.  In addition to negatively impacting the personal health of the more than 100 million Americans who suffer with Diabetes, it is a condition that significantly increases overall costs to the healthcare system.  Prevention, education and proper management are essential in reversing this troubling public health concern.  Visit  www.diabetes.org to learn more.

Hi, 
In 2016 and 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services estimated that more than 130 Americans died each day from an opioid-related drug overdose. Today, opioid overdoses are the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. 
The fight against the opioid epidemic has received strong bipartisan support in Washington. In 2016, Congress passed and President Obama signed into law the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) and 21st Century Cures Act, both of which helped provide states with resources to expand opioid abuse and treatment efforts. In fact, since the 21st Century Cures Act became law, Colorado has received over $15 million in grant money to help meet the needs of our impacted communities. 
After CARA and the 21st Century Cures Act were signed into law, I continued to travel across Colorado’s Third District to meet with the healthcare officials, law enforcement officers and first responders who are on the front lines of this fight and listen to their feedback. During these meetings it became apparent that while both bills were certainly a step in the right direction, there was more work to be done.
The opioid crisis is a multifaceted issue, and no one approach will bring it to an end. We must advance policies that facilitate prevention education and effective treatment, ensure law enforcement has the tools it needs to respond to bad actors trying to bring dangerous opioids across U.S. borders, and support health care professionals in their work to decrease prescribed addiction. During the 115th Congress, we worked together to introduce a series of proposals to address opioid abuse from every angle.  
This past month, Congress passed, and President Trump signed into law a sweeping bipartisan package that includes more than 70 of the proposals that we introduced this Congress. The proposals included in the law, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, range from arming first responders with the overdose-reversing drug naloxone and providing law enforcement with more tools to help intercept deadly synthetic opioids at the border, to expanding Medicare coverage of substance abuse disorder treatments and services. 
Included in this groundbreaking package was a proposal that I helped introduce called the Alternatives to Opioids (ALTO) in the Emergency Department Act, which specifically addresses the complex issue of prescribed addiction. While there are many different reasons why an individual may become addicted to opioids, all too often, addiction begins with an injury and a prescription to treat the pain. The ALTO Act will help remedy this issue by providing hospitals across the country with the resources to promote non-opioid pain treatments in emergency rooms. 
The ALTO Act is based on a successful pilot program that was started by the Colorado Hospital Association and took place in 10 hospital emergency departments across our state. The program was so effective that the 10 participating sites were able to reduce the distribution of prescribed opioids by 36 percent over a six-month period. Now that this program will be replicated in hospital emergency departments across the nation, the impact will be profound.
I am proud of the work that has been accomplished thus far to confront opioid addiction. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act is a big step and I have no doubt that this package of bills will help save countless lives. However, the opioid crisis cannot be solved overnight, and the work is still far from done. In the 116th Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike must continue to listen to the impacted families, healthcare providers and law enforcement officials back home and work together to address this national crisis.  
I plan to continue these conversations back in Colorado’s Third District and I encourage you to share any ideas, background or knowledge that you may have on this issue with us by calling my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-4761 or writing to me at www.tipton.house.gov.

MEET LARRY     CONTACT     SERVING YOU     MEDIA     LEGISLATION     INDIANA'S 8TH 
Fellow Hoosier,
Thanks for tuning into this month’s edition of the Bucshon Bulletin. Continue reading to learn about the work I’m doing in Congress to address the issues that matter to Hoosiers, such as legislation I’ve supported to combat the opioid crisis and improve our national water infrastructure. 
Supporting Our Troops Abroad
Last week I had the opportunity to travel to Afghanistan as part of a bipartisan Congressional delegation to meet Afghan government officials and American troops stationed there. 
One of the most important duties of Congress is to ensure our troops around the world have the necessary tools and resources they need to get the job done. It’s one thing to attend briefings and classified updates in Washington on our operations and efforts to ensure peace around the world, but it is quite another to see it first-hand and hear from commanders and troops on the ground.
During my trip to Afghanistan, I saw the direct result of our increased funding for troops and supplies. It has had a positive impact. From the commanders of the NATO-led Resolute Support mission, down the chain of command, our men and women in uniform are the best trained fighting force in the world and I am honored to have met with them and been reassured that they have the personnel, training and equipment necessary to accomplish their mission. While the threat of terrorism remains constant, so will our efforts to defend against it. 

￼
Fighting the Opioid Epidemic
President Trump signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6) on October 24. This important legislation included my bill, the Opioid Screening and Chronic Pain Management Alternatives for Seniors Act in Section 2002 of the bill.
The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act will help our struggling communities to combat the opioid crisis by focusing on improving care for those who have opioid use disorder, and preventing opioid misuse and addiction. This comprehensive legislation, negotiated and agreed upon by both chambers in a bipartisan manner, will help states like Indiana combat the growing opioid epidemic. It will give hope to families and it will save lives.
As a physician, I believe it is vital to support initiatives that will help to prevent seniors from misusing or becoming addicted to opioids while managing their chronic pain. One of the ways to address the opioid crisis is to prevent Americans from becoming addicted in the first place. By screening seniors as they enter the Medicare system, we can use this milestone as an opportunity to address their concerns and manage their chronic pain while reducing risks associated with opioid use. As opioid use disorder continues to increase among older Americans, our seniors need to understand the risks of opioid use and discuss with their physicians the best course of treatment. 

￼
Improving Hoosier Waterways
President Trump signed the America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (S.3021) on October 23, 2018. This important legislation included my bill, Promoting Hydropower Development at Existing Nonpowered Dams Act in Section 3003 of the bill. 
Our water infrastructure is vital to the economic success and prosperity of our nation. This is especially true for Southwest Indiana which is bordered by two major rivers, the Wabash and Ohio Rivers. The America’s Water Infrastructure Act makes important investments that will set in motion improvements to our ports, inland waterways, locks, dams, flood protection, and other critical water infrastructure.
The Promoting Hydropower Development at Existing Nonpowered Dams Act cuts through the red tape and instructs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to create an expedited permitting process that will result in a final decision on an application in two years or less. Hydropower provides benefits in the form of jobs, economic investment, improved public health, and resource conservation. It’s also a great source of American-made energy. In the Eighth Congressional district alone, there are six non-powered dams that could be modernized to produce clean energy.

Improving Hoosier Infrastructure
On November 28, 2018, we took a step forward in breathing new life into the historic Harmony Way Bridge.  I was proud to support my bill, the Restore Harmony Way Bridge Act (H.R. 6793), when it passed through the House of Representatives by unanimous consent. This legislation would convey the Harmony Way Bridge to the New Harmony Bridge Bi-State Commission established by Indiana and Illinois - allowing the states to have management over the Harmony Way Bridge and write the next chapter for this historic bridge.
The Harmony Way Bridge was an engineering marvel that was built in 1930.  After decades of use, the bridge was closed in 2012 due to structural concerns.  Communities on both sides of the Wabash River in Indiana and Illinois want to see this historic community landmark preserved.  Unfortunately, the federal law that led to the bridge’s construction has also prevented it from being refurbished and reopened by the states of Indiana and Illinois.    More Photos from Afghanistan

ON TRACK

Great news! We have secured the federal funding necessary to keep the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP) on track in 2019. 

Last week, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released funding which includes $52.12 million in additional funds for SHEP. This funding, combined with President Trump's original budget request of $49 million, brings the total fiscal year 2019 federal funding for SHEP to more than $100 million. This will keep the critical economic development project on track. 

With this commitment, we are one step closer to realizing the full economic impact expanding our harbor will have on the nation and the world. 

I will continue fighting for this federal support to keep the project moving forward and on time until it becomes a reality. 

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CLXXXIX

Monday, November 26, 2018:  Today is academy day!  Each year a group of volunteers from the First District perform the task of interviewing candidates on my behalf for the service academies and make recommendations for placement.  This stellar group of volunteers is, by design, made up of individuals with and without military experience.  As we gather this morning at the National Museum of the Mighty Eighth Air Force in Pooler, I have the opportunity to welcome the students and family members and introduce them to our volunteer academy board before the interview process begins.  Next, I head to our Savannah office where I meet with a constituent regarding insurance coverage of medical formula. 
￼
Rep. Carter visiting the Savannah Center for Blind and Low Vision
Many parents of children with rare genetic diseases are faced with high medical costs and depend on insurance to help defray these costs.  Afterwards, I meet with a constituent who tragically lost her daughter a few years ago as a result of domestic violence and we discuss possible legislation that could strengthen our laws in this area.  Next, I head to the Savannah Center for Blind and Low Vision (SavannahCBLV) to learn more of the fine services this agency is providing to promote independence and dignity for people who are vision impaired or blind.  Serving counties in Southeast Georgia and Southern South Carolina, their services are offered in the home or in the center in Savannah.  After a great visit and tour of their facilities I head back to our Savannah office where I meet with my good friend, Dr. Jack Considine, to discuss an array of issues mainly focusing on health care.

Tuesday, November 27, 2018:  I’m up at 4:30 a.m. this morning and at the airport at 6:10 a.m. for a 7:10 a.m. direct flight to Washington.  Bleary eyed, I anxiously await to board my flight when I am informed that the flight has been delayed until 8:40 a.m.  After notifying my staff that I have been delayed and will not be able to deliver the keynote address to a national health care group having their annual meeting in Washington this morning, I am informed that the flight has now been delayed until 11:30 a.m.  Once again I contact my staff and they are able to book me on a different flight that gets me into Washington at 1:30 p.m.  Not only do I end up missing the keynote address but I also miss three other meetings that I had scheduled today.  Oh, the joys of relying on air carriers!  Once I’m finally at the Capitol, I meet with my Chief of Staff who, due to my absence, was earlier today tasked with picking our number for office assignment for the next session.  Fortunately (at least for him) he chose a good number and we will be relocating to an office closer to the House Chamber and near our committee meeting rooms. 
￼
Rep. Carter at the Fall Awards Banquet of the National Aeronautic Association
Next, I head to an Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee member briefing on maternal mortality presented by the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).  The briefing is a synopsis of a 3-day summit that was held over the summer that brought together experts from around the U.S. and the world to discuss strategies in reducing maternal mortality.  Later, I attend a Whip Team meeting where we hear from Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen who updates us on the situation at the southwest border.  After our first vote series of the day, I head downtown where I attend the Fall Awards Banquet of the National Aeronautic Association and share in the excitement of witnessing my good friend, Mark Burns, President of Gulfstream Aerospace in Savannah, receiving the Wesley L. McDonald Distinguished Statesman of Aviation Award. 
￼
Rep. Carter and Mark Burns, President of Gulfstream Aerospace, at the Fall Awards Banquet of the National Aeronautic Association
This award honors Americans who have made significant contributions to aeronautics over an extended period of time as Mark has during his 35 year career with Gulfstream.

Wednesday, November 28, 2018:  This morning starts with our weekly GOP Conference and there is a lot to discuss this morning as we finish out the 115th Congress and continue to prepare for the 116th Congress.  Afterwards, I head back to my office where I film a video welcome to the Georgia Transit Association Meeting being held in Jekyll Island next weekend.  Afterwards, we have our weekly staff briefing where we have lots to discuss with the upcoming office move and trying to tie up loose ends legislatively during the lame duck session. 
￼
Rep. Carter meeting with the Georgia Farm Bureau Federation
Later, I meet with CIOX to discuss health information management services and Health and Human Services (HHS) electronic health record requirements.  Next, I meet with the American Consumers & Workers Justice Coalition (ACWJC) to discuss flooring products and the impact of tariffs on their business.  After meeting with members of the Georgia Farm Bureau Federation to learn more about the immense devastation the agriculture community experienced from Hurricane Michael and how we can help them with disaster relief, I meet with the Alliance for Patient Access, a non-profit that advocates for patient access to approved therapies and treatments. 
￼
Rep. Carter meeting with the Alliance for Patient Access
My last two meetings of the day are with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the Integrative Health Policy Consortium.

Thursday, November 29, 2018:  One of the joys of serving in Washington is making good friends and this morning I have the pleasure of meeting with one of my good friends, Tom Madson.  Tom has represented Gulfstream Aerospace in Washington for the past 20 years and before that served our country in the Air Force for 26 years. 
￼
Rep. Carter speaking at The Hill's New Member Reception
Tom will be retiring tomorrow from Gulfstream and I have the opportunity this morning to wish him well in this new chapter of his life.  Afterwards, I attend a Doctor’s Caucus meeting with the American Society of Clinical Oncologists before heading to a Steering Committee meeting where I am serving as a proxy for my Georgia colleague, Rep. Tom Graves (R-GA).  In the Republican Conference we have a steering committee that decides appointments and leadership positions on committees.  Tom is the Georgia/South Carolina representative on the Steering Committee but because he is applying for an appointment, he has asked me to be his proxy during his presentation.  This is my first experience on this committee and I find it to be fascinating.  Later, I head to my office where I meet with representatives from the West African country of Liberia and end my day at The Hill’s New Member reception downtown where I share with incoming members of the 116th Congress some of my experiences when I started four years ago.

Friday, November 30, 2018:  I’m at the White House this morning as I assist my Deputy Chief of Staff, Mary Carpenter, and her mother as well as Hunter Odom from Richmond Hill gain access for a tour.  Once back at the Capitol, I head to the 116th Organizing Conference of the GOP to ratify the recommendations of the Steering Committee.  Our first and only vote series of the day is afterwards and then I head to the airport for my return flight home.

Helping Vermonters Keep Warm

￼

As the weather gets colder and heating costs go up, some Vermonters will have a hard time keeping warm this winter. If you or someone you know is struggling to pay to heat their home, help may be available. Honestly, it is unconscionable that in the wealthiest country on earth, some Vermonters – including seniors and families with young children – have to choose between keeping their homes warm or putting food on the table. That’s why I am fighting in Washington to increase funding for the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) rather than cut it like the president and his friends in Congress have proposed.

Our Dairy Farmers Deserve a Fair Price

￼

Vermont’s dairy farmers are struggling to survive. The price they get for their milk has been below the cost of production for four years in a row. Our state has lost one-third of its dairy farms in the last decade, and more than 65 this year alone. And, as farms disappear, so do the businesses and jobs they support. That’s why I have introduced legislation to provide emergency relief to our dairy farmers, and have urged the U.S. Department of Agriculture to increase its purchases of excess milk products. However, farmers need a long-term solution, and to my mind that has got to include managing the supply of milk. In recent weeks, my office has held listening sessions with dairy farmers in Addison and Franklin Counties to hear their ideas to ensure fair prices.

Fighting for Net Neutrality

I’m proud Vermont has taken steps to restore net neutrality after President Trump’s FCC chair, Ajit Pai, began dismantling important federal net neutrality rules on behalf of huge corporations like Verizon, Comcast and AT&T. Net neutrality simply means that Internet Service Providers cannot discriminate by halting, slowing, or otherwise tampering with the transfer of data and content. With the repeal of net neutrality, Internet Service Providers can divide the web into slow and fast lanes and restrict or charge more for certain content. Vermont has put in place measures to stop companies from auctioning off the internet to the highest corporate bidder. It is no wonder that these companies’ front groups are now suing the state. Now more than ever before, we need a free and open internet.

State of the Union Essay Contest

￼

I am pleased to announce my ninth annual State of the Union essay contest, which gives Vermont’s high school students an opportunity to describe what they think are the major issues facing our country, and what they would do to solve those challenges. I always look forward to seeing what students chose to write about, and then joining the twenty finalists for a lively roundtable discussion at the Vermont Statehouse. I even submit the essays of the twenty finalists to the Congressional Record, the official archive of Congress. The deadline to submit an essay is January 9, 2019. I hope you consider writing one!

An Alarming Increase in Hate Crimes

We should all be very alarmed about the significant increase in hate crimes here in Vermont and throughout our country. It goes without saying that no one in America should fear for their safety because of their religious beliefs, race, immigration status, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability. Americans can disagree politically, but we should never resort to hate speech, much less violence. We must do everything possible to overcome the growing divisiveness and corrosion of political discourse in this country. It is destructive to our democracy.

Fighting for Vermont’s Working Families 

￼ 

I recently visited Northern Counties Health Care’s Orleans Dental Center, the Head Start in Hardwick, the Lamoille Family Center in Morristown, and the Community Health Services of Lamoille Valley in Morrisville. Each of these facilities provide absolutely critical services in their community and without them, too many Vermonters – especially our young people – could fall through the cracks. These organizations were very clear about what their communities need: quality, affordable housing, child care and health care. To my mind, every Vermonter – and every person in this country – should be able to access these basic human needs.

We Must Protect T-Band Spectrum Use 
for First Responders
Dear Friend:  
There is an issue of critical importance to the New York area that has flown under the radar for some time--the preservation of a life-saving first responder radio spectrum known as the T-Band.   For decades, the T-Band radio spectrum has supported vital public safety radio communications among our first responders. It allows police, firefighters and EMS to communicate even when cell towers, electricity, or the internet are down. It even functions deep underground in tunnels and inside concrete buildings. 
But now, thanks to an outdated provision in the law, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is required to reallocate and auction the T-Band spectrum for use by the private sector by 2021. This would endanger crucial public safety communications here in the Bronx and Westchester, as well as in major metropolitan areas across the United States.  It would also force police, firefighters, and EMS to spend millions to buy new radios and cause first responders to rely on untested systems.
I wrote a bill, the “Don’t Break Up the T-Band Act,” to allow law-enforcement, fire officials, and EMS to continue using the T-Band spectrum to operate their radios for day-to-day life saving operations.   My legislation has bipartisan support in the House, and is backed by law-enforcement and fire department officials from New York. It is my hope that with the start of the new Congress we will be able to move this critical bill forward and allow our first-responders to continue using the T-Band spectrum to communicate effectively when keeping us safe.
Sincerely, ￼ Eliot L. Engel MEMBER OF CONGRESS

Dear friend,  Last night we learned that President George H.W. Bush passed away at the age of 94. As a member of the U.S. Air Force, I was proud to serve in the war of my generation under President George H.W. Bush. He was a thoughtful, kind and patriotic Commander in Chief. He put service before self and inspired many. He will be dearly missed.  Delivering on my promise to secure our water: Earlier this week I met with Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Rickey ""R.D."" James, along with Reps. David Valadao (CA-21), Jim Costa (CA-16) and John Garamendi (CA-03), to announce a $449 million grant for the Sites Reservoir Project to bring more water storage to the Central Valley. This is a major victory for the Valley and will help to finally get this water storage project underway.  Over the past few months, I’ve brought Secretary Perdue, Secretary Zinke and Assistant Secretary James, in addition to Environmental Protection Agency Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler, to the Central Valley and secured their support to fight for Central Valley water rights and improve our water storage. As a result, President Trump signed a presidential memorandum in October to address hydroelectric relicensing, like what is currently happening at Don Pedro, and require agencies to consider local plans, like the Tuolumne River Management Plan developed by Modesto and Turlock Irrigation Districts, to avoid catastrophic water grabs at the hands of Sacramento Bureaucrats.  Protecting our water and way of life has always been and continues to be my top priority. I will keep fighting for the Central Valley as the 115th Congress comes to a close.  Sincerely, 
￼  Jeff Denham Member of Congress

Congressman Smith's E-news: December 1, 2018 
￼ 
Modernizing NAFTA 
On Friday, President Trump, along with Mexican President Peña Nieto and Canadian Prime Minster Trudeau, signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) at the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The USMCA is the culmination of more than a year of negotiations between our three countries in order to update and build upon the success of NAFTA. I look forward to playing an active role in the review process as a member of the Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over trade agreements.    I have worked over the past two years to ensure the important benefits of a trilateral NAFTA agreement continue in the modernized version. I traveled to both Montreal and Mexico City to meet with my parliamentary counterparts and ensure the needs of Nebraska’s agricultural industry were being properly communicated. As I’ve said from the beginning when President Trump first talked of revising NAFTA, Canada and Mexico are Nebraska agriculture’s two best customers and any replacement should build on this success.   Much has changed in the nearly 25 years since NAFTA was signed and there are several areas in which improvements have been made. One example is Canada’s dairy market, which for too long has limited access to American dairy while unfairly shielding Canadian dairy producers from competition. Under the new agreement, Canada would eliminate both class six and seven dairy categories. The agreement also seeks to prevent non-NAFTA countries from abusing its privileges by importing through a third country to avoid tariffs. For example, in the auto industry, new rules of origin will require 75 percent or more of vehicle content be produced in North America.   Other areas which were badly in need of updating include intellectual property protections, guidelines for digital trade, and streamlined financial services language. In particular, the agreement enhances protections against the theft of trade secrets, which we all know is a major problem we face in dealing with other countries like China. It also seeks to mitigate disagreements with our neighbors over the storage and migration of data across borders having arisen with the advent of the digital age.  This is a complex agreement and, as I have said previously, I look forward to going through it in detail once formally submitted to the Congress. We should, however, recognize the significance of this achievement. Only a few months ago, we were concerned about maintaining any agreement at all, knowing a withdrawal from NAFTA would have dire consequences for all of North America.   Now is the time to address steel and aluminum tariffs levied against Canada and Mexico which have resulted in retaliation against our agricultural producers and other industries. USMCA should be seen as an important first step toward restoring and expanding market opportunities for our agricultural producers around the world. We must also capitalize on upcoming negotiations with Japan and work hard to resolve our trade dispute with China concerning its unfair trade practices.

Dear Friend, 
Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter. Here you can get the latest updates on the work I am doing on your behalf in Washington and at home in Ohio. I encourage you to stay connected with our office through my website, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter pages. It is an honor to represent you.

Ohio, New NAFTA, FSC Accomplishments
Congressman Warren Davidson was in Washington, D.C. this week as Congress was in Session. 
On Monday, Congressman Davidson toured Walls Brothers Asphalt and the May Financial Group and had lunch with Darke County Sheriff Toby Spencer. Later in the day he toured Person Centered Solutions. You can read about his visit to PSC here. 
On Tuesday, Congressman Davidson toured the Meijer Distribution center in Tipp City. 
On Wednesday morning, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Timbs v. Indiana, a case that could have huge ramifications for the way states and local governments use civil asset forfeiture to target the property of suspected criminals. Congressman Davidson said he's thankful the Supreme Court finally took a case that gives them an opportunity to put tight limits on abusive forfeiture practices. You can read his full opinion here.   
On Thursday, Congressman Davidson took to the House floor to talk about the accomplishments of the Financial Services Committee and the Jobs 3.0 bill. You can watch his remarks here.  
On Friday, President Trump and the leaders of Canada signed the New NAFTA deal. Congressman Davidson said this agreement is better than no deal, and better for America in many respects. He went on to say that failing to end high aluminum and steel tariffs between the United States, Canada, and Mexico is why he still considers this deal incomplete. Congress and the governments of Canada and Mexico still must approve The New NAFTA deal.

Davidson Introduces Bill to Allow Private Funds for Border Wall
On Friday, Congressman Davidson introduced the Buy a Brick, Build the Wall Act, legislation that would create an account at the U.S. Treasury dedicated to holding public donations for the completion of a wall along the U.S. southern border.
The Buy a Brick, Build the Wall Act allows money deposited in the Border Wall Trust Fund to be used for planning, designing, constructing and maintaining a barrier along the border between the United States and Mexico.

Why Michael Cohen’s Trump Tower Moscow revelation matters
By Alex Ward, Vox
￼
Michael Cohen’s guilty plea in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation on Thursday provided new details about why President Donald Trump pursued friendly ties with Russia during the 2016 campaign: He tried to secure a lucrative real estate deal in Moscow. 
A court document filed by Mueller states that Cohen — Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer — lied to Congress about plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. 
Cohen told Congress that negotiations to build the tower stopped in January 2016. But Cohen now admits those talks continued into at least June 2016, well into the presidential campaign and even after Trump became the GOP’s nominee. There were also plans to give the building’s $50 million penthouse to Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
All of this puts Trump’s praise of Putin during the campaign in a whole new — and disconcerting — light.

John Bolton is a coward
￼
By Paul Begala, CNN
""Let them eat cake."" -- Marie Antoinette ""Heck of a job, Brownie."" -- George W. Bush ""My belief is, we will in fact be greeted as liberators."" -- Dick Cheney  Migrant detention centers for children are ""more like a summer camp."" -- Matthew Albence, acting No. 2 official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
Add to the list of tragically callous and shockingly cruel statements from government officials this from National Security Adviser John Bolton, when asked Tuesday if he has listened to the audiotape of the murder of US permanent resident and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi: ""Unless you speak Arabic, what are you going to get from it?"" 
A lot. You will, presumably, hear struggle. You will hear beating, according to a Turkish newspaper, citing Turkish security sources. You will hear torture. You will hear an innocent man's final, desperate words: ""Release my arm! What do you think you are doing?"" You will hear one of the alleged conspirators, who allegedly put on Khashoggi's clothes to act as a body double, comment that ""it is spooky to wear the clothes of a man whom we killed 20 minutes ago.""

George H.W. Bush’s Oval Office note to me revealed the heart of who he was
By Bill Clinton, The Washington Post Opinion
On Jan. 20, 1993, I entered the Oval Office for the first time as president. As is the tradition, waiting for me was a note from my predecessor, George Herbert Walker Bush. It read: 
Dear Bill, 
When I walked into this office just now I felt the same sense of wonder and respect that I felt four years ago. I know you will feel that, too. 
I wish you great happiness here. I never felt the loneliness some Presidents have described. 
There will be very tough times, made even more difficult by criticism you may not think is fair. I’m not a very good one to give advice; but just don’t let the critics discourage you or push you off course. 
You will be our President when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well. 
Your success now is our country’s success. I am rooting hard for you. 
Good Luck — George 
No words of mine or others can better reveal the heart of who he was than those he wrote himself. He was an honorable, gracious and decent man who believed in the United States, our Constitution, our institutions and our shared future. And he believed in his duty to defend and strengthen them, in victory and defeat. He also had a natural humanity, always hoping with all his heart that others’ journeys would include some of the joy that his family, his service and his adventures gave him.

Congressman Al Green's Statement on the Passing of President George H.W. Bush    
(Houston, TX) - Congressman Al Green released the following statement regarding the passing of 41st U.S. President George H.W. Bush on Friday, November 30, 2018:    
""Shortly after being elected to Congress, I was pleasantly surprised when I received a statement indicating that former President George H.W. Bush desired to meet with me. After overcoming my sense of disbelief, I honored his request and had a private meeting with him in Houston, Texas. It was much longer than I expected and ended with him giving me some sage advice: because others will have an agenda for you, one of your most difficult challenges will be setting an agenda for yourself. Truer words were never spoken. 
""President George H.W. Bush, may you rest in peace knowing your legacy of service, dignity, and respectability are among the hallmarks of your presidency. The presidency didn’t define you. You defined your presidency. My condolences to his family and friends.""

Friend-  I hope you and your family had a restful and blessed Thanksgiving. I know that I enjoyed reflecting back on all I had to be thankful for from this past year.  Earlier this month, I spent several days traveling across the district celebrating Veterans Day and honoring the sacrifices of our nation's heroes. Over Thanksgiving week, I got to spend time with our soldiers on the ground in Afghanistan. I had the opportunity to thank these soldiers for their service and sacrifice in defense of our freedom. Our delegation, including several other members of Congress, met with senior military and diplomatic leaders in the region to receive updates on continued anti-terrorism efforts.  Back home, I had the chance to discuss some of my other priorities across the district such as expanding broadband access and promoting economic development.   Take a look at what I was up to throughout the month below. I hope your November was just as filled with thanksgiving as mine was.
￼

Right before Thanksgiving, I traveled to Afghanistan alongside Representatives Jim Banks, R-Indiana; Bill Flores, R-Texas; Conor Lamb, D-Pennsylvania; Larry Bucshon, R-Indiana; and Tom Suozzi, D-New York to meet with our service members. 

￼

We met with General Austin Miller, commander of US forces in Afghanistan, to receive a brief on the progress made in the fight against ISIS and our cooperation with Afghan forces

￼

Our delegation met with the Afghan President, Ashraf Ghani, to discuss continued anti-terrorism efforts in conjunction with the Afghan military. 

￼

Back home, I met with Occoquan District Supervisor Ruth Anderson to visit Old Bridge Road and discuss congestion solutions.

￼

I facilitated multiple Capitol tours for constituents this month. Did you know my office can help you set up a tour? 

￼
I held a Federal Employee Telephone Town Hall in conjunction with the Office of Personnel and Management to answer questions for federal employees about open enrollment and retiree issues.
￼

Stafford County Scout Troop 1410 stopped by my office to talk about leadership in public office and my work in representing the First District. . 

￼

I joined the Fredericksburg Area Veterans Council for their annual Veterans Day Ceremony to commemorate the service of our nation's heroes and share how the 115th Congress worked to support veterans.

Friend-  I hope you and your family had a restful and blessed Thanksgiving. I know that I enjoyed reflecting back on all I had to be thankful for from this past year.  Earlier this month, I spent several days traveling across the district celebrating Veterans Day and honoring the sacrifices of our nation's heroes. Over Thanksgiving week, I got to spend time with our soldiers on the ground in Afghanistan. I had the opportunity to thank these soldiers for their service and sacrifice in defense of our freedom. Our delegation, including several other members of Congress, met with senior military and diplomatic leaders in the region to receive updates on continued anti-terrorism efforts.  Back home, I had the chance to discuss some of my other priorities across the district such as expanding broadband access and promoting economic development.   Take a look at what I was up to throughout the month below. I hope your November was just as filled with thanksgiving as mine was.
￼

Right before Thanksgiving, I traveled to Afghanistan alongside Representatives Jim Banks, R-Indiana; Bill Flores, R-Texas; Conor Lamb, D-Pennsylvania; Larry Bucshon, R-Indiana; and Tom Suozzi, D-New York to meet with our service members. 

￼

We met with General Austin Miller, commander of US forces in Afghanistan, to receive a brief on the progress made in the fight against ISIS and our cooperation with Afghan forces

￼

Our delegation met with the Afghan President, Ashraf Ghani, to discuss continued anti-terrorism efforts in conjunction with the Afghan military. 

￼

Back home, I met with Occoquan District Supervisor Ruth Anderson to visit Old Bridge Road and discuss congestion solutions.

￼

I facilitated multiple Capitol tours for constituents this month. Did you know my office can help you set up a tour? 

￼
I held a Federal Employee Telephone Town Hall in conjunction with the Office of Personnel and Management to answer questions for federal employees about open enrollment and retiree issues.
￼

Stafford County Scout Troop 1410 stopped by my office to talk about leadership in public office and my work in representing the First District. . 

￼

I joined the Fredericksburg Area Veterans Council for their annual Veterans Day Ceremony to commemorate the service of our nation's heroes and share how the 115th Congress worked to support veterans. 

￼

I joined Governor Northam at Premier Tech for an important economic development announcement in the First District. Premier Tech will invest $1.89 million to expand its peat moss mixing and distribution facility in King and Queen County and create 20 jobs. 

￼

King George County Supervisor Ruby Brabo and I joined KGI Communications and Baicells to discuss a new broadband deployment here in the First District. 

￼

I visited Dar Al Noor Mosque in Manassas to discuss the status of religious liberty in our nation and the persecution of the Uyghurs, a Muslim minority ethnic group in China.

HAPPENING IN THE HOUSE This week, the House considered and passed an extension of the National Flood Insurance Program through December 7th. Congress created the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in 1968 to provide government insurance protection against flood risks for both homeowners and commercial businesses. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administers the NFIP and provides flood insurance to approximately 5 million policyholders. This extension will allow Congress to consider the package alongside a funding bill for the rest of the fiscal year next week.
THE MIGRANT CARAVAN ISN’T ABOVE OUR LAWS The migrant caravan in Mexico isn’t above our laws. The caravan of 8,500 individuals moving through Mexico have made several attempts to infiltrate our borders and attack law enforcement officers who are protecting law-abiding citizens.  Many migrants are claiming asylum from the violence of their home countries.  But some migrants are throwing rocks and bottles at law enforcement officers, rushing the border, and cutting border fences. Get the facts on the national security issue at the southern border in this week’s Mullin It Over.

 NEWSOK: OKLAHOMA EMPLOYMENT RATE IMPROVES IN OCTOBER Oklahoma continues to see improvements in employment rates all across the state as a result of President Trump’s policies. NewsOK recently reported that “unemployment rates were lower in October than a year earlier in all 77 counties. The statewide jobless rate for October was 3.4 percent, down from 3.5 percent in September.” Read more about the state’s employment outlook at this link.
  WEEKLY WRAP-UP The crisis at our southern border is a national security risk—not an immigration issue. I am proud of our president for putting the safety of American citizens first. Watch the weekly wrap-up on my Facebook or YouTube page.

Congresswoman Beatty Marks Rosa Parks Day, 
Convening Community Leaders Forum

On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, an Alabama seamstress, refused to give up her seat on a segregated Montgomery, Alabama bus. Her defiance and subsequent jailing sparked the peaceful, 381-day Montgomery Bus Boycott that eventually led to the complete desegregation of our nation’s public transportation system.
Though small in stature, Parks became an enormous figure in the Civil Rights Movement, working alongside Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and others to advance civil rights, greater freedom, and opportunities for all Americans. Soon after, Parks earned the title: “Mother of the Modern Civil Rights Movement.”
50 years later, in 2005, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03), then-State Representative in the Ohio General Assembly, authored legislation to designate December 1st as “Rosa Parks Day” in the State of Ohio—making the Buckeye State the first in the nation to formally recognize the Civil Rights icon. Every year since, the State of Ohio pays tribute to Parks and pauses to reflect on the “Power of One” that each individual possesses to make a difference in the lives of others, our nation, and the world.
“Rosa Parks forever changed the world. She was the embodiment of the ‘Power of One,’” Beatty said. “Her life and actions on that historic December day is a touchstone moment for me and so many Americans—not to mention people across the world. By sitting down, Rosa Parks stood up for what is right and just.” Beatty continued, “It is our collective responsibility to honor Rosa Parks and the ‘Power of One’ by following in her footsteps. We all have a role to play.""   
￼


Congresswoman Beatty speaks at her 2017 Community Leaders Forum. (December 4, 2017)


This year marks the 14th annual statewide tribute to Rosa Parks. Coinciding with this year’s statewide tribute, Congresswoman Beatty is hosting a Community Leaders Forum “Footsteps: We All Have a Role to Play” that will bring local, national and civil rights leaders together for an important discussion on the “Power of One” and its continuing importance to our community and the legislative work of the upcoming 116th Congress. 
For more information on the Community Leaders Forum and/or to RSVP, please visit Congresswoman Beatty’s events page.

Republican Congress Getting Results for Tennesseans:
	•	The Senate health committee I chair passed legislation to help ensure that doctors and health care providers in Tennessee and Alzheimer’s patients and their families have more of the support and information they need. We also passed legislation to help recruit more doctors and nurses to care for pregnant women living in rural areas. In Tennessee, 70 of our 95 counties have at least 50 percent of their residents living in rural areas -- that is 1.5 million Tennesseans.
	•	My committee also approved four more of President Trump’s nominees on Thursday. These nominees will work on important issues including higher education policy, pension fund insurance, and labor policy.
Important news from this past week:
	•	This week, the United States Senate confirmed Tennessean Stephen Vaden from Union City to serve as General Counsel for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Stephen is a very well qualified nominee, and I’m glad he was confirmed this week.
Reducing the cost of health care 
￼
Click here to listen to my remarks at the health care costs hearing this week.
The cost of health care is an issue at the front of most Tennesseans’ minds. I held a hearing this week to learn what Washington should do to get out of the way of private sector innovation to lower costs. For example, International Paper, a 120-year old company headquartered in Memphis, uses a variety of approaches to lower the cost of health care for its 33,000 employees. One innovative approach International Paper takes is encouraging employees to use the Best Doctors program. When an International Paper employee’s doctor recommends for example, a hip replacement, the employee can ask for a second opinion from Best Doctors. Best Doctors reaches out to get the necessary medical records from the employee’s doctor, sends the records to world-class medical professionals who review the case, and then either reaffirms the hip replacement or recommends a different course of treatment, such as physical therapy. The use of this voluntary program saved International Paper over half a million dollars in 2017 by preventing unnecessary care. Going forward, I plan to take what we learned at our hearing this week and from our previous four hearings and ask leading health care policy experts for specific ideas on how to reduce the cost of health care.
 
￼
 
 
I appreciated having Dr. Jonathan Perlin, president of clinical services and chief medical officer at HCA Healthcare in Nashville, as a witness at my health care costs hearing this week.
 
 
 
Introducing Tennessean Cliff Corker to the Senate Judiciary Committee 
￼
Watch video of my remarks at Judge Corker’s confirmation hearing here.
It was my pleasure to introduce Tennessean Cliff Corker this week at his confirmation hearing to serve as a U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Tennessee before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Cliff Corker currently serves as a United States Magistrate Judge on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. He was selected by the District Court Judges of the Eastern District of Tennessee -- a testament to his qualifications to be a District Court Judge and to his support from the community. He will be an asset to the federal bench, and Tennessee is fortunate that President Trump chose to nominate him. I urged the members of the committee to support his nomination so he can be quickly considered by the full Senate.
 
Confirming Union City’s Stephen Vaden to be the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s General Counsel
￼
I spoke on the Senate floor to encourage my colleagues to support Tennessean Stephen Vaden’s nomination to be general counsel at the United States Department of Agriculture before the Senate confirmed him this week. Stephen grew up on a family farm in Union City where his father was a farmer, so he has hands-on experience for this job. He attended Vanderbilt University and Yale Law School, and he practiced law at two distinguished Washington firms. Based on his experience on his family’s farm, his strong academic credentials, his mentorships and his legal experience -- both in the private sector and at the U.S. Department of Agriculture over the last year -- he’s very well-qualified to serve as the Department’s general counsel.
 
Cosponsoring prison reform legislation 
￼
This week, I cosponsored the First Step Act, prison reform legislation introduced by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and endorsed by President Trump. The First Step Act will help improve the federal criminal justice system and reform federal prisons. I applaud President Trump and Chairman Grassley for their leadership on this bipartisan legislation, which takes some important first steps to help non-violent offenders re-enter their communities and reduce the likelihood of returning to prison in the future.
 
My committee approves four more qualified Trump nominees
This week, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee I chair concluded a productive 115th Congress by passing five additional bills that will help Americans lead healthier lives and continue to have access to local libraries and museums, and approving four more qualified nominations. You can see a breakdown of the bills we passed and nominees we approved here. With the approval of these five bills, this committee has reported 29 bills this Congress and approved 50 nominees. I hope the full Senate will pass these bills and confirm these nominees before the end of the year as well. While we have accomplished quite a bit working together this Congress, looking towards next year, there are some things I hope to work on. This includes finding real ways to lower the cost of health care for Americans and reauthorizing the Higher Education Act to ensure the student’s education is worth their time and money.
 
￼
 
This week marks the 2nd anniversary of the heartbreaking Gatlinburg fires that swept through Sevier County. Over the last two years, we have seen the resilience and strength of East Tennesseans. I could not be more impressed with the hard work and bravery of our firefighters, police, and other first responders, as well as the responsiveness of local, state and federal officials. These men and women worked tirelessly to save lives during the fires and to help recover and rebuild over these past two years.
Funding Chickamauga Lock for the fifth consecutive year 
Chickamauga Lock construction will continue for the 5th consecutive year under the work plan released by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Completion of the Chickamauga Lock is one of my top priorities as chairman of the appropriations subcommittee overseeing the agency. This funding will keep construction of the new Chickamauga Lock on schedule, and is great news for East Tennessee since it will help keep up to 150,000 trucks off I-75 and keep the cost of shipping goods low for manufacturers across the state. More U.S. senators ask to increase funding for the Army Corps of Engineers than any other part of the budget. This year, Congress worked hard to provide record funding for the Corps to ensure we could keep federal lock and dam projects on track, which was important for Chickamauga Lock after the project was restarted in 2015.
 
￼￼
I was glad to have Tennessee State Representatives David “Coach” Byrd of Waynesboro and Jerry Sexton of Bean Station come by Tennessee Tuesday to say hello this week. Tennessee Tuesday is a breakfast I hold every Tuesday the Senate is in session to meet with the people for whom I work. If you find yourself in Washington during a session week, sign up through my website -- I’d love to see you.

In the district, my staff attended numerous meetings and events, including a discussion with representatives from Texas A&M International University (TAMIU) in Laredo regarding details for our 2019 STEM Alliance Event that will be taking place at TAMIU.
I have also included a video from the Federal Trade Commission that details important steps you can take to secure your computer from online hackers and scammers now that the holiday online shopping season is upon us. 
As always, please contact one of my offices if you need assistance with any federal agency. 


Rep. Cuellar Passes Bipartisan Bill Promoting US-Mexico Economic Partnership and Cooperation 
￼

On Tuesday, November 27, Congressman Michael McCaul and I passed H.R. 1567 - the United States-Mexico Economic Partnership Act, a bipartisan bill that will bolster professional development and economic growth in both countries, including in the border region in Texas, with a focus on the energy, health, entrepreneurship, and education sectors.
The relationship between the United States and Mexico runs deep through commercial, cultural, and educational partnerships. The goal of the bill is to promote a bilingual workforce that can better serve both sides of the border and increase economic development in the region. Read more here.


Rep. Cuellar Discusses Hurricane Harvey Damage to UT Austin Marine Science Institute
￼

On Tuesday, November 28, I met with the Senior Associate Vice President for Research and Federal Relations at The University of Texas at Austin Ellyn Perrone to discuss the damage Hurricane Harvey inflicted on UT Austin’s Marine Science Institute. I remain committed to South Texas’ recovery and the efficient allocation of all federal funds intended for repairs. I will additionally continue to explore new sources of efficient energy and business in the region. 


2019 STEM Alliance Event Planning Meeting
￼

On Wednesday, November 28, my Laredo District Office met with Representatives from Texas A&M International University (TAMIU) to discuss details for our 2019 STEM Alliance Event that will be taking place at TAMIU.

Constituent Highlight: Assisting Local Veteran from Mission 
￼
This month, my Mission Office successfully assisted constituent U.S. Army Reserves Sergeant First Class Ruben A. Rodriguez to reinstate the veteran’s transfer of unused Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits to his dependents. His previous approval of his benefits was rescinded by the Department of Defense, after a discrepancy with his US Army Reserve retirement orders. My office facilitated supporting documents to our congressional liaison, which were then sent to the Department of Army, Education Division for re-evaluation. After review and consideration, his benefits were reinstated. Pictured from left are U.S. Army Reserves Sergeant First Class Ruben A. Rodriguez and Constituent Service Representative Alexis Gallegos. 


Farewell to Bexar County Outreach Coordinator Pete Arguello 
￼

I want to wish Pete Arguello, my Outreach Coordinator for Bexar County, farewell and good luck as he takes on a job as Government Relations Coordinator with VIA Metropolitan Transit in San Antonio. He has worked for me for the past nine years and he has been an invaluable asset to my team. 


Intern Spotlight: Merrilee Agather
￼

Merrilee Agather is a recent graduate from the University of St Andrews, where she majored in Russian language and medieval history. She is originally from San Antonio, Texas, but is currently residing in Washington DC, for the duration of her internship. She is planning on attending law school in the future and says this internship has prepared her for her professional career down the road.

Dear Lindsey, 
The past couple of weeks have proven to be very busy, but I wanted to take the time to give you all an update on the recent work in Washington, D.C. and the 15th District of Texas. 
It is an honor to serve as your congressman. 
It was my honor to spend my second, consecutive Thanksgiving with the incredibly brave men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces, stationed overseas. These brave troops keep our country safe, and for that, I am forever grateful. In Congress, I will continue to fight for our military, veterans, and their families.  
Read more about my visit to Djibouti and Kuwait by clicking the picture below: 
￼
Recently, Northern District Director, Albert Martinez, attended the annual Senior Citizens Thanksgiving Luncheon in Concepcion, Texas. Mr. Martinez had the honor of joining Jim Hogg County Judge-elect, Juan Carlos Guerra; Duval County Judge-elect, Gilbert Saenz, and San Diego Mayor, Sally Lichtenberger (pictured below). Aside from enjoying turkey and dressing, the group discussed ways to ensure that the senior citizens of the 15th District of Texas are able to retire comfortably after a lifetime of hard work. In Congress, I work to protect Social Security and improve Medicare for all Americans.
￼ 
Recently, I announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has awarded a loan of $50 million to San Miguel Electric Cooperative. I remain a strong proponent of maximizing American energy resources and ensuring that every American has access to affordable energy. The Eagle Ford Shale, potentially the largest economic development in Texas, runs through Central and South Texas and has created thousands of jobs in the region. Rural electric delivers affordable and reliable electricity, Internet, air conditioning, heating, and solar services to more than four million Texans and over 300,000 in the 15th District of Texas.

On Monday, I sat down with KVEO’s Mike Jimenez to discuss my recent letter to the Administration, requesting real flood control infrastructure in the Rio Grande Valley. Recently, the Administration allocated taxpayer dollars for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to construct a six-mile levee system in the Rio Grande Valley Sector.
Physical barriers along the Rio Grande will actually increase flooding risks in a region still recovering from devastation and already prone to flooding.

Recently, Chief of Staff Jose Borjon (pictured below) attended a groundbreaking ceremony in the city of Hidalgo, Texas. The event was hosted by Texas State Representative Sergio Muñoz, Hidalgo County Commissioner Eddie Cantu, Hidalgo Mayor Sergio Coronado, the Hidalgo City Council, and the Hidalgo Economic Development Corporation (all pictured below). The Economic Development Administration awarded the city of Hidalgo a $1.2 million grant for infrastructure improvements to the area, including water and sewage lines. The new development includes a new apartment complex, cold storage facility, and a new IDEA school. Expected private investments are projected at more than $54 million! A huge win for local residents and businesses! In Congress, I will continue to work with local government to ensure that  federal funding continues to create these opportunities.

Some of you have reached out to inquire about my stance on Wednesday’s Leadership votes. The answer? Before any Leadership nominee were to be voted for, Congress, and the way it functions, needed to be address for huge problem – current Rules have prevented Members of Congress for working directly for the people they represent. 
On Wednesday, I applauded Leader Pelosi after she offered her support for Rules reform in the 116th Congress. Our top priorities should be breaking the gridlock and returning power to the people. I thank Leader Pelosi for her commitment to a Rules package that will make the Washington work again. These changes will bring much needed transparency, accountability, and consensus, putting the People’s House back on track to serve all Americans.

November 26

Tri-County Waterfront Park: Happy day after Thanksgiving weekend!
I hope yours was a good one. Mine was down at the farm with the boys, siblings, nieces and nephews, and a long list of other friends. Our tradition is something along the lines of Survivor, which means between early morning duck hunts, preparation for the Thanksgiving meal and a family BBQ, and a whole lot more, you wind up so worn down that you’re more than ready for weekend’s end to come!
I’ll be in Washington tomorrow morning by 7:15 as I leave on the early morning flight, but tonight I’m doing a town hall meeting with the Daniel Island Neighborhood Association. The topic of discussion will be what I’ve been talking about with regard to a Tri-County Waterfront Park.
The importance of this I cannot highlight enough.
The Tri-County area continues to grow, and the Lowcountry and Charleston area that many of us grew up with is disappearing as it does so. Not every inch of land needs to be developed as our area becomes more and more urban. This is especially the case on lands that you and I own as taxpayers. Click here to read more.

Move Out Day: Well…the last day is here.
While I will continue to be a member of the House until January 3rd, we will officially have to be out of the Washington office tomorrow morning.
It’s bittersweet.
It’s hard to move. It’s hard to take down. It’s hard to store and to put away.
Each effort and the materials touched are visible reminders of unseen hours of effort, focus, and contemplation by the whole team on ideas that matter both to the Lowcountry and our country as a whole.
It hits home for me what we always remember at poignant moments in our lives. When my dad died and I built the coffin, it hit home for me that life was short. When one of my best friends from college died, it hit home for me that life was short. When it seemed that politics was over for me in the wake of 2009, it hit home for me that life was short.
Each of us could fill in the blank with markers in our lives that have reminded us of the gift of life, its brevity, and the importance of making the most of the time that we have. And yet we all get busy with life’s different strings, stresses, and pulls, and we forget about the importance of remembering how numbered our days really are.
Today’s packing and final arrangements with regard to the Washington office has been one of those days for me.
And so I leave you not only with my pause and contemplation on this point here at day’s end, but I leave you with the upside of remembering that our time on any of life’s projects is limited.
Specifically, I would ask that you take the time to listen to Steve Jobs’ commencement address at Stanford University. We all need clear reminders of the importance of remembering time, and he is as eloquent as anyone I’ve heard in expressing this. You can find the speech at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc.  I also leave you with a cover that I remember from Forbes magazine years ago that celebrated the life and legacy of Malcolm Forbes. It had a picture of him and simply the words, “while alive, he lived.”
Indeed, in whatever we do in life, this would be my prayer for each one of us. The Bible in fact says to be hot, or cold…but not lukewarm. We should indeed try to grab what’s before us and run it hard until that chapter is done.
My office’s operations will certainly continue in Charleston and Beaufort, but we will be relegated from this point forward to a small cubicle down in the bowels of the Rayburn Office Building for the weeks remaining in this Congress. For that reason, if I’m tougher to reach over the next couple of weeks, just give me a little time and I’ll still get back to you!
Happy Tuesday….

Free Markets and General Motors: Happy Wednesday…
Tomorrow I’ll come back to the two suspension votes that we had last night. But given the front page stories today on the president’s threats to cut off General Motors subsidies, I thought it important to offer my perspective on what’s at play.
As I’m sure you’ve read, General Motors has proposed to eliminate about 14,000 jobs in North America. And this represents about 15% of their salaried workforce in the region. They planned to re-deploy about $4.5 billion in annual savings to more profitable lines of business. Interesting was the fact that the stock price for GM went up based on the market’s view that GM needed restructuring. The company never took the tougher steps that Ford and Chrysler had some time ago, and as a consequence, GM has been stuck with uncompetitive labor contracts that make it tough for them to compete.
But here's the interesting part….
What in the world is the president doing in once again going after a single business? Click here to read more.

International Aid Votes: I appreciated the number of you who took the time to offer their comments and opinion on yesterday’s post on General Motors. I do believe that clarity on the philosophy behind aid to a company like GM should have been important years ago - just as I believe it is important today to be clear about the dangers of the philosophy built in to attempts to control a company from Washington.
In any case, thank you again to those who took the time to make me think more deeply about the issue given the comments I saw.
Which of course brings me to yet another philosophic point. In this case tied to the two votes we took on aid and support of hot spots around the world and the Congo. Specifically, we voted on the Global Fragility and Violence Reduction Act (H.R. 5273) and The Democratic Republic of the Congo Democracy and Accountability Act (H.R. 6207). I voted against both and they passed 376-16 and 374-11, respectively.
The concerns I had with these two bills were similar. In matters of foreign policy and war it is easy to get in, but much more difficult to get out. Click here to read more. 
￼
November 30  The Updated NAFTA - USMCA: We were to have voted today on a tax bill that represented a combination of tax extensions and IRS reforms, retirement adjustments, and small business tax provisions. They ultimately pulled the bill this morning because they didn’t have enough votes, and that’s worth a larger commentary as I suspect the bill will come back up next week.
Of note today in Washington was the president’s signing of the new United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement known as “USMCA” to replace the existing agreement known as “NAFTA.” For the president to sign the new agreement into law, the Congress must ratify it. A ratification can be in the form of either a majority vote by both houses or simply two-thirds of the Senate.
As I have written before, for all the hype, in many respects this revised agreement does not change much in terms of substance. There are a few minor gains on dairy and auto protections, but the main win for the administration was that any trade agreements with non-market economies (really meaning China) would need to be disclosed three months before beginning negotiations. In effect, this represents a stand against China and a shot against the bow of Canada, should they choose to engage more deeply with the Chinese.
The idea of creating retaliatory consequences for trading partners like Canada simply because they trade with places other than America strikes me as counterproductive. The idea of being a sovereign nation is that you can do as you and your people see fit. I can only imagine how we would respond as Americans if someone were to dictate our trade practices as a condition to trading with them. Click here to read more.

SAFE AND SECURE WATERS
￼
The brave men and women of the United States Coast Guard are integral to our national security. 
This week, Congress took bipartisan action to make sure our Coast Guardsman have what they need to protect the safety, security, and stewardship of our nation’s waters.
We also took action to preserve the Great Lakes. All our nation’s waterways are valuable resources, but here in northern Indiana, the Great Lakes are part of our home.
This national treasure is a key economic driver for our state, supporting more than 15,000 direct jobs and 14,000 indirect jobs in Indiana.
From maintaining clean ecological health to sustaining our fishing economy, I am committed to maintaining the positive impact the Great Lakes have on Hoosiers. 
I will continue to fight to keep our lakes clean and our country safe so future generations can enjoy them. That is why I was proud to support S. 140, the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018.
This important bill gives our state opportunities to improve the long-term health and security of the Great Lakes by:
	•	Establishing a Great Lakes and Lake Champlain Invasive Species Monitoring Program to monitor the Great Lakes system and prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species.
	•	Creating the Center of Expertise for Great Lakes Oil Spill Preparedness and Response, which would research freshwater oil spill response technology and educate first responders on best practices.
	•	Authorizing $5 million for the Great Lakes Commission to review petitions for enhanced marine pollution control device standards and requirements.
MOURNING PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH
￼
President George H.W. Bush served his country with honor, from his courageous service in World War II to the decades of public service that followed. I am grateful for his steady leadership and his unwavering commitment to freedom, peace, and the security of the American people.
Dean and I join all Americans in mourning his loss, but we are comforted that he and his beloved Barbara are together again. Our prayers are with the entire Bush family in these difficult days.
U.S.-CANADA-MEXICO TRADE AGREEMENT
￼
On Friday, the United States, Mexico, and Canada formally signed a new trade agreement. While it is encouraging to take the next step toward a modernized agreement, I am disappointed there is still no resolution to the steel and aluminum tariffs and retaliatory measures. 
As long as they remain in place, these unnecessary tariffs on our trading partners will continue to harm American manufacturers and threaten Hoosier jobs. 
I urge President Trump to stand up for our small businesses and workers by ending these tariffs and focusing on the real problem of China’s unfair trade practices.

Securing the Retirement Future for Millions of Americans
For over 70 years, retirees from diverse employment backgrounds have relied on multiemployer pensions to support them and their families throughout their retirement years. Unfortunately, because of several factors, the multiemployer pension system faces significant challenges. Multiemployer pension plans were created as retirement plans sponsored by more than one employer as part of a collective bargaining agreement. The crisis facing multiemployer pensions is not new and the problem has been growing for years. Earlier this year, Congress established the Joint Select Committee on the Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans, on which I’m honored to serve. I have been working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find a bipartisan solution. 
How did we get to this point? The problem stems from a combination of factors that has led to the underfunding of several large multiemployer pension plans. While many plans are in strong financial shape, there is a growing number of financially-distressed plans that are putting the entire system at risk. If a pension plan fails, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) steps in but can only give plan participants a fraction of what they would have received under the terms of their pension. To make matters worse, the PBGC’s multiemployer program’s finances are also in crisis. In Fiscal Year 2018, the PBGC’s multiemployer program had a deficit of more than $53 billion, which is an increase of over $10 billion since Congress last acted on this issue in 2014. The PBGC believes that without any change it is likely that this program will become insolvent by 2025. 
Four years ago, while I chaired the Education and Workforce Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions, I worked closely with then-committee Chairman John Kline and Ranking Member George Miller to pass the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act (MPRA). This critical legislation gave plans the tools to put themselves on firmer financial footing by applying to the U.S. Department of Treasury; unfortunately, as of September this year, they have approved only seven of the 32 MPRA applications received and rejected applications from some of the largest and most troubled plans. The purpose of MPRA was to give pension plans the tools to save themselves without a taxpayer bailout, and would have given troubled plans like Central States a chance at solvency. It is not a question of IF the multiemployer pension system will fail, but WHEN.  
The multiemployer pension system is worth saving, but it will take some tough choices to find a solution. Republicans and Democrats share the same goal, and we have spent countless hours trying to find a solution to this crisis. It is clear we can increase the pension plan premiums or reduce plan outlays to lower costs, and some have suggested we provide taxpayer funding to create loans or direct funding. The issue with providing taxpayer funding is no one in the government helped negotiate or guarantee these benefits, and I am concerned about the precedent we set if the federal government becomes the backstop for private pension plans. We must balance the needs of employers, retirees and taxpayers alike in providing potential solutions to this crisis. Multiemployer pension plans cannot be fixed overnight. The system faces multiple challenges that are causing it to fail; unfortunately, the Joint Select Committee has yet come to an agreement on a resolution. 
Whether we are able to agree on a solution this Congress or have to continue working into the next year, any acceptable agreement must do three things. We must resolve the funding status for endangered plans while protecting taxpayers from bailouts. Second, we must ensure PBGC’s financial stability is not threatened. Third, we must work to provide new options for employers and workers alike to ensure sustainable retirement options continue to be available for millions of hardworking Americans. On this third point, I introduced the bipartisan GROW Act this year with Rep. Norcross of New Jersey. This legislation combines the best aspects of defined benefit and defined contribution plans to modernize and strengthen the multiemployer system. I am confident this legislation could be one piece of the multipronged approach needed to address this problem. This is one of my top priorities in Congress and I will continue working with my colleagues to ensure every American, especially those who rely on the multiemployer pension system, has a sustainable path to retirement security.  
Feel free to contact my office if I can be of assistance to you or your family.

12/1/18 9:02,Latest News from the Senate,"￼  


Friends,  I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday. I am always thankful for the opportunity to serve each of you and make a difference in your lives. In West Virginia, we have so much to be thankful for, including an economy that’s on the rise, communities that come together to support each other, and so many other things. This week in the Senate, I continued efforts to help our state make the most of the growth we are experiencing and put more West Virginians on the path to a brighter future.  Click here or the image below for more details on this effort, and keep scrolling for additional updates from this week in the U.S. Senate. 
￼ 
Preparing Our Students and Workers  I am working hard to create economic growth in West Virginia, while also making sure West Virginians are prepared to take full advantage of the new opportunity being created. Education, including higher education, plays a very critical role in this effort. That’s why I teamed up with my colleague, Senator Peters from Michigan, to introduce bipartisan legislation that will help students and support economic growth in our state. Specifically, the bill would rewrite certain tax rules so that private foundations can help graduate students pay off their student loan debt through scholarships. As our state’s economy continues to grow, it’s important that younger workers are not constrained by the cost of higher education and have more options when it comes to gaining the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in the workforce. Learn more here.  Our Future Leaders  One of the most important responsibilities I have as a senator is nominating young men and women to our nation’s service academies. Earlier this week, I nominated 31 qualified high school students from 20 counties across the state. There is no question that these students are smart, talented, and driven and have worked extremely hard to get to this point. I am honored to support them throughout this process and look forward to following their journey as our future leaders in West Virginia and America. View the full list of nominees here.  How Can We Help?  Whether you need help with a casework issue or have a question about scheduling a meeting at one of my offices, my staff and I are ready to assist you.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS UPDATE
￼ 
Lindsey - 
I'm excited to share with you two bills that we've passed to make progress on environmental issues facing our community: 
First, we passed the Strengthening Coastal Communities Act to help protect and preserve our coasts. As the Audubon Society said, our bill benefits ""taxpayers, wildlife, and waterfront communities."" I was a strong supporter and early co-sponsor of this bill. Getting it through the House of Representatives is a good, bipartisan accomplishment. 
This week, Congress also passed my bill - the Jupiter Island Land Transfer Act - to ensure that the habitats of endangered turtles and other animals are preserved by expanding the Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge. Being good stewards of our environment begins with strong conservation efforts and protecting our environment is critical to our businesses and livelihoods. My bill is now headed to the President's desk to become law! 
These are just a few of the important moves we're making to protect our environment. As our fight for clean water continues, I will make sure you have all the information you need to participate in the Lake Okeechobee Regulation Schedule (LORS) review process that I required the Army Corps to conduct as part of the Water Resources Development Act, which we got signed into law in October. 
To learn more about these bills and the other progress we're making to prevent discharges and clean up our waterways, watch this week's Week In Review video:

Coast Guard bill advances with Saugatuck Chain Ferry provision 



Dear Friend: 
Welcome to your weekly update. As always, you can learn more about these and other legislative issue at my website: upton.house.gov.
Coast Guard bill advances with Saugatuck Chain Ferry provision
On Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives advanced S. 140, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018. Included in this package was a provision that I authored which would exempt the Saugatuck Chain Ferry from the requirement under section 8902 of title 46, United States Code, that the vessel be operated by an individual licensed by the Coast Guard.
This is important because, as local leaders have expressed repeatedly, the Chain Ferry is a hand-cranked vessel and the current regulations are woefully outdated.
Come spring, the historic Saugatuck Chain Ferry will be moving again.
Learn more here or do a deeper dive below:

Progress for new Soo Lock
This week, the U.S. Army Corps listed the Soo Locks project as a priority for 2019.
I was happy to chat with WSJM about the importance of this project and what it means for not only Southwest Michigan but our entire state.

Critical Habitat SCOTUS Decision

On Monday the Supreme Court dealt a serious blow to overregulation and government overreach when it remanded Weyerhaeuser v. United States Fish and Wildlife Service to the lower courts in a unanimous 8-0 decision. The Court’s decision centered around the legal requirement that for a space to be designated by USFWS as “critical habitat,” the species in question must be able to survive in that area. “Critical habitat” is a regulatory designation that USFWS has abused for years to hamper rural development in areas that endangered species do not and cannot live in without substantial and costly alterations to the natural environment. Combatting executive overreach has been one of my top priorities throughout my years in Congress- in 2014, I introduced the Common Sense in Species Protection Act and hosted a Natural Resources Committee field hearing in Batesville after USFWS implanted non-scientific regulations in Arkansas. This ruling vindicates years of struggle against arbitrary Federal regulations and is a victory for both the economy and wildlife conservation. Regulators will now focus on protecting endangered species where they can actually survive, and not needlessly disrupting rural development.

FAQ (What folks have been calling/texting my office about this week)
Q: What is the latest update on the Farm Bill?  A: The Farm Bill negotiations have officially concluded and Conference Committee is waiting for the Congressional Budget Office score before releasing the exact details on the final bill. Although it has been a very slow process I am very excited about the final piece of legislation. I look forward to delivering on my promises and giving rural America an updated Farm Bill that works for everyone.

Rep. Rick Crawford (R., Ark.) added, ""Like Chief Justice Roberts, I have an ordinary understanding of how adjectives work. I am glad to see the terrible ruling from the Fifth Circuit overruled and reign in agencies run amok. We are a nation of laws, and the Supreme Court’s ruling ushers in a new era of agency accountability and proper wildlife conservation.""

Arkansans in D.C. oppose poultry-grower loan changes
U.S. Sens. John Boozman and Tom Cotton and Reps. Rick Crawford, French Hill, Steve Womack and Bruce Westerman are pressuring the Small Business Administration to reverse the proposed rule that would make it more difficult for contract poultry growers to obtain agency-backed loans.
In a recent letter to agency Administrator Linda McMahon, the legislators asked her to reconsider the rule, saying it could ""jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of small family farms and small businesses across Arkansas.""
