August Recap
It is an honor to work on behalf of all Philadelphia and Montgomery County residents. I take my role as your Representative in Congress very seriously and always want to hear from you about issues, concerns and solutions that are most important to you and your loved ones.
In case you missed it I wanted to share some of my August highlights:
Penn State Ag Days
As you know, I am a proud member of the House Agriculture Committee and serve on the Subcommittee on Nutrition and the Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture. I always say Food Policy is Foreign Policy.
￼
As we head down the path of drafting a new Farm Bill, I’ve had numerous thoughtful conversations with farmers, suppliers, buyers, consumers and many other key leaders in our farming and Ag community. 
Penn State Agriculture Progress Days at Pennsylvania State University in State College, Pennsylvania provided an incredible forum to discuss key advances in agriculture research, development and education that will lead to the continued success and growth of our farming economy (pictured above). I am committed to ensuring everyone’s perspectives, voices and views are heard and considered in our Farm Bill. The Farm Bill lays out a plan and path for our nation and no one’s voices are to be left out of this important process. I look forward to speaking with you soon to hear the vital issues you would like to see included in our Farm Bill.
No Federal Funding for Confederate Symbols Act
This month, I joined with Congressman Espaillat (NY-13) to introduce an anti-hate bill after the violence in Charlottesville. Our bill titled the No Federal Funding for Confederate Symbols Act, prohibits Federal funds from being used to create, maintain, or display, as applicable, any Confederate symbol on Federal public land, including any highway, park, subway, Federal building, military base, street, or other Federal property. Currently, there are at least 1,503 remaining symbols of the Confederacy in public spaces, including 109 public schools named after prominent Confederates, many with large African-American student populations. There are more than 700 Confederate monuments and statues on public property throughout the country. There is no circumstance where federal funds should support monuments to slavery or white supremacy. As your Representative in Congress please know that I will continue to speak out in the face of injustice and intolerance of any kind. An attack against one of us is an attack against all of us.
Our Children Are Our Future 
The results couldn’t be clearer, we know early childhood education programs play a critical role in building healthy, vibrant neighborhoods. Earlier this month, I visited the Parent Infant Center (PIC) on Spruce Street and had an incredibly fulfilling visit to a Pre-K classroom. During my visit, the kids and I read Todd Parr’s book titled, “I LOVE YOU,” and had such a wonderful time! 
￼
Together I know we can replicate the work they are doing at the Parent Infant Center (PIC). In Congress, we should be looking at places like the PIC we can use as a model that can be replicated in neighborhoods in our cities and suburbs nationwide (pictured above). 
No Conflict of Interest Presidency Act of 2017
I have long said there is a big difference between campaigning and governing. It is time for President Trump to govern for the well-being of the American people. Their needs to be a clear wall, a clear line between President Trump’s business connections and his role as President. This is why at the beginning of August, I introduced the No Conflict of Interest Presidency Act of 2017 which will provide much needed clarity and the legislative backing I believe the Administration needs in order to begin to focus on the issues that matter most. Issues such as improving the quality of life for Philadelphians, Pennsylvanians and Americans: things like food policy, school modernization and home repair that give the residents in our cities and suburbs the tools they need to build strong, healthy neighborhoods.
Protecting the EPA
This week, I joined with PennEnvironment to call for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to continue its full funding (pictured below). Water is not a partisan issue. We all need water for our survival. Even though the Administration says we should make massive cuts to the EPA, I believe that doesn’t necessarily mean that is the right thing to do.

Together, as a community, we have made great progress over the years when it comes to protecting, preserving and restoring our waterways. Please know that as your Representative in Congress, I will do all I can to ensure our progress does not disappear overnight.

North Texans Helping With Harvey Relief & Recovery
Our whole community continues to stand with the victims of the catastrophic events of Hurricane Harvey. There is tremendous support from North Texas in the aftermath of this terrible storm. Many first responders from cities around the 24th Congressional District have answered the call to help their fellow Texans.  The Texas Task Force 2: Urban Search and Rescue was deployed a few days ago to aid in the recovery efforts. Members of the Bedford, Carrollton, DFW Airport, Euless, Farmers Branch, and Irving Fire Departments are all part of this task force. We're so thankful to all the men and women that answered the call to help Texans in need.
￼
 There are many ways for North Texans to help the relief efforts of Hurricane Harvey. Shelters of evacuees are right here in the 24th district and throughout the region. Volunteering, donating supplies to local centers, donating blood, financial contributions, are all ways to support the relief efforts.  Volunteer  Donate Resources at Trusted World  Red Cross   

Texans Helping Texans

￼
 It was a busy August traveling all over the district meeting with  individuals that serve our community on a daily basis. The people  at Metrocrest Services in Farmers Branch are no exception. I had  the chance to visit this facility with members of the North Texas  Food Bank and see the generosity and hope these men and women  provide..

￼







Organizations like these provide nutritious meals, household and school supplies, employment assistance, and counseling to families and individuals in need. But the most important thing they provide is hope to North Texans during difficult situations in their life. It's a great example of many different parts of our community coming together to offer a hand-up and not just a hand-out. 

Roundtable with Constituents in Southlake

￼
 It was great to hear from constituents in Southlake and get their  feedback about what Congress is doing. We talked about the  thousands of pages of Obama-era regulations that I voted to roll  back that will make it easier for businesses to operate in the  metroplex and throughout the country. I took questions about tax  relief legislation that we're working on in the Ways and Means  Committee to make it simpler to file your taxes and keep more of  your hard-earned paychecks. We talked about the legislation  Congress passed and the President signed to reform the VA and  make sure our veterans have the facilities and care they deserve.

 Many thanks to Joel with Vote Under God for hosting this  roundtable discussion at Gateway Church.

Job Creators in Coppell 

￼
After starting with two employees and a desire to provide an affordable solution to a friend’s back pain, VARIDESK has engineered their way into the furniture industry and in just a few short years has grown to 200 employees; based in the heart of the 24th District. In 2016, they received the award for the fastest growing entrepreneurial company by SMU Cox Dallas 100.  

Their successes and those of small businesses like them rely on pro-business policies that enable growth and job creation.

By continuing to improve the economic and regulatory environments our small businesses operate in, we will continue creating careers and growing opportunities that strengthen the American middle-class.

A One of a Kind Facility in North Texas 

￼
 It was a pleasure to meet with Paul Howard, President of Neuro  Fitness Foundation in Euless. Neuro Fitness Foundation is a non-  profit organization that provides a specialized gym for strength and  cardiovascular training for individuals with neurological issues and  related lifestyle challenges.

￼







Neuro Fitness Foundation is a one of a kind facility in North Texas. Paul and his team have done tremendous work helping the disabled gain mobility and strength to become more self-sufficient. 

For more information about this organization, please visit: http://neurofitnessfoundation.org/

Small Business Owners in Bedford

￼
 Small Businesses drive the American economy and strengthen our  communities.

 Access to capital can be a serious barrier to growth for small  businesses, Which is why earlier this year the House passed The  Small Business Investment Opportunity Act to expand the amount  of capital available to the entrepreneurs in North Texas to help  them grow their operations.

￼





I had the opportunity to discuss this and tax reform with Tarrant County small business owners in Bedford. Providing middle-class tax relief and eliminating burdensome regulations on small businesses is key to strengthening the economy and promoting job growth in North Texas.

Hot Dog Day at the Carrollton Senior Center

￼
I joined the Carrollton Senior Center for hot dog day earlier this month. Throughout North Texas I've been visiting with seniors, listening to their concerns about a wide range of issues, most importantly, Social Security and Medicare. I will continue the important work to strengthen both Medicare and Social Security and ensure these programs remain stable for future generations.

￼







 Our seniors deserve the peace of mind and certainty that the  programs they are planning their retirement around will be there  when they need them. My continued goal is to make sure that  Medicare and Social Security meet the needs of seniors and  taxpayers, now and into the future.

Tax Reform for North Texas Job Creators

￼
 Texans know how to spend their money better than the  Washington bureaucracy. Providing tax relief to working families  and reforming the tax code for North Texas businesses remains a  high priority. I was able to tour businesses in our backyard that  employ thousands of North Texans and want to continue to grow  right here. 

￼







The problem is our current tax code rewards growth overseas instead of job creation here at home. Businesses right here in the metroplex want to expand but they need the certainty that permanent, pro-growth tax reform will provide. I'm committed to making America's tax system look a little more like Texas and lot less like Washington.

[FIRST NAME],

How is your summer going? Thank you for signing up to receive updates on things happening in our community and in Congress. Continue reading for news about your health care coverage, new education benefits for veterans, Silicon Valley innovation, and protecting our interests abroad.

As always, I appreciate hearing from you and my staff is available to answer any questions or concerns you have. 

I hope to see you at my next town hall on September 20 at 6:30 pm. We’ll share information about the venue and how you can watch online shortly. Or follow me on Facebook and Twitter @RepRoKhanna to hear about it first!

Protecting Your Health Care

￼
The Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land, and thank you to all who shared their stories, called the office, and raised their voices on how important the ACA is to them and their families. I will continue to advocate for improvements like Medicare for All. 

Watch a recent interview where I lay out these next steps.
A 21st Century GI Bill

￼
Veterans will get more financial assistance to learn jobs skills to join the tech economy under a modernization of the GI Bill. It passed Congress with unanimous support and was recently signed into law. It was an honor to work with Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on this important legislation, the VET TEC Act. 

Read more in the Mercury News about how veterans in the Bay Area will benefit.
 

Innovation Across the Nation

￼
Throughout the halls of Congress, Silicon Valley ideas are discussed every day as people look to our region as a model. On issues from economic development to job training to broadband access, it’s been exciting to work on solutions to bring the opportunity of the digital economy throughout the nation. 

Watch a short video about my visit to Appalachia to see how coal country is learning to code.

 
American Responsibility Abroad

￼
Over the past few months, the Trump Administration took steps to escalate military action in lieu of diplomacy in too many instances. It’s time to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan; choose diplomacy over provocation with North Korea; pursue a diplomatic solution to Venezuela’s political and economic crisis; and stop conducting refueling for missions over northern and western Yemen. 

Read my op-ed with Sen. Rand Paul on why we need to practice restraint in foreign policy.

A Discussion with DREAMers 
Dear Friends,  I wish the President could sit in an Albuquerque living room and have a real discussion with DREAMers about what DACA means to them. I did that this morning, and every time I talk with these young people and their families, I am reminded about how valuable they are to our community. 
We can’t forget about the parents, either. I met parents today who sacrificed to escape violence and move to New Mexico in search of opportunities for their young boys. Now, they are terrified about the likelihood that President Trump will end DACA and put their youngest son at further risk. When he was a toddler, they would skip going to the doctor when he was injured because he could be deported. I can’t imagine being faced with that choice.
Despite the hateful rhetoric and actions from the President, this father still says he loves America. But he is scared. When I meet with immigrant families, I hear story after story that reflect what our country is all about. Families contributing to their adopted communities and aspiring for a better life for their children. Jazmin, a Law School graduate who wants to be an immigration lawyer, wasn't aware of her status until she applied for a job when she was 16 years old. Soon after, her family moved to New Mexico after learning that immigrants were welcome here. 
We are fortunate to have Jazmin and her twin sister, Yazmin, a student who has taken a leave of absence from medical school to advocate for her community and the women who inspired her the most, her mother. 
If you are a DREAMer and would like to share your story, I would love to hear about what DACA means to you. Please call my office at (505) 346-6781.   Sincerely,  Michelle Lujan Grisham Member of Congress First District of New Mexico  P.S. As always, if I can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to contact my Albuquerque district office at (505) 346-6781.

Dear Lindsey, 
I have heard it over and over again from my constituents: Michiganders are working harder than ever, but paychecks are not keeping up with rising expenses. No matter what you do, it is hard to keep up, pay the bills, save for your kids’ college, and save for retirement. 
Congress has not done its job to invest in small businesses and grow incomes for working families. Supporting small businesses and manufacturers who create good-paying jobs here in Michigan should be Congress’ focus. That is why I spent the month of August talking to workers about how we can create better jobs, better wages and economic opportunity for our entire region.
￼
Rep. Kildee visits GLE Precision in Bridgeport during August to highlight made in America manufacturing and discuss his work in Congress to invest in infrastructure.
What I heard was that Congress must invest here at home to ensure a fair playing field for our businesses and workers. That means investment in job training and education, rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges to improve our infrastructure and renegotiating failed trade deals. That’s why I’m proud to tour and highlight the ‘Made in America’ manufacturing happening in places like Flint, Saginaw, Bay City and Tawas. These businesses are creating the jobs and opportunity that build vibrant communities and a healthy middle class.
￼
Rep. Kildee visits Bay Plastics Machinery in Bay City during August talking with workers about his work in Congress to improve job training.
I will work with anyone to make sure hardworking Michiganders are represented in Congress. When workers have a voice in Washington, middle-class families win.

I want to hear from you. What issues should Congress focus on next?

Good paying jobs



Investments in infrastructure



Fair trade deals

August E-News
 Tahoe Summit
The Lake Tahoe Summit held was held on August 22nd in South Lake Tahoe.  The Congressman attended and delivered the following remarks:
Lake Tahoe Summit
First, I want to thank Senator Feinstein for restoring the bi-partisan nature of this annual Tahoe Summit.  Lincoln once reminded us “that we can succeed only by concert.”  We demonstrated that maxim with the enactment of the Tahoe provisions in the Water Infrastructure Improvements Act last December.  That wouldn’t have been possible without Republicans and Democrats coming together in Washington.     Returning the annual Lake Tahoe Summit to the same bi-partisanship is an important step forward locally and promises the same kind of progress into the future.   Click to read full remarks.

I am honored to join you today on this auspicious occasion of your assumption of American citizenship.  
America is not just a nation. America is also a notion – an idea – that is unique among the nations of the world. There are many democracies and republics around the world today – but only one to my knowledge, founded on the uniquely American principles given voice in the American Declaration of Independence and given life in the American Constitution.   Click to read full remarks.

Thank you for organizing this discussion on tax reform.     I believe the most important mandate given to this administration and this Congress is to revive our economy.  Our success or failure will largely be determined on achieving this objective and will be judged by the answer every American gives to Ronald Reagan’s question in both 1980 and 1984: “Are you better off than you were four years ago?  Click to read full remarks.

North Star Newsletter: August 2017
￼
Supporting Americans Affected by Hurricane Harvey  
Hurricane Harvey has left tens of thousands of American families displaced, uprooting entire cities and communities along its path through Texas and Louisiana. Franni and I are thinking of all of the families affected by Harvey, and we’re grateful to all of the emergency responders, firefighters, rescue workers, community leaders, and volunteers who are working to keep people safe.
Once Congress returns to Washington next week, I urge my fellow lawmakers to come together and pass bipartisan emergency aid as quickly as possible. We must do everything we can to help our fellow Americans.
The Great Minnesota Get-Together  
My favorite part about the Minnesota State Fair is getting the chance to talk to people from across the state about the issues they care about. I’ve been at this year’s Fair almost every day and I’m so glad people are continuing to let me know what’s on their minds.
I’ve met so many amazing Minnesotans at my booth on the corner of Judson and Underwood, and I’ve taken part in a lot of great Fair events since it kicked off last week. For example, I joined STEM Day with exhibits and activities that promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education programs, and I was proud to be part of Military Appreciation Day ceremony and mark the 100th anniversary of the 34th Red Bull Infantry Division with Minnesota National Guard Adjutant General Richard Nash.
The State Fair also gives me an opportunity to gather ideas about how I can help improve the lives of Minnesotans. Right now, one of my top priorities is lowering prescription drug prices, and so I urge you to drop by my booth to take a survey about the best ways to make medications more affordable for families and seniors.
It’s been another great year at the Great Minnesota Get-Together, and if you haven’t had a chance to come by yet—or maybe you’re itching to make a second, third, or fourth visit—I urge you to make your way out to the fairgrounds before it ends next week.
￼
Visiting the Iron Range and Northern Minnesota  
During August, I traveled throughout northern Minnesota and the Iron Range to talk with folks about how I can help make sure their voices are heard in Washington.
I met with Grand Portage Band leaders to discuss issues affecting tribal communities, and toured Grand Portage National Monument to highlight the importance of protecting parks and public lands. After that, I sat down with local business owners in Grand Marais to talk about their priorities and the unique challenges they face on the North Shore.
I also met with Iron Range steelworkers in Eveleth during my trip to the Northland. These are the men and women who helped build this country and bring us into the 21st century, and I’m fighting to protect their jobs and keep their local economies vibrant—to do that, I want to make sure our unions stay strong and that we’re cracking down on the foreign trade cheats that suppress our domestic steel production and steal jobs in Iron Range communities.
On top of those meetings, I stopped by the Virginia Fire Department to thank firefighters for their service and to learn more about how I can continue supporting their work, and I met with officials and local leaders at a community action agency to hear their concerns regarding how President Trump’s budget would affect the various programs they provide for things like housing and heating assistance, Meals on Wheels, and Head Start.
To find about my visits to Duluth and Cloquet, I hope you’ll read more at the link below.
￼
Standing Up For Minnesotans Who Serve Our Country  
We need to do everything we can to support the men and women who serve our country, and who put their lives on the line to defend our freedom, when they come back home. That’s why I helped write a key section of a bipartisan package of veterans legislation that recently became law.
The provision I authored is based on a bipartisan effort I’ve been working on for a long time—and which my Minnesota colleague Senator Amy Klobuchar also supports—to extend GI Bill education benefits to National Guard and Reserve members who are or have previously been called to active duty, including a group of Minnesotans who were put in harm’s way while serving in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula.
I’m glad to say that this new veterans law, in addition to the provision I wrote, will also allow veterans to use their GI Bill education benefits for their entire lives, instead of the previous 15-year limit, and it extends full GI Bill eligibility to all veterans who, post-9/11, were wounded in action.
I’m glad I could help get this bill passed and I look forward to continuing to work to improve the lives of Minnesota veterans.

A Devastating Storm, an Inspiring Response
Our thoughts and prayers are with the millions of victims of Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Louisiana.  We are all deeply moved by the suffering that we all have witnessed.  But were also equally inspired by the way the residents of Texas and Louisiana have responded. 
Of course, we owe a great debt of gratitude to the first responders for their heroic work, including our own New Jersey National Guard and New Jersey Task Force 1 Urban Search and Rescue Team, now deployed to Katy, Texas.  We also must commend the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard and all the other federal and state agencies on the ground and so many private organizations, like the American Red Cross, for their ongoing efforts to rescue, house and assist thousands of people in need.
And then there are the selfless individuals!  An army of volunteers manning an armada of small boats and trucks have plunged into the rescue effort, often placing themselves in harms way, to rescue fellow citizens and, in most cases complete strangers.  Its been very inspiring.
The weeks efforts have been concentrated on rescue.  But, as the floodwaters recede, the focus will shift to recovery activities.  
The President has signed a disaster declaration for Texas which authorizes grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of this disaster.
But the veterans of Super Storm Sandy, Hurricanes Katrina and other catastrophes  elected officials and businessmen and women alike  understand that a long-term, stable recovery requires an injection of resources at the earliest possible date to ensure the ability to rebuild and strengthen the region: rebuilding homes and businesses.
After Super Storm Sandy in 2012, as a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, I faced the task of convincing my Congressional colleagues, many representing districts that have never suffered a major disaster, to approve over $50 billion in emergency funding to help New Jersey, New York and Connecticut recover.
I said it in 2012 and I will say it again: whenever a crisis or natural disaster hits any part of the nation, elected representatives from across the nation need to come together in a bipartisan fashion to deliver much needed federal support. This is what America is all about  when one of us is in need, we step up to lend a helping hand.
My Appropriations Committee stands at the ready to provide any necessary funding for relief and recovery. We are awaiting requests from federal agencies now on the ground in Texas, and will not hesitate to take quick action once an official request is sent.
How to Help the People of Texas
The compassion and generosity of the American people is never more evident than during and after a disaster. It is individuals, non-profits, faith- and community-based organizations, private sector partners, and governmental agencies working together that will most effectively and efficiently help survivors cope with the impacts of Tropical Storm Harvey.
However, there exist a few important guidelines to be aware of as you strive to help Harvey survivors:
	•	The most effective way to support disaster survivors in their recovery is to donate money and time to trusted, reputable, voluntary or charitable organizations.
	•	Cash donations offer voluntary agencies and faith-based organizations the most flexibility to address urgently developing needs. With cash in hand, these organizations can obtain needed resources nearer to the disaster location. This inflow of cash also pumps money back into the local economy and helps local businesses recover faster.
	•	Please do not donate unsolicited goods such as used clothing, miscellaneous household items, medicine, or perishable foodstuffs at this time. When used personal items are donated, the helping agencies must redirect their staff away from providing direct services to survivors in order to sort, package, transport, warehouse, and distribute items that may not meet the needs of disaster survivors.
	•	Donate through a trusted organization.  At the national level, many voluntary-, faith- and community-based organizations are active in disasters, and are trusted ways to donate to disaster survivors. Individuals, corporations, and volunteers, can learn more about how to help on the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (NVOAD) website.
ICYMI: Arpaio Pardon
I believe the Presidential pardon of Joe Arpaio was a mistake. Law enforcement officials have a special responsibility to respect the rulings of the court and this action undermines the rule of law.
The Wall Street Journals August 27 editorial said it well.  Read it here.
Salute: Congratulations to the American Legions first female commander.  Denise Rohan is a 33-year Legionnaire and current member of Post 385 in Verona, Wisconsin.  An Army veteran, she has announced her theme for this year will be Family First, and that the theme is based on The American Legions motto of For God and Country.""  Read more about this pioneering Legionnaire here.
Salute: The American Worker
As we prepare to celebrate Labor Day 2017, we salute the men and women who make up the world's most dynamic workforce. Through good times and challenging times, America counts on the strength, energy and innovation of the world's finest labor force.

Latta with his mom, Rose Mary, on Mother's Day last year. Mom passed away last week.
 
Dear Friends,
It's with a heavy heart that I share that my Mom, Rose Mary Latta, passed away on August 23rd and is now with her Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
Mom graduated from Pandora High School in 1941, and during World War II she worked as a “Rosie the Riveter” at the Lima Tank Depot and later at the Bluffton Meter Works. She married my Dad, Delbert Latta, in 1948.
Mom was a steadfast campaign worker for Dad, stuffing, addressing, and stamping envelopes and helping in many other ways. Mom always had time for my sister, Rose Ellen, and me. She was an incredible pie baker, with what I considered the best, flakiest crust around!  I always told her she should enter the State Fair because she would win.
Mom was the center and the glue of the family and I will miss her.
Thank you to everyone that has reached out to our family with your kind words and memories of Mom. They have meant a lot to us.
Sincerely,
￼
Congressman Bob Latta 

Talking to Constituents in Ohio's 5th District 
I've been busy recently talking to people around Ohio's Fifth Congressional District. Here's some of what I've been up to.  Walked to End Alzheimers in Sauder Village.  Cybersecurity tour at Northwest State Community College.
I discussed the Internet of Things at a recent trip to Owens-Illinois.   Visited businesses in Findlay with Consul-General of Japan Mitsuhiro Wada.  Attended the Northwest Ohio Regional Economic Development Association Legislative Roundtable.  Toured businesses and spoke at Rotary in Hicksville.  Attended the Grand Opening of the Leipsic Community Center.  Presented a flag at the Change of Command ceremony for CDR Meghan Michael of NOSC Toledo.  Toured Defiance businesses and visited Defiance college.  I also traveled just past the border into Michigan to join Rep. Debbie Dingell at a new facility that is testing self-driving cars. While this location was in Michigan, self-driving car development, testing, and implementation will have a big impact in both of our states.
Working on Behalf of Small Biz, Veterans, and Protecting Lake Erie
Along with the meetings I mentioned in the column to the left, I've also been focused on our veterans, small businesses, and protecting Lake Erie.   Make sure to read my recent op-ed in the Toledo Blade about protecting our Great Lakes. We need to ensure that programs like the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and Ohio Sea Grant have the resources they need to protect Lake Erie. Our Great Lakes provide us with our drinking water, and they help drive the local economy through tourism and outdoor activities.  On the small business front, I recently met with small business leaders in Perrysburg and Archbold. Small businesses are the engines of our economy, creating three out of every four new jobs.   Members of the National Federation of Independent Businesses told me that regulations continue to stifle their ability to grow and the broken tax code is too complex and time consuming.   Both of these issues are ones that Congress has been working to fix, including passing 14 Congressional Review Acts which were signed into law. These bills kept burdensome regulations passed at the end of the Obama administration from taking effect.   Veterans issues have also been a priority of mine. The House has already passed legislation this year to make it easier for the VA to suspend or fire employees for misconduct or poor performance.   We also recently voted to extend the Veterans Choice program which allows veterans to see a doctor if there is a backlog at their local VA. I discussed these issues recently with my Veterans Advisory group. It's important that we keep the promises made to those that have served our country.

Fifth District Family Values Watch

Congressman Latta's monthly newsletter tracking life and family news from the Nation’s Capital
Thursday, August 31, 2017
During the August work period, I have had the opportunity to travel to neighborhoods and communities across the district to discuss issues that are most important to you and your families.  At a time when family values are often marginalized and the sanctity of life can be disregarded, I commend your vigilance in fighting for life and families.  When I return to Washington, D.C. next week, I want to assure you that I always keep the thoughts and views you have expressed to me in mind when I am engaged in the legislative process on Capitol Hill. 
Please feel free to forward this e-newsletter to share pro-life and pro-family news in your community.  It is my great honor to serve as your Member of Congress and it is my number one priority to represent you and the best interests of the Fifth Congressional District.  Please do not hesitate to call, write, or e-mail me in the future with any of your concerns or questions.  For federal-related issues, you may reach my Washington, D.C. office by phone at (202) 225-6405, or my District office at (800) 541-6446 for constituent services.  I also encourage you to visit my website at http://www.latta.house.gov.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN OHIO
You may recall that early last year, Governor Kasich signed into law a bill that defunds Planned Parenthood in the State of Ohio.  This would have eliminated $1.3 million in taxpayer funding from the abortion provider.  However, Planned Parenthood sued the state to block the law from being enforced.  The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio granted a permanent injunction, which prevented the state from stopping funds to Planned Parenthood.  State Attorney General Mike DeWine appealed the decision to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to argue that this law is constitutional and should be enforced.  On August 3rd, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals heard the case (Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio v. Lance Himes), but has not yet released an opinion.   
 PROTECTING CHILDREN WITH DOWN SYNDROME 
In last month’s newsletter, I explained that every year the House Appropriations Committee develops legislative proposals detailing the expenditures of the federal government for the upcoming fiscal year.  Many of these proposals included significant pro-life provisions, which I was very pleased to see.  The House of Representatives plans to vote on the appropriations proposals early next month.  Before we vote, Members have an opportunity to submit amendments to these proposals in an effort to make changes to the bill.  I have submitted and hope to offer an amendment that will prevent funds from being made available to any international organization that promotes or performs abortions with knowledge that the pregnant woman is seeking the abortion solely because the unborn child has been diagnosed with Down syndrome. 
This amendment is in response to the recent report from Iceland claiming to eradicate Down syndrome.  In reality, the country was not eliminating the disability but eliminating unborn children with the diagnosis.   It is very disheartening to know that these children were not even given a chance to live and to teach others of the value they could bring to families and society.

August 31, 2017
Dear Lindsey,
￼
          Youve seen those yellow buses around town and youve liked those first day of school photographs on Facebook and you knowsummer is over. But that doesnt mean theres nothing to look forward to anymore  in fact, there are all kinds of programs and activities Montanans now have in their sights.
          Friday night football games, school plays and concerts, art competitions and cross country meets  these are just a few of the community events that the school year provides.
         Our schools bring a lot to our communities, but nothing more important than education. I, myself, am a product of Montana Public Schools from kindergarten all the way through college at Montana State University and I cant stress enough the importance of doing your best and learning all you can. If youre a student, parent or teacher, take a moment to check out these resources that can help you start your school year off right.
          I am also working hard to ensure Montana schools have greater flexibility in allocating federal education funding to return the dollars where they belong: closer to the classroom. My legislation, the Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success (A-PLUS) Act, accomplishes this by increasing states ability to allocate federal education funding to best fit their students unique needs, frees states from burdensome federal regulations and better ensures academic achievement for our students.  
          As you settle into your school year routine, I hope youll stay in touch with me about the issues important to you.
          As always, I encourage you to contact my office to express your concerns or opinions on policy issues important to you. And if were not already connected on social media, I invite you to follow my daily updates on Facebook.
          Its my number one priority in Congress to represent the values and interests of the people of Montana, and your input is very helpful as I do. I also invite you to visit my website, www.daines.senate.gov, so we can stay in close touch.
Best Wishes,

8/31/17 15:50,Hurricane Harvey: How we can help,"￼
August 31, 2017 
Dear Friend:
As the flooding from Hurricane Harvey continues to devastate the Gulf Coast, please join me in keeping the people of Houston and the brave first responders helping them in your thoughts and prayers. While the destruction is devastating, I am confident that our great nation will pull together as one to help support the City of Houston and the surrounding areas.
I want to commend the many local firefighters and members of our military who are on the ground in Texas helping with relief efforts. I am also thankful for the American Red Cross volunteers from across Colorado who drove emergency response vehicles to Texas to help with evacuation procedures.
Listed below are various ways you can help the victims of this natural disaster.
Helping the Victims from Harvey
See this information from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, on how to help with relief efforts: 
	•	Contractors: http://www.fema.gov/about-industry-liaison-program or Google ""FEMA Industry"" 
	•	Group drivers/haulers: www.GSA.gov, 844-GSA-4111 (844-472-4111)
	•	FEMA local hire positions are being posted in www.USAJOBS.gov under Customer Representatives 
	•	Anyone wanting to be a FEMA reservist: https://careers.fema.gov/reservists-program 
 The American Red Cross in Texas has asked people to volunteer. The office announced on Friday that it would be training volunteers at their shelters through a ""fast-track"" course. 
Visit DisasterAssistance.gov for more ways to contribute to relief efforts.
Check the charity
Before you donate to a charity, make sure you know where your aid is going. Check with the Federal Trade Commission and the Internal Revenue Service to learn about scam charities.
Donate Blood
If you are interested in donating blood you can contact the following organizations: American Red Cross: 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767) Armed Services Blood Program: 703-681-5979

8/31/17 14:38,Putting students first,"News From Congresswoman Sewell Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window          Click here to open a plain text version of this email
￼
Dear Lindsey,
From pre-K to college, education opportunities in our district make the difference when it comes to our children being prepared to compete for jobs in the 21st century. But schools and programs in our district like Head Start and even some programs at our historically black colleges and universities are facing cuts. We can’t afford to sit back while our schools and students are at risk.   Help me make your voice heard in Washington. Tell me what your top education priorities are for Congress.   
 ￼  Rep. Terri Sewell tours Head Start center to explore education issues in rural Alabama
Defending Head Start  You might know that Early Head Start has provided educational jumpstarts to children ages 0 to 3 in parts of our congressional district and has expanded those services to the Choctaw, Dallas, Marengo, and Wilcox County service area. The language-rich activities that Early Head Start provides, such as reading, singing, and talking, are proven to lead to better life outcomes. The addition of Early Head Start in these rural Alabama counties is a big step forward.   Unfortunately, however, Head Start plans to close some centers serving 3-5 year olds in Choctaw, Dallas, Marengo, and Wilcox Counties. This means some families will need to drive more than 20 miles to the nearest facility for access to early childhood education. I’m a strong believer that all children, regardless of their zip code, deserve an education that gives them every chance at success. That’s why my office is working with the Office of Head Start, other Members of Congress, the state Pre-K office, and local groups to ensure that services will not be denied for eligible children and their families. 
Tell me how you壇 like to see our school systems improve.   The Tax Loophole That’s Draining Public Schools  If you have the money, you can cheat the system. Under today’s tax code, one loophole allows wealthy Americans to redirect public school dollars into their own pockets by double counting state and federal deductions for donations to private schools. Our struggling public schools are even more at risk due to a few people who want an extra tax break. That’s why I plan on introducing the Public Funds for Public Schools Act, a bill to close the tax shelters that are draining tax dollars out of public education. It’s a solution that could help save our schools from proponents of unaccountable private schools, and it’s thanks to input from teachers, students, and constituents like you that we we’re able to put this idea into legislation.   That痴 why I知 asking for your input. What is the number one education issue facing our communities?   Fighting for HBCUs  In the last six months, many HBCU’s across the country have lost Upward Bound funding grants targeted at providing low-income students with access to higher education. Here in Alabama for example, for the first time since the 1960s, Miles College will no longer have access to funding from Upward Bound. 
￼
  
HBCUs provide incredible opportunities to students who may otherwise go without a college education. In fact, nearly half of the nation's 105 HBCUs have a freshman class where three-quarters of the students are from low-income backgrounds. The longer HBCU’s go without Upward Bound funding, the more classes of graduating seniors will go without the opportunity to earn a college degree. That’s why I authored a letter signed by 42 other Members of Congress, urging Secretary Devos to clarify the reasons that these Colleges were denied Upward Bound grants.   Let me know what education issues you would like to see addressed next.   To stay up to date with my work on education, I encourage you to like my Facebook page or subscribe to my e-newsletter. Your input is important to my work on behalf of the 7th Congressional District, and if you have questions, I encourage to send feedback through my website.   I look forward to hearing from you, 
￼

News from Representative Lee Zeldin
￼
Dear Lindsey, 
￼
￼
￼
I hope you are enjoying your summer. This month, I toured NY-1’s businesses, large and small, to meet with employers and employees and discuss their top priorities to grow their businesses here on Long Island and create more good paying, private sector jobs. The NY-1 Economic Growth Tour was a great opportunity to talk with many of our area’s job creators and their workforce to discuss ways we can improve the business climate and allow local commerce to flourish. This included a visit to Cobham, Positive Promotions, Harbor Light Oyster Farm, and many more. We discussed STEM education, tax and regulatory reform, agricultural policy, and other important topics during these great visits. Click here, here, and here, to read more about several of these events.

I released several statements condemning the violence in Charlottesville. Anyone associating themselves with the KKK and Nazism is associating themselves with hatred, bigotry, racism, intolerance and a tremendously inhumane past filled with horrible evil. Click here and here, to read some of my statements on these events.   I released a statement following President Trump's recent speech where he outlined the United States' strategy in Afghanistan. For years, we have been trying not to lose in Afghanistan. Now is the time to win and END this never ending war altogether. To read my full statement, click here.
I also released a statement in response to the ISIS terrorist attack in Barcelona, Spain. Americans are united in prayer and resolve with all of the victims, their families, and the great people of Spain. Way too often, we are reminded that Islamic terrorists do not just pose a threat to the Middle East. Now more than ever, there must be a renewed focus on defeating these radical Islamic terrorists abroad, or we will face them more and more here at home. Click here to read my full statement.  I issued a statement regarding the unanimous passage of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2371 which places new sanctions on North Korea. The sanctions will target many of North Korea’s revenue streams and primary exports, such as coal, iron, and seafood, and is expected to reduce the nation’s roughly $3 billion total export revenue by more than a third. There are several other dynamics and elements of options to this complex issue, but it cannot be understated how significant the potential is for these new sanctions to apply enormous pressure on Kim Jong-Un to change his behavior. It is in his best interest and his nation’s best interest to do so. Read my full statement here.   In addition to the NY-1 Economic Growth Tour, I held many other excellent outreach efforts, such as Undercover Congressman, Lunch with Lee, and Mobile Office Hours. These efforts were great opportunities to connect with NY-1 constituents and groups and listen to their concerns. In the picture below, I am with one of the many constituents I surprised (as well as Brookhaven Town Supervisor Ed Romaine) at Leisure Village senior living community when I joined a Meals on Wheels route during “Undercover Congressman” to discuss the need to protect senior nutrition programs. Click here, here, and here, to read more about these events.
￼  Rep. Zeldin pictured above with a NY-1 constituent, discussing the importance of supporting Meals on Wheels 
I announced that the Eastport Fire District was awarded a $313,334 grant for communication equipment through FEMA's Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program. Funding from this regional grant will be used at the Eastport, East Moriches and Westhampton Beach fire districts. Our firefighters put their lives on the line everyday to protect our communities, and ensuring they have access to the best possible equipment must always be a top priority. Click here to read more.  I held a Hurricane Preparedness Seminar in Farmingville where representatives from FEMA, NOAA, American Red Cross and Suffolk County Fire Rescue and Emergency Services (FRES), provided information to help Long Islanders prepare for, stay safe during, and recover from hurricane storm systems. This year, forecasters predict an above-normal hurricane season in the Atlantic. As we are witnessing in Texas with Hurricane Harvey, it is vitally important to be as prepared as possible in the case of a hurricane or tropical storm. Click here, or the video below, to learn more about this event.
￼
I also announced that the Long Island Museum of American Art, History, and Carriages has been awarded $40,000 through the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) competitive grant program to support the museum’s “A World Before Cars” Gallery. It is paramount that we continue to support and fund our local historical sites, museums, and arts programs, and I am honored to do my part in Congress. Click here to read more.  I wrote an op-ed on honoring the memory and supporting the future for the Tesla Science Center. Built upon historic grounds in Shoreham by one of the most brilliant minds ever known, the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe is an inspirational museum on the verge of a rebirth that not only holds a rich history, but also great potential. I previously had the pleasure of visiting the Center to tour the facility and meet with its leaders to discuss the need to support STEM and the science community. Click here to read my full op-ed.  I visited the VA hospital in Northport to meet with D. Scott Guermonprez, the newly installed Director to welcome him and discuss ways to improve communication between the facility and public officials to ensure the best possible service for Long Island’s veterans. Click here to read more.
￼  Rep. Zeldin pictured above with Director Guermonprez, following their discussion about ways to improve the VA
I was all around the district meeting with constituents, including Mobile Office Hours at the Mastic Fire House and Smithtown Fire Department, where I was able to meet with many NY-1 constituents to discuss a wide range of issues, such as Social Security, veterans’ affairs, and health care. You can read more about these events here, and here.

August 31, 2017
Dear Friend,
Every year, I look forward to reconnecting with folks across the district and checking in to hear their thoughts and concerns during August when Congress is out of session. From discussing legislative issues with business owners, to visiting farms and meeting with constituents across the district at local events, my time spent at home always informs how I spend my time in DC and summer gives me a special chance to meet with folks from all over.
After a long spring and summer spent fighting to protect the Affordable Care Act, I was grateful to spend time in our district thanking folks for all their calls and thoughtful commentary supporting this law. In the days following the violent actions of white supremacists in Charlottesville, it became clear that our community could not rest and that we must stand up and be heard as we fight the hatred and racism that is dividing our nation.
Democrats nationwide were joined by many Republicans in denouncing the actions of white supremacists. However, President Trump took a different path in blaming both sides and arguing that there were very fine people among the neo-Nazis and white supremacists. He even pardoned a former sheriff who used his time in office to discriminate against Latinos, blatantly violating their constitutional rights and defying a court order.
I believe our country deserves leadership that sets the proper tone – even as we disagree on matters like health care, trade, wages, and job creation. It is my hope that upon serious reflection on the lessons of this August, we can come together in September to do our jobs in a way that brings people together.
Please continue to stay in touch and let me know what is on your mind as Congress resumes its work this fall.
Thank you, ￼  Mark Pocan
 
DC SPOTLIGHT
September Showdown
When Congress returns from recess in September, the debate will turn to the budget and the threat of a government shutdown, the fight to raise the debt ceiling, and funding relief for the response to Hurricane Harvey. Unfortunately, President Trump continues to threaten a government shutdown if he doesn’t get funding for his border wall, which he once promised would be paid for by Mexico, not the American taxpayer. Over the coming month, I will urge Republicans to work with Democrats to find a solution to the budget and fight for working Americans, not a costly and misguided wall. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I will be active in the fight to ensure middle class priorities and Wisconsin values are reflected in our federal spending decisions. 
Tax Reform
President Trump and Republicans in Congress continue to claim that they will turn to tax reform as their next legislative goal, but with a full plate in September, any action on tax reform will likely be delayed. The American people deserve an open and transparent process on tax reform, not more backroom, secret deals like we saw with the Republican health care bill. There is no reason to rush a tax reform proposal through Congress and we must make sure that any proposal does not include one penny in tax cuts for the top one percent.
AROUND THE DISTRICT
 ￼
In Dane County, I toured the Henry Vilas Zoo with County Executive Joe Parisi and met with Berit the polar bear.
 ￼  In Green County, employees of Orchid Monroe gave me a tour of the facility, where I learned the history of the company and met with workers who manufacture metal components.
￼
In Rock County, Visit Beloit hosted a ‘Lunch and Learn’ where I spoke with fellow small business owners, as well as leaders from the private, educational, health care, and government sectors, and the Ho-Chunk Nation.

Many Texans lost everything in Hurricane Harvey, but thanks to the generosity of their fellow Texans, they have not lost hope. 
Dear Friend,
The images of the destruction wrought by Hurricane Harvey are heart-wrenching. Our Texas coast neighbors have lost so much  homes, possessions, and for some, family members and friends.
Thanks to the generosity of so many, though, the one thing they have not lost is hope.
The big-heartedness of Texans has been on full display in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. All across the state, people have given their time and resources to help those affected by the storm. 
Even as the waters begin to subside, volunteers and donations continue to pour into Houston and neighboring communities from across Texas to assist with rescue efforts and to shelter wet and weary evacuees.
North Texas has sent first responders, equipment, and other aid. Individuals and businesses alike have donated equipment, money, and time to the response effort.
The City of Fort Worth has prepared five public buildings to serve as shelters with the capacity to serve thousands of evacuees from Houston and other affected areas.
The entire Texas National Guard has been mobilized to assist with search and rescue, and recovery efforts in the aftermath of the storm. About 12,000 guardsmen are conducting search-and-rescue missions from Corpus Christi to Houston.
In the wake of the hurricane, the good people of Texas have shown the world the values that make our country so special. The outpouring of generosity, kindness, volunteerism, and heroism on display this week reflects the very best of America.
Donations of clothes, diapers, water, non-perishable foods and other essentials are badly needed. If you can donate, make sure to do so to a reputable organization. 
Sincerely,
￼

Dear Friend,
Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone impacted by the catastrophic flooding impacting our area. We are working tirelessly with our federal, state and local partners to ensure the needs of our constituents are met.  It is very important that folks apply for disaster assistance online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov. In addition to the disaster website, you can file a claim by downloading the FEMA app on your phone at https://www.fema.gov/mobile-app. You may also file a claim by calling 1-800-621-FEMA (3362). However, please know that a phone claim may take longer as FEMA's phone lines are overwhelmed.  We encourage all residents across the 36th Congressional District affected by Harvey to file a claim with FEMA. This does not guarantee assistance, but it will help you pursue any claim and it serves to ensure that your county qualifies for any FEMA assistance that may be available in the future. Even if your community has not yet been declared a disaster area, you can and should file with FEMA.  We have also put together the following webpage with helpful information and resources on Harvey, including details on shelters, disaster assistance, emergency contacts and much more: https://babin.house.gov/harvey/.  If our staff may assist you in any way, please call us at any of the following numbers as we stand ready to assist:  Deer Park: 832-780-0966 Orange: 409-883-8075 Woodville: 844-303-8934 Washington, DC: 202-225-1555  Please do not hesitate to let us know how we can be helpful to you. 
God bless,

Friend,

The United States accounts for about 1/4 of the estimated number of drug-related deaths worldwide, including overdose deaths. Overdose deaths in the U.S. more than tripled during the period of 1999-2015, from 16,849 to 52,404.

The U.S. averages 120 drug overdose deaths per day.

Today is International Overdose Awareness Day. The opioid epidemic is taking the lives of too many Americans in communities all across the country. We all know someone who has been affected -- this is a crisis that spans urban and rural communities, socioeconomic divides, and state borders.

The federal government needs to better empower state and local governments to address this crisis. That's why the House of Representatives delivered a $781 million increase in resources to the local and state level for fighting the opioid epidemic -- including grants, treatment and prevention, and support for law enforcement.

In the fight against the opioid epidemic, we're all in this together.

Yours in service,
￼

8/31/17 11:08,Beyond resistance: Strengthening disaster preparedness and mitigation,"Update | Thursday, August 31, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 34th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: strengthening disaster preparedness and mitigation.
The scenes of Hurricane Harvey’s destruction in Houston and across Texas are heartbreaking, and the damage is severe. And in our own backyard, wildfires – a normal, natural occurrence made worse by climate disruption – are ablaze across Oregon, forcing people to evacuate their homes and impacting air quality across the state.
Natural disasters like these, unfortunately, are only increasing in frequency and severity due to climate disruption. As we continue to provide much-needed resources to rebuild these communities, the federal government should also be a better partner in helping communities plan for and mitigate these events. Whether for wildfires, flooding, or earthquakes, advanced planning and investing in resilience is critical to withstanding disasters, saving lives, and recovering more quickly.
	•	American infrastructure is already falling apart, which is why disaster readiness must be a priority. I support the BUILD Resilience Act of 2017, legislation that would establish a grant program to help communities invest in resilient infrastructure and prepare for natural disasters. Additionally, now more than ever, we need to protect and strengthen the federal standards for resiliency that we already have in place.
	•	We need to continue providing resources for response and relief after a disaster, but we must also invest in prevention and mitigation. Not only will this approach help keep people out of harm’s way, it can save money—$1 spent on mitigation can prevent $4 on future disaster relief costs. My Repeatedly Flooded Communities Act, for example, would proactively reduce flood risk by focusing federal investment on prevention and mitigation. 
	•	Wildfires are becoming more destructive due to climate disruption, sprawling development that has pushed people into forested areas, and changing forestry practices. However, while most of the floodplains in the United States are already developed, most of the wildland urban interface in the 11 Western states is not. This gives us an opportunity to ensure that the development that does take place is safe. And for help in the short term, I support the Wildfire Prevention Act of 2017, legislation that would provide hazard mitigation assistance in areas affected by wildfire, and the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act of 2017, which would fix the way we budget for wildfire suppression and prevent the devastating practice of “fire borrowing.”  
	•	On the West Coast and in my district, seismic preparedness is a chief concern. We must continue to fund institutions like the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), which does critical research regarding natural disasters through the Earthquake Hazards Program. This program provides funds to transition the Earthquake Early Warning Demonstration Project into a regional network on the West Coast, ensuring that communities have a brief window of time to prepare for an incoming earthquake. Early alerts will save lives, giving people the crucial time to take cover, trigger automated systems to slow down trains and manage the power grid, generators can turn on, and everyone can be better prepared. 
Congress has a responsibility to ensure that all communities are ready for these natural hazards, now and in the future. It should advance these efforts. 
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

8/31/17 10:36,Out and About in Maryland,"￼
 Dear Friend, 
During the August district work period, I've been fortunate enough to travel across Maryland to meet with citizens and community leaders, and to visit local organizations and businesses. Hearing from people like you about important issues in Maryland and across the country helps me do a better job as your representative in Washington. 
Below are some quick highlights. 
￼ 
National Night Out gave me the opportunity to visit several communities.  
￼
 I stopped by the Cheswolde Neighborhood Association's (CNA) National Night Out event to greet constituents in Baltimore and discuss my support for first responders. In the photo above, I'm with Baltimore Police Department Commissioner Kevin Davis, City Councilman Isaac Yitzy Schleifer and Nate Willner of CNA.  
￼
 Halethorpe's National Night Out was hosted by the Halethorpe Civic League and the Halethorpe Improvement Association. During the event (pictured above), I provided certificates to several community leaders who have made a tremendous impact on Halethorpe. They included: 
	•	Paul Tharp - Business Community Leadership Award
	•	Pete Kriscumas - Government Community Leadership Award
	•	Michael McAuliffe - Community Leadership Award
	•	Officer James J. Sanders - Law and First Responders Community Leadership Award  
￼ 
 I enjoyed celebrating Hillandale Citizens Association's National Night Out in Silver Spring (pictured above), where I met with constituents and discussed many important local and national policy issues.  
￼
 East County Regional Center's National Night Out in Silver Spring (pictured above) gave me the opportunity to have some great conversations about local and national policy issues with folks from the community, board members from the East County Citizens Association and members of the Burtonsville Fire Dept., among many other representatives from local community groups and organizations.  
￼
 I swung by the Olney Chamber of Commerce's National Night Out (pictured above) at the Fair Hills shopping center in Olney and joined a number of local government officials. I really enjoyed speaking with Olney residents and meeting members of the Sandy Spring Volunteer Fire Department to discuss my work in Washington on behalf of Maryland's Third Congressional District.  
￼ 
Our district also boasts many strong community and business associations that bring residents together through their good works.  
￼
 I had the opportunity to meet with several board members from the Howard County Citizens Association. We discussed a variety of topics, including health care and escalating drug costs, aging, affordable housing and airplane noise.  

￼
 I stopped by the annual Glen Burnie Carnival, hosted by the Glen Burnie Improvement Association (GBIA), to meet with Glen Burnie residents and hear from my constituents about a wide array of issues before Congress. In the above photo, I am pictured with GBIA President, Barbara Moeller.  
￼
 I participated in the Howard County Chamber of Commerce's legislative meet and greet with more than 100 small business leaders. During the event (pictured above), I spoke with many local business leaders about policies that can help spur economic growth in Howard County and across Maryland.  
￼
 I met with Raj Kudchadkar (pictured above left), CEO of the Central Maryland Chamber in Anne Arundel County, to discuss the Chamber's new mission, talk about how local businesses are doing in the region, and highlight some ways in which the federal government can assist with some of the key projects planned in the Odenton area. During the meeting, I also met with Michele Waits (pictured above right), a former Chamber Board member and Director of Marketing at A.J. Properties.   
￼ 
My tour drove home once again how many key regional assets are serving residents of our district. 
￼
 I visited Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital (pictured above) -- a post-acute-care facility that serves children with special medical and rehabilitative needs -- to see firsthand the many programs and services that the hospital provides to children in Baltimore. A majority of Mt. Washington's patients come from financially disadvantaged families. Our tour was hosted by Dr. Richard Katz, the hospital's chief medical officer, Jill Feinberg, the hospital's vice president of development and external affairs, and Clark Lare, who serves as a board member on the hospital's foundation. During the visit, we discussed several areas of health care policy that impact residents in Maryland's Third Congressional District.  
￼ 
 Marylanders are rightly proud of the Dundalk and Seagirt Marine Terminals of the Port of Baltimore. In the above photo, I am standing in front of the Ports America Chesapeake's high-efficiency cranes at the Seagirt Marine Terminal where I learned about how these cranes help make the Port of Baltimore a critical economic driver in the region.  
￼
 I had an incredible time at the Food and Drug Administration & United States Air Force Student/Mentor Salute to Science Symposium, where I met with student interns from Maryland and from around the country to discuss their groundbreaking research at FDA and Air Force research facilities throughout the year.  
￼
 I met with folks from the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and had the opportunity to tour its office in Baltimore. We discussed efforts to provide affordable and high-quality immigration services and citizenship assistance to refugees in Baltimore and across Maryland.  
￼
 I met with Towson University President Kim E. to discuss the institution's academic programming and its plans to expand workforce development in critical STEM disciplines such as cyber-security, forensic chemistry and environmental science -- and to discuss how Congress can help. By providing students with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed in the twenty-first century workforce, and by better connecting students with STEM-focused careers, we can help strengthen our economy and create good-paying jobs.  

￼
 Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh and I joined city homeowners who were among the 31 residents to receive rooftop solar panel installations on their homes as part of a new public-private partnership in our city. During the event, Mayor Pugh and I highlighted how this innovative program helps underserved Baltimoreans lower their energy bills and reduce their carbon footprints. We also discussed how this program provides hands-on job training for Baltimore residents seeking employment in the solar industry -- one of the fastest-growing industries in America.

8/31/17 10:17,Speaking out for Nevada families,"  
￼

Hello Lindsey,  As your Congressman, I have an obligation to speak up when things aren't right and get to work on solutions that will improve the lives of hardworking Nevadans. Last week, I joined members of our community in speaking out on two important issues, addressing Nevada’s doctor shortages and the expiration of Temporary Protected Status for immigrant families. 
ADDRESSING NEVADA’S DOCTOR SHORTAGE
Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Nevada’s health care system has improved and thousands are now covered throughout our state.   However, Nevada's doctor-patient ratio still lags behind the rest of the country. In 2016, there were 201 physicians per 100,000 Nevadans, while the national average is 251 per 100,000. All 17 counties were designated Health Professional Shortage Areas.  Too often, hard working Nevadans are getting left behind, especially when it comes to getting reliable and affordable health coverage.   The lack of doctors in Nevada has made it difficult to navigate the state's health care system, and many Nevadans can't find the timely care they need, ultimately relying on the ER for medical treatment.   Can you imagine having to wait for 3 to 6 months for your child to see a pediatrician? No one should have to wait weeks or months for care that could save their lives.   That’s why Congresswoman Jacky Rosen and I are both proud co-sponsors of the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act of 2017. This bill would help expand the number of residency slots for doctors so that Nevadans no longer get left behind when it comes to getting care.  Recent investments like UNLV's medical school will help train new doctors and strengthen Nevada’s medical community. I look forward to working with community stakeholders as we work on new, innovative solutions to help Nevadans finally get the care they deserve.

LAS VEGAS NOW: Nevada struggling with doctor shortage 
THE NEVADA INDEPENDENT: Legislation to address physician shortage finds bipartisan support from Nevada's congressional delegation  SPEAKING OUT ON THE EXPIRATION OF TEMPORARY PROTECTIVE STATUS
I came together with my brothers and sisters at the Culinary Union to call on the Administration to extend Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 2,800 Nevadans.  
￼
For me, this issue hits close to home. My family is an immigrant family. We came to this country when I was eight years old searching for a better life. I know that when we give immigrants an opportunity, they succeed helping strengthen our country. 
TPS allows us to keep hope alive for immigrants seeking relief from violence and oppression in their home countries. But this is only a temporary solution. What we truly need is bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform, and I am committed to coming together with my colleagues to make it happen.

Washington, D.C.– Congressman Thomas Massie has received The New American’s Constitution Award for a perfect score on the publication’s 2017 Freedom Index.   Every year, The New American editorial board rates members of Congress on key votes that reflect constitutional principles of freedom.

“It is an honor to be recognized by The New American for a 100% Constitutional voting record for the first half of the 115th Congress,"" said Congressman Thomas Massie. ""I am also honored to be joined by Congressman Walter Jones (R-NC) and Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), both of whom also received a perfect score. This is an important rating because of its focus on Constitutional principles.""

Some of the votes that were scored for the Freedom Index include supporting the reinstatement of some veterans Second Amendment rights, opposing the House's ObamacareLite bill, and opposing the omnibus bill that added to our national debt- which is nearing $20 trillion.

Filing a Claim at DisasterAssistance.Gov 
 


Dear Neighbor,
I just finished a conference call with the Administration, FEMA, DHS, House Leadership, the Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and the Houston-Galveston Congressional delegation. When Congress returns next week, the first step that we will take is to put together an emergency appropriations bill to help with the most urgent, short-term needs of people who have lost their homes and property and suffered so much as a result of this terrible storm.
I am emailing you today because it is vitally important that FEMA have an accurate count of how many people have suffered property damage or lost their homes and been displaced by this storm. Therefore, I urge you to log onto disasterassistance.gov as soon as you are able. The website is self-explanatory and will walk you through the various forms of federal assistance that are available depending on the type of property damage you have suffered. I stressed to the White House that this will probably be the largest housing disaster in the history of the country. I urge you to log onto disasterassistance.gov or call  FEMA at 1-800-621-3362 as soon as you are able. 
I will be playing a leading role in ensuring this emergency appropriations bill passes as quickly as possible and that everyone injured by this storm can begin to get help as quickly as possible. For the long term, there will be a second emergency appropriations bill put together this fall, and I will be working hard to ensure that Harris County and Southeast Texas get the funding we need to repair our flood control system. I will also be pushing for funding to build additional flood control protection, such as the Ike Dike and an additional levee at the headwaters of Cypress Creek.
In the meantime, I am continuing to stay in touch with first responders and Harris County Flood Control District to make sure that any evacuations are handled efficiently and that people of District 7 are notified promptly of any expected changes in water levels.
Your safety and security is my highest priority, and my prayers are with everyone who has suffered from this terrible storm.
Sincerely,  ￼  John Culberson

Aloha,
I really appreciated hearing from you at our town halls over the past few months, including last week's meeting on Maui.  I am encouraged by all of you who have attended a town hall, written to me, or called our office to share what is important to you.
I enjoyed being a part of the formal dedication ceremony for the Heeia National Estuarine Research Reserve.  NOAA and the community partners have already shown how much can be done by working together, and I look forward to seeing what else they can accomplish.
The application deadline for our high school internship program is coming up on Sunday, September 10.  Each year, I look forward to the new ideas and perspectives that our high school interns bring to the office.  I encourage any high school seniors who want to make a difference in their community to apply.
As always, please contact my office in D.C. or Hawai‘i if there is anything we can do. We are here to help.
Mahalo,

Brian Schatz United States Senator



Hearing from Maui
Last week, Senator Schatz hosted a town hall meeting on Maui to hear from residents and answer questions.  If you could not attend an in-person town hall, comments or questions for Senator Schatz are always accepted via our website or by phone.
￼

Recognizing Heeia NERR
Senator Schatz spoke at the dedication ceremony for the Heeia National Estuarine Research Reserve in Kaneohe.  Headed by the University of Hawai‘i Institute for Marine Biology, the Heeia site uses both western science and Native Hawaiian cultural and traditional practices to study the Kaneohe Bay estuary.  As the first ever National Estuarine Research Reserve site in Hawai‘i, Heeia fills an important gap in representing the biogeographic diversity of our country.  
￼
Earlier this year, Senator Schatz announced that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will award $3,247,000 to coastal management programs in Hawai‘i, including those at the Heeia National Estuarine Research Reserve.

Hello from Arizona’s Fifth Congressional District – 
It is hard to believe that next week, Congress will be back in session and working on our agenda for the American people. As we frequently noted last month, we have a lot on our plate, including tax reform, health care reform, appropriations, and the debt limit.
I’ve had a great time in Arizona this month, talking with thousands of constituents across our district. We’ve been able to use the month away from Washington, D.C. to come to a better understanding of the issues facing this district, and I have much to take back to Capitol Hill to share with my colleagues.
CALLING ALL VETERANS
If you are a veteran in Arizona’s Fifth Congressional District, my staff hopes to see you at the Congressional Veterans Benefits Awareness Fair – TOMORROW in Mesa. See the graphic below for more details.
Please RSVP to Lee in my District Office at lee.huff@mail.house.gov to confirm your attendance. 
   ￼
As Congress works to ensure that the promises our nation made to her veterans are kept, it is important to highlight the successes we’ve had in that mission:
	•	This Summer, Congress passed the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017. I was pleased to vote in favor of this historic bill, which sends a strong message to our honored veterans that Congress is looking after their interests. This law will help ensure that employees at all levels of the Department of Veterans Administration will not be allowed to provide below-average care to American veterans. Our veterans have long paid the price of this severe incompetence; Congress will not look the other way. 
	•	My office recently announced new office hours at the Southeast Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care Clinic in Gilbert. These hours will allow expanded service and outreach to veterans who reside in the East Valley. Our district staff will be on site every first and third Wednesday of each month in Room 1120 from 2:00 to 4:00 PM. 
	•	In January, I led a letter with Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema and the rest of the Arizona Congressional delegation to urge VA Secretary Shulkin to grant exemptions under the federal hiring freeze to ensure necessary medical staff and other key positions at the Phoenix VA were not left vacant. In response to the letter, the VA thankfully announced that the freeze would not affect the Phoenix VA from hiring additional medical staff.
FRIDAYS ARE FOR FREEDOM
Shedding Light on Unconstitutional Federal Regulations
Each week, I take a look at an unconstitutional federal regulation and let you know how I am working to overturn it. Be sure to visit my website each Friday – under the “Freedom Fridays” tab – to read through my thoughts for the past couple months.
 FOR THE GOOD OF THE ORDER

Dear Lindsey,
          On July 18th the Senate confirmed Patrick Shanahan to be Deputy Secretary of Defense. He received 92 bi-partisan votes on the floor. His nomination was passed out of the Armed Services Committee by unanimous voice vote. And yet, he was subject to a cloture vote, a procedural hurdle that provides more time for debate.
          Why did Democrats subject Shanahans nomination to a cloture vote? They didnt use the extra debate time to discuss the nominee's qualifications, and he had already passed out of a bipartisan committee by unanimous voice vote. Unfortunately, it would seem they were just trying to gum up the works of staffing President Trumps Administration.
          At the end of July during President Obamas first year in office, the Senate had confirmed 58% of the Presidents nominees.  At the end of July during President George W. Bushs first year in office, the Senate had confirmed 59% of the Presidents nominees. But for President Trump, at the end of July  the Senate had confirmed just 20% of the Presidents nominees. At that pace, the Trump Administrations Executive Branch wont be fully staffed for 11 years.
          At the beginning of August, the Democrats finally approved a number of President Trumps nominations, but more work needs to be done. Any President, regardless of political affiliation, needs his Executive Branch staffed so that he can work on behalf of the American people as best as possible. And the U.S. Constitution gives a role to the Senate in confirming these nominations.
          Democrats and Republicans alike are subject to the U.S. Constitution  and it is my hope that the Democrats long-awaited approval of nominations at the beginning of the month is a sign that they are eager to finish staffing the Presidents Administration and move on to the issues Montanans elected us to work on, issues like tax reform and infrastructure investment.
          As always, I encourage you to contact my office to express your concerns or opinions on policy issues important to you. And if were not already connected on social media, I invite you to follow my daily updates on Facebook.
          Its my number one priority in Congress to represent the values and interests of the people of Montana, and your input is very helpful as I do. I also invite you to visit my website, www.daines.senate.gov, so we can stay in close touch.
Best Wishes,

Dear Lindsey,
          I have bad news. Defying decency and commonsense, in the middle of Montanas fire season, several radical environmentalist groups hope to stop Montanas efforts to lessen the threat of wildfire in northwestern Montana.
          These groups have given 60-Day Notice of Intent to Sue under the Endangered Species Act, to block the community-developed Beaver Creek Project in the Flathead National Forest. These radicals are more concerned with ideology than our safety and they used the Ninth Circuits terrible Cottonwood decision as their justification to block the Beaver Creek Project.
          So what is this Cottonwood decision? In 2015, an activist court invented a new standard that makes harvesting timber in our national forests that much more difficult. Already, one project area is now impacted by wildfire that would have been treated had it not been for the Cottonwood decision. Four other projects are stopped in their tracks and likely more could be impacted if these radicals get their way.
          I have introduced legislation that would statutorily reverse the Cottonwood ruling and remove this unnecessary burden and I will work hard to see it signed into law.
          The Beaver Creek Project and others should move forward  the threat of wildfire is real and Montanans know better than radical environmentalists how to care for our forests and mitigate the threat of wildfires. They need to step back now.
Tell me what you think:
Do you believe radical environmentalists are using activist judges to stop responsible forest management? 
Yes
No

Update from   Congressman Peter DeFazio 
Here's an update of what I'm working on both in Oregon and in Washington: 
Town Hall Meetings Across Southwest Oregon 
￼ 
This August, I had a great trip through my district, holding town hall meetings in Roseburg, Eugene, Springfield, Oakridge, Albany, Corvallis, Bandon, Coos Bay, and Florence. I spoke with hundreds of seniors, students, veterans, and other constituents about the latest activity in Congress. Our democracy depends on citizen engagement. It was inspiring to see so many people in our communities getting involved in the democratic process.    
Not all town hall meetings have been as civil and productive as mine, but Members of Congress have an obligation to engage with their constituents even when those conversations are difficult.    
At my town hall meetings, I addressed important issues on the minds of constituents in Southwest Oregon. I discussed Republican attempts to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act, which would leave millions of Americans without health care in order to give high-income earners thousands of dollars in tax cuts. I also discussed my agreement with President Trump that NAFTA should be renegotiated and include my Workers Bill of Rights, which would ensure strong environmental and labor protections are included and eliminate the ability of foreign investors to sue the federal government. Additionally, I talked about my work in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to pass a comprehensive infrastructure bill that will create thousands of good paying jobs, and my efforts to prohibit the privatization of the air traffic control system.

￼ 
Recently I visited the Edward C. Allworth Oregon Veterans' Home in Lebanon (OVHL), where I had the honor of visiting veterans recuperating in the facility's rehabilitation wing. I also presented an American flag that was flown over the U.S. Capitol. This flag will fly over the OVHL on Veterans Day in November of this year.  
After attending the Home's opening in September 2014, it was a pleasure to see veterans receiving top quality care. Through the combined efforts of Linn County residents and the Oregon Department of Veterans' Affairs (ODVA), the Home was opened almost one year ahead of schedule. This 154-bed facility provides state-of-the-art modern health care amenities to veterans in need of skilled nursing care, as well as short-term rehabilitative aid to veterans so that they can return home after hospitalization.  
The facility is designed as an intentional community, creating a neighborhood environment that offers residents traditional living arrangements and routines, provides autonomy and a sense of community, and improves quality of life. The OVHL is a prime example of the care that we owe to the men and women who have sacrificed so much in service to our country.  
I take a back seat to no one when it comes to promoting programs that support veterans. Taking care of our military personnel and their families is an obligation of the federal government, not an option. As I have done throughout my time in Congress, you can count on me to continue my efforts to provide our veterans the benefits, resources, and privileges they have earned. 

Johnson Crushers International (Eugene) 
￼ 
I also toured Johnson Crushers International (JCI) in Eugene, where I participated in the I Make America advocacy program of the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM). The AEM seeks to highlight the equipment manufacturing industry's positive impact on the U.S. economy and job market.  
Equipment manufacturing companies like JCI support 1.3 million jobs throughout the U.S. and contribute $159 billion to the U.S. economy. In Oregon alone, the equipment manufacturing industry supports 13,000 jobs and contributes $2 billion to our state.  
JCI was founded in 1995 and supports 245 jobs in the Eugene/Springfield area. JCI invents, designs, manufactures, sells, and provides aftermarket parts and service support for the aggregates and mining industry. It is also supportive of career and technical education programs and works with local school districts to provide tours.  
Companies like JCI are an integral part of our local economy in Southwest Oregon. I will continue to support trade and economic policies to keep manufacturing industries in America.  

Will President Trump ""Implode"" Obamacare? 
In light of the Senate Republicans' recent failure to take health care away from millions of Americans, several constituents from across Southwest Oregon have contacted me with their concerns about the possibility that President Trump could dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA) using his executive powers.  
Unfortunately, President Trump could end the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) cost-sharing reduction payments, stop enforcing the individual mandate, and stop promotion and outreach for the ACA. All of these could destabilize the market. 
Paying for Cost-sharing Reductions (CSRs): Every month, the federal government provides funding to insurance companies to reimburse them for keeping deductibles and co-payments down for low-income people. President Trump has threatened to stop these payments. If he does, many insurers would either raise premiums to cover the higher costs or even pull out of the market entirely. I recently signed onto a letter to Trump urging him to continue the CSR payments, which provide over six million Americans access to affordable health care. I am also a cosponsor of legislation to make Congress responsible for these payments, rather than the Executive branch. 
Enforcing the Individual Mandate: President Trump has threatened to loosen enforcement of the mandate which requires individuals have health coverage or pay a penalty. Failure to enforce the individual mandate makes it much more likely that younger, healthier individuals will drop coverage, resulting in higher costs for older and sicker Americans. I have proposed and supported bipartisan fixes to the individual mandate, which I have argued in the past goes too far. But the fact of the matter is without a suitable replacement, failing to enforce the mandate will drive up costs for those who need coverage the most. 
Outreach for the ACA: The last sign-up period for the ACA ended eleven days after President Trump’s inauguration. During those eleven days, the administration stopped information and outreach that would have encouraged people to sign up for health insurance. The administration could do this again during open enrollment this fall. Without education and outreach efforts, the number of Americans who learn about the ACA and sign up for coverage would likely decrease, leading to higher prices for those that keep their coverage. While the sickest patients will likely sign up regardless, the market relies on healthier patients to ensure that costs remain affordable.  
While all these possibilities are of serious concern, Congress can take steps to mitigate the president’s actions. As your representative, you can be sure that I'll keep fighting any attempts to destabilize the marketplace and cause uncertainty for Oregon families.  

North Korea's Nuclear Aggression 
Under the leadership of Kim Jong-un, North Korea has aggressively increased its pursuit of sophisticated nuclear weaponry. Recent reports revealed that North Korea is much closer than was once believed to producing a nuclear warhead that could potentially reach the U.S. mainland, as well as other U.S. territories and military installations around the globe. In response, President Trump threatened North Korea with ""fire and fury like the world has never seen.""  
The issue of foreign policy with North Korea is one of the most complicated questions that this administration and previous administrations have faced. The U.S. should be pursuing all diplomatic approaches available to bring North Korea to the negotiating table, not threatening the country with a pre-emptive strike and total annihilation, which would ultimately provoke the unstable regime into starting a war with far-reaching global consequences. In fact, North Korea recently issued a statement in response to President Trump’s comments, saying that “sound dialogue is not possible with such a guy bereft of reason and only absolute force can work on him.”  
These recent developments only underscore the need for Congress to reassert its constitutional authority over war powers. As a co-equal branch of the federal government, the U.S. Constitution grants Congress, not the executive branch, the power to declare war. However, over time Congress has allowed the executive branch ever-expanding authority to initiate military action.  
I have always been vocal against executive overreach under both Democratic and Republican administrations. During my entire tenure in Congress, I have introduced legislation to defend the constitutional division of powers between Congress and the president as they apply to the use of U.S. military force. This Congress, I introduced H.J.Res. 75, the War Powers Amendments of 2017, to strengthen the War Powers Resolution. My legislation would make clear that before the president undertakes any offensive military action, prior authorization from Congress is required. I am also a cosponsor of H.R. 669, the Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act, which would prohibit the president from conducting a first-use nuclear strike unless a declaration of war is issued by Congress. 
While there is no easy approach to dealing with North Korea’s evolving nuclear capabilities, it is in the best interests of our national security to deescalate military engagement with such an unpredictable regime.

￼
 

August 30, 2017
 
Dear Friends,  In communities across America, drug abuse is a serious problem that ruins lives and tears families apart.
Not only is it important that we collaborate as a community on the best way to confront drug abuse, it's also critical that we support our law enforcement officials who take on this scourge head-on.
One such instance took place this spring: after a three-year investigation conducted by local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies, 19 individuals have pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute meth in central Wisconsin. During that period, the individuals involved distributed 127 pounds of meth, at a value of $5.7 million.
This is real-deal police work, and it saved lives. I recently honored the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office for their work in this investigation.
Click HERE or the image below to watch the video of the ceremony. Remember to ""like"" and ""SHARE"" on Facebook!
￼
Also of note, the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office worked hand-in-glove with several other agencies, including: Wisconsin Department of Justice, Division of Criminal Investigation; the Wausau office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Marathon County Sheriff's Office Special Investigations Unit; the Wausau Police Department, and IRS Criminal Investigation.

 Drug Enforcement Roundtable
Another important way to address the drug crisis- whether it's meth, heroin, or opioids, is to have an open discussion as a community. It's truly encouraging that we can come together to confront this issue directly. That's why I was proud to host a Drug Enforcement Roundtable where we had a great collaboration with Lt. Governor Rebecca Kleefisch, Attorney General Brad Schimel, as well as first responders from around the district.

Friend,

The intensity and devastation of Hurricane Harvey has broken records -- on Tuesday afternoon, it was recorded that, since the beginning of the storm, 51.88 inches of rain had fallen in parts of Houston. Harvey is also breaking hearts, homes, and families -- the death toll has reached 30 and hundreds of thousands of people are under evacuation orders and in shelters. The devastation has been unimaginable. 

But in true American spirit, people from across the country are providing help and support for those in need, including right here in Ohio's Second District. Today, the Chillicothe Gazette highlighted the many individuals and local organizations who are stepping up to offer assistance to Texas this week in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.

Yours in service,

Earlier this year, I voted to repeal and replace Obamacare with a patient-centered approach designed to lower premiums. I was disappointed that the Senate couldn't advance our goal, but I remain committed to relieving the American people of Obamacare's burdensome costs and regulations.

As you may know, I am working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help American families get access to affordable, quality care. Therefore, I want to hear from you about your health insurance.

Since Obamacare was enacted in 2010, has the cost of your health care increased, decreased, or stayed the same?

ICYMI >> Upton in Detroit News: FDA user fees support medicine and Michigan jobs 



ICYMI: FDA user fees support medicine and Michigan jobs By U.S. Rep. Fred Upton August 25, 2017 Detroit News
Every five years, Congress must reauthorize the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) user fee programs for generic drugs, prescription drugs, biosimilar biological products, and medical devices. These programs are critical to patients, drug and device manufacturers, and the millions of Americans who work hard every single day to deliver new treatments and cures. At its core, reauthorization and updates to the FDA user fee programs will enable U.S. manufacturers to get their breakthrough products to market faster all while maintaining the highest levels of patient safety.
And in some good news that you may not have heard about: Congress came together to overwhelmingly pass legislation that would do just that and last Friday President Trump signed our bill into law. 
The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 is a bipartisan bill that updates and reauthorizes these critical user fee programs. Specifically, it will make common-sense reforms to the FDA such as facilitating the availability of over-the-counter hearing aids, enhancing generic drug competition to help lower prices, and improving fee structures to help small businesses thrive and grow. Without swift enactment of this legislation, the FDA would be forced to start laying off up to 70 percent of their employees that approve drugs and devices. That would have a devastating impact not only on local pharmaceutical firms but to patients and consumers who may be forced to needlessly suffer without the availability of potentially life-saving new drugs or devices.
Beyond the public health benefits, this legislation is critical to thousands of jobs, particularly here in Michigan. We are home to medical device maker Stryker Corp., the generic drug maker side at Perrigo Co., Pfizer Inc’s largest manufacturing site, and dozens of smaller biotech and manufacturing firms. In recent months, I’ve visited with workers and leaders at these innovative companies, including Pfizer, which recently announced a multi-million dollar expansion in Michigan that will bring in more than $2 billion in economic activity annually and 5,680 jobs to our state. Folks at these firms have told me it is vital for this legislation to move forward to protect these local jobs as well as patients who will benefit from the new therapies the FDA helps get to market. 
I have a long record of supporting medical innovation, research, the development of new drugs and devices and, of course, good-paying local jobs right here at home. Now that our groundbreaking, bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act is law, reauthorizing these FDA user fee programs is an important next step to ensuring these jobs stay here in Michigan and patients across the country benefit from improved, life-saving therapies. I was proud to champion this legislation and was pleased to see such strong bipartisan support for it in the U.S. House of Representatives and in the U.S. Senate.
Workers, job creators, and patients here in Michigan and across the country depend on this legislation. We just delivered.

Traveling Across the Volunteer State to Hear From Tennesseans
Last week, Senator Corker continued his travels across the Volunteer State to hear from Tennesseans and share his perspective on how to address the major challenges facing our nation.
 ￼
August 22, 2017 - Senator Corker participated in a roundtable discussion hosted by the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce at the Mars Petcare headquarters in Franklin. 
￼
August 22, 2017 - After the roundtable discussion, Senator Corker toured Mars Petcare, which employs 1,000 Tennesseans. 
￼
August 22, 2017 - Senator Corker visited the Middle Tennessee Chapter of the Military Officers Association of America to update members about the work he is doing on their behalf in Washington.

August 24, 2017 - Senator Corker enjoyed hearing what Tennesseans care about most at a meet and greet hosted by the Robertson County Chamber of Commerce.
Welcoming LG Electronics to Tennessee
On Thursday, Senator Corker was in Clarksville with Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Representative Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development Commissioner Bob Rolfe at a groundbreaking ceremony for LG Electronics' new home appliance manufacturing facility, which is expected to bring at least 600 full-time jobs to Montgomery County. 
I know there is nothing more important to local officials, nothing more important to any of us, than heads of households having good-paying jobs, and today, because of what this announcement means, 600 people in this community are going to have a good-paying job, said Corker.

Supporting the Direction President Trump Laid Out for the U.S. Role in Afghanistan
Last week, Senator Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, released the following statement after President Donald J. Trumps address to the nation on the way forward in Afghanistan.
I had the opportunity to talk with Secretary Tillerson in advance of the president's address, and while I look forward to receiving additional details, I support the direction President Trump laid out for the U.S. role in Afghanistan, said Corker. While there are certainly substantial questions about whether Afghanistan has the capacity over time to provide stable governance to its people, this more focused plan provides the U.S. military with the flexibility it needs to help the Afghan military regain momentum. It also utilizes a conditions-based approach for our military, which should lead to better diplomatic outcomes, and ensures engagement with regional partners, especially Pakistan and India, giving us a better opportunity for success.
Applauding the Trump Administration's Sanctions on Venezuela
On Friday, Senator Corker released the following statement after the Trump administration announced financial sanctions on Venezuela.
These carefully calibrated sanctions send a strong signal to the Maduro regime while still allowing for much needed humanitarian assistance, said Corker. As I said when I visited the country in 2015, Venezuela is a country with great unrealized potential and its people deserve far better than the current state of affairs, which was brought on by gross economic mismanagement that has inflicted shortages, hyperinflation and unemployment on ordinary Venezuelans. I appreciated the detailed briefing I received from Vice President Pence and applaud the Trump administration for standing with the Venezuelan people. I look forward to working with them to examine additional policy options in the near future.

Dear Lindsey,
Here in the Badger State, we have a proud history of making things. It’s what we do and we do it well.
But in order to drive stronger economic growth, we must do more to build our Made in Wisconsin manufacturing economy. 
That is why I introduced new tax reform legislation to provide tax relief for manufacturers so they can invest in innovation and create jobs.
My 21st Century Manufacturing Act will change the current Research & Development tax credit to make it more accessible for small and medium businesses, especially manufacturers. This tax reform will also promote the adoption of “connected manufacturing” technology through a new investment tax credit for manufacturers.
Specifically, my 21st Century Manufacturing Act will:
	•	Increase the alternative simplified credit from 14 percent to 20 percent
	•	Allow firms to use cost reduction and creating new uses for their products to count as qualified research expenditures
	•	Allow firms to count managers of research products as qualified research expenditures
	•	Allow companies to deduct ten percent from expenditures on ‘connected manufacturing equipment’
To learn more about how my 21st Century Manufacturing Act will help support Wisconsin manufacturers, or to share your thoughts regarding tax reforms that promote investments in research and development, please feel free to reach out to my office.
In the meantime, I look forward to keeping in touch with you as my 21st Century Manufacturing Act progresses in the Senate. 
Sincerely,
￼
U.S. Senator for Wisconsin

Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 33rd day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: putting an end to gun violence.
From Roseburg, OR to Sandy Hook, CT and Orlando, FL, we have seen too many horrible acts of violence happen across the country. Gun violence in the United States is not inevitable, nor should Americans accept it as the status quo. We need to address this issue for what it is: a public health crisis that threatens the well-being and peace of mind of communities across the country.
It’s past time we take action. There are commonsense steps we can and should take to keep our communities safe, including:
	•	Keeping guns from the most dangerous users by closing the “private sale loophole” and implementing comprehensive and uniform background checks;
	•	Having law enforcement follow up with each person who fails the background check;
	•	Restricting assault weapons and high capacity magazines that are unsafe in any public space;
	•	Removing barriers to research on gun violence to allow us to fully understand the impact and implications of current policies;
	•	Making sure guns are tested and regulated to ensure consistency and that they operate as intended;
	•	Empowering health care professionals to discuss all matters that affect their patients’ health, including gun ownership;
	•	Ensuring better regulation for gun dealers and focusing compliance on the few unscrupulous gun dealers;
	•	Enforcing existing gun laws by not letting the gun lobby undermine enforcement agencies;
	•	Requiring that people purchasing a gun have liability insurance;
	•	Improving our mental health system to make it more accessible and available and enhancing our capacity to help individuals with mental illness; and
	•	Providing resources for first responders, schools, and public facilities personnel to deal with active-shooter situations.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage,

Courier of Montgomery County: Brady meets with Trump, lobbies for federal disaster declaration

￼ August 30, 2017 - In Case You Missed It

By John Marshall

Homeowners across Montgomery County who lost their homes or suffered other financial losses from the floodwaters caused by Tropical Storm Harvey – but did not carry flood insurance – appear to be close to getting some welcome financial help from the federal government.

U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-The Woodlands, told The Courier Tuesday evening that after a late afternoon meeting with President Donald Trump and Gov. Greg Abbott in Austin, both are supporting his request for a federal disaster declaration for Montgomery County, which was left off initial declarations.

Disaster assistance may include grants to help pay for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, uninsured and underinsured personal property losses and medical, dental and funeral expenses caused by the disaster, along with other serious disaster-related expenses, according to a Federal Emergency Management Agency FAQ.

If approved almost immediately, as expected, residents of Montgomery, San Jacinto, Grimes and Walker counties would be able to sign up for what Brady described as ""relief and recovery."" Officials were working out the details late Tuesday, with final approval of the additional funding expected within days or less.

""We're very close,"" Brady said.

Brady, speaking to The Courier by cell phone as he drove back to The Woodlands, said once the declaration is approved, people could sign up immediately.

""I'm confident we will far exceed FEMA's (previous) declaration,"" Brady said of the expected financial help.

Once the declaration is approved, people who have lost their homes or suffered other financial losses could go online to seek financial assistance. Under the plan there would be ""immediate relief"" for people who need help in finding a place to live and other expenses , while there would also be financial assistance for people who had no flood insurance, or were not completely covered by flood insurance.

The news will no doubt come as welcome relief for the scores of people across the county who have lost their homes, or had them severely damaged, by the floodwaters caused by Tropical Storm Harvey.

The damage from the historic rainfall levels – measured in feet, not inches – has been widespread throughout the region, as well as locally, with Conroe's McDade Estates and the River Plantation area seeing some of the worst destruction in the county.

County Judge Craig Doyal initiated this important process late last week when he declared the county a disaster and urged Abbott to do the same prior to Hurricane Harvey striking the coast in anticipation of the damage expected in the area. Abbott, who initially left Montgomery County off the initial list of 30 counties, added Montgomery County along with 19 others over the weekend. The governor has since added a few more.

In response to Abbott's initial declaration, President Trump issued a disaster declaration for Texas a few days ago that has included a handful of counties.

According to Darren Hess, Montgomery County Office of Emergency Management coordinator, around 800 homes not carrying flood insurance would need to be damaged to get the federal disaster, and he believes the county will easily exceed that considering the massive flooding in areas that have not taken on water before.

Doyal has been very proactive in getting Montgomery County on the funding map after natural disasters, including the major storms and flooding in May 2015, April and May 2016.

Dear Friend,
As we continue to feel the effects of Harvey, water levels are still high and many homes are still in jeopardy. The recovery process has just begun and the dangers do not end when the water recedes. Sadly in times of crisis, scammers try to take advantage of folks in order to make a quick profit at the expense of those simply trying to pick up the pieces. It is important to remain vigilant so that scammers do not cause more damage. 
Here are a few tips to protect yourself from scams.
	•	Federal workers do not solicit or accept money. Government officials will never ask you for money in exchange for information. 
	•	Safeguard personal information: Do not give personal information such as Social Security and bank account numbers unless you initiate the call.
	•	Ask for an official laminated ID. A FEMA shirt or jacket is not absolute proof of identity.
	•	If you need temporary housing while you recover, be cautious of rental scams. Many times scammers advertise nonexistent rentals in order to trick people into sending them money.
	•	Be skeptical of people promising immediate clean-up and debris removal. They may demand up-front payment for work they never do, quote outrageous prices, or even lack the skills, licenses or insurance needed to legally do this work.
	•	Beware of people going door-to-door. People going door-to-door to damaged homes, or phoning homeowners claiming to be building contractors could be scam artists, especially if they solicit financial information.
The physical danger is not yet over, please be sure to listen to the direction of local emergency officials and evacuate if ordered to do so. If you are not under evacuation, please stay off the roads unless it’s an absolute emergency.  Our county offices also have important local emergency management information if you need it. Here are links to TX-22 county emergency information - Fort Bend County,  Brazoria County, and Harris County. 
I’m honored to represent you in Congress. For more information on constituent services, current legislation or to sign up for my E-newsletter, please visit my website, www.olson.house.gov. 
Very respectfully, Pete Olson

From the Hill to the Mountains
Celebrating Labor Day in the Mountain State
Our great nation was built on the backs of a strong, diverse and dedicated workforce. It is only fitting that, every year on Labor Day, we acknowledge the social, civic and economic contributions of our working men and women. Labor Day was first celebrated in 1882 when work was hard to find, and those who did find work struggled to receive fair compensation, safe working conditions and fair work hours.
Since that time, we have come a long way as a state and as a nation on behalf of our workforce and working families, but there is always more to achieve. The best way to invest in the future of our state and nation is to invest in our current workforce and in our youth, and to provide opportunities for all who want to work to do so with success and in the best environments we can provide. We must continue to instill a strong work ethic in our youth, and inspire them to excel, to pursue the higher education or training needed to land good jobs, and to keep their talents within our beautiful state. 
There is nothing more honorable or rewarding than working hard to provide for your loved ones. As your former Governor and now as your United States Senator, I am continuing to do my part to ensure our workforce has safe conditions, good wages and opportunities to create a strong future right here in the Mountain State. 
While I continue fighting for new jobs and opportunities in West Virginia, I join each of you this holiday weekend in thanking the hardworking men and women who make a difference in our state every day. Our West Virginia workforce keeps the lights on, educates our children, improves our economy and keeps our communities safe and healthy and all of that is certainly something to be proud of. 
Happy Labor Day, West Virginia. Thank you for all your hard work.
 
NEW JOBS IN WV
Jobs Announcement at the Tech Park in South Charleston
I was excited to join N3, an international technology and marketing company, on Monday at the West Virginia Regional Technology Park to announce the addition of approximately 300 new jobs in the Charleston area. When I was Governor and we were fighting to save the tech park, we knew that making it a success wouldn’t be easy. No major economic development project ever is. That’s why the announcement by N3 is so significant for the park, the Kanawha Valley, and our entire state. Welcome to West Virginia, N3!

West Virginia Spotlight
Route 10 in Logan
On August 23, my Regional Coordinator, Mike Browning, attended the ribbon cutting for the road project that connects Logan County communities with a four-lane highway.  After 20 years of planning, we can celebrate safer, more convenient access to this beautiful area of the Mountain State.

How May We Help You?
I truly appreciate the opportunity to hear from West Virginians. As your U.S. Senator, I am proud to be your voice with government agencies during your time of need. My goal is to provide top-notch customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me, or who may need help.  I have a team of caseworkers in each of my four offices to help you with matters of concern. While I have no direct jurisdiction in the administrative matters of any federal, state, or local agency, I welcome the opportunity to assist you with whatever problem you may be experiencing and ask that full consideration be given to your case.
Recently my office was able to help Dianne Hughes from Beckley, West Virginia.  Dianne contacted our office for assistance with the IRS.  Due to a technicality under the Affordable Care Act, she was penalized for her insurance premiums once she obtained other insurance coverage.  Amber McCartney, caseworker, in my Charleston office was able to work with the IRS on her behalf for a favorable outcome.  If you need help with the IRS, VA, Social Security, Black Lung benefits, or recognition, please contact my office or click here to email me.

 Responding to Charlottesville

Dear Friend, 
In the wake of the tragedy in Charlottesville, and what I feel was the President’s troubling and wrong response, I wanted to write to you to speak about our path forward in these challenging times.  As your Representative in Congress, I have spent the past several months fighting back against these divisive and harmful ideas.  
Like many, I have been deeply disturbed by the President’s policies that I feel attack and demean  minorities, immigrants and others who have historically been discriminated against. Seven months into his Presidency, the President's policies in my opinion have continuously appealed to our nation’s worst instincts and prejudices. I wish that these type of comments were something new, but for anyone following our political discourse these days, they are sadly not. His recent statements regarding the events in Charlottesville, in my opinion, have only added more fuel to the fire and are simply unacceptable for the President of the United States of America. 
In my opinion, his statements give solace not to those who have been historically oppressed, but to those who stand in support of white supremacy and racism.  This type of rethoric appears solely to promote fear over hope, hate over love, and division over unity.  It is not an agenda that I support, and it is one that is deeply hurtful to the people of the Bronx, New York City, and our nation. I am also worried that his statements will mean that our federal guardians of fairness, like the Department of Justice, will be less inclined to fight against hate, bigotry, and extremism.  We have seen troubling actions taken by the Department of Justice to undermine affirmative action and civil rights even before his comments in response to the Charlottesville tragedy.
As the Ranking Democrat of the Appropriations Subcommittee with oversight responsibility for the budget of the Department of Justice, I am keeping a close watch on that agency’s work and commitment to protecting those who have traditionally been discriminated against.  I am fighting to make sure that the Department of Justice has the resources to protect civil rights, fight back against hate, and continue the progress made under President Obama in making our country a fairer, better place.  It is an uphill battle, but one that is important and necessary for the Bronx. When Congress returns after Labor Day, we will be debating these, and many other issues, on the floor during consideration of a funding bill for the full federal government.  I hope that, in the wake of Charlottesville, Republicans and Democrats alike take time to recommit ourselves to the fundamental issues of fairness, tolerance, and justice in our nation.  The appropriations bill that we will be considering is a good place to start. 
I believe the President has lost the trust of many Americans. When we come back from recess next week, I am ready to continue fighting against efforts to undo all that we have achieved over the past 50 years.
 Sincerely, 
 
José E. Serrano

Dear Lindsey,
Yesterday’s missile launch over Japan is an unfortunate reminder that tensions with North Korea are not deescalating. Just last week, I was on an official visit to China, South Korea, and Japan where my colleagues and I saw firsthand the threat North Korea poses both to the region and the world.  We met with foreign leaders and U.S. representatives across these countries to discuss how cooperation between our nations can help bring Kim Jong-Un’s regime to the negotiating table with the aim of denuclearization.
Earlier today, I spoke on 97.1 and Fox 2 News about my trip. Follow the links below to listen to and watch my interviews. 
 ￼
 ￼
The first stop of the trip was in Hawaii where we met with members of the U.S. Navy to discuss our military readiness in the region and to tour the World War II Valor In The Pacific National Monument at Pearl Harbor. It was an awe-inspiring reminder of the courageous service members who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom. 
Both in Korea and Japan, I was briefed on American Pacific operations by top American military leaders including U.S. PACOM Commander Admiral Harry Harris, U.S. Forces Korea Commander General Vincent Brooks, and U.S. Forces Japan Commander Lieutenant General Jerry Martinez. These leaders are in charge of the approximately 78,500 U.S. military personnel stationed across both countries and play a fundamental role in maintaining these critical U.S. security alliances. 
 ￼
 ￼
We were also able to meet with senior government officials including South Korean President Moon Jae-in, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, and senior officials at the Japanese Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Defense. These leaders are committed to a peaceful resolution on the peninsula and to ensuring successful implementation of new sanctions against the Kim regime.
Our delegation had the unique privilege of visiting both the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and Dandong, China, a city overlooking the North Korean city of Sinuiji across the Yalu River on the North Korea border. The difference between these borders was stark.
 ￼
 ￼
The DMZ is a sober reminder that North Korea’s conventional weapons targeted against Seoul could destroy the city, its citizens, and U.S. personnel and their families in a quick afternoon. But Dandong is a bustling trading hub where China exports and imports goods across the Yalu River that fuel Kim’s weapons programs. Some estimates show that China accounts for over 90% of North Korean trade. It’s imperative that the United States work with governments across the world, particularly China, to increase economic pressure on North Korea and cut off the regime’s access to oil, forcing them to the negotiating table.
This trip was essential in increasing the diplomatic cooperation between our nations, strengthening our national security, and promoting trade in the region. This was a unique experience that will help me better represent you on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. However, I’m glad to be back home in Ballwin and look forward to meeting with many of you before Congress is back in session after Labor Day. 
Sincerely, ￼  Ann Wagner Member of Congress

Houston braces for more rain as death toll increases  Remnants of Harvey – recently downgraded to a tropical storm – continue to pummel southeast Texas for the fourth straight day. The confirmed death toll has risen to 10. Forecasters warn that more rain is expected in the coming days, suggesting that catastrophic flooding will continue and likely spread to neighboring states. It’s unknown exactly how many people are missing, how many have been evacuated and how many remain trapped in their homes.   +If you are interested in helping, the Nashville Scene has a guide on how to aid our southern neighbors. 
￼
North Korea launches missile toward Japan  President Trump today said “all options are on the table” after North Korea fired yet another missile this week. This time the intermediate-range ballistic missile flew over the Japanese mainland before landing in the Pacific Ocean. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the act “an unprecedented, grave and serious threat.” 
￼
Trump pardons controversial Arizona Sheriff President Trump late Friday night pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Arizona’s Maricopa County. Best known nationally for promoting the Obama “birther” conspiracy, Arpaio was convicted of contempt of court in connection with defying a federal court’s order to stop racially profiling Latinos in his state.   +Arpaio’s tenure as sheriff was notorious for his use of discriminatory and inhumane practices, including illegally profiling Latinos based on their perceived immigration status and depriving inmates of food, healthcare and sanitary rooms.     +Condemning the pardon, Jim noted: “The president continues to divide – not unite – our nation and abuse the power of the office.”
Attorney General restores program for local police departments In a speech to the Fraternal Order of Police in Nashville on Monday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions highlighted President Trump’s intention to sign an executive order giving leftover military equipment to local police departments. The Obama administration put restrictions on this 1990s-era program that originally aimed to give older, surplus military supplies to local police departments to help communities fight drugs. The program has grown, allowing law enforcement agencies to expand their efforts to fight crime while saving taxpayer dollars. But the equipment has recently been criticized as an unnecessary use of force.
￼
Emails: Trump associate hyped potential Russian ties News reports Sunday and Monday indicate that one of President Trump’s associates felt he could persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to say “great things” about Trump’s business acumen as a way to bolster the Republican’s political credibility.  In a November 2015 email sent to Trump’s personal lawyer, the associate said any Putin praise could help lead to a Trump White House victory “and we can engineer it.” The associate added that he could get Putin’s “team to buy in on this.” That email and others recently were turned over to the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating possible connections between Trump and Russia.

I kicked off the week at Malmstrom Air Force Base to meet with the men and women safeguarding our nation’s most powerful weapons. I assured them that as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I’m fighting to modernize our fleet of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles and support Malmstrom in every way I can. After my tour, I grabbed lunch with Great Falls Chamber of Commerce members and local business owners to discuss how we can work together to bring good-paying jobs to Cascade County.
 
 
 
 

 
￼
I had quite a day in the Magic City! It began with a visit to the Billings Interagency Dispatch Center, where they have been coordinating a robust response to area wildfires. I then stopped by the Billings Airport before making a quick trip to thank the local firefighters who put their lives on the line to keep people and property safe. I ended my day at the new Billings Public Library to present an American flag that had been flown over the U.S. Capitol.
 

 
 
 
 
 
￼
On Thursday I headed to Bozeman to hear from folks in Montana’s tech sector about the issues affecting businesses across the industry and what we can do to keep attracting cutting-edge innovators who create high-paying jobs. The folks I talked with said that these companies are looking for places with a lower cost of living than traditional tech hubs like Silicon Valley, and they like Big Sky Country specifically because of our public lands and outdoor way of life. But, we must invest in infrastructure and education to really make Montana the next big center of tech in the west.
 
 
 
 
 
￼
After harvesting wheat over the weekend in Big Sandy, I had the honor of hosting VA Secretary David Shulkin in Helena. As Ranking Member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee I’ve worked closely with Secretary Shulkin to get five bipartisan veterans bills signed into law this year by President Trump. So, I wanted him to hear from folks on the ground about how we can get even more done for veterans throughout Montana. Once the Secretary’s visit ended I headed to Florence for a briefing on the Lolo Peak Fire, where I discussed the urgent need to fix how we fund the fight against wildfires. I ended the evening in Polson, where Congressman Gianforte and I had dinner with Housing Secretary Ben Carson and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes.
 
 
 
 
 
￼
On Tuesday, we broke ground on the new Glacier Rail Park, which will create jobs and help revitalize downtown Kalispell. This project is being funded with help from a grant that I proudly secured for the city. I then headed to Columbia Falls, where we held our first ever Last Best Outdoors Fest, a celebration of the jobs and businesses that make up Montana’s outdoor economy. Between the bands, the beer and the big name speakers I think our 1200+ guests had a pretty good time—I know I did!

Dear Friend-
Earlier this week President Trump announced the United States’ renewed commitment to our operations in Afghanistan.
The Administration’s new strategy:
	•	Ends the era of giving the enemy our timeline to withdraw troops
	•	Shifts the focus of our presence in Afghanistan to national security instead of nation building
	•	Strengthens our partnership with India to promote stability and common values in the region
	•	Changes the status quo of relations with Pakistan to prevent safe havens for terrorists
	•	Cost effectively integrates diplomatic, economic, and military forces to work towards peace
President Trump’s strategy lets conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables and micromanagement from Washington, determine military decisions, ensuring our troops have all the resources needed to protect our nation and defeating terrorists.
I believe the Administration’s new vision will set our troops up for success, protect vital U.S. interests in the area, and ensure Afghanistan does not serve as a haven for terrorism.
I want to know what you think. Please take a moment to respond to the short survey below.
Which part of this strategy do you feel will do the most to protect US interests in the region and keep Americans safe?
Ending arbitrary deadlines to withdraw troops Strengthening our partnership with India Changing approach to Pakistan relations Commitment to a stable and secure Afghanistan to protect our nation’s interests All of the above None of the above I don’t know  I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with me. Your opinion helps shape my thinking as I represent you in Washington.  Sincerely,  Rob

Public Lands Are for All of Us 

As you might recall, former President Obama unilaterally designated two monuments in our area despite significant local opposition, doing so through misuse of the Antiquities Act. The creation of a Mojave Trails monument has been debated for some time, and a local consensus was reached on its boundary. Still, after colluding with special interest groups and performing a single fly-over in an airplane, Obama created a much larger monument and did so without a public meeting or public comment. He created another monument, Castle Mountains, out of thin air by that same abusive process.
You might also have heard attack ads against me and President Trump, implying that we seek to destroy these monuments. (They neglect to mention that I support fully a third monument, Sand to Snow.) If you’re skeptical of their message, you should be. It’s a complete lie on multiple levels. My position on Mojave Trails has never changed: The President should abide by the bipartisan boundaries established in my desert bill and Senator Feinstein’s desert bill. My position on Castle Mountains has never changed: no monument should be created without public input.
Anyone or any entity supporting Obama’s abuse of the Antiquities Act is supporting the dirty closed-door politics that Washington, D.C. has given us for too long. We shouldn’t accept the absurd notion that a single politician should determine the fate of your livelihood, community, and region without your input — that somehow he knows best. Furthermore, opposing Obama’s abuse of the Antiquities Act does not mean opposition to protecting public lands.
I support smart conservation, with monuments created through a thorough public vetting process. That’s why I introduced desert legislation in 2015 (HR 3668) and again in 2017 (HR 857), because we deserve a sensible approach to conservation that includes input from Congress and the public. While drafting these bills, I’ve worked with countless stakeholders — including the aforementioned environmental groups and other environmental groups with better integrity — to ensure that land protections meet the demands of local economies, recreationalists, and conservationists. This resulted in significant support locally.
The county of Inyo and cities of Apple Valley, Banning, Barstow, Big Bear Lake, Hesperia, Twentynine Palms, and Yucca Valley endorsed my proposal because it protected public access to Mojave Trails. I even mailed a survey to tens of thousands of households in my district to see if a monument or a less restrictive designation was preferred for Mojave Trails. A plurality of the 2,500 survey responses supported a less restrictive designation (47% to 44%).
Instead of protecting the 965,000 acres of Mojave Trails as addressed in Feinstein’s legislation and my own, Obama drew a staggering 1.6 million-acre boundary. To make matters worse, Obama created the Castle Mountains National Monument to stop a mining project that environmental extremists have long despised. In fact, the actual Castle Mountains — an interesting topographical feature — could have been protected without drawing the boundary so large as to prevent the mining operation. In both cases, Obama used the Antiquities Act to circumvent public scrutiny.
That’s why President Trump asked Department of the Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to issue recommendations on modifying Mojave Trails and Castle Mountains national monuments. It’s ironic that these extreme environmental groups and their Congressional advocates claim there was a “backroom” deal between Trump and mining companies in determining the fate of these monuments — ironic because a backroom deal occurred between these environmental groups and Obama in creating the monuments. I believe a Freedom of Information Act request would prove my statement true, because some members of these same groups insinuated such collusion in speaking to my staff. Moreover, Zinke’s review allowed for public comment; Obama’s actions did not.
No one side should have free reign in the discussion of public land use, but we haven’t seen a balanced approach in decades. Had Obama and his special-interest supporters chosen good public process in determining these monuments, the Trump administration would not be reviewing their misdeeds. Obama threw 553.5 million acres of public land into national monuments, nearly twice as much as all previous presidents combined. We should never assume one person in government, given that much power, has acted properly in every case. No presidential action is above review.  This op-ed was published in the Victor Valley Daily Press, click here for the full editorial

Dear fellow South Carolinians,

Thank you for subscribing to my weekly e-newsletter, and please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. 

Hurricane Harvey 
My thoughts and prayers remain with Houston, southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana this morning. Disasters like Hurricane Harvey cause so much damage, not just to possessions but psychologically as well. Know that we are all here for you.We have seen so many acts of heroism and bravery over the weekend into today. I want to thank all the first responders, emergency officials and neighbors from across the country for their efforts!

Solution Sundays  We can disagree without being disagreeable. Love must defeat hate. Anger, frustration and seclusion will not help us get to the root of the problem. Instead, let us remember the strength of unity and reach out to one another. Last summer, Senator James Lankford and I started the “Solution Sundays” initiative, encouraging people who look different or come from different backgrounds to get together for simply a conversation over a meal.
The goal is to help folks break down walls so that we can understand each other better and move towards uniting our country. We hope everyone will join us in breaking down walls and building trust in our communities. You can read more about Solution Sundays here.

Around the State  Last week, I traveled around South Carolina to meet with two different groups and communities. On Tuesday, I was at the Mary Ford Child and Family Development Center in North Charleston to learn more about their Head Start and Early Head Start programs. I had the opportunity to speak with local education and community leaders about the success of these programs, and even got to spend time with some of the youngest students. On Friday, it was an honor to speak at the Greenville County Republican Women’s Club lunch, where I was able to engage in conversation with many wonderful South Carolinians.

Sincerely,

Dear Friend,
Last week, I published an op-ed in The Atlantic entitled, Progressive Values Cant Be Just Secular Values.
I believe that religion shouldnt be a partisan, dividing issue. In fact, at the greatest moments of American progress, our faith has helped pull us together.
I hope youll take a few minutes to read it and let me know what you think.
 
The Atlantic: Progressive Values Cant Be Just Secular Values
By Chris Coons
For a generation, the Democratic Party of which Im a member has steadily moved away from communities of faith. Today, according to a recent Pew study, more than one-third of Democratsincluding 44 percent of self-described liberal Democratsthink churches and religious organizations actually have a negative impact on the United States.
But the beliefs of those liberal Democrats dont reflect the views of most American voters. The fact of the matter is this: The vast majority of Americansincluding the majority of Democratsare people of faith. According to a recent Pew study, for example, nearly 80 percent of Americans identify with a religious faith. Two-thirds of them pray every day.
Thats why if progressives are to achieve our goals, we have to open our hearts and minds to our allies in the faith community. Doing so wont just advance our shared policy goalsit might also help heal a nation deeply divided along political lines.
Like many Americans, Im a progressive Democrat and a Christian. Thats why I know that progressive values arent just secular values. We can get to some of our most important public-policy priorities through both secular and scriptural routes.
To read the full column, click here.
 
Thanks for subscribing to my newsletter  and please keep in touch to let me know how I can help your family and your community. Id love to hear from you. I hope youll send me an email or give my office a call.
Sincerely, 
￼

If you are like me, your heart is broken for the victims of Hurricane Harvey and their loved ones. I remember vividly touring the destruction left by Tropical Storm Isabel in my district in 2003 and how our community pulled together to help each other in our time of need. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the federal level to provide relief to those in Harvey's path as soon as possible.  
I am also very proud of the Marylanders who have headed to Texas to assist. The Red Cross’ Greater Chesapeake Region has sent more than 100 volunteers to help set up shelters so far. Two Baltimore County paramedics and two firefighters have been deployed. About 30 members of an urban search-and-rescue team based in Montgomery County are on the ground. And the Maryland National Guard is on stand-by should they be requested.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has issued guidelines for those who want to help. The most effective way to contribute to the relief effort is to send cash to trusted organizations because it is efficient, flexible to use and requires no packaging or transportation.  Organizations on the ground know what they need most and can often buy in bulk, stretching your donation further.  Finally, let this be a reminder to us all that natural disasters can strike at any time. Make sure your family has a plan in place for both sheltering and evacuation. Determine how you will contact one another and reconnect if separated. Make sure your insurance is up-to-date and that important documents, precious photos and valuables are stored safely. The Department of Homeland Security offers some valuable tips and tools here.

Mobilizing Efforts 
Dear Friends,

Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone facing unprecedented flooding following the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. Our first responders and emergency personnel are fully engaged in their rescue operations, and I appreciate their amazing work as rain continues to fall throughout the week. If you’re interested in volunteering to help with disaster relief efforts, please visit: http://www.redcross.org/volunteer/volunteer-opportunities.

On the Ground
Heading into the final week of the August district work period, I look forward to meeting many of you around the community, attending a ribbon cutting ceremony in Winder, hosting a “Coffee with Your Congressman” event in Taliaferro County, and speaking with students in Greensboro – just to name a few.

There was a great crowd at my “Coffee with Your Congressman” event in Lincoln County on Thursday, and I want to thank each of you for sharing your thoughts and concerns with me. I value your feedback and appreciated all of your outstanding questions. Without a doubt, the residents in the 10th District are remarkable, and it is truly an honor to serve each and every one of you.

Afterwards, I participated in a dedication ceremony for “The Foundations of American Law and Government Display,” which includes nine framed documents that have played a significant role in the development of the legal and governmental system of the United States. 

With the help of Lincoln County Commission Chairman Walker Norman and a board member of Ten Commandments Georgia, Lynda Brown, the collection is now prominently showcased at the Lincoln County Courthouse. I was grateful to offer a prayer of blessing and thank both Ms. Brown for spearheading the local initiative and the county for approving this important display.

Then, I joined the Georgia Childcare Association at the Little Geniuses Daycare in Thomson for a tour of its facility, which offers a warm and caring environment and provides age-appropriate programs that enhance children's emotional, social, and cognitive development. While at the school, I read to a class of preschoolers and discussed new fingerprint rules and requirements with its staff. It is safe to say that “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie” is a favorite among the young learners. Thanks for having me! 
￼
￼

At lunchtime, I attended the Thomson Rotary Club’s monthly meeting for a discussion about the pace of the Congressional calendar, Service Academy nominations, and how we have secured $8.5 million in benefits, grants, and scholarships to the district this year in constituent services, while fielding questions from Rotarians. During my remarks, I also acknowledged the outstanding achievement of Will Johnson, an alum of Briarwood Academy and one of my nominees who received an Academy appointment last year. Will graduated from Cadet basic training at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) on August 8th!

Serving approximately 630 students, the teachers have incorporated creative techniques taught at the famed Ron Clark Academy in Atlanta into their classrooms, including bringing in local artists to help paint their classroom walls. 
￼
￼

They also have an outstanding garden, where students plant and harvest their own produce. Just last year, Georgia’s Department of Agriculture, Public Health, Education and Georgia Organics honored Warren County Schools with the bronze level “Golden Radish Award” for their farm to table program. Thanks for giving me a glimpse of “The Warren County Way!”
￼

Next, I made my way to Old Hudson Plantation in Sparta for a site visit. Old Hudson is a family-owned, modern shooting club that offers Skeet, Trap, 5-stand, and a newly added 14-station Sporting Clays course in Hancock County. As an avid outdoorsman and staunch defender of the 2nd Amendment, I thoroughly enjoyed touring the venue. 

Additionally, Old Hudson is one of the Georgia’s most successful game hatcheries, producing quail and pheasant chicks and guided hunts for the same birds between October and March. Thank you, Nancy and Neal Bush, for having me!

That evening, I was grateful to join folks at the Hancock County Farm Bureau, where residents were able to enjoy a vibrant exchange of ideas over a cup of coffee with me. We discussed topics ranging from health care reform to my work on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee during my legislative update. Throughout the question and answer period, constituents asked about how to support those who were legally immigrating to the U.S., rural health care, President Trump’s border wall initiative, the farm bill, and the state of our military.

At the end of the week, I paid a visit to Athens, where I attended the ReNew Athens Revitalization Project ceremony thanking those who have helped restore vital housing opportunities for individuals trying to get out of hard times. I commend State Representative Spencer Frye, who is incredibly active with Habitat for Humanity and the project, and Mayor Nancy Denson for their hard work.

After that, representatives from the Peach State Federal Credit Union welcomed me to Lawrenceville for a tour of its headquarters to learn more about federal issues facing the industry and talk about the need for commonsense regulations. Thanks for having me!

On Saturday, I was honored to present Department of Defense Lapel Pins and the State of Georgia’s Certificate of Honor to some of our local heroes at the American Legion Post in Statham. I’ve said this once, and I’ll say it again, our veterans represent the very best of America, and while we can never repay them for their service and sacrifice, we must honor them as best we can.
￼
￼
￼
￼
Want to have coffee?
In order to better represent you in Washington, I often host “Coffee with Your Congressman” events. Continuing this tradition, on Thursday, August 31 from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., I will be hosting another meet-and-greet at the Taliaferro County Farm Bureau in Crawfordville. I encourage residents from Taliaferro County and the surrounding area to join me for a legislative update and an open conversation to discuss the issues that are most important to you in the community.
￼


A New Path Forward
Last Monday, President Trump addressed the Nation from Fort Myer, Virginia, to announce the administration’s strategy in Afghanistan and South Asia. The President was very deliberate in reaching his decision on Afghanistan and considered a host of different options for moving forward. While his decision was not reached easily, it must be considered in the context of the previous policies which have failed. 

Most notably, when President Obama set an arbitrary timeline for withdrawing from Iraq, the coalitions we worked so hard to craft fell apart, setting the stage for ISIS and other terrorist organizations to fill the void. Simply put, we cannot repeat this legacy in Afghanistan.

I am pleased that President Trump articulated a strategy rooted in taking the fight directly to the terrorists, lifting engagement restrictions which have for so long tied the hands of our troops in theater, and applying pressure to our partners in Afghanistan and Pakistan to more aggressively combat terrorists operating within their borders. 

It is my hope that these policies will more effectively create the conditions necessary to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a staging ground for those who wish harm upon us. Now it is incumbent upon Congress to provide our brave men and women in uniform with the resources required to achieve that success.

The Week Ahead
Heading into the final week of the August district work period, I look forward to meeting many of you around the community, attending a ribbon cutting ceremony in Winder, hosting a “Coffee with Your Congressman” event in Taliaferro County, and speaking with students in Greensboro – just to name a few. 

As always, I want to hear from you. Please contact my office with any questions, comments, or concerns. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to keep track of upcoming events!

Sincerely,

Rep. Hice visits Peach State FCU to talk CU difference CUNA News – 8/29 In what was termed an “educational” meeting, Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.) visited Peach State FCU, Lawrenceville, Ga., on Aug. 25. “Congressman Hice had an opportunity to meet with our senior managers and many of our staff members, some of whom knew him,” said Marshall Boutwell, president/CEO of Peach State FCU. “I’m struck by Congressman’s Hice’s desire to learn about how credit union’s work and how they serve their communities.

Dear Lindsey,
          Waters have risen and rain continues to pour down in Houston, Texas. Hurricane Harvey has impacted millions and the death toll is expected to rise. The photographs weve seen of the devastation take your breath away, yet amidst the terror, we continue to hear stories of hope and of neighbors helping neighbors.
          Tragedies like these in America always go hand in hand with heroics from our first responders and everyday citizens. Volunteers from across the country are mobilizing and countless private donations are headed to Texas.
          We may be thousands of miles away, but natural disasters like these always remind us that we truly are one nation, these United States. I hope you will join me in praying for our Texan family and friends, as well as the first responders who are still saving those in harms way. Now is also a good opportunity to refresh your own emergency situation plans  you never know when natural disasters might strike and being prepared is a critical part of our response. 
          As always, I encourage you to contact my office to express your concerns or opinions on policy issues important to you. And if were not already connected on social media, I invite you to follow my daily updates on Facebook.
          Its my number one priority in Congress to represent the values and interests of the people of Montana, and your input is very helpful as I do. I also invite you to visit my website, www.daines.senate.gov, so we can stay in close touch.

If you are having trouble viewing this message or would like to share it on a social network, you can view the message online.￼

 
￼￼
 
Dear Friend,
If you are 65 like me  the official age of eligibility for Medicare  you may be worried about the future of the program or wondering how to sign up or get assistance with your current benefits. Heres what Im doing to help:
Fighting to Protect Medicare for Seniors and Future Generations
In Congress, I have long been committed to protecting Medicare and ensuring that seniors in Ventura County receive the benefits they have worked so hard to earn. I am firmly opposed to any proposal to end the Medicare guarantee, gut benefits, or drive up costs. We must remain steadfast in our promise to all Americans to protect Medicare.
I also support efforts to further enhance the Medicare program so seniors get the care they need, including legislation that would expand Medicare to give beneficiaries coverage for vision, hearing, and dental care.
Helping Seniors with Medicare Benefits
As your representative in Washington, it is also my job to help those approaching 65 navigate the Medicare process and ensure those who are enrolled are getting the services and care they need.
For example, my office recently helped a constituent from Port Hueneme, who had lost his Medicare Part B coverage due to a lapse in payment stemming from a recent relocation. We were able to help him direct the missed payments to the proper office and have his coverage reinstated.
If you are approaching 65, learn more about how to enroll in Medicare here. If you are already signed up and interested in learning about other coverage options, explore choices here. If you are having trouble signing up for Medicare or need help with your current Medicare benefits, please do not hesitate to contact my district office at (805) 379-1779.
Sincerely,

Dear Friends,
￼
This month, I traveled across Virginia on a 1500-mile roadtrip that took me through Southwest and Southside Virginia, and I have honestly never been more optimistic about the future of our Commonwealth.   In Mecklenburg County, I went to an elementary school where boys and girls are learning how to code and build robots before they’re even old enough to drive. They’re learning the skills necessary to compete in the 21st century, and there’s no reason they should have to leave their hometowns just to access those 21st century jobs.   
￼

Just look at Big Stone Gap – about as far southwest as you can go. I went to Mountain Empire Community College, where they’re teaching students how to operate drones that can be used to inspect power lines or deliver medicine. With the right investments, Southside and Southwest Virginia can become tech hubs with high-tech, high wage jobs in industries like software development, robotics, or cybersecurity. The talent is there in the people of Virginia's rural communities, but we need to unleash that potential by finally bringing full cell coverage and high-speed internet to the whole region. It will require the public and private sectors to work together on this 21st century problem just like they did in the 20th century with rural electrification, and I am committed to continue the fight for these job-creating investments to grow Virginia’s economy. 

It’s not just the tech sector that gives me hope. In small town after small town that I visited, I saw a renaissance on their main streets. When I visited the main street in Tazewell, there were brand new restaurants and coffee shops, as well as a new 160-person restaurant that’s just about to open its doors. In Bristol, I announced the new Southwest Virginia Mountain Brew Trail, which will drive tourism to Southwest Virginia’s thriving craft brewery scene. 

While I’m hopeful for the future, I understand that a lot of families are still struggling to get back to where they were before the great recession. From town halls and forums in Tazewell, Galax, Martinsville, and Norfolk, to farmers roundtables in Roanoke and Wythe Counties, to my first ever Facebook Live Town Hall, Virginians shared their concerns about healthcare, our broken tax code, and our growing national debt. I’ll be taking their ideas with me to Washington when Congress returns in September. 

If there’s an issue that’s important to you or a question you’d like to ask, I invite you to send me an email and follow my work in the Senate on Facebook and Twitter. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

￼
Mark R. Warner

8/29/17 11:14,Beyond resistance: Improving road safety through Vision Zero,"Update | Tuesday, August 29, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 32nd day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: improving road safety through Vision Zero.
More than 40,000 Americans were killed last year in crashes on our roadways. This carnage is preventable and must stop. Our most vulnerable road users—bicyclists and pedestrians—make up a disproportionate share of these deaths, with pedestrian fatalities increasing by 16 percent from 2009 to 2014 and another 9 percent from 2015 to 2016. We need a different, more effective approach to road safety.
Communities across the country are recognizing that there is only one number of acceptable deaths on our streets: zero. Cities from Portland to Fort Lauderdale are implementing interagency Vision Zero plans to connect engineering, education, and enforcement to end transportation deaths and serious injuries. Despite horrific national statistics, Vision Zero is already making a difference at street level.
Congress should encourage this innovative approach to transportation safety, which is why I recently introduced the Vision Zero Act of 2017. This bill creates two competitive grant programs to plan and implement a Vision Zero framework, giving local communities access to funding and best practices to set and reach safety goals. Passage of the Vision Zero Act would help communities of all sizes develop and implement innovative, effective strategies to end the carnage on our roadways and reverse the disturbing trend of rising traffic deaths.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

Dear Friends,  
Hurricane Harvey is one of the most catastrophic hurricanes to ever hit the Texas coast. Our friends and families in Southeast Texas are struggling due to storm damage and flooding that continues to devastate homes, properties, and entire communities. I applaud President Donald Trump for his swift action by promptly signing a disaster declaration at the request of Governor Greg Abbott. This will provide any and all emergency protective measures to be made available to those impacted by the hurricane.
It is moving to witness all the love and support from surrounding communities in Texas, as well as the entire United States. Americans from nearby states have traveled great distances to assist victims in any way they can. I’d also like to recognize local law enforcement and health professionals who chose to stay behind and brave the storm in order to help those who were unable to help themselves. Because of individuals like these, many were saved who would not have been otherwise. I will continue to pray for the victims, their families, and all of those who have been displaced from their homes. As Texans, we stick together and we will make it through this. 
If you are interested in helping out those affected by this tragic event, there are a multitude of ways that you can find here. The smallest act of service can mean a great deal to those who have lost everything.  
I have included some articles and releases you may find helpful, located on the right side of this newsletter. It is an honor and privilege to represent the people of Texas’ 25th Congressional District and as always, please reach out to me with any issues and concerns that are important to you. 
Sincerely, 
Sincerely,

Friend,

For over 70 years, Australia and the United States have been staunch allies, dating back to the height of World War II. Since then, Australia has fought in at least five wars alongside the United States of America. Australian troops have fought and died alongside ours in Iraq, where I served, and elsewhere in the Middle East, where the battle against terrorism continues. 
 
As a member of both the House Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, I know that Australia remains one of our closest and most capable military and intelligence partners around the globe. 

￼

 
I recently returned home from assignment with the House Intelligence Committee in Australia, where leaders from across the globe gathered to discuss the increasingly complex national security environment we face as an international community. The U.S. and Australia must continue to build upon our intelligence and technology sharing, cooperating more on counter-terrorism measures and tactical planning.

￼

 
During this assignment, we commemorated the Australian American Leadership Dialogue’s 25th Anniversary and its contribution to the bilateral relationship. The Leadership Dialogue must continue to remain a priority for our two countries going forward.

￼

 
We will continue to work together to strengthen our strategic cooperation with our allies and equip our servicemembers and intelligence communities to detect, deter, and defeat the threats of the coming decade.

￼

Yours in service,
￼

Last Tuesday, I listened to and answered questions from constituents across the Third District at a Facebook Live Town Hall Forum hosted by the Kansas City Star's Editorial Board. In all, the forum reached around 200,000 people online and we hosted more than 100 randomly-selected constituents at Olathe City Hall - the sixth town hall forum I've hosted at this location. 
It was great to take questions from the audience and from Facebook Live commenters about important issues facing Congress and our nation right now. I want to thank everyone who took the time out of their busy schedules to join me in person and watch online. Since Ive been in Congress, I've hosted and attended dozens of town hall forums and hundreds of constituent meetings and gatherings across the Third District to make sure Im keeping in touch with our community and listening to your comments and concerns. I continue to seek out ways to reach the most people and to engage in the most civil and productive dialogue possible, and I found that this was a great meeting.

2017 Kansas Agriculture Tour
As Co-Chair of the Congressional Beef Caucus and a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, I made several stops across Kansas last week to visit with farmers and ranchers as part of my statewide Agriculture Tour. I enjoyed talking with Kansans across the state on issues most important to them as Congress starts works to pass the FY18 agriculture spending bill, begins to focus our efforts on putting together the next Farm Bill, and continues to work with the Administration to craft trade deals that will open new markets around the world for farmers and ranchers across Kansas and America. 
Kansas Department of Agricultures Groundwater Management District #2 in Halstead
￼
 
I kicked off this year's Ag Tour at the Kansas Department of Agricultures Groundwater Management District #2 in Halstead to visit about the Equus Beds Aquifer and the Wichita Aquifer Recharge project. It was great to hear from District 2 Manager Tim Boese on their ASR Project improving water quality and providing additional supply for nearby water users. Thank you to Tim and staff for hosting me!
￼
MKC Grain Storage in Hutchinson
￼ ￼ Click here to read more about Kevin's visit to Groundwater Management District #2 from The Hutchinson News.
My second stop was at as Mid Kansas Coop (MKC) Grain Storage at the Old Air Force Base Runway in Hutchinson. I was impressed by the nearly half a mile long and 4.7 million bushels of wheat that has been on the abandoned Air Force Base since August of last year. I enjoyed seeing the grain pile, which took about a month to fill up coming in on about 200 truckloads per day, and talking about the importance of crop insurance and trade deals to farmers across Kansas.
 
Thank you to Mark Cochran, local manager at MKC in Haven, and Danny Stussy, grain elevator superintendent for MKC in Haven, for taking me to view the storage site. Also a special thanks to the Kansas Farm Bureau and District 4 Board Member Steven McCloud for arranging the stop.
 
￼
While we were nearby, I had to stop at Carriage Crossing in Yoder, Kansas to enjoy some lunch with my dad. As a lifelong Kansas farmer who still works on our family farm, my dad is the one who taught me the values of hard work and dedication that so many Kansans learn working on the farm. He taught me at an early age that farming is not just a way to support your family, it's a way of life. Its a set of certain values like hard work, determination, never giving up even through the hard times. It's always great when I'm able to spend time with him.

DFA Meadowlark Dairy Plant in Garden City

￼
Click here to read more on Kevin's visit to DFA from The Garden City Telegram.
 
My third stop was at Garden Citys Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) Meadowlark Dairy Plant. During the visit, I was able to see their brand new facility, which is expected to officially open next month. It was fun to get a preview of the facility that is expected to process 83 truckloads of raw milk  about 4 million pounds  per day, where the final product is shipped through the BNSF Intermodal in the Third District. The milk being produced at DFA ultimately ends up in my community and creates shipping jobs, rail jobs, and truck jobs.
 
Special thanks to Alan McEntee, DFA project manager, for showing me around. We're so proud to have DFA headquartered in KCK and it was great to see how DFA is connecting our state. 
￼
Great Bend Chamber of Commerce
￼ ￼ Click here to read more on Kevin's visit to Great Bend from the Great Bend Tribune.
I enjoyed the opportunity to visit with folks at the Great Bend Chamber coffee event last week while in Central Kansas for my Ag Tour. We talked about important tax credits for rural housing and facilities like Trail Ridge, where the coffee event was held.
Thank you to President/CEO of the Chamber Jan Peters, and the rest of the Chamber for hosting me!
￼
Kansas Governor's Agriculture Summit in Manhattan
￼
There was a huge turnout from a diverse group of about 400 agriculture advocates from across Kansas at the 2017 Kansas Governor's Agriculture Summit in Manhattan. It was great to have the opportunity to speak with these advocates about my commitment to support our farmers and ranchers.
Right now, farmers and ranchers are being left behind in the 21st Century economy. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates American farmers incomes will drop 9% in 2017, and there will soon be fewer than two million farms in America for the first time since pioneers moved westward after the Louisiana Purchase. High yields and low commodity prices are raising concerns that the next few years could bring the biggest wave of farm closures since the 1980s.
In Congress, I will continue to work on behalf of Kansas farmers and ranchers to protect their efforts by protecting crop insurance, reforming the tax code, repealing harmful regulations, and prioritizing trade. Thank you the Kansas Department of Agriculture for hosting this wonderful event, and special thanks to Secretary Jackie McClaskey for inviting me to participate.
￼
Kansas Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan
￼
Following the Ag Summit, we continued the Ag Tour down the road in Manhattan at the Kansas Wheat Innovation Center.
The center was built by the Kansas Wheat Commission and represents the single largest research investment by Kansas wheat farmers in history. It was completed in 2012, and houses 15,000 square feet of research laboratories and 10,000 square feet of greenhouses that receive grant funding from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). The center is also home of the Wheat Genetics Resource Center, which coordinates a national and international network to conduct genetic studies in wheat.
Touring their greenhouses and labs and hearing about the science of wheat was a great learning experience. Thank you to Kansas Wheat CEO Justin Gilpin, the several board members from across the state who attended, and Government Affairs Director Daniel Heady for having us.
￼
Wulfkuhle Cattle Farm in Berryton
￼
On Friday, we continued the Ag Tour at Rocking H Ranch on the Wulfkuhle Cattle Farm, which is a 3rd generation cattle farm in Berryton. The Wulfkuhle's own about 3,500 acres in Shawnee County and have about 800 to 1,000 cattle.
Trade is an item we're prioritizing in Congress to help ranchers like the Wulfkuhle's. Under the Trump Administration, exports to China are happening again for the first time since 2003 when China accepted its first shipments of U.S. meat in late June. Continuing to work with the Administration to open up new markets across Asia and around the world will greatly benefit the agriculture and specifically the beef industry in Kansas, and as the Co-Chairman of the Congressional Beef Caucus it's something that remains on the top of my mind. 
￼
Cultivate Kansas City in KCK
￼
The final stop on my 2017 Ag Tour was at Cultivate Kansas City, a 12-year old non-profit organization that grows food, farms, and community in support of a healthy local food system in the KCK metro area.
I enjoyed hearing from Executive Director Katherine Kelly on the importance of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) grants that helped start, sustain, and expand Cultivate KC's urban farm over the years. I was also given an overview of nutrition incentive programs by staffer Jen Marsh during the visit.
It was great to hear about the program's benefits, including how researchers at KU Medical Center have partnered with Cultivate KC and evaluated the program and found healthy results.

Around Kansas
Fort Riley 1st Infantry Division 100th Anniversary
￼ Kevin visiting with Representative Roger Marshall (R-KS) and Fort Riley Commanding General Joseph Martin. 
On Friday, I stopped at Fort Riley for the 100th anniversary of the Big Red One 1st Infantry Division. The Big Red One, was the first to fight in WWI, WWII and Vietnam and was the first to return to Iraq in 2014. Today, there are more than 5,700 1st Infantry Division Soldiers deployed throughout the world. Big Red One boasts 35 Medal of Honor recipients since its inception in 1917 - one of most decorated divisions in the U.S. Army.
￼
The events on Friday were the culmination of Victory Week celebrating 100 years of the service and sacrifice of the Big Red One. During my time at Fort Riley, I spent some time at their memorial to those lost in the Global War on Terrorism to reflect on the sacrifices of our military. The men and women of our military sacrifice so much to protect America and our freedoms, and that's why I joined my colleagues in the House of Representatives to pass the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) back in July to give the largest pay raise to troop in eight years. Thank you to all the courageous soldiers in the 1st Infantry Division.
￼
Third District Job Fair
￼
We had a great turnout at my annual Job Fair at the KCKCC Technical Education Center. Eighty-six employers were there to take resumes and meet with job seekers, with the first hour exclusively reserved for veterans. Our past job fairs have helped numerous Kansans find work and this year was no different. I enjoyed meeting the many employers from law enforcement, tech industry, manufacturing, health care, transportation industry, financial management, education, food service industry and more.
￼
Jobs are available in the Third District of Kansas and the employers at the Job Fair were pleased with so many applicants. Thank you to Keely Schneider, Executive Director of Workforce Partnership, as once again Workforce Partnership was a great partner in making last week's Job Fair a success. Special thanks to Kansas City Kansas Community College for hosting us.
￼
KU Chancellor Dr. Doug Girod
￼
I enjoyed visiting with new University of Kansas Chancellor and former Vice Chancellor of KU Medical Center Dr. Doug Girod last week. Over the years, I've had the privilege of getting to know him and his character, and am excited for his leadership at KU. Good luck on your first year serving as Chancellor, I know you'll do great!
￼
KU Student Body President
￼
 
It was great catching up with the University of Kansas Student Body President, Mady Womack, last week. Mady is a senior studying Economics with minors in Mathematics and Business, and has an impressive background in serving her college campus through her time on the Student Senate. As former KU Student Body President, I appreciated hearing from Mady on her leadership experience on campus and her priorities for this year. I'm proud to have Mady, a Third District resident from Leawood, serving in this role.

Hurricane Harvey
￼ ￼ Click here to read more from the Kansas City Star.
As Hurricane Harvey continues to make landfall in the Houston, Texas area, Brooke and I join many of you in keeping those affected in our thoughts and prayers. It's been one of largest natural disasters we've seen in a long time, with Harris County receiving more than 30 inches of rain and still more to come - some saying in the end it could be more than 50 inches. 
President Trump has signed a disaster proclamation and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) officials are on the ground helping out local and state efforts. Additionally, as we often see in times like these, Americans from around the country like the two men from a Blue Springs landscaping business highlighted in the Kansas City Star article above have stepped up to help. In times of great peril, we as a nation come together to lift up our brothers and sisters in need. It's what makes our country so great. 
If you want to help the victims of this horrible disaster, you can click here for a list of various ways to chip in. 
Fact of the Week
Congress is working to protect agriculture through reforming the tax code.
Estate Tax repeal is vital to family famers, with 2/3rds of all farmers in the United States over the age of 55, and 97% of the more than 2 million farms in America are family-owned. 
Third District Trivia 
Last week, I attended Victory Week 2017 to celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the Big Red One 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley. Do you know the Big Red One's division motto?
Send your answers to haley.brady@mail.house.gov and the first correct response will receive a shout out in next week's newsletter.
Congratulations to last week's winner Charles Carson from Gardner. 
Last week's answer:  Last week, we witnessed the total solar eclipse in Kansas City. This was the first total solar eclipse in the US since 1979.

Dear Friends, 
As Texas continues to see incredible damage and unimaginable flooding, I hope that you, your friends, and loved ones are safe. 
Federal, state, and local search and rescue teams are operating 24/7 to reach those stranded in flooded areas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has more than 1,100 Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) personnel working to save lives in south Texas. Another 850-plus personnel are in the state and are expected to be performing rescues this evening.  National US&R teams, located across the United States, are trained and equipped to handle structural collapses and swift water rescues. For more information, please go to my website here. 


If you feel your life is in danger, call 911. First responders are not responding to requests for assistance received through social media. If you cannot get through to 911 at first, keep calling and do not hang up.


I advise you to download the FEMA Mobile App to receive alerts from the National Weather Service, get safety and survival tips, customize your emergency checklist, find your local shelter, and upload your disaster photos to help first responders.

The Coast Guard also has an additional nine teams onsite doing shallow water rescues. More information on USCG rescue operations is available on their website at: http://www.news.uscg.mil/Texas/. If you are in need of immediate rescue you can call them at the following numbers: 

281-464-4851 

281-464-4852 

281-464-4853 

281-464-4854

For more information about Hurricane Harvey, go to www.fema.gov/hurricane-harvey and for more specific information regarding Harris County go to http://readyharris.org/.
Federal Preparation   Last Friday, I sent a letter to the President urging his authorization of Governor Abbott's request for an expedited major disaster declaration on behalf of the Texas counties impacted by Harvey. On the heels of my letter, President Trump approved the request. As vast as Texas is, simply put, the collective resources of all of our jurisdictions and voluntary organizations are not adequate on their own to deal with this historic hurricane. These new funds released to help Texans respond to and recover from Harvey’s impact will be greatly beneficial and lifesaving. Declaring major disaster areas  allows FEMA to come in and provide assistance before the damage is too vast. 
I joined Maria Bartiromo on FOX News to thank President Trump and Governor Abbott for their swift and decisive action. This is why I think this has been one of the best responses to one of the worst hurricanes I've seen in my lifetime hit the coast of Texas. 
You can watch my appearance by clicking here or on the image below. You can read my letter to the President by clicking here.

Emergency Management Coordination   I have made myself available to aid our local emergency management officials in any way possible. I will continue to help in the coordination between federal, state, and local officials to ensure a robust response to this storm.

August Monthly Column
Texans know it is long past time to secure our borders. Failed policies of the past have allowed millions of illegal immigrants, traffickers, and violent criminals to gain access to our great state and ultimately the United States. This has left Americans – and Texans in particular – vulnerable to the types of tragedies that we have become increasingly familiar with. As Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and a fourth generation Texan, I feel an increased responsibility to secure and protect our borders while simultaneously strengthening and enforcing our immigration laws. That is why I introduced H.R. 3548, the Border Security for America Act.
You can read the rest of my monthly column here.
Foreign Affairs Update   Last week, President Trump issued new sanctions against Venezuela. I applaud this decision. Until President Maduro makes it clear he intends to appropriately address the worsening political and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, the international community must take additional actions to make him pay a price for his negligence.  The U.S. and international community must continue to apply pressure on President Maduro until he ceases all dictatorial actions, reestablishes democratic norms, and begins to respect the basic human dignity of the Venezuelan people that continue to suffer under his oppressive rule. 
Also last week, North Korea fired three short-range missiles. The launches were the regime's first rocket tests since two intercontinental ballistic missiles were fired earlier last month. Then today, North Korea fired missiles over Japan causing people to seek shelter. This was the 18th missile launch by Pyongyang this year alone. Despite tough economic sanctions against the regime, North Korea continues to act belligerently. I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to provide this administration with the tools needed to deter future aggression from Pyongyang.
Legislative Update
The House remains in District Work Period until after Labor Day so there are no votes. 
I encourage you to visit my website, www.mccaul.house.gov, for more information on constituent services and legislative updates.  Also, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to get the latest updates on my work in Washington and the 10th District of Texas.  It continues to be a great honor to represent you in the United States House of Representatives.  I will continue to help with coordination between federal and local emergency officials throughout the week. I hope everyone heeds the warnings of local officials and stays safe!   With Best Regards, ￼  Michael T. McCaul Member of Congress

News from Representative Ryan Costello
￼ 

Welcome to Ryan’s Report, my weekly e-newsletter, and thank you for reading.
Over the weekend, Hurricane Harvey descended upon Texas and we’ve all seen the heartbreaking images of the destruction caused by this natural disaster. Governor Tom Wolf announced that 45 members of Pennsylvania’s Task Force One, Urban Search and Rescue Task Force departed Philadelphia to report to Fort Worth, Texas to assist in water rescue and search and rescue efforts there as Hurricane Harvey continues to bring rain to the Gulf Coast. 
There are many service and governmental organizations on the ground, helping victims, restoring order, and working to mitigate further effects of the storm.  In the coming days, it is expected that Congress will consider legislation to provide emergency funding to the state of Texas and the many victims displaced by Harvey. I will keep you posted on the status of that effort and what additional measures the federal government may take to provide assistance during this trying time.  
In the meantime, it is important for our citizens to be prepared for anything. The Department of Homeland Security’s website, www.ready.gov, provides information to help you prepare for and respond to emergencies including natural and man-made disasters. My office has also previously released a Preparedness Manual.  As we approach September, which is recognized as National Preparedness Month, I encourage you and your family to take a few minutes to review these materials and come up with a plan to be prepared.   
In addition to addressing the nation about the status of federal relief efforts in Texas, this past week the President addressed the nation about a strategy in Afghanistan. Throughout the day on Tuesday, I joined several local radio programs, including with Laura LeBeau on WLBR, WEEU, and WCHE to share my thoughts on the President's remarks. Before I update you on my full week, I want to make sure you have seen the statement I issued on Tuesday regarding the President's remarks:
￼
I support that the President outlined a strategy in Afghanistan that relies on the advice of experts and depends on conditions on the ground, as opposed to an arbitrary timeline. We should not facilitate a date of departure for terrorists or organizations with an intent to cause the United States harm.
Within this strategy, it is appropriate to choose an approach that utilizes diplomatic, economic, and military options – both soft and hard power. We must also make sure Pakistan is willing to assist us in our essential counterterrorism goals in the region, which means Pakistan must reject any tolerance for militants or terrorists. These are each important parts of a strategy for rooting out terrorists from safe harbor, so they cannot develop attacks on U.S. citizens or our homeland, and for Afghanistan to deliver its own future.
My statement is also available on my website and Facebook page.
As the August District Work Period winds down and we prepare for Congress to be back in Session following the Labor Day holiday, I’d like to announce that on Tuesday, September 5th at 7:30 p.m. - 8:30 p.m. I will be hosting another Telephone Town Hall for constituents to share their priorities for the fall legislative agenda.  To register your phone number, click here. Remember, only constituents from PA-6 will be called. 
If for some reason your phone number is not called or you get disconnected, you can always follow along by clicking this link. Looking forward to a lively and productive conversation on current affairs!
August 21 - August 25: Working Together for Local Solutions
Pennsylvania Awarded a Federal Conservation Grant
￼
This week, I announced the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources has received an award in the amount of $2,420,000 for land acquisition in the Schuylkill Highlands Project Area - the Highlands reach all four counties of Pennsylvania's Sixth District. The grant is through the federal Highlands Conservation Act. As a cosponsor of legislation that would extend Highlands Conservation Act funding through 2021, I was pleased to announce this grant.
I believe conserving our commonwealth’s historic land and watersheds is important to our local economy, to protecting drinking water for our communities, to the health of our residents, and for the wildlife that know these lands and watersheds as home.
Through my work in Congress and previously, as a Chester County Commissioner, I have been an advocate for the Pennsylvania Highlands, which includes portions of Valley Forge National Historic Park, the Schuylkill River Heritage Area, and Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site in our community. I have led efforts to preserve Chester County's historic farmlands and open spaces, and in Congress, I have supported long-term land conservation funding for the Pennsylvania Highlands Region that runs through the Sixth District. To read more, click here.

Berks County Career and Technical Education Roundtable
On Thursday, I participated in a Career and Technical Education (CTE) roundtable in Wyomissing, where we discussed the importance of strengthening CTE -- an issue I am focused on, particularly as the co-chair of the 21st Century Skills Caucus.
￼
The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act has not been updated in over a decade, which is why I cosponsored and supported H.R. 2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. This bipartisan legislation, which passed the House in June, would reauthorize and update the Perkins Act to strengthen job-ready educational opportunities in high schools, community colleges, and technical education programs in Pennsylvania and across our nation.
In our community, the Perkins Act helps support the work of Berks Technical Institute, Montgomery County Community College, and Chester County Technical College High School of Phoenixville in their mission to equip students with the high-quality education and hands-on experience necessary to enter the workforce or take their careers to the next level.
It was helpful to hear from local businesses and job creators about their work to train and hire skilled workers, and receive feedback on the type of skills employers are seeking.

Still Working for You in Washington
Career Opportunities for Servicemembers & Veterans
The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act, commonly known as the Forever G.I. Bill, was signed into law this month. This legislation, which I helped introduce and voted for on the House Floor, makes bipartisan improvements to the G.I. Bill, including the elimination of the 15-year cap on accessing benefits under the law -- this change allows eligible servicemembers and veterans to have access to these benefits throughout their entire lives.
￼
Within the Forever G.I. Bill is the VET TEC Act. This portion of the bill helps to bring these benefits into the 21st century by increasing opportunities for veterans to receive high technology training and to complete a STEM degree. As a member of the Congressional STEM and Veterans Jobs Caucuses, this is an important modernization for veterans and a priority of mine in Congress.
As our workforce needs change, it is important we offer the training and education for these new roles to prepare veterans to succeed in the 21st century civilian workforce. Click here for my thoughts on why this legislation is so important.
Seniors Telephone Town Hall
On Tuesday, I joined AARP for a telephone town hallwith seniors across our District. We discussed healthcare, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid -- among other topics. In addition to this telephone town hall, this week I held seniors town halls with residents in Phoebe Berks Village and Sanatoga Court. 
It's important for you to know that in Congress, I also support:
	•	Social Security MAIL Act: Identity theft is one of the most serious and increasingly frequent issues affecting American citizens. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reports that complaints concerning identity theft in the United States increased by nearly 50 percent from 2014 to 2015. In many cases, identity thieves specifically target Social Security account numbers (SSN) to gain access to a victim’s financial information.That is why I helped introduce H.R. 1513, the Social Security MAIL Act. This bill would only allow the Social Security Administration (SSA) to include a full Social Security Number in mail documents if it is required and provide reasoning as to why it is required. 
	•	Call Spoofing Legislation: One of the first bills that passed the House this Congress was intended to protect seniors. Call spoofing is a telephone scam used to change the information on a caller-ID and pose as a trusted source, such as an official government agency, a medical center, or a bank. The intention behind call spoofing is to collect valuable personal information – including, for example, banking information – to defraud or cause other harm to an individual or family. In an effort to protect your personal information, I supported H.R. 423, the Anti-Spoofing Act, designed to ensure those who engage in spoofing face criminal fines and penalties. Call spoofing is not limited to voice messages – those using this tactic also utilize text messages, and this legislation would include text messages in these fines and penalties.
 
Next week is the last full week of the August District Work Period before I will return to Capitol Hill for votes, committee hearings, and constituent meetings.
Sincerely,
￼ 
Ryan Costello
Member of Congress
 
 




Do you believe the federal government should end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program? This program, established by the Obama Administration, provided certain undocumented immigrants, who came to the U.S. as children, with a ""lawful presence"" in the U.S for a period of two years. 


Yes, it does not matter that these individuals were brought to the U.S. as children because they were brought illegally.



No, these individuals were brought to the U.S. as children at no fault of their own.



Yes, because individuals who receive a lawful presence under DACA have not ""been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, three or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.""



No, because individuals who receive lawful presence under DACA can continue to reapply for this program.



I think this decision should be made on a case-by-case basis.



I'm not sure.

Friends,
One week ago, the President informed the nation of his decision on a path forward in Afghanistan. I am sure this decision was not an easy one, but I believe it was the right one. I appreciate President Trump's dedication to eliminating safe havens for terrorism without giving away our strategy to the enemy. 
As a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I stand ready to ensure our men and women in uniform have all the tools and resources they need to defeat the enemy. I outlined my thoughts on Afghanistan in this column earlier this summer.
EXCITING DEVELOPMENT IN GREENVILLE
￼ 
It was an honor to be in Greenville at the ribbon cutting ceremony for the Country Village Apartments senior housing. This facility and the services provided serve as a truly wonderful example of a public-private partnership to offer affordable housing to seniors and those with disabilities. I was proud to play a small part in the grand opening event. It was great to see several good friends, including State Representative Chris Sells, Greenville Mayor Dexter McLendon, and others! 
LUNCH IN LUVERNE 
￼ 
I was glad to be in Luverne last week where I joined the Kiwanis Club for their lunch meeting at the Chicken Shack. We talked about a lot of the positive developments happening in Washington right now to undo much of the damage caused by the Obama Administration. It was great to see some familiar faces and meet new people.
A PRODUCTIVE ""MEET WITH MARTHA"" IN ANDALUSIA
￼
Many thanks to those who attended the ""Meet with Martha"" event in Andalusia last week! It is so important for me to hear from those I represent, and I really appreciate everyone who took the time to come talk with me. Thank you to the Andalusia Area Chamber of Commerce staff for going above and beyond to host the event and make it wonderful. 
AN AFTERNOON AT STRAUGHN SCHOOL
￼
I also enjoyed a fun visit to the Extended Day Program at Straughn Elementary and Middle Schools. I was blown away by the engaging activities and learning opportunities being offered! As a working parent, I really appreciate this affordable and productive after school care option in our district. It was exciting to see firsthand all the big things happening at Straughn! 
EGGS AND ISSUES WITH THE MONTGOMERY CHAMBER
￼
Montgomery is my hometown, so it's always great to attend local events among friends. Last week I was honored to be the keynote speaker for the Montgomery Area Chamber of Commerce's Eggs and Issues breakfast. I told the group about opportunities Congress has to build upon the nation’s economic momentum, such as reforming the tax code, investing in infrastructure, and fixing health care. 
I also shared the latest on our efforts to land the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter at Montgomery’s Dannelly Field. We haven't received an official decision yet, but I truly believe Montgomery and the 187th Fighter Wing are in a good position to land the coveted mission. We are anxiously expecting a decision from the Air Force later this fall, and as soon as I know, I promise that I will let you know. No matter the final decision, the men and women of the 187th Fighter Wing are to be commended for their remarkable work and professionalism. 
A MORNING IN DOTHAN
￼
It was great to talk with local business owners and job creators at an event hosted by the Dothan Area Chamber of Commerce. I reiterated my commitment to fighting for policies that help and strengthen businesses instead of hurt them. 
As you're likely aware, there's a push among House Democrats to rename military installations that are named for Confederate figures. This topic came up several times throughout the week. As I told the Dothan Eagle: That's not going to happen. Fort Rucker is a proud post with a distinguished history of training the best rotary wing aviators in the world. It’s a shame Democrats are trying to inject divisive politics into our military installations.
A FRIENDLY MEETING IN ENTERPRISE
￼
I spent an afternoon in Enterprise where I spoke to a lunch meeting of the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE). I appreciate the friendly atmosphere and all the thoughtful questions asked by those who attended. Thank you for hosting me!
A VISIT TO GENEVA'S SYSCO GULF COAST
￼  
I visited Sysco Gulf Coast in Geneva for a facility tour and a meeting with managers and administrators. It was amazing to see the scale of their impressive work - I even got to try out the test kitchen! Many thanks to Sysco President Chris McCollum for hosting me. It was also great to see my friend Geneva Mayor Frankie Lindsey.
As the month of August continues, I'm looking forward to more meetings and visits through the Second District. Stay tuned on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to learn more about upcoming events near you. As always, it is an honor to serve you in Congress. Please never hesitate to let me know if there is a way my office can be of assistance.   Sincerely,

Praying for Our Friends in Texas
Right now floodwaters are ravaging the city of Houston. What we've heard on the news, along with the photos that have been posted on social media, is heartbreaking. My prayers are with the millions of Texans who have been impacted by Hurricane Harvey over the past several days. I hope that you will keep them in your prayers as well. During this difficult time, we have also witnessed the compassion of neighbors helping neighbors and first responders on the job around the clock to save those in distress. Crews from across the country, including Virginia, are heading to Houston to help their fellow Americans, and I am extremely grateful for all of our first responders. What's happening right now in Texas is a stark reminder that a natural disaster can strike at any time. For more information on how to prepare, visit Ready.gov. 
Snapshots from the Sixth
￼
Stable Craft Brewing in Augusta County is expanding! I enjoyed participating in this exciting announcement welcoming new jobs and investment in the region.
￼
Last week, I visited the Plains Area Day Care Center in Broadway. This center provides childcare to many families who otherwise could not afford such a service. But most people don't know that it sits on property that was originally deeded to Rockingham County by the federal government nearly 30 years ago. Unfortunately, given the complex conditions of the deed, legislation like my bill, H.R. 954, is necessary to help ease federal restrictions so that they can make much-needed improvements to the facility. This bill passed the House in July, and now it’s up to the Senate to act. I urge the Senate to pass this bill and allow the Plains Area Day Care Center to continue to serve this community.
Honoring the Memory of Lacey Putney
On Saturday, I was sad to learn that former delegate Lacey Putney had passed away. Lacey was the longest-serving state legislator in Virginia's history. Anyone who worked with him knew that he was a true force. He knew how to get things done. We represented many of the same communities over the years, and I was always impressed by his passion for serving his fellow Virginians. Lacey was a kind man as well and loyal to his Big Island roots. I am honored to have called him a mentor and a friend. My prayers are with Carmela and his family during this difficult time. With his passing, Virginia lost one of the great ones. While he may be gone from this earth, there is no doubt that his legacy of service will live on.

We Need Pro-Growth Tax Reform Now
Why reform the tax code? The answer is simple – what we have today is not working for American families, workers, job creators, and the economy. Today’s tax code just doesn’t compete on a global level. Instead of bringing jobs and company headquarters to our communities, this lack of competitiveness has driven American jobs overseas. This, along with outrageous compliance costs and time devoted to navigating the tax code, holds back job creation. Most of all, it’s our friends and neighbors who depend on these jobs that feel this impact the most. 
￼
It’s been 31 years since the last major overhaul of America’s tax code. In that time, the tax code has grown into an unwieldly, overly-complex mammoth. I know from talking to folks in the Sixth District that very few think that the tax code today is fair. From farmers, manufacturers, and even people I run into on street, it’s one of the most common questions I get: when is Washington going to do something about taxes?   I have long supported moving forward on tax reform, including introducing legislation to scrap the tax code and force Congress to act on a new system. Last month, leaders in the House of Representatives, Senate, and White House came together to announce intentions to move forward with bold, pro-growth tax reform. This reform centers on three main ideas: growing jobs and paychecks nationwide, making the tax code simpler and fairer for all Americans, and helping middle-class families, not special interests. In the House, we have been working on a blueprint for tax reform for several years. Now, the House Ways and Means Committee will begin producing legislation to bring before Congress in the coming months.  We can all agree that the current tax system is broken, and keeping it is not in America’s best interest. As this process moves forward, I hope you will let me know your suggestions for tax reform by contacting me at Goodlatte.House.Gov. I will continue working to enact a simpler, fairer, and less burdensome tax code that allows hardworking families to keep more of their money and encourages businesses to invest in the future. We need pro-growth tax reform now. Click here to read my full weekly column.

Kansas Common Sense  August 28, 2017
Hello,
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. 
Hosting Army Chief of Staff Gen. Milley at Fort Riley
It was a privilege to host the Chief of Staff of the Army, General Mark A. Milley, at Fort Riley during the Big Red One's 100 Year Anniversary.  As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, I invited Gen. Milley to tour the new Irwin Army Community Hospital; the General played an influential role in its completion and I’m glad he was able to see first-hand how patients benefit from the hospital. Throughout the tour, it was evident that Gen. Milley is committed to the well-being and care of our soldiers and their families.  Additionally, I attended a dinner at Fort Riley honoring Gen. Milley and his work on behalf of our country’s military.  Thank you to Major General Joseph Martin, 1st Infantry Division and Senior Mission Commander, Fort Riley, and the hospital leadership and staff for hosting us.
￼  
Attending the Junction City and Manhattan-area Chamber of Commerce Victory Week Luncheon
Major General Joe Martin invited me to the 1st Infantry Division Victory Week Luncheon on Wednesday. Each year during Victory Week, the Junction City Military Affairs Council and the Manhattan Military Relations Committee host a combined luncheon. This year, MG Martin was the guest speaker, and he gave a presentation about the Big Red One’s recent deployment to Iraq.  I valued his update about the progress made in combating ISIS and eliminating its reign over the Iraqi people. I will continue to work hard in Washington to make certain that our soldiers are provided with the proper resources needed to defend our freedom. 
Hosting Townhalls Around the State
Throughout my time in Congress, I have been committed to holding townhall meetings to hear from the Kansans I serve. Last week’s stops provided me with valuable feedback from Kansans that I need in order to do my job representing you in Washington.  Last week, I hosted townhall meetings in Lane and Sherman counties.  Healy Listening Tour It was great to visit the Eagles' Landing in Healy to discuss the VA, healthcare, rising premiums, immigration, the farm bill, crop insurance, NAFTA and education.  Thanks to Jeff Allen for helping to organize the townhall. Also, thanks to state school board member Sally Cauble and Healy Principal Beverly Roemer for attending. 
￼
Goodland Listening Tour On Friday, I hosted a Listening Tour stop in Sherman County at the Northwest Kansas Technical College following the weekly Goodland Rotary meeting. We discussed a number of topics including healthcare, foreign policy, Medicare and social security, tax reform and my continued opposition to privatizing air traffic control.  Thank you to all who attended. I appreciate the Goodland Rotarians’ hospitality and am proud to be a fellow Rotarian.
￼  
Working to Sustain NIH funding
As Congress works to make improvements to our health care system, we should make certain we continue to prioritize medical research and its ability to save lives tomorrow through today’s investments. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) plays a critical role nationwide in directing our medical research community.  I recently visited the NIH headquarters in Bethesda, Md., accompanied by NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins, several directors of NIH Institutes, University of Kansas Chancellor Douglas Girod and members of the KU Alzheimer’s Disease Center, to see firsthand the work being done by some of our nation’s leading physicians and scientists. After touring NIH’s facilities and discussing research progress on neurodegenerative diseases — specifically, Alzheimer’s — it is clear, now more than ever, that sustained funding for the NIH is essential for the next generation of Americans and will help lower health care costs in the future.  Read my full op-ed in the Lawrence Journal-World here.
￼
Stopping in Grinnell and Touring McCarty Farms
I stopped in Grinnell to meet with community members on Friday. I discussed the farm economy, the farm bill, trade and trucking issues with folks at Equity Bank, Hometown Grocery and Senior Center. I also toured McCarty Family Farms near Rexford to discuss dairy issues and the growing dairy industry in Kansas.  Grateful for visits like this and the warm welcome Kansans provide to visitors.
￼
Honored to Serve You in Washington
It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

The Webster Wire
Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends:
I had another great week in the district meeting with business owners, local leaders and families. I spent time at the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and discussed the ongoing efforts to preserve Florida’s waterways and coastlines. Crystal River National Refuge is the only refuge created for the protection of the Florida manatee and preserves the undeveloped spring habitat in Kings Bay. Throughout my public service, I have advocated for policies that support local projects and find solutions that preserve and protect Florida’s precious natural resources, while balancing the needs of our growing economy.
￼ ￼
_______________
It was great hearing from the constituents who attended my listening sessions in their neighborhoods this week. Thank you for coming and sharing your concerns about the environment, healthcare for veterans, tax reform, and healthcare.

I was honored to volunteer with Habitat for Humanity of Citrus County who is bringing people together to build hope in Citrus County.
￼ ￼
_______________
Last Wednesday, I was pleased to speak at the Leesburg Rotary and provided a congressional update. Afterwards, I attended the ribbon cutting ceremony for The Joint Institute at The Villages Regional Hospital. 
_______________
I enjoyed visiting the Richloam General Store and learning about the history of the community of Richloam. Owner, Eric Burkes' Great Uncle opened the store in the 1920s which served as the Post Office and general store for the community of Richloam until 1936. These businesses are part of the engine of the economy and our small towns that are the bedrock communities of our nation. 
￼
_______________
Agriculture is one of the three pillars of Florida’s economy. Farmers and ranchers all over Florida grow and raise the food that ends up on kitchen tables around the world. I visited the Mazak family cattle ranch and rock mine, Webster Farm Supply and owner and John Graham’s cattle ranch. We discussed issues and concerns facing today’s cattle ranchers. Florida's cattle industry, one of the oldest and largest in the nation, has contributed greatly to Florida's economic growth and natural resources.
￼
_______________
I was honored to present a flag flown over the Capitol to AMVETS Post 2006 in Leesburg, VFW Post 9236 in Hernando Beach VFW Post 10084 in Lake Panasoffkee and American Legion Post 186 in Brooksville as a token of appreciation for their service to our great nation. We owe our veterans a debt we’ll never be able to repay.

Constituent Corner
A constituent from Silver Springs reached out to my office because he had applied for Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) several years ago but had been denied each time and was currently waiting on determination from the appeals council. Our office place an inquiry with Social Security. After about a month, our office received an update that the constituents case was approved and his benefits would begin once processing finished with the processing center. 
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.

For the 9th Time, Senator Collins Chairs JDRF Children’s Congress to Raise Awareness about Type 1 Diabetes
￼
“I want my disease to go away – for me and all the other kids who suffer from it. I want us all to be able to live without thinking about it. That’s why I am here,” said 10-year-old Gray native Charlie Albair at a hearing on Type 1 diabetes (T1D) chaired by Senator Collins.   Senator Collins, the Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee and founder of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, invited Charlie to testify at the JDRF Children’s Congress, a biennial event to raise awareness about T1D. Brady Chappell of Naples also attended the hearing as one of the 160 Children’s Congress delegates who are selected through a national competition based on letters they wrote stating why a cure for T1D is important to them. This was the 9th Children’s Congress Senator Collins has chaired.   “I want to give a special welcome to the two delegates from Maine, Charlie Albair of Gray and Brady Chappell of Naples. I am proud that you are here representing our great State of Maine,” Senator Collins said. “I
￼
appreciate that you have shared your personal stories and told us what it’s like to live with diabetes, just how serious it is, and why it is so important that Congress fund the research necessary to discover better treatments and, ultimately, a cure.”   “Since I started the Senate Diabetes Caucus, funding for diabetes research has more than tripled from $319 million in 1997 to more than a billion dollars this year,” Senator Collins continued. “As a result, we have seen encouraging developments in the management, treatment, and potential cures for Type 1 diabetes. With continuation of this investment, the children here today can look forward to a better and brighter tomorrow.”   Charlie, who loves baseball and aspires to play for the Red Sox, urged Senators to continue to support diabetes research, promising that “if you do, I will invite you to a game when I am on the Red Sox.”

Senator Collins Announces $7.89 Million Grant for Project to Improve Rail Capacity in Northern Maine
Senator Collins announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded Maine a $7,890,000 grant through the FASTLANE program to repair and upgrade 22 rail bridges on the Madawaska Subdivision of the Maine Northern Railway. This funding will help create jobs, improve competitiveness, and provide an economic boost for the state.   As the Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Collins has worked to fully fund the FASTLANE program so that it can provide critically needed resources for transportation projects in Maine and across our country. Maine DOT Commissioner David Bernhardt expressed appreciation for Senator Collins’ work to support infrastructure in Maine.   “This FASTLANE grant is a critical piece of funding for the upgrades and improvements of railroad bridges in northern Maine,” said Commissioner Bernhardt. “I want to thank Senator Susan Collins once again for her continued efforts in recognizing the importance of Maine’s transportation system.” 
￼  Plan Authored by Senators Collins and McCaskill to Improve Generic Drug Competition, Expand Patient Access to Affordable Medication Signed into Law
Provisions authored by Senators Susan Collins and Claire McCaskill (D-MO) to improve generic competition and lower the cost of prescription drugs was signed into law as part of the FDA Reauthorization Act. Senator Collins recently spoke from the Senate floor in support of her plan, which will help foster a competitive marketplace to improve the affordability and accessibility of prescription drugs for patients.   “Drug companies should not be able to increase their prices dramatically by thousands of percent overnight without any justification or development of the drug to improve its effectiveness, for example,” said Senator Collins in her remarks from the Senate floor. “Our legislation will help to foster a much healthier and more competitive marketplace as the best defense against such exploitation. I am pleased that our bipartisan plan will increase generic competition, which is so important to American families and particularly our seniors, who take a disproportionate number of the prescription drugs that are prescribed in this country.”   In December 2015, Senators Collins and McCaskill, the Chairman and former Ranking Member of the Senate Aging Committee, launched a bipartisan investigation into the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to egregious price spikes for certain drugs. Their investigation included a series of hearings that strived to understand why companies can make these large price increases and to identify which policies should be considered to counter these disturbing practices. In December 2016, Senators Collins and McCaskill released a report on drug pricing that detailed the Committee’s findings.   Click HERE to read more about Senators Collins and McCaskill’s plan.

Visiting Dove Tail Bat Company in Shirley
Paul and Theresa Lancisi recently gave Senator Collins a tour of their small business, Dove Tail Bat Company, which manufactures bats for Major League Baseball
￼
players in Shirley, Maine. Baseball players of all age and experience levels use the high-quality bats for training to Little League to World Series victories. Dove Tail Bat Company uses ash, maple, and birch wood that is grown locally, carefully selected, and hand split at the company’s log mill.   The Lancisis plan to more than double their production of bats to 30,000 this year, up from 14,000 bats in 2016. The catalyst for this tremendous growth was a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), which allowed them to construct a building, buy machinery, and increase inventory through the winter. Senator Collins, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, has strongly advocated for the CDBG program, which has helped a number of Maine communities create new economic opportunities. 
￼
At Maine Med’s Research Institute in Scarborough, Senator Collins Announces $20 Million NIH Grant, Tours Cutting-Edge Facility 
￼
Senator Collins visited the Maine Medical Center Research Institute (MMCRI) in Scarborough to announce a five-year, $20 million grant awarded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The funding will be used to establish the Northern New England Clinical and Translational Research Network, which will be composed of MMCRI, the University of Southern Maine, and the University of Vermont. The consortium will collaborate on biomedical research and help implement innovative medical treatments for many chronic diseases prevalent in Maine and the region.   ""This $20 million grant will help spur the advancement of treatments, means of prevention, and cures for diseases that affect nearly every American family. The establishment of this consortium is a credit to the skilled scientists at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute and its partnering institutions, including the University of Southern Maine,” said Senator Collins. “As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I have strongly advocated for increased funding for biomedical research. By helping to foster collaboration among researchers and implement innovative medical treatments, this investment will help us conquer so many diseases that take both an emotional and financial toll.”  
￼
The award will help researchers develop and implement innovative medical treatments for many chronic diseases that are common in Northern New England such as cancer, heart disease, obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and substance abuse. Research activities will also focus on defining optimal methods of prevention and health care delivery in rural environments, where approximately 60 percent of Maine’s population resides. Tufts University School of Medicine and the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth will collaborate with the three partners that constitute the research consortium.   This year, Senator Collins helped secure $2 billion in additional funding to support research at the NIH. The investment built on a $2 billion increase she successfully advocated for last year, the largest funding boost the NIH had received in more than a decade. 
￼
Senator Collins Attends Kennebec Valley YMCA Reception
￼
Senator Collins attended a reception for the Kennebec Valley YMCA, which has enriched families and children through competition, learning, and just plain fun for more than 100 years. In return, the community has built a strong Y through its generous support. At the reception, Senator Collins heard stories from YMCA members and local residents about the importance of the organization to the community.
￼
Legislation to Extend Veterans Choice Program Signed into Law with Provisions Authored by Senator Collins
Senator Collins’ provisions will help maintain ARCH veterans’ access to health care in their communities, address delays in authorizing VA medical facilities
As a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees the Department of Veterans Affairs, Senator Collins has worked to ensure that veterans have convenient access to the high-quality health care that they have earned through their service.   Last week, the President signed into law the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act that was cosponsored by Senator Collins. The legislation includes provisions Senator Collins authored to authorize more than two dozen leases for Community-Based Outpatient Clinics across the country, including one in Portland, and ensure Northern Maine veterans who received local health services through the ARCH pilot maintain similar access to care in their communities under the Choice program. 
￼
Congratulating Waterville Public Library on National Recognition
￼
The Waterville Public Library was recently awarded the prestigious 2017 National Medal for Museum and Library Service, the highest honor the nation bestows upon museums and libraries for exceptional service to America’s communities. The award is given to only 10 institutions nationwide each year.   Senator Collins met with Cindy Jacobs, the President of the Waterville Public Library Board of Trustees, to congratulate the library's staff and volunteers on receiving this well-deserved achievement. 
￼
Senator Collins’ Resolution to Support Purple Heart Day Unanimously Passes Senate
￼
The Purple Heart is a reminder that freedom is a gift purchased at the greatest possible price. Congress recently passed a resolution authored by Senator Collins supporting the goals and ideals of National Purple Heart Recognition Day, which was August 7th. The annual commemoration honors all of the brave men and women who have made tremendous sacrifices to defend our nation.   Just as the Purple Heart Medal has held a special meaning to its millions of recipients and family members, it also has special significance to Senator Collins’ family. Her father, Don Collins, is a World War II veteran who was wounded twice during the Battle of the Bulge. He earned two Purple Hearts and the Bronze Star.

August 28, 2017
Dear Friend,
Like a lot of families, the Kilmers are gearing up for back to school. It was a full summer for my daughters, Sophie and Tess, with trips to Hurricane Ridge, Neah Bay (this weekend – for Makah Days!), and a few summer camps. The highlight, for me, was watching their performance last weekend at the completion of their Theater Camp at the Admiral Theater in Bremerton.
I was proud to watch Sophie fly across the stage (not literally) as Peter Pan and Tess embrace the role of Maleficent. It speaks volumes that the talented directors at this camp were able to wrangle all these kids into putting on such shows.
￼
￼
Frankly, they accomplished more in two weeks than Congress has managed to do.
That’s especially troubling considering the number of deadlines Congress faces after Labor Day. For one, Congress must take action on the debt limit. And Congress must pass a budget. As a quick refresher, since the debt limit suspension expired on March 15, the Treasury Department has used ‘extraordinary measures’ to continue paying America’s bills. The department will be out of those options by October. If Congress does nothing, the resulting damage to the economy would make it more expensive for folks to borrow money to buy a car or home, start a business or expand one.
Simply put, America should pay its bills. I strongly believe our nation should get a handle on our long-term fiscal challenges. The debt is a problem that doesn’t get better by having Congress hide its head in the sand. That’s why, as I’ve written previously, I’ve pushed Congress to pass a “Fiscal State of the Nation” bill and to work in a bipartisan way to address our long-term debt. 
But defaulting on our nation’s existing obligations would make no sense at all. When folks have asked me about this, I’ve explained that it’s a bit like choosing not to pay the minimum balance on your credit card or your home mortgage. It’s a choice you could make, but it would do lasting damage to your credit score.
The TV show The West Wing did a good (and funny) job of explaining the challenges related to the debt ceiling in an episode 13 years (and trillions of dollars) ago. You can watch it here.
Beyond that, Congress needs to pass a budget. If things went according to plan, Congress would pass a budget in the Spring. As we sit here today, Congress has not even voted on a budget. As a consequence, federal agencies and the folks who depend on them are largely flying blind. I feel so strongly about the need for Congress to pass a budget, I’ve sponsored a bill that’s somewhat controversial in DC. It’s called “No Budget, No Pay.” It says that if members of Congress don’t do their jobs and pass a budget, they shouldn’t get paid.
But there’s more. Congress also needs to pass twelve appropriations bills by the end of the fiscal year – September 30. Heading into September two-thirds of the appropriations bills the House needs to pass have yet to be voted on. The Senate hasn’t taken any up. That means we could see a shutdown at the end of the month.
If this sounds frustratingly like the movie Groundhog Day, then you’re right. We saw a few years ago how damaging a government shutdown was. It hurt federal workers. It undercut the ability of federal agencies to execute their missions. And it hammered local businesses too. Restaurants and hotels and shops near Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and near the National Park were hit hard. In fact, the last shutdown cost the American economy tens of billions of dollars. 
This is not an approach families or businesses would take to budgeting. Without a budget we could also see a return of the across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration. Again, that’s a mindless gimmick.
So, in the weeks ahead, I’m going to do everything I can to push for a smarter, more constructive approach. One that doesn’t rely on gimmicks and brinkmanship but, rather, that focuses on dealing with our nation’s financial challenges problems head-on.
Hate in Charlottesville
Today marks the 54th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr’s ‘I Have a Dream’ speech. In front of thousands of people – from near and far, rich and poor, black and white, faith community leaders, elected officials, union leaders, activists, and concerned Americans – Dr. King challenged this nation to live up to its creed – a creed based in the notion of equality as a basic right for everyone. He spoke of a dream of people of different races being able to join hands and live in harmony – “to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.” 
That peaceful march and Dr. King’s words stand in such sharp contrast to what we saw in Charlottesville a couple of weeks ago. Rather than peace, we saw violence – and even a tragic loss of life.
Rather than standing in the shadow of the great American who signed the Emancipation Proclamation, we saw Neo-Nazis and white supremacists standing in front of painful symbols of the Confederacy.
Rather than an aspirational dream, we heard division and hate speak.
It was a reminder that, while we’ve made progress as a nation, we have a long way to go to fulfill Dr. King’s dream.
Let me say what I wish the President had said immediately, consistently, and clearly: There is no room in American politics for the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis. Or any other group that seeks to oppress others. Violence is wrong. Racism is wrong. Bigotry is wrong.
Dr. King once said that: “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” But it doesn’t bend on its own. It bends because each of us work harder to build Dr. King’s dream. I was reminded of that when I recently sat down with the NAACP of Tacoma for their awards banquet. Every day in our community folks are going about the quiet work of making our country a better place. They deserve our gratitude.
￼
An Afghanistan Update
The President also recently made news with a speech declaring his intent to send more troops to Afghanistan. It’s clear that the Taliban and other groups operating in that country wish to do us harm. But it’s critical for us to have a serious discussion about this plan before we put more American servicemembers in harm’s way.
A couple newsletters back I noted that Congress passed an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against Al Qaeda following the attacks on 9/11. Rather than green-lighting decisions based on a 16-year-old authorization, I think it’s time for Congress to have a real debate regarding what exactly an authorization of military force should look like in our current world.
Congress needs to ensure the executive branch is acting responsibility to keep our nation safe and also keep our soldiers from getting bogged down in a never-ending conflict. A new AUMF is critical to ensuring we have a clearly defined mission and a strategy for success.
A Plug for 21st Century Apprenticeships
I’ve written about a bill I’ve cosponsored to further the use of tech apprenticeships to help us build the middle class. I recently stopped by Infoblox – a rapidly growing Tacoma company—to talk about how my legislation could help bring new folks from all walks of life through the Infoblox doors. We had a great discussion with local leaders and workers from the company and I’m excited about what we can do in the future.
￼
You can read more about this initiative in my blog, and learn about my visit with Infoblox here.
Support for Local Initiatives
I’ve written extensively about my concerns with the President’s proposed budget. And in the past two weeks we’ve gotten some prime examples of why it’s important for the federal government to be a partner in our region. If we were to pass the President’s budget, some key investments that help businesses and folks in our region would be put at risk.
For example, the Department of Labor announced more than $2 million in grants to YouthBuild, a pre-apprenticeship program dedicated to supporting at-risk people ages 16-24. 
In our region, two groups received these honors. In Tacoma, Goodwill of the Olympics & Rainier Region received $1.1 million in funding, and in Bremerton, Olympic Educational Service District 114 received $1.078 million.
With this investment from the Department of Labor, we can make sure that opportunity is extended to folks in all communities – no matter their zip code.
Another recently announced change that will play an essential role in our community is an additional investment in the ShakeAlert Earthquake Early Warning System.
In the event of an earthquake off the coast of Washington, folks will have only minutes or less to get to higher ground. I've fought for this Earthquake Early Warning System because it will be a literal lifesaver for people in our region. Imagine what a few seconds of warning can mean for a teacher in a classroom, a doctor doing surgery, a commuter crossing a bridge, or an office worker getting into an elevator.
While the president’s budget proposed eliminating federal funding for this effort, I’ve played a leading role on the Appropriations Committee in keeping funding for the system going. The new award from the United States Geological Survey will put $4.9 million toward bringing the ShakeAlert system online.  
Celebrating a Legend
I was honored to be on hand with Dan Evans, our former Governor and former Senator for the dedication of the Daniel J. Evan Wilderness Area in Olympic National Park. In addition to thanking Dan Evans for his leadership, I had to confess to him that I wasn’t sure what to call him (Governor? Senator? This seems like the only time that the phrase “Governator” might actually be appropriate!)
The backdrop of the park reminded us that the outdoors bring together families, friends, and neighbors. There has been no greater champion for protecting these outdoors spaces than Dan Evans.
He helped create the North Cascades National Park, Alpine Lakes Wilderness and Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area. His legacy helped shape our state and also shaped future generations of elected leaders who now carry the charge of environmental stewardship forward.
Most importantly, his work reminds us that when it comes to protecting precious outdoors spaces it’s not about Democrats or Republicans – it’s about Washingtonians.  
￼
District Visits
Thanks to the entire Peninsula School District team for the phenomenal work it does. Great to see so many business and civic leaders at the Partners in Learning event to extend gratitude and wish the faculty, staff and administrators best wishes for a good school year!
￼
I was happy to join the Earth Economics team in Tacoma to discuss everything from flooding to ocean acidification, and lands management to Puget Sound restoration efforts. They do really interesting work looking at how human economies interact with our environmental challenges. Thanks for taking time to meet with me!
￼
I spoke to a group from the State Board for Community and Technical Colleges about the value of collaboration. Doing an outdoor speech during the eclipse was a bit …different. This is officially the first time that I gave a speech that blocked out the sun.
￼
I had an awesome visit to the Clallam County Fair and met with a ton of people (including County Commissioner Randy Johnson with whom I talked cross-laminated timber). Then, my tour of the fried foods of Western Washington continued with a deep fried Snickers bar. 
￼
I spent a recent afternoon visiting the leadership team at a great local community financial institution, Kitsap Bank. We chatted about their operations and growth in the region and discussed their upcoming EDG3 Fund finale in November. This is the 4th year that Kitsap Bank has offered this entrepreneurship competition focused on sustainability, with the winning small business getting a $20k prize!
￼
I spent one of my lunch hours visiting with the employees of Skookum in Bremerton for an employee town hall (ok, we ate BBQ too). Skookum is a leader in providing training and jobs for people with disabilities, and have made a name for themselves in our region as a dedicated and community-driven organization. I want to thank President and CEO Jeff Dolven for giving me the opportunity to hear from the people who work there and to answer questions.
￼
At Bremerton High School, I spoke to the West Sound teachers and highlighted the need for this education funding. I even got the chance to talk to some students who told me they were excited about the new school year. With great students and teachers, the school year is bound to be a success!
￼
OK – that’s it for this time. Thanks for reading. And, as always, thanks for the opportunity to represent you!
Sincerely,
￼ 
Derek Kilmer

Dear Friend, 

From the factory floor to your local coffee shop, I have been traveling throughout the First Congressional District to listen to your thoughts on a wide variety of issues and to share with you what Congress has been working to accomplish. To read more of my column in today's Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, please click on the link.

COMP PERFORMANCE GROUP

Manufacturers in the First District have unique needs. It is important that I understand those needs so I can ensure the environment created by the federal government allows them to continue to expand and create jobs for more Mississippians. Last week, COMP Performance Group was one of five companies we visited. COMP's Olive Branch facility is their worldwide distribution center. 

￼

COMP Performance Group is a leading manufacturer of products used by custom automotive enthusiasts and racecar drivers. Employees ship products used for all race and street performance engines to countries all over the world.  


YOKOHAMA TIRE MANUFACTURING MISSISSIPPI

In October 2013, Yokohama Tire Manufacturing Mississippi, LLC. executives joined federal, state and local leaders in West Point to break ground. Two years later, I was proud to be a part of the grand opening ceremony to celebrate the company's $300 million investment in Clay County. Yokohama has grown to 470 employees.  

￼


During our tour, I talked with Yokohama executives who say the driving force behind the decision to locate to north Mississippi was the ready and available workforce, support from community colleges and universities for training, and the pro-business climate in Mississippi. 


ASICS AMERICA CORPORATION

Hardworking Mississippians continue to attract manufacturers to the First District. Derick Tate, a supervisor at the distribution center, began working for ASICS ten years ago. He has worked his way up from a re-stocker to his current position.

￼

It is because of people like Derick, that in 2010 ASICS America Corporation chose to locate the distribution center in the Chickasaw Trails Industrial Park in Byhalia. Since then, they have grown the Byhalia location and consolidated their footwear and apparel operations under one roof. 


TVA MAGNOLIA

In 1935, the City of Tupelo became the first to get electricity through the Tennessee Valley Authority. TVA has come a long way since then by seeking a wide variety of ways to lower power bills. Currently, TVA generates electricity using a combination of nuclear, coal, hydro, wind power, and natural gas. 
                                             
￼

We toured the TVA Magnolia Combined Cycle Power Plant in Ashland which is the newest to go online with natural gas. TVA Magnolia produces enough power to sustain 519,800 homes. Keeping energy
costs down attracts more businesses and industries and creates jobs.
                                            

ACCO BRANDS

ACCO Brands is one of the world's largest suppliers of branded school, office, and consumer products. Bob Alley, general manager for the company's regional headquarters in Booneville, says they are proud to have products that are made in America. Every product that is made in Booneville proudly displays that fact on the box. 

￼
ACCO Brands General Manger Bob Alley (left) 
discusses the regional headquarters operation 

Since 2009, ACCO Brands has concentrated on bringing jobs back to the U.S., specifically to Booneville. We saw that firsthand during our tour of the operation. Through insourcing from China, Florida, and Manila, Philippines, ACCO Brands has brought new work and jobs to Booneville. Company decisions such as this one have enabled ACCO Brands to triple their volume and have more strategic support from their customers. We are thankful for their investment in north Mississippi.

March on Washington Anniversary
""I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.'"" 54 years ago today these magnificent words were spoken to over 250,000 people at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial by Civil Rights Leader Martin Luther King, Jr. Today, sadly, we are still faced with challenges of racism and hate that are disturbing reminders of our nation's past. We must always be mindful of the struggles our neighbors face to turn away from hate and towards love and acceptance as MLK preached about so many years ago.

Meggitt Women in Aerospace Discussion
Thank you to Meggitt for allowing me to lead an important discussion Monday about women in aerospace! We have to bring all of our best and brightest into the talent pool. This means reforming our education and training systems, and strengthening the programs in place that are already improving the recruitment and engagement of women and minorities. Thank you to all of the Meggitt staff who attended and shared their experiences and institutional knowledge on the importance of expanding women's roles in aerospace.

8/28/17 17:34,Arkansans Call For Tax Reform ,"District Update | August 28, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email
￼
Dear Friends,
Thirty-one years ago, President Ronald Reagan signed tax reform into law. Since then, our tax code has become so big and so broken that now it is discouraging job creation and investment and weighing down our economy. It is blocking hardworking Arkansans and Americans from getting ahead and hurting our small businesses.   I support a tax code that lets Arkansans and Americans keep more of what they have earned. We need a tax code that is simpler, flatter, and fairer –  a tax code that lets businesses grow and expand to create jobs and support families.   My good friend, Rachael Cox, showed me around Conway Machine and Bison Pumps, and we talked about simplifying our tax code to help our local manufacturers be more competitive at home and abroad. To watch, click HERE.
￼

In Conway, I visited with Louis and Steve Shrekenhofer, owners of family-run Leather Brothers. They shared with me their frustration with our outdated tax system. As job creators and successful small business owners, they want to see a tax system that is pro-growth and pro-business and that works for them and the community they serve. 

Today’s burdensome U.S. tax code makes our businesses less competitive around the world. And when your businesses, workers, and “Made in America” products cannot compete and win globally, the result is fewer jobs, smaller paychecks, and less economic growth here at home.

The Committee on Ways and Means has held a series of public hearings focused on how to make our tax system work better for the American people. So far, these hearings have examined the challenges facing American businesses and workers in the global tax environment, tax-related challenges facing families and small businesses, and Member-driven solutions that would transform our tax code. 

               ￼
Today, small and closely held businesses create roughly half of all jobs in the United States. Yet, these businesses are currently taxed at rates as high as 44.6 percent. Starting and sustaining a small business in America is difficult enough. Our broken tax code only makes it harder by forcing Main Street job creators to send too much of their income to Washington.  The House’s tax reform package will be simpler, flatter, and fairer, and it will let businesses grow and expand to create jobs and support families. It will let Arkansans and Americans keep more of what they have earned. 
￼

That means:

✔ More job opportunities
✔ Bigger paychecks
✔ Lowest tax rates in modern history
✔ Greater financial security

Doing your taxes should be as simple as filling out a postcard. The burdens and complexities of our current broken tax code comes at a real cost to Arkansans and Americans all over our country. Independent estimates show that taxpayers spend a combined $99 BILLION each year complying with the individual income tax – money families could otherwise use on what is important to them. 

We're working in Congress to reform our tax code so it promotes economic growth and opportunity for all people. I'm am proud of the work Chairman Kevin Brady and the House Ways and Means Committee is doing to fight for these improvements. Visit them at waysandmeans.house.gov. 

Sincerely,
￼ 
Representative French Hill

Wittman Visits 7th Fleet

WASHINGTON – Congressman Rob Wittman (VA-01), Chairman of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, released the following statement following his August 28th visit to the U.S. 7th Fleet, headquartered in Yokosuka, Japan in response to the collision of the USS John S. McCain off the coast of Singapore on August 21:
“I met with Vice Admiral Sawyer earlier today and was encouraged that he shares my concern for rapidly improving the safety of our fleet.  I continue to believe that there are underlying problems with the forward deployed navy forces that need to be improved including the material condition and training readiness levels of our Navy forces.  I look forward to discussing the welfare of our sailors and addressing these underlying problems with Navy leadership in early September.” 
As a result of continuing concerns associated with the collisions of the USS John McCain and the USS Fitzgerald, Congressman Wittman visited the U.S. 7th Fleet during a Congressional Delegation Visit to the Pacific Command Area of Responsibility to include a discussion with the new 7th Fleet Commander, VADM Sawyer, and other sailors at the Yokosuka Naval Base.
On September 7th, the House Armed Services Committee will host a joint hearing between the Subcommittees on Seapower & Projection Forces and Readiness on “Navy Readiness – Underlying Problems Associated with the USS Fitzgerald and USS John S. McCain"". Witnesses for the hearing will be VADM Thomas S. Rowden, Commander, Naval Surface Forces, United States Navy and Mr. John H. Pendleton, Director, Defense Force Structure and Readiness Issues, U.S. Government Accountability Office 


Congressman Rob Wittman represents the 1st District of Virginia. He serves on the House Natural Resources Committee and the House Armed Services Committee, where he is Chairman of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee.

Dear Lindsey,
During the August district work period, Ive been staying busy in Oklahoma. Ive been all over town meeting with the great folks of the Fifth District, addressing the concerns of our community at civic organizations, policy groups, and our chamber of commerce. Ive also visited some of our local businesses and community banks, as well as the FBIs office in Oklahoma City to meet some of the OKC Division agents that keep us all safe. I applaud the work of the FBI and local law enforcement for investigating and arresting a man who sought to commit an act of domestic terrorism in Oklahoma City on August 12. Our intelligence community and local law enforcement work every day to protect our neighborhoods, and they often do it without the public ever knowing.
 
I was glad to speak with the Oklahoma City Economic Roundtable at Oklahoma City Universitys Meinders School of Business earlier this month. I took the opportunity to discuss my continued concerns with the proposed privatization of the FAAs air traffic control system. The impact this legislation would have not only on general aviation, but on national security, cannot be overstated. If this proposal were to become law, there would be no prohibition on the hiring of foreign nationals as air traffic controllers. There would be no oaths of office for those in the control towers dealing with not just our flights that happen every day, but also all of the things that go on with our military, our intelligence services, the FBI, drug enforcement, and border security. While I am supportive of modernizing our aviation and airspace infrastructure, it is very important that we do not relinquish control of our national air space.
 
On a visit to Oklahoma Citys Capitol Hill, I toured a newly renovated library which will open this fall. Cindy and I raised five kids, and moved 15 times over my 21 year career in the Army. With all of the moves, we often had to homeschool our children and we were grateful for the resources that were available to us at local libraries. Libraries provide access to knowledge, and its good to see the southeast Oklahoma City community working together to support this important resource.
 
I was honored to speak to an interfaith group seeking to make a difference in the lives of young people in the foster and adoption community. As a father of three adopted children in addition to my two biological daughters, I spoke about my experiences in parenting. During my time as an Oklahoma state senator, I was a staunch advocate for adoption reform. The family unit makes a positive impact on the life of a child. In the case of my own adopted children, their lives would have been very different if they had been raised in an orphanage rather than in a family.
 
As an aviator myself, earlier this month I enjoyed meeting with the good folks of the FAAs Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, which is the largest Department of Transportation office outside of Washington, DC. Ive also been working with state and military leaders to prevent the installation of wind turbines in western Oklahoma that would compromise vital airspace that is utilized daily by several air force bases in the region for military training maneuvers. We must keep that airspace clear of obstacles that could impact the ability of our air force servicemembers to access their training areas.
 
While speaking with several of these groups during the August district work period, I expressed my opposition to raising the federal debt limit.  As a nation we are $20 trillion in debt, and we simply cant continue down the path were on. Cutting government waste has been a core objective of mine since coming to Congress. Ive introduced 12 cost cutting bills this Congress, which if enacted would save the taxpayer $28.5 billion. My legislation has cut $4 billion from the federal budget thus far, and Ive published seven editions of my Waste Watch report highlighting a total of more than $300 billion in wasteful government spending.
 
For this last week of the August district work period, Ill be meeting with constituents and speaking with business owners and job creators in our community. To make it easier for you to see what Im up to, I launched my official Snapchat account earlier this month. With more than 166 million users, and 45 percent of Americans between ages 18 and 34 on Snapchat, this platform provides a modern way to engage with elected officials. Use my Snapchat code to follow me on Snapchat.
 
As always, it is an honor to continue to serve the country and the people of Oklahoma.
 
 
With respect,
Steve

VEHICLE ATTACKS, THE SECOND AMENDMENT, AND A FREE SOCIETY

I was saddened to hear of the recent terrorist attacks in Spain. A terrorist drove a van into a popular Barcelona street packed with pedestrians and other members of the same terrorist cell rammed a car into a crowd in the seaside town of Cambrils. Fifteen people were ultimately killed in the attacks, many of them tourists simply enjoying a holiday.
The attacks in Spain are the latest in a trend. In the past several years, people aiming to cause death and destruction have used automobiles to perform their evil work.
In July 2016, an ISIS-inspired terrorist driving a van killed 84 people at Bastille Day celebrations in Nice, France.
Last December, a terrorist drove a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin, Germany. Twelve people died in the attack.
In April, four people died after a man drove a truck into a crowd in Stockholm, Sweden.
London alone has witnessed three vehicle attacks this year: five were killed by an Islamic extremist in a car at Westminster Bridge in March, eight pedestrians were killed by a van driven by Islamic extremists in June, and one man was killed when a van driver targeted Muslims leaving Ramadan prayers.
Just a week before the Barcelona attack, a man used his car to target soldiers in a suburb of Paris, seriously injuring three of them.
Vehicles attacks have become all too frequent in Europe, and the United States is not immune to them, either. The country recoiled in horror when an alleged white supremacist and/or neo-Nazi plowed a car into a crowd of protestors in Charlottesville in August, killing Heather Heyer.
The unfortunate fact is that when people with hate in their hearts decide they wish to harm others, they will be able to turn just about any item into weapons. The attacks in Spain were the work of a jihadist cell. The murders they committed were mainly by vehicle, but one of the terrorists stabbed an innocent man when hijacking a car, and police suspect the house they were based in was being used as a bomb factory. Clearly, they were intent on wreaking death and destruction by whatever means they could.
The right to drive cars, trucks, vans, etc. is not protected by the U.S. Constitution. Obviously, motorized vehicles were not in existence at the writing of our great constitutional document. And even though animal-driven vehicles existed, the courts have ruled that it is a privilege to drive motorized vehicles on the roads.
There is a constitutional right to bear arms. And it is true that, just like the horrible situations discussed above, guns are often used improperly in acts of violence and/or terror.
After an horrendous act by a gun-wielding assailant, we often hear calls for the control of guns. I do not agree with these calls for gun control! But I do note with curiosity that with more and more common use of cars, vans, and trucks as weapons for violence and terror that some on the left have not started a campaign for “reasonable automobile control.” It is true that you have to be licensed to drive an automobile but some people in this country think drivers’ licenses are overly burdensome on the unlicensed population even though the penalties for driving without a license are not severe.
I am not arguing for automobile control or more severe penalties for driving without a license, but I raise the issue to highlight the double standard by some as it relates to guns.
Restrictions on cars, the constitutionally-guaranteed right to bear arms, or whatever device that might cause great destruction can sometimes seem like a simple fix, but they are more likely to diminish the rights of law-abiding people than the bad guys.
We live in a free society with rights granted by God and protections for those rights built into our Constitution. Likewise, the ability to continue to live in a free society means that we must insist on civil discourse of the important issues of the day instead of resorting to violence and acts of terror.

Friend,

In case you missed it, take a look at this New York Times article about the work we are doing in the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee.  

￼

Our actions speak for themselves. We’ve dedicated our time to addressing the challenges that our veterans face across the board, including access to healthcare, child care, education, and job opportunities. Take a look: 
	•	Action Alert: #ForeverGIBill  
	•	House Passes Wenstrup Bill to Increase Access to Specialty Care Physicians at the VA  
	•	Keeping our promises for veterans benefits  
	•	President Trump signs VA Accountability Bill  
	•	Action Alert: 7 bills for our vets 
As the Chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee on Health, I’ll be sure to keep you posted as I continue to lead on these issues. Our vets are our heroes – we need to make sure they are treated as such. 

Yours in service, 
￼

Dear Friends, 
We have all seen the devastating footage coming out of South Texas during these past few days. In what the National Weather Service is calling an ""event beyond anything experienced"", Hurricane Harvey has affected the lives of countless Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with them during this difficult time.
But, in the wake of the destruction, there have been several stories of bravery, compassion, and courage. Texans have shown the world why the United States of America is truly special: we take care of each other.
In case you missed it, here is a link to a video that captures the bravery of these everyday citizens who have undoubtedly saved countless lives.
￼
If you have loved ones affected by the storm, I encourage you to direct them to our website for helpful information on where to get help.

Dear Friend, 
Last week was a busy one that started with the rare occurrence of a solar eclipse! It was wonderful visiting with everyone at the McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center in Concord for the eclipse watch party, and I hope you had the chance to experience this amazing natural phenomenon as well!  
￼

On Tuesday morning at Dartmouth College’s Organic Farm and then again on Thursday afternoon at La Cite Ecologique Eco-Village in Colebrook, I joined local farmers, foresters, conservationists and other environmental advocates to discuss the 2018 Farm Bill and hear their thoughts about this critical legislation. The Farm Bill, which is reauthorized every five years by Congress, covers issues such as agriculture, nutrition, conservation, forestry, and rural development. Local agriculture plays an important role in our state's identity and economy, and we must ensure this comprehensive bill will help support new and beginning farmers. I’m looking forward to sharing what I heard at both of these sessions with my colleagues in Washington. 
￼

On Tuesday afternoon in Claremont and Thursday morning at Coos County Family Health Services in Berlin, I sat down with healthcare providers, educators, survivors, law enforcement and others to discuss what we can do to prevent sexual violence. In our conversations, we focused on local efforts, services, and challenges surrounding sexual violence in New Hampshire’s rural communities. Sexual violence is not only a moral issue to me; it’s deeply personal. We need to end this all too persistent problem, and I appreciate the opportunity to hear the ideas, perspectives and experiences of the incredible advocates who joined me for these discussions. It is my hope that these conversations will let other survivors of sexual violence know that they are not alone. 
￼

I also hosted a roundtable discussion with the Women’s Rural Entrepreneurial Network (WREN) on Wednesday to talk about issues faced by women-owned small businesses in the North Country, including access to capital, workforce training, and transportation. These hardworking business owners shared with me their thoughts on the Women’s Small Business Ownership Act, legislation I support that would improve access to lending and increase business counseling and training services for women entrepreneurs through the Small Business Administration. WREN is doing incredible work to support Granite State female entrepreneurs and small businesses that are creating jobs and growing our economy. 
￼
With WREN discussing the critical role women entrepreneurs play in the North Country economy and throughout New Hampshire.
Later on Wednesday, I held a town hall forum at Berlin City Hall to discuss my current efforts in Washington and hear directly from local residents about the issues that impact them in the North Country. I’m committed to supporting our local economy, tourism, and veterans, and I will take the ideas I heard with me to Washington as I continue working across party lines to improve the lives of all people in New Hampshire’s second district.
￼
Great to be in Berlin for a town hall meeting to hear from residents about issues important to them.
As always, I encourage you to make your voice heard by writing or calling my office. I appreciate the thousands of people who have taken the time to contact me to share their thoughts and ideas. Your input helps me best advocate for the issues that matter to hardworking Granite State families, and I always welcome your suggestions and questions.   Sincerely,     ￼

Dear Neighbor,
My office is always ready and willing to help in the aftermath of disaster; however, please note that we are not ourselves a relief agency. When a natural disaster occurs, my office works with federal, state and local government officials and tries to restore normalcy as fast as possible. My office can assist with answering questions, directing to resources and on-site assistance, and helping to navigate the FEMA process.

I need to Evacuate, Who Do I call? 
URGENT: If you need assistance evacuating, contact the following numbers. Keep calling until you get through.
The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has also stated that if you are in need of immediate rescue you can call them at the following numbers:
281-464-4851 281-464-4852 281-464-4853 281-464-4854 281-464-4855 Boat rescue - 713-881-3100 



Evacuation of Inverness Forest Subdivison 
This decision was made solely by the Army Corps of Engineers. The release of water from Addicks and Barker Dams will certainly have an impact on Texas 02. The release of this water will supposedly prevent flooding downstream, aiding in flood relief for portions of TX 02. However, it probably will cause flooding in other parts of the district, such as Bear Creek. 
Evacuation Notice ReadyHarris.org:
This is a voluntary evacuation for all residents in the following areas of Inverness Forest Subdivsion. All streets north of Kingsbridge Road, including east and west Greenbrook Drive and Kenchester Drive. Water levels on Cypress Creek near I-45 will possibly top the levee by tomorrow morning. Residents in this area are encouraged to seek higher ground. For more information, please contact the Harris County Flood District at 713-684-4000. 
IN THE EVENT OF A LEVEE BREACH OR FAILURE, THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE STREET AND HOME FLOODING. 
Residents should evacuate all family members and pets. In addition, they should take all medications and important papers, such as insurance policies. 
Maps of the flood plains can be found here: https://t.co/OasrWpUTs2

Dear Lindsey,
From a deployment ceremony for the 238th Aviation Regiment to pumpkin processing in Princeville, I wanted to highlight ten photos from my tour of the 18th District last week:

1. Catching up with H. Wayne Wilson at WTVP
￼
I had the pleasure to stop in and join H. Wayne Wilson's ""At Issue"" program at WTVP studios. We discussed issues facing both the 18th District and our nation, including a long-term infrastructure bill, our current healthcare system, facing hate and bigotry within our communities, battling the opioid epidemic, and also my Congress of Tomorrow Project.
2. Habitat for Heroes
￼
I sat down with Lea Anne Schmidgall of Habitat for Humanity of Greater Peoria to hear about the latest developments our local chapter is working on for our veterans. I have had the honor of serving as Master Sponsor for their most recent Habitat for Heroes build and I am excited for their next project to begin in 2018!
3. Peoria Area Association of Realtors
￼ ￼
I spoke with the Peoria Area Association of Realtors last week to hear their thoughts on tax reform and the importance of public policy that promotes home ownership in our communities.
4. Pumpkin Processing at Seneca Foods
￼
Fun fact: Our Congressional district has two companies that produce and process nearly all of the pumpkin that we find on grocery shelves across the United States and the world. I had the pleasure of touring one of those companies last Thursday--Seneca Foods in Princeville. I enjoyed learning about the company and hearing about the importance of global trade for our agricultural products, such as pumpkin.
5. Senior's on Social
￼
I joined my friend and colleague Rep. Rodney Davis last Thursday in Springfield at the community senior center to host a resource fair for seniors looking to learn about new technologies, how to protect themselves against identity theft, and talk about new online tools being implemented by the Social Security Administration.
6. Deploying Central Illinois Heroes
￼ ￼
Last week, Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion of the 238th Aviation Regiment deployed to Texas before heading to Afghanistan for a nine month tour in support of Operation Freedom Sentinel.
The appreciation for their service to our country cannot be understated and we, as Americans, are all so grateful for their commitment to and sacrifice for our great nation. I wish them a safe tour and our our prayers are with them and their families. We look forward to welcoming them home safely in nine months.
7. Cass-Morgan County Farm Bureau
￼
It was a pleasure to speak to the Cass-Morgan County Farm Bureau last Thursday night at Hamilton's in Jacksonville. It was a great opportunity to hear their perspective on many topics, ranging from crop insurance, to the importance of trade. I look forward to continuing to be a strong advocate for our family farmers in Washington, D.C.
8. Beardstown Infrastructure
￼
I spoke in Beardstown last Thursday to the Corridor 67 Coalition about transportation infrastructure in the area. Our highways, bridges, locks and dams are the backbone of our district and I remain a strong advocate for making these critical investments back here at home.
9. Feedback from our Veterans
￼
On Saturday, I met with my Veteran's Advisory Committee at City Hall in Peoria Heights to hear updates on any issues our veterans are facing or opportunities they have upcoming. Today's meeting also allow me to provide an update on how our work in D.C. will continue to advocate for the needs of our veterans.
10. Route 66 Tropics Sign Awarded Grant
￼
Last Thursday, the National Park Service announced a grant of $17,000 from the Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program to the Tropics Neon Sign Project Committee based in Lincoln, Illinois. This grant will be used to help restore the historic neon sign for the Tropics restaurant in Lincoln, which serves as stop for tourists along Route 66.
For over 60 years, the Tropics restaurant sign has been a well-known landmark, demonstrating the uniqueness that defines the Rt. 66 experience. It is crucial that we maintain this and other iconic stops along the ‘Mother Road,’ which is why I will continue to advocate for Rt. 66’s preservation as a member of the House.

8/28/17 14:33,Time to Limit the Congressional Campaign Season!,"Monday Report from Representative Rick Nolan
￼
 
￼
￼
￼
￼
It’s Time to Restore Our Democracy – and Limit the Congressional Campaign Season
￼
Click on the screen above to hear me explain why limiting the Congressional campaign season is so important to the integrity of our democracy and our public policy making process. 
Dear Friend, 
Non-stop, 365 day a year congressional campaigns tune out voters, tire out candidates, divert Congress away from doing the people’s business, and waste billions of dollars. The simple fact is that endless campaigning and fundraising are toxic to our democracy and our public policymaking process. When members of Congress go to Washington, they need to set campaigning aside, go to work, and govern.
Moreover, non-stop campaigning has done nothing to boost voter participation. According to the highly respected Pew Research organization, the U.S. has ranked an embarrassing 31st among 34 developed nations in voter turnout over the past few election cycles.
So our Restore Democracy legislation calls for limiting the congressional campaign season to 60 days before a primary or a general election. The measure also prohibits members of Congress and their challengers from raising money while Congress is in session.
In fact, limiting the campaign season is a tried and true fix that developed nations all around the world have employed to boost voter interest in elections and put a stop to 24/7 fundraising by the candidates. For example, Canada’s 2015 elections, the longest in recent history, lasted just 11 weeks. And as the Washington Post reported at the time, even that was too long for many Canadians:
When Canadians look south to our system, it seems confusing. After all, our campaigns last longer than most Canadian governments do. “Strange is not the right word — well, maybe strange is the right word,” said Peter Mansbridge, the chief correspondent for CBC News. “They don’t get how you can be so consumed for so long in the political process of electing instead of the process of governing.”
The Restore Democracy Revolution
By themselves, any of the measures in our Restore Democracy bill would constitute a major boost for our democratic process. Taken together, they are nothing short of revolutionary in scope.
The foundation lies in putting a stop to special interests spending unlimited amounts of secret money to influence government and elections. Our legislation would also put Congress on record supporting small donor-public campaign financing and limiting the campaign season. Moreover, we are calling for full disclosure of all campaign contributions, establishment of national online voter registration and a halt to all voter suppression.
We also call for a return to Congress’s traditional process of Regular Order. Under Regular Order, we compromise and find bipartisan solutions by fully considering every idea and amendment under an open rule – and affording each one an up or down vote. That’s how Congress fixed things, solved problems and got things done for more than 200 years. It’s time to get back to that tried and true method of serving the American people.  We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email.
Sincerely, ￼

The Endless 17-Year War in Afghanistan is Bleeding America to Death
￼  If there is one Trump campaign promise the American people agree with, it’s putting a stop to endless wars of choice that are costing us so much precious American blood and treasury – and reinvesting those resources in America and our people.
The President’s announcement last week that he will continue to pursue the futile and seemingly endless 17-year war in Afghanistan is deeply disappointing and disturbing. His speech sounded eerily like Presidents Johnson and Nixon in the 1960’s, determined to stay in Vietnam and wage a war every bit as unwinnable as the one in Afghanistan. And sadly, the result will be the same in the end.
If there is one Trump campaign promise the American people agree with, it’s putting a stop to endless wars of choice that are costing us so much precious American blood and treasury – and reinvesting those resources in America and our people. The simple fact is that this conflict in Afghanistan has become America’s longest war. It is bleeding us to death, and the Chinese and the Russians are laughing at our costly and tragic folly. Our brave and patriotic troops deserve better than to be put in harm’s way to defend one of the most corrupt and dysfunctional governments in the world.
 

 
Houston Battles Record Floods
￼Remembering the terrible floods that hit Duluth in 2012, our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Houston and southern Texas as they endure record rainfalls in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. The President has already cleared the way for federal disaster assistance to help with what will be a long and costly recovery. 

Our Week in Center City
￼  Eighteen federal agencies held a briefing for Minnesota Congressional staff last week in Minneapolis, explaining their mission and pointing out ways we can all work closer together to assist the people we represent. My Constituent Services Director Brynn Sias and Field and Constituent Services Representative Rick Olseen attended the session at the Minneapolis Federal Service Bank. 
Our Week in International Falls
￼  The Minnesota Assistance Council for Veterans held is annual StandDown in International Falls last week to make a wide variety of legal, health and other services available to local military Veterans. Pictured here are Margaret Kostiuk and Wayne Sampson. At 97 years young, Margaret is a practiced opera singer, and she did a spectacular job singing the National Anthem before the event.
￼  The StandDown featured free haircuts for military Veterans.
Our Week in Duluth
￼  Minnesota Assistance Council for Veterans hosted another annual StandDown in Duluth last Friday, where scores of military Veterans could receive a free lunch, haircut, legal advice, surplus supplies and other services.
￼  As Minnesota’s first member of the Congressional Climate Solutions Caucus, I was delighted to meet with these representatives of the Citizens Climate Change Lobby in Duluth to discuss the effects of climate change on public health and our way of life here in the Northland.   
￼  Ari Juntunen and Jack Nagorski, two 13-year olds from Esko who were frustrated in their search for summer jobs, wrote to me recently urging some flexibility in the federal child labor laws. We had a good meeting in Duluth to discuss the reasons why these laws are in place. I’m pretty sure these enterprising young guys will be successful in whatever they decide to do in life.   
Our Week in Saint Paul
￼  We had a good meeting with Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Commissioner Tom Landwehr (on my right in this picture) and representatives of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services in pursuit of a federal grant from the BP oil spill to help fund the proposed National Loon Center project in Cross Lake. Among other environmental projects, the Center will help protect and restore natural habitats for Minnesota loons threatened by invasive zebra mussels and the long term effects of the oil spill.   
Coming Up in Minnesota

As Congress' district work period continues, I'll be traveling around Minnesota's 8th District meeting with people from all walks of life, getting advice and counsel to take back to Washington. I get some of my best ideas from the people I am so privileged to represent. So, if you see me in your community, please take a few minutes to stop and chat.   

Finally...
Ever Wonder What It’s Like to Work in a Congressional Office? We’re Looking for Interns in DC and Duluth!
￼  Many thanks to our DC summer interns. Left to right in this photo are Frankie Hanson, Peter Engel, Maya Hermerding and Simon Fruth. 

Calling all college students and graduate students here in Minnesota’s 8th District. If you’re interested in public policy issues and would like to help us serve the great people of Central and Northeastern Minnesota, we have internships available in our Washington, D.C. and Duluth offices throughout the fall, spring and summer semesters. Check my website for more details.

Thanking Our Emergency Responders
￼  Thanking Judge Hebert & Fort Bend Emergency responders for their help during #Harvey
￼  Thanking Missouri City Police Chief, Fire Chief, City Manager & and first responders for their hard work during #Harvey
Dear Friend, 
Hurricane Harvey made landfall Friday night in Rockport, TX and moved along the coast into the Houston region. I don’t have to tell y’all what the impact to our region has been. Mandatory and voluntary evacuations, road closures, complete destruction of several roads in our region, hospital evacuations and flood damage to countless homes. These are a few of the devastating impacts we face from the wrath of Harvey.
After calling all of the Mayors in TX-22 to get an assessment of conditions on the ground, I was fortunate to get out of the house for a while over the weekend to survey some of the damage and thank our emergency responders on the Fort Bend side of TX-22. The roads were not in good enough shape to make it over to Brazoria, but our staff in Pearland has been keeping me informed of conditions throughout the region.
The rain and flooding are not yet over, please be sure to listen to the direction of local emergency officials and evacuate if ordered to do so. If you are not under evacuation, please stay off the roads unless it’s an absolute emergency.  Our county offices also have important local emergency management information if you need it. Here are links to TX-22 county emergency information - Fort Bend County,  Brazoria County, and Harris County. The Red Cross also has a Hurricane Harvey Response Information site.  
I’m honored to represent you in Congress. For more information on constituent services, current legislation or to sign up for my E-newsletter, please visit my website, www.olson.house.gov. 
Very respectfully, Pete Olson

I recently urged the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make sure that Florida’s state animal, the panther, remains protected under the Endangered Species Act. Fewer than 250 panthers remain in our state and they deserve to be protected from extinction!
TOMORROW is the deadline to weigh in on this decision with the Fish and Wildlife Service. You can send your thoughts by email to David Shindle, the biologist collecting responses, at david_shindle@fws.gov or by fax to (772) 562-4288.
Let me know if you agree that panthers must remain protected by replying to this email or by LIKING my Facebook.

Buchanan Urges Feds Not to Downgrade Panther Protections
Zac Anderson
U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan is calling on federal wildlife officials to maintain the highest level of protection for the Florida panther under the Endangered Species Act.
Buchanan, R-Longboat Key, wrote a letter Wednesday to Greg Sheehan, the acting director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, expressing “my strong concern over reports that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may weaken protections for Florida panthers.”
Federal officials currently are reviewing the status of the panther, which is listed as “endangered” with a population estimated at around 200. The federal government recently downgraded the status of another iconic Florida species, the West Indian manatee, lowering it from “endangered” to ""threatened."" Buchanan objected to that decision.
 Buchanan told Sheehan that “major hurdles remain to the full recovery” of the panther.
“Alarmingly, your agency’s standard review comes less than a year after 32 panthers were struck and killed by vehicles on Florida roadways — the highest number of panther-involved accidents ever recorded,” Buchanan wrote in his letter. “Such traffic fatalities have risen more than 65 percent since 2012, outpacing the number of documented panther births. These roadkills are in addition to other causes of death, including poaching and disease.”
The Congressman’s move comes six months after federal wildlife officials decided to downgrade the protected status of the West Indian manatee, leading a bipartisan group of Florida lawmakers led by Buchanan to formally objecting to the decision.
In March, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced that manatees will be considered “threatened” instead of “endangered” under the Endangered Species Act. The change in status could pave the way for state and local officials to roll back manatee protections.
A letter signed by 11 Florida lawmakers — nine Democrats and two Republicans — calls the decision “disappointing and potentially very harmful to the survival of the iconic Florida animal.”
The Florida panther was one of the original 14 mammals named to the endangered species list in 1967, but a critical habitat for the big cats has never been established, “even though one is required by the Endangered Species Act,” Buchanan noted.
Though the review by the agency occurs every five years, Buchanan said he is concerned the safeguards may be weakened because the agency has said it will consider a study claiming the Florida panther is no different than pumas or mountain lions in western states.
Buchanan was referring to a 2000 study that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has come to focus on by geneticist Melanie Culver and three fellow scientists that concluded that all the panthers, pumas and mountain lions in North America are actually a single subspecies. To some, that suggests that Florida panthers are nothing special, genetically.
But Culver, in an interview, said she believes the Florida panther still belongs on the endangered list, just not the way it is listed now. The U.S. Geological Survey scientist concedes that making a change would require a complex solution.
“You’d have to de-list it and then petition it to be listed as another entity,” Culver told the Tampa Bay Times. “That’s a legal problem. They’d have to completely lose legal protection to be protected the right way.”
Florida panthers are the Sunshine State’s official state animal, voted in by schoolchildren over such other contenders as the alligator and the mosquito.

Working Hard for Jersey Values 
Even as families flock to late-August beaches -- and as 17 courageous New Jerseyans head to Texas to support the Hurricane Harvey relief efforts -- my work for Jersey values never stops. As my office and I take meetings, visit businesses and explore non-profits this district work period, let us know how we can better serve your community. Get in touch with us either online or by phone at (201) 389-1100 or (202) 225-4465. 

Rolling Up My Sleeves 
This week, I shared how I got ""behind the bar"" at Starbucks to serve up some coffee and hear from Park Ridge customers. Barista-ing at Starbucks is not as easy as it looks, but Jacob was a patient teacher. My go-to drink is cold-brew iced coffee, black, with a splenda. 

You can watch me serve up a cup HERE. 

If you have a business and want to show me how you serve North Jersey, get in contact with my office.

Supporting Vets Coming Home From Iraq and Afghanistan 
I'm proud that North Jersey and #TeamGottheimer hosted veterans for a unique opportunity to learn at the U.S. Small Business Administration's ""Boots to Business"" training course. Boots to Business is an entrepreneurial training course designed to support veterans after returning from service as they build the skills necessary to own and operate their own business. There is no greater responsibility than that we owe to those who have given so much to us. Supporting our veterans as they return to our communities, particularly from Iraq, Afghanistan and around the world, is one of the most important obligations we have in honor of their service.

Find out more about this great program HERE. 

￼

Celebrating and Pursuing Women's Rights 
Last week, 97 years ago, the 19th Amendment was added to the constitution, guaranteeing women the right to vote. To celebrate this milestone moment for civil and women's rights, we recommit to fighting for full gender equality in the workplace, at the ballot box, and in our communities. Women of all backgrounds deserve the full opportunity of growing incomes, lowered costs for families, and access to affordable health care. 

￼

Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 31st day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: protecting animals.
The way we treat animals reflects the values that we hold as a society and has a tremendous impact on the livability and vitality of our communities. As co-chair of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus, I’m working on a bipartisan basis to advance a strong, pro-animal legislative agenda.
We need to crack down on animal abuse and cruelty, protect imperiled species, defend farm animals and require they receive compassionate and humane treatment, and ensure responsible research and testing. 
Our legislative agenda has wide support and could be passed in this Congress, including legislation to:  
	•	prohibit the domestic slaughter, trade, and import of dogs and cats for human consumption;
	•	strengthen laws against shark finning;
	•	prohibit the manufacturing or sale of cosmetics that have been tested on animals;
	•	end animal cruelty and torture; end horse soring; and more.
Learn more about our efforts here.

Protection of animals is one of our core values. Congress should accelerate our efforts to protect their welfare.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

Dear Friend,
Last week, I visited Kit Carson, Cheyenne, Kiowa, Prowers, Baca, Las Animas, Pueblo, Crowley, and Otero counties as part of my annual farm tour, which is an excellent opportunity to hear firsthand from the men and women that are part of Colorado’s agriculture industry.
Two of the issues that came up at many of the stops were government regulations and trade. I will continue to support efforts to eliminate burdensome and duplicative government regulations that hamper Colorado’s agriculture community, and I’m going to keep pushing back on the Administration regarding any changes to trade policies that limits Colorado farmers' access to new export markets across the world.
Day 1 started in Kit Carson County at Eastern Colorado Seeds in Burlington. I then went to Cheyenne County to meet with some local farm bureau members before stopping at Nan’s in Cheyenne Wells for a lunch meeting with county officials and additional farmers from the community. My next stop was in Kiowa County at a Milo farm a few miles outside of Eads. 
 ￼
 ￼
 ￼
Day 2 started off in Lamar for a meeting with Dr. Linda Lujan, President of Lamar Community College. While most of the week was devoted to meeting with farmers, Lamar Community College has several classes for students hoping to get more involved in the agriculture industry and is another example of how the region is directly and indirectly impacted by a strong agriculture industry. Following my meeting with Dr. Lujan, I went to Springfield for a meeting with Baca County Farm Bureau members and local elected officials. My next stop was in Las Animas County for a meeting with farm bureau members, county commissioners, and other members of the community in Trinidad and Hoehne at the Hoehne Community Center where I answered questions on agriculture, healthcare, public lands, and foreign policy issues. I finished day two in Pueblo where I met with Pueblo County Farm Bureau members at Milberger’s Farm. 
 ￼
 ￼
 ￼
 ￼
I wrapped up the farm tour on Wednesday meeting with farmers and local officials in Olney Springs to discuss needed regulatory reforms. I then went to Otero County for visits to Knapps Farm Market and Hirakata Farms in Rocky Ford. My last stop of the day was in La Junta for a tour of Diamond A Farms.
 ￼
 ￼
 ￼
I was raised by a family that depended on a strong agriculture industry in Colorado to make a living and not a lot has changed since then. Last week was another important opportunity to meet with farmers, small business owners, and community leaders that are impacted by agriculture in order to see what I can be doing for them as their representative in the Senate. We have a lot to do on the upcoming Farm Bill, and I will work hard to put in place policies that positively impact the thousands of Coloradans that work in the agriculture industry every day.
Sincerely,
￼
Cory Gardner
United States Senator

VetSuccess Proposal Signed into Law
On August 16, President Donald Trump signed into law a bill to expand and improve the GI Bill. My proposal to make the VetSuccess on Campus program permanent was included in the bill. The VetSuccess program places counselors on college campuses to assist veterans in navigating their GI education benefits and planning their course loads. The counselors in the VetSuccess program are making a difference in the lives of our veterans. The initiative, which began as a pilot program, has proven effective and I am pleased that it will now be made permanent.   I also strongly support the broader Forever GI Bill that included my proposal. This bill marks historic change for our veterans as it improves and extends GI Bill benefits granted to veterans, their surviving spouses and dependents. It also ensures that all purple heart recipients receive the full GI Bill, increases benefits for reservists and guardsmen and improves technology for processing claims. This law is the single largest improvement to veterans’ education benefits since 2008. Read more about it here.

Dear Lindsey,  It was another productive week across the Tenth District. We had a packed house at our health care forum for seniors in Grayslake to help residents learn about Medicare and what resources are available in our community. Earlier in the week, we held an information session in Mundelein for high school students and their parents to learn more about attending a U.S. military service academy after graduation. I was honored to be joined by former Navy Captain and NASA Astronaut Jim Lovell, who shared stories of his experience attending the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. Thank you also to everyone who attended our open house at our Satellite Office in Round Lake Park. 
Please read on for aditional information on these events and more, as well as an invitation to our upcoming Job Fair in North Chicago in September. 
CONNECTING SENIORS WITH HEALTH CARE RESOURCES
￼
On Thursday of last week, I hosted a health care forum in Grayslake for area seniors. This event was an opportunity to learn more about Medicare, including eligibility, enrollment, and choosing a plan. In addition, we discussed what health care resources are available for Tenth District seniors.
We were joined by a number of great loca organizations, including the AARP, Alzheimer’s Association Greater Illinois Chapter, Catholic Charities, Family Service of Lake County, and Northeastern Illinois Agency on Aging.
Our office is here to help with any issues you may have involving the federal government. We’ve already helped more than 100 Tenth District residents resolve problems with the Social Security Administration, Medicare, Veterans Administration, and more. 
If you need help, don’t hesitate to contact our office here.
NOMINATING THE NEXT GENERATION OF SERVICE ACADEMY GRADUATES
￼
Last week we also held an information session for students and families interested in learning more about attending the U.S. Military Service Academies, as well as ROTC and direct enlistment options. More than 200 people turned out to Mundelein High School to hear from representatives from the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Merchant Marines. 
We were also joined by a very special guest – former Navy Captain and NASA Astronaut Jim Lovell. Students and their families had the honor to hear from the Apollo 13 commander about his formative experience at the U.S. Naval Academy and the doors it opened throughout his career and life. 
￼
Our office is accepting applications for service academy nominations up until October 15. 
Learn more about how to apply on our website.

HOSTING A JOB AND RESOURCE FAIR
￼
Our hiring event this spring was such a success, we’ve decided to do it again. I’m hosting a Job and Resource Fair with State Representative Rita Mayfield in North Chicago on Friday, September 15. 
More than 40 area employers and social service organizations will be on hand to meet with attendees. 
Learn more and RSVP on the Eventbrite page.
WEEKLY WRAP-UP
￼
Love the message on this backpack! It was great to be at WJ Murphy Elementary School last week to greet the students and families starting a new school year. Due to a tremendous effort to recover from last month's flooding by the staff and teachers at Round Lake Area Schools CUSD #116, schools opened on-time.
￼
Charles Karp lives in Northbrook and is a World War II veteran who was wounded in Germany and earned the Purple Heart. After returning from the war, he gave his medals to his mother. When his daughter recently found out her dad didn’t have the medals he had earned, she contacted our office, and working with the Army and National Archives, we were able to confirm his record and secure replacements. It was such an honor to present these medals to Charles and his family, listen to his stories, and thank him for his service.
￼
Enjoyed the conversation at our Neighborhood Office Hours in Glenview Park Center last week.
￼
Our first responders are hard at work everyday to keep our communities safe. Glad to spend time with local chiefs at the Lake County Fire Chiefs Association meeting.
￼
Speaking out against reckless concealed carry reciprocity with Moms Demand Action. We need commonsense reforms to reduce gun violence - this dangerous legislation would undermine local safety laws and force states to accept the concealed carry standards of every other state.
￼
Chatting with the folks who dropped in to our open house at the  Avon Township building. If you ever need assistance, we operate a satellite office there in Round Lake Park every Monday from 8:30am - 4:30pm and Tuesday 8:30am - 12:30pm. More details on our website.
￼
Participating in a candle lighting ceremony in solidarity against hate at B'Nai Jehoshua Congregation in Deerfield. I visited to discuss my trip earlier this month to Israel with 50+ other members of Congress.

Dear Friend,
With the Great Minnesota Get-Together officially underway, I grabbed some food and sat down with MPR and the Star Tribune to discuss a wide assortment of topics. Watch a Facebook Live interview with the Star Tribune here.
Here's a snapshot of my other events and visits: Healthcare Providers roundtable to improve care for our seniors, tour of IMRIS Medical, received Champion of Health Care Innovation Award and got a firsthand look at the Fairview Southdale Hospital tele-ICU. I met with our local fire chiefs, eBay Small Business sellers, toured a Habitat for Humanity build site, and visited with small businesses like American Flexible Products, Quality Bicycle Products and ABC Millwork/Lyman Lumber and Chem/Serve in Coon Rapids. Tax reform and workforce issues were big topics of discussion.
Tax reform was also a big discussion item with employees of Cargill, Japs/Olson printing, and Best Buy, who hosted a tax town hall forum (you can read about that here).
And, thanks to everyone who took the time to individually meet with me over the past couple weeks. I held Congress on Your Corner events in Chaska and Eden Prairie, as well as extended office hours into the evening to hear your thoughts, concerns, and ideas. I appreciate listening to what's on your mind so I can more effectively represent you.
Please let me know whenever I can be of assistance to you or your family. Join the conversation online by visiting my website, Facebook page, Twitter, and Instagram.

Filling Court Vacancies
On Friday, I wrote a commentary in the Star Tribune urging the confirmation process to get underway for Minnesota Supreme Court Justice David Stras to the U.S Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. He has widespread bipartisan support from a diverse group of judges, attorneys, and law professors across our state. Justice Stras has also proven his exemplary qualifications throughout an impressive legal career. He even received a well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association, the highest recommendation possible.
Unfortunately, it appears there are some in the Senate that are stalling Justice Stras' confirmation; nominees to other judiciary positions who were named around the same time and even after him have already had hearings or are set to have one soon. As I wrote, I encourage Minnesota's senators not to engage in any obstructionism or partisan game-playing that is keeping an outstanding legal mind off the Eighth Circuit Court. 
 
Fighting Opioid Crisis at the VA
Our VA hospitals are an essential means of providing care to our veterans and I'm encouraged by the progress made in recent years to enhance their operations and customer service. The Minneapolis VA does an especially good job serving our Minnesota vets and I was excited to be there this week.
I met with Director Patrick Kelly for an update on new standards of care they're establishing and spent time with Dr. Krebs, who is a national leader in evaluating the treatment and prescription of opioids, specifically within the VA system. Unfortunately, there are too many veterans who have fallen prey to this epidemic, but Dr. Krebs is leading the efforts to counter addiction to opioids by establishing best practices with doctors to lower maximum dosage as well as addiction prevention for vets who may have been overprescribed. This is an increasingly growing concern across the country and state, including right here in our community. I was recently interviewed on C-SPAN's Washington Journal to discuss this epidemic and am pleased to see all of the great work the Minneapolis VA is doing.
 
Health Care for Seniors
I don't believe any one political party or person has a monopoly on good ideas. It's important to gather as much insight from a wide variety of stakeholders, which is why I continue to host roundtable discussions on various subjects. Lately, this has included tax reform, transportation issues, retirement savings and financial services, and input from the fire chiefs in our community.
My health care provider roundtable also brought together key stakeholders and laid the groundwork for some significant bipartisan consensus to improve care for seniors in Medicare. I gathered doctors, nurses, clinicians, and other health care professionals -- including Care Providers of Minnesota, the Mayo Clinic, Zipnosis, Novu Health, Life Science Alley, our hospitals and others -- who all identified burdensome rules that are increasing the cost of Medicare and impeding care for seniors.

Meet Richard | How Can I Help You? | Issues | Media Center | Contact Me
Friends,
 
Jobs and the economy have always been among my top priorities for the 8th district. Thats why Im proud of what we have accomplished to support economic growth, cut job-killing regulations, support workforce development and unleash our economy. You probably havent heard it in the national news, but regulations we have cut this year will save taxpayers more than $86 billion. 
 
Thats real progress, but we cant stop there.
 
I began last week helping to break ground on the new stadium that marks the first time in 21 years Americas pastime will return to Fayetteville. Because Fayetteville has such strong ties to the military, it was fitting for the event to be kicked off with paratroopers from the U.S. Army Special Operations Command parachute team descend down onto the site of the new stadium to set off the groundbreaking. It was an incredible sight to behold as we look forward to what will surely be a great addition to the community for families, friends and baseball enthusiasts.
 
While Fayettevilles new stadium is great news for our region, I know that there is still so much more to be done to support job growth - starting with tax reform.
 
I believe we have a once in a generation opportunity to reform our nations tax code to get our economy rolling. Last week I discussed this priority with hard working men and women at the Goodyear Rubber and Tire plant in Fayetteville, home builders in Moore County and local leaders at the N.C. Transportation Museum in Rowan County.
 
Right now, our tax code is so complicated and our rates are so high that America has become uncompetitive for many businesses. I want to simplify and lower our rates so companies like Goodyear can start creating more jobs and grow their operations here in North Carolina.
 
Along with this, I also want to make it so individuals can fill out their taxes on the back of a postcard. This simple and easy approach will give Americans more peace of mind when it comes time to pay their taxes, reduce the stress of filling out tax forms and save families time and money to spend on things that matter.
 
While I want to reform our tax code to be simpler, I do believe it is important to protect home ownership. To that end, I want to make sure we preserve the Mortgage Interest Deduction tax credit. The home is where our memories are made and homeownership represents an American ideal that we must preserve. Simplifying our tax code and preserving homeownership will be key to allowing everyone unlimited opportunities. So as many families begin a new school year, I will stay focused on our economy so you can stay focused on what matters.
 
As I've said before, no good ideas come out of Washington, which is why I come home every weekend. I relish the opportunity each August to spend several weeks traveling the district and listening to constituents. This year is no exception. I'm taking our common sense solutions back to Washington next week, where I'll continue standing up for our values in Congress.
 
Until next week,
￼

Member of Congres (NC-08)

REP. ROYCE WELCOMES RECENTLY FREED PASTOR TO ROWLAND HEIGHTS
￼
 Rep. Royce embraces Pastor Nguyen Cong Chinh for the first time following his release from a 
Vietnamese prison.

This past week we celebrated a big win for religious freedom. It was a blessing to greet Pastor Nguyen Cong Chinh in person after his release from prison and his family’s safe arrival in the United States. 
Nguyen Cong Chinh is an evangelical pastor originally from the Quang Nam province, and has lived in the Central Highland provinces of Kon Tum and Gia Lai since 1985. 

Over the past three decades Pastor Chinh has been subjected to beatings and his family was continually harassed for simply practicing their faith. Despite the unthinkable harassment, torture, and imprisonment he suffered under Vietnam’s communist government, Pastor Chinh never lost faith in fighting for the rights of his congregation to worship freely. 
￼

Pastor Chinh’s sacrifice shines as a beacon of hope and strength to millions around the world who still lack even the most basic of human rights. Click HERE to read more about Pastor Chinh's inspirational story.

17,000 CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS 
WILL KEEP BONUSES 
￼
Great news for our California National Guard heroes! It should not have taken this long, but the Department of Defense made the right decision to allow 17,000 of our National Guard members to keep the bonuses that they rightful earned serving their country. 

Many of you contacted me in regards to how the Department of Defense was using tax liens and wage garnishments to reclaim bonus payments to California National Guard members. I'm pleased to see this nightmare come to an end for these soldiers, many of which fought bravely in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Our men and women in uniform must always know that we've got their back. Click HERE to read more about this news from the Los Angles Times.

WELCOME FULLERTON'S NEWEST POLICE CHIEF 
￼
I'm excited to welcome David Hendricks as Fullerton's newest police chief. David has an experienced and honorable law enforcement record protecting and serving the people of Southern California. 

I'm confident that our community is in safe hands under his leadership. Make sure to say hello and welcome Chief Hendricks next time you see him!

Update Regarding Tropical Storm Harvey
 

Dear Texas Neighbors,  Tropical Storm Harvey has had a devastating impact across southern Texas.  I have been briefed on the latest projections regarding this storm and want to share what we know with you.  There have been seven confirmed deaths at this point; however, there will likely be more in the coming days.  While the heaviest impacts so far have been concentrated in the coastal and southeastern areas of Texas; parts of District 17, including portions of Brazos, Burleson, and Lee Counties, are already enduring flooding conditions; and more areas are likely to be impacted in the coming days.  As this storm makes continues to drift slowly around southern Texas, more of our TX-17 neighbors will be threatened by flash flooding and tornados.  The National Weather Service is predicting over two-feet of rain in parts of Central Texas.  If you live in an impacted area, please stay safe.  It is important to avoid flooded roads and follow orders given by local and state officials.  If you do not live in an impacted area, please be ready to help.  As Texans, we know that we must come together to support our neighbors in the aftermath of Harvey.  We are including links to resources that may be helpful for you and your family: US Geological Survey Radar Map and Texas Water Dashboard National Hurricane Center and NOAA Rainfall Forecast Information American Red Cross Texas Gulf Coast Disaster Response Governor Abbott's Texas Hurricane Center Including Evacuation Information Texas Department of Transportation Road Closure Information  Brazos County Emergency Management Burleson County Emergency Management Lee County Emergency Management  FEMA: Disaster Assistance FEMA: Filing Flood Insurance Claims  We are maintaining constant contact with FEMA, state, and local officials as our state deals with this tragedy.  Also, our offices stand ready to assist constituents in contacting federal agencies.  For assistance, please contact my team in Waco at (254) 732-0748; in Bryan/College Station at (979) 703-4037; or in Pflugerville/Austin at (512) 373-3378.  Please keep our fellow Texans and our First Responders in your prayers during these difficult times.  With great respect,
￼
Bill Flores Member of Congress

 The Walker Weekly Report | August 27, 2017
 
￼
                                         
My prayers are with everyone facing catastrophic flooding in the aftermath and continuation of Hurricane Harvey. First responders are doing a heroic job saving lives and face more challenges as rain is expected to fall throughout the week. 

I just saw the picture above. It's a line of people from Louisiana and more headed towards Houston with boats in tow, ready to help first responders. This is such a powerful testament that our strength as a nation is in our people and the willingness to lend a helping hand. Please keep all of those impacted in your prayers.

My thoughts and prayers also continue to be with the sailors and families of the USS John McCain following a collision between the US destroyer and an oil tanker near Singapore. The Navy has issued a comprehensive review of practices to address the incident. I am hopeful that the Navy's operational pause and review will prompt safety assurances. Our sailors deserve nothing less.

Please keep reading for the full update. Have a blessed week.

President Trump Signs Historic Veterans Bill at American Legion Convention
￼

Our office is proud to have helped more than 700 veterans get the care they deserve from the Veterans Administration. Unfortunately, for too many of our heroes, when they reach out to the VA for help, they are met with delays and bureaucracy. North Carolina's veterans deserve better than to be on VA waiting lists, anticipating the care they were promised when they put their country before themselves. 

On Wednesday, President Trump signed the Veterans Appeals Improvment and Modernization Act, which streamlines the process of veterans appealing claims over disability benefits. Currently, more than 470,000 veterans are in limbo as they wait for a decision on their benefits. That is unnacceptable.

By signing this bill into law, Congress and the President have taken another important step toward ensuring our nation’s heroes have the great, timely care they deserve.

￼ 
Rate of Babies Going Through Opiate Withdrawal Skyrockets
￼

This story is heartbreaking beyond words and another important reason we have made fighting the opioid epidemic a top priority. We have passed legislation this Congress for prevention, education, and treatment of opioid abuse. We have also passed bills that support law enforcement efforts in North Carolina.

No baby, child, or adult should have to go through addiction alone. And we are going to do everything we can to make sure the people pushing these drugs in our communities are brought to justice.

￼
Honoring the Montfort Point Marines
￼

It was our privilege to honor the Montford Point Marines at an event today with Jerome, our Constituent Liaison. Jerome has been an integral part of helping our office serve over 700 veterans with VA cases.

In 1942, President Roosevelt established a presidential directive giving African Americans an opportunity to be recruited into the Marine Corps. Instead of being sent to traditional Marine boot camps in Parris Island, South Carolina and San Diego, California, these African-American Marines were segregated – attending basic training at Montford Point - a facility at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. About 20,000 African-American Marines received basic training at Montford Point between 1942 and 1949. Today,the Montford Point Marines are an Association that holds dozens of Chapters throughout the United States.

Each of these men are heroes. They were segregated to train, and had to fight just to be able to defend their country. Their bravery will not be forgotten.

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend,  We are praying for our neighbors in Texas as they endure the effects of Hurricane Harvey with devastating floods. We are also keeping our first responders in our thoughts as they work to bring Texans to safety.
We lost a true patriot in Florida this week with the passing of Senator Greg Evers. Senator Evers served Northwest Florida for more than 15 years in the Florida House of Representatives and the Florida State Senate, where he worked to implement conservative ideals in our great state. We will forever be grateful to him and may he rest in peace.
I spent this week traveling throughout the Second District hearing from you about the issues that matter most. Please read about my week below:  Military Action in Afghanistan This week, President Trump announced our new strategy moving forward in Afghanistan. President Trump was clear: new strategy, new goals. We will win. Our new goal: to kill our enemies. We will give our troops the tools and rules to win. We fight for America and to keep us safe, to stop terrorism from reaching our shores, not to rebuild other countries. They must take responsibility for their own future. The Afghanistan people, and others in the region, are on notice that this is their fight, and we will support them, but they must take the charge up this hill, not us.  Sam's Club of Panama City  ￼  Thank you to the management and staff of Sam's Club for the enlightening tour in Panama City on Monday. I learned how Sam's Club aggressively pursues partnerships with local producers to display and market their goods. I was also impressed by the Sam's Club corporate and local commitment to the ""Feeding America"" program, and several local charities. What a great group of Americans!   Touring Taylor County I spent time this week meeting with small businesses, local leaders, and hardworking Taylor County residents. ￼  It was an honor to be presented a resolution of appreciation by the Taylor County Commission for my efforts in helping the county secure the Department of Transportation grant to improve 80 miles of railway in the area. These railway improvements will mean improved economic and job opportunities in Taylor County, and I will continue to be a leading voice for the people I am honored to represent. Click here to learn more.
 ￼  I toured Duke Energy's solar facility in Perry and learned about the 22,000 solar panels that are providing energy to customers in Taylor County. It was great hearing and seeing the future of solar in North Florida at the Perry facility with Duke Energy Representatives.  ￼  I also met with the Kiwanis Club of Perry this week and discussed the recent railroad grant, strengthening our military, and what they want to see get done in Washington. They are working hard to meet the needs of and empower children in Taylor County.
Tallahassee Memorial Hospital ￼  I spent Tuesday morning touring the project at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital with the Associated Builders and Contractors of North Florida. They are working on a new state-of-the-art surgical center/intensive care unit to replace all of Tallahassee Memorial Hospital's current operating and intensive care areas. Thank you to the many contractors and subcontractors for helping on this tremendous project.  Veterans Appeals Process  ￼  President Trump just signed the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 into law. This important legislation will update and streamline the bureaucratic nightmare that is the disability claims appeals process.  Click here to learn more.   Mobile Office Hours  Members of my district staff will be hosting Mobile Office Hours throughout the Second District next week. We encourage you to stop by to see how our office might be able to help you.  Click here for a full list of times and locations.    ￼  August 28  Lafayette County   Time: 2:30-4:30 PM ET Location: County Courthouse, 120 W Main St, Mayo, Florida  August 30  Calhoun County  Time: 10:00 AM-12:00 PM CT Location: Calhoun County Library, Meeting Room, 17731 NE Pear Street, Blountstown, Florida    Thank you for your continued energy and enthusiasm, as reflected in your letters and Facebook posts. If you haven’t already, LIKE my Facebook page. You can also follow me on Twitter @DrNealDunnFL2.
Thank you for the opportunity to serve you in Congress!
 Sincerely,  ￼  Dr. Neal Dunn Member of Congress

￼  I take every opportunity I can to thank our many EMS/Fire Rescue personnel across the Second District for the risks they take every day. Thank you Dixie County EMS/Fire.   
￼ 
Met with Taylor County Sheriff Wayne Padgett this week and thanked him for his service to the Second District. The Taylor County Sheriff’s Office is working hard to keep our local communities safe.

CONSTITUENT SERVICES 
ISSUES AND LEGISLATION 
August 27, 2017 
Mental Health First Aid Training:
Mental Health First Aid has been one of my top priorities since coming to Congress. I have introduced and championed the Mental Health First Aid Act, which passed the House with strong bipartisan support and eventually was signed in to law. This important training helps law enforcement agents, first responders and others better identify and aid people in need before tragedy strikes. By building a stronger community, we can extend our mental health safety net in America to help and protect tens of millions of people.
I am pleased to see others, such as Lady Gage, are using their influence to help spread the word of this great training program. If you are interested in learning more about it, read this article by Mashable.
 
Learning More about KUs National Security Laboratory:
On Tuesday, I had the opportunity to sit down with leadership of the University of Kansas and Lawrence community and learn more about their new National Security Laboratory. This new facility will conduct research for the Department of Defense and other U.S. government agencies. This lab is expected to be completed in the spring of 2018 and I look forward to touring the lab when it is completed.
￼
 
Visiting the Johnsonville Meat Factory:
Also on Tuesday, I visited the Johnsonville Meat Factory in Holton to discuss food safety legislation and regulations as well as their commitment to quality. Additionally, as a member of the Ways and Means subcommittee on Trade, we talked about international trade and access to foreign markets. It was great listening to their insightful thoughts and I look forward to visiting again soon!
￼
 
Visiting with East Kansas Agri-Energy:
On Wednesday, I stopped by East Kansas Agri-Energy (EKAE) in Garnett for a tour and to learn more about the ethanol and renewable diesel they produce. We also stopped by the local Quick Stop which sells some of the ethanol produced by EKAE. This was a great learning experience, and I want to thank the staff for such a great tour.
￼
 
Exploring Leroy Co-Op:
As part of my farm tour on Wednesday, I visited LeRoy Co-Op to learn more about their family owned business and how they serve farmers in the community. Not only do they do a great job helping local farmers, but they also support local school functions and 4-H livestock sales. It was great learning more about their feed mill and all the supplies they offer for their members.
￼
 
Touring Slead Farm:
After Leroy Co-Op, I stopped by the Slead Farm just outside of Lebo to talk about agricultural regulations, research, and more. Thank you to David Slead and his son Dustin for taking me along their beautiful farm to talk more about corn and soybeans!
￼
 
Visiting Lyon-Coffey Rural Electric Co-Op:
Lastly, I visited Lyon-Coffey Rural Electric Co-Op at their new Beto Junction facility and discuss rural electrification. It was great to see how they manage more than 2,500 miles of line and 7,300 electric meters in over 9 counties. Thank you for the great tour!
￼
 
Speaking at the Lawrence Rotary:
On Thursday, I had the privilege to speak at the Jayhawk Breakfast Discussion for Rotary Club in Lawrence. I gave the rotary members an update on Congress work to help reform our broken tax code and the list of issues we face when Members of Congress return next month. Thank you to the Lawrence Rotary for inviting me to speak, it was great meeting all of you!
￼
If you want to learn more about this event, read this article from the Lawrence Journal World.
 
Speaking at the Topeka Chamber Congressional Forum Luncheon:
This week, I spoke at the Topeka Chamber Congressional Forum Luncheon on the work Congress is doing to reform our tax code so that businesses can grow and create more jobs. I was honored to receive the US Chamber Spirit of Enterprise Business Builder and Job Creator Award. This award means a lot to me. In Congress, I have introduced and fought for common sense, pro-job policies that will help our local businesses grow and economy flourish.  Again, thank you for this award and your support. I look forward to continuing our work to create pro-job and pro-growth legislation that will help our local businesses grow. 
￼
If you want to learn more about this event, read this article from the Topeka Capital Journal.
 
Meeting with Junior League of Topeka:
On Thursday, I met with the Junior League of Topeka to learn more about the National Diaper Bank Network and discuss legislation that would support successful private diaper banks. I had a fantastic visit with these inspiring ladies discussing the importance of having access to diapers for struggling families, and I look forward to sharing their efforts with my colleagues in Congress.

New Afghanistan Strategy
Last week, President Trump announced his policy on Afghanistan, and I was pleased to hear the President put forward a bold plan to fight terrorism and protect American interests. 
￼
In his remarks, the President made clear the United States will support the Afghan government and security forces in their fight against Taliban, al-Qaeda, ISIS, and other insurgents and prevent re-establishment of international terrorist safe havens in the country.  He pledged to keep the pressure on the Afghan government to guarantee it delivers on important reforms and ensured the United States will continue to work closely with our NATO allies and other partners in training, advising, and assisting Afghan forces.  
I am pleased to hear the President corroborate his commitment to defeating terrorists.  Importantly, the President also made clear that decisions regarding troop levels will be based on conditions on the ground, not on arbitrary timelines.  This is a great step forward in regards to our national and global security, and I support the President's efforts to prioritize the safety of our country. 
Veterans
Last week proved to be another great week for America's veterans! On the heels of our ground-breaking ceremony for the new VA clinic in the First District, the President signed another pro-veterans bill into law. This bill, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, will help streamline and simplify the broken VA appeals process.
￼
The legislation is supported by the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and many others.  As a nation, we have a duty to give back to the brave men and women who have sacrificed so much to preserve our way of life, and I was proud to support this legislation when it came before the House. We will continue pushing for reforms to help our veterans.
In The District
￼
Last week, I spent much time engaging with senior citizens in Southwest Alabama. I enjoyed speaking at the Connie Hudson Mobile Regional Senior Community Center in Mobile, where I gave a brief update on the legislative progress in Washington and then took questions from those in the audience. I also addressed an audience in Robertsdale for the Community Education Program for Seniors.  I provided updates on the happenings in Washington, while additional speakers provided important tips to help avoid fraud and financial exploitation.  Later in the week, I visited the Semmes Senior Center for their ""Lunch and Learn"" program.  The group was very well-informed about the issues impacting our country, and I really enjoyed the conversation.
￼
I had a very productive town hall meeting at LeFlore High School in Toulminville. A special thank you to my friend and Mobile County School Board Member Robert Battles for helping organize the event. 
Town hall meetings are just one of the ways I stay connected with my constituents.  During my District work periods, I travel across Southwest Alabama to fulfill my commitment of being the most open and accessible Congressman possible. I have now held over 90 town hall meetings, and I will keep that momentum going throughout the year.
￼
Additionally, I spent an exciting day in Foley as we celebrated the grand opening of the new UTC Aerospace Systems facility. This expansion is a testament to our dedicated and skilled workforce and the great community support. I'm very excited about the future of aviation in Southwest Alabama.
On Friday, I held two events with groups in Baldwin County. I started by speaking at a meeting of the Montrose Historic Preservation Society. I enjoyed visiting with so many of my neighbors and discussing issues impacting our community. Next, I headed to Daphne for lunch with hospital administrators from Southwest Alabama at Thomas Hospital. We talked about the wide range of issues impacting health care in Alabama and ways to get better care to our local residents.
It was another packed and productive week spent all across Southwest Alabama!

Congressman McHenry Weekly Update 


Hearing From You


 This week, I held the final three of my annual town hall meetings. They began Monday night on the campus of Isothermal Community College in Spindale which again this year served as host for my town hall meeting for constituents from Polk and Rutherford Counties. 
                ￼
Tuesday afternoon, I was in Buncombe County where I hosted very well attended town hall at the Land of the Sky Shrine Club in Swannanoa. 
                  ￼ 
I finished this year’s town hall meetings Wednesday night in Lincolnton where I had the opportunity to discuss issues with constituents from Lincoln and Iredell Counties at the Lincoln County Senior Center. 
￼

I'd like to thank all the Tenth District residents who took time out of their busy days to attend one of my town hall meetings over the last two weeks. These meetings are a valuable resource to me as I serve you in Washington and I'm greatly appreciative of everyone who came out. You can see additional photos from all six town hall meetings by liking my Facebook page and following me on Twitter and Instagram.




A Busy Week in NC-10


 With Congress out of session for the August work period, I was pleased to spend another week back home in western North Carolina. On Monday  I started the week off by participating in an event in Ellenboro celebrating the launch of AT&T’s fixed wireless internet. This is an important first step towards providing wireless internet in Rutherford County and other rural parts of NC. 
￼
Next I had my eclipse glasses ready in Forest City where I joined with Americans throughout the country in watching the Great American Solar Eclipse. 
                 ￼
Afterwards I went to Outdoor Colors in Rutherfordton where I met with employees and learned about the hydrographic finishing work they do. 
￼
Tuesday morning I started the day in Rutherford County where Mayor Bob Keith and the Town of Lake Lure invited me to attend a Lake Lure Breakfast Forum where I had the chance to provide an update on all that has been happening in Washington. 
￼
My next stop was in Buncombe County where I visited Montreat College and learned about their cybersecurity program and major. It was fascinating talking to students about this innovative new program aimed at confronting one of the great threats of this generation.  
￼
Afterwards I headed over to the Lakeview Center for Active Aging in Black Mountain where I had the opportunity to meet with constituents and learn more about the great services the Center provides to our area. 
￼
Wednesday, I started the day in Lincoln County by visiting the Rock Springs Campground in Denver before going to Iredell County to see the Lake Norman State Park in Troutman.  
￼
In the afternoon I toured Trilogy Lake Norman a new development in Denver aimed at seniors that will be completed soon.  
￼
I wrapped up my afternoon with a visit to Blum, Inc. where I learned about the Apprenticeship 2000 program. The program, which began in 1995, provides four year technical training apprentice programs through which graduates are guaranteed jobs after graduation.  
￼
Thursday I began the day in Gaston County where I was honored to present the Bessemer City Fire Department with their Homeland Security AFG and SAFER grant checks, which will allow them to purchase new rescue and extraction equipment as well as provide recruitment incentives and reimbursements to volunteers.  
￼
Thursday afternoon, I headed west to Cleveland County where I joined with the Internet Association to host a Small Business Crawl in downtown Shelby. On the crawl, I visited four small businesses whose use of the internet has transformed the way they do business.  
￼

I ended Thursday getting to see what it takes to be a Duke Energy lineman. It was a unique experience that included the opportunity to put on all the required safety equipment and go up in a bucket with an actual Duke Energy lineman to see firsthand the hard work they do each day. 

￼

On Friday, I was in Hickory on the campus of Catawba Valley Community College. While there, I was honored to be presented the PhRMA/ We Work For Health NC award. I was one of two North Carolina members of Congress to receive this prestigious award. 

                   ￼

After the award presentation, I joined the CVCC Small Business Entrepreneur Exchange Podcast as a guest. On the podcast, I had the opportunity to discuss the importance of small businesses to the economy of western North Carolina.

￼

My next stop was Conover Station where I participated in a lunch and round table discussion with some of Catawba County's CEOs.

                  ￼

I finished my packed week with a tour of the Blue Ridge Molding Company in Conover. While there, I learned about Blue Ridge Molding which provides injection molding and assembly services to manufacturing companies up and down the east coast.

               ￼

The Importance of Local Businesses


 This week I had the opportunity to meet with several local Chambers of Commerce here in western North Carolina. Our small businesses are so important to our local economy and I always enjoy meeting with these business leaders during the August work period to provide them an update on what has been happening in Washington. My first meeting was with the Rutherford County Chamber of Commerce which I joined for lunch on Monday in Rutherfordton. 
￼
Following my Buncombe County town hall meeting Tuesday afternoon, I visited with members of the Asheville Area Chamber of Commerce in downtown Asheville. 
￼

Thursday, I started my day by speaking to the Gaston Chamber’s Good Morning Gaston meeting in Gastonia.

￼

Then at lunchtime Thursday I spoke to the Cleveland County Chamber’s Congressional Luncheon in Shelby.

What I Have Been Reading



Navy Ends Rescue Efforts for Missing USS McCain's Sailors

Choice USA throws Gastonia Party
 
Gaston Gazette
Choice USA, which bottles local favorites Sun Drop and Cheerwine, recently celebrated its 100th birthday and hosted a party to celebrate where you could buy Sun Drop for a quarter. It is great to see a local company celebrating this incredible milestone by bringing the community together with good music, delicious food, and a classic muscle car show.

Week in Review
 
 
One of the best parts of my job is traveling the district to visit and hear from all of you and this week I got to meet many new faces and see some familiar ones during my Coffee with Your Congressman events in Myrtle Beach, Georgetown, Nichols, and Society Hill.

We discussed current events and legislation as well as how I'm working for you in Congress. Sometimes we agreed and other times we didn't. Regardless, I truly enjoyed meeting and hearing from everyone even when we had different viewpoints or opinions.

One thing I have to say after this week's events is that I believe that our country is divinely inspired. You may not agree, but I firmly believe that.
Although our Founding Fathers were flawed, just as we all are, they created a country based on the premise that all men are created equal. To believe that one group or person is greater than another is abhorrent to the founding principles of this country.

This country is based on that principle and rooted in compromise. Because of these things, our country is now the greatest, most prosperous nation in the history of the world. Regardless of our differences, nearly everyone I heard from agreed on one thing: we have got to get back to putting country over party in order to get things done. 

Friends, I'm working hard on the federal level and the local level to uplift everyone in the Grand Strand and the Pee Dee and promise I will continue to do so.

Thanks to all who took the time to voice their concerns and meet with me this week. It's an honor to serve you!

Digital Town Halls
 
 
In addition to my in-person events, I also did two media town hall style events this week. I hosted a Facebook Live town hall with Michael Maely of WMBF, where many of you submitted questions about everything from health care to education to infrastructure. 

I also joined Hot Talk Morning Show with Dave & Liz on WRNN to take questions and talk current events with my friend and colleague Mark Walker, who is the Representative for the 6th District of North Carolina. I know with busy schedules it is hard to meet in person, so these are great ways for us to discuss issues that matter to you when schedules sometimes don't allow for an in-person meeting. 

If you missed it, you can rewatch the Facebook Live here and listen to the WRNN interview here. I will also plan to do more of these events going forward so please visit my website to stay up to date on all future events.

Fighting Addiction
 
 
Addiction affects everyone regardless of race, status, income, or religion. It truly knows no bounds and is devastating our communities. We've passed bills in Congress to provide funding and streamline programs to help combat addiction, but I believe the real work comes from within our communities.

I hosted an Anti-Drug Task Force Summit where local leaders from law enforcement, the health care industry, treatment centers, and recovering addicts from around the Grand Strand and Pee Dee came together to share solutions to fighting addiction. Everyone has seen the effects of addiction and by working together we can help addicts recover and save lives.

Accountability in the IRS
 
 
Scandal after scandal after scandal has emerged from the IRS over the past few years. It seems to me the agency has completely undermined its own credibility, and worse, there is never accountability. 

There was more troubling news last week when it was discovered that the agency rehired 213 employees who were previously fired for falsifying documents, avoiding paying taxes, using taxpayer data without authorized permission, or convicted of theft.

This is completely unacceptable, so with other members of the House Ways & Means Committee, I sent a letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen voicing my concern about these recent revelations. American taxpayers need to know that the IRS is competent, honest, and ethical but right now we don't have those assurances.

7 More Reasons for Tax Reform
 
 
	•	Reason #21: According to the independent Tax Foundation, America's job creators spend an estimated 2.8 billion hours each year on filing tax returns. These businesses should be using time and resources to improve their operations, create jobs, and help grow our economy instead of trying to comply with our complicated tax code.
	•	Reason #22: Right now, America's global companies pay a tax penalty when they bring home profits earned abroad. As a result, global U.S. businesses now hold over $2 trillion in earning and investments overseas, money that our broken tax code discourages them from bringing home to invest in our country and workers.
	•	Reason #23: Through the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), our nation's tax code requires millions of families and businesses to spend time and money calculating their taxes twice every year- once for their regular income tax and a second time for the AMT. Worse, these families and businesses must pay the higher of the two.
	•	Reason #24: Our burdensome tax code only gives more power to the embattled Internal Revenue Service (IRS). With a simpler and fairer tax code we can rein in the IRS by allowing Americans to better understand their taxes and assert their rights as taxpayers.
	•	Reason #25: Individuals and families spend a combined 2.6 billion hours each year on filing their individual income tax returns. This is a sure sign that our tax code is far too complex and burdensome.
	•	Reason #26: More than three decades have passed since the last time our tax code was reformed and during this time, other countries have passed us by. We are the only ones holding ourselves back and this has got to change so we can be competitive in the world. 
	•	Reason #27: Today's tax code incentivizes businesses to shift their profits overseas. This denies our country tax revenue to fund important priorities such as defense, and it disadvantages American job creators that do play by the rules. Estimates show that U.S. companies in 2012 shifted over $280 billion in profits to low tax countries, more than all large American corporations paid in U.S. taxes combined.

GOOD NEWS
I hope everyone had the chance to view the Solar Eclipse last Monday! It was a rare occurrence and we were blessed to be in the area of near or total eclipse. I enjoyed watching with my wife Wrenzie from Front Street in Georgetown with many friendly families and faces. It's heartwarming to see how a monumental event like this can bring the community together!

8/27/17 14:25,Squeal Award: Complicated and Erroneous Foreign Tax Credits,"Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email
￼
 

Home  |  Make' Em Squeal  |  Email Joni 





Good afternoon folks - 
Iowans sent me to Congress with a mission: to cut reckless spending and stop government inefficiencies. 
That's why every month, I give out the Squeal Award, which recognizes a Washington expense, program or concept that has proven to be wasteful and needs to go.


Squeal Award: Complicated and Erroneous Foreign Tax Credits

""It's too complicated.""
""It's broken.""
""There's too many loopholes.""
As I travel across Iowa, those are just a few of the frustrations folks have with our current tax system - and they're right. Many of the provisions put in place burden taxpayers and overwhelm the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the point that erroneous payments and returns are made to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. For a prime example, look no further than the Foreign Tax Credit (FTC).
The United States generally taxes individuals based on citizenship rather than residency, therefore American citizens who are working abroad have to pay taxes to the foreign country they are working in, as well as U.S. taxes above a certain wage of salary exclusion. For those Americans paying double the taxes abroad (U.S. and foreign), the Foreign Tax Credit is available to offset their overseas tax liability.
However, a 2015 audit by the U.S. Treasury Department Inspector General for Tax Administration found that this tax credit is not working the way it was intended to, and the oversight for compliance is dismal.
In the audit, the Treasury Inspector General identified that the IRS fails to have the adequate ""controls and processes in place to identify erroneous FTC claims"". Because of this, between 2010-2012, the IRS potentially mishandled nearly $100 million in FTCs due to improperly filed tax returns, nearly $2.9 million was claimed both as a deduction and a credit, and allowed nearly $40 million in incorrect FTCs on more than 188,000 tax returns when third-party information return documents didn’t match the FTCs that were claimed.
The flawed claims and mishandled money when it comes to FTCs add to the pile of evidence for the great need for tax reform. We must simplify and streamline this process for U.S. citizens. 
Due to the failure to properly monitor claims and payments under the Federal Tax Credit, I hereby present the IRS with this month’s Squeal Award.

Thank you!

Dear Friend,
On Tuesday, I sat down with a group of small business owners and families all connected through their homeschool group that are hurting from the failures of Affordable Care Act including lack of insurance options, access to care, and increases in costs of health care.
Like them and many of you, I remain frustrated with the gridlock in D.C. and how politics and the media often can misrepresent good policy ideas and inhibit reforms that may help Americans.
While I have really enjoyed being back home in the Eighth District over the past several weeks traveling all over the twenty four counties to meet with constituents, I am looking forward to returning to Washington with a renewed vigor to tackle the tough problems facing our country.

Meeting with Leadership at Robins Air Force Base
I spent much of Monday at Robins Air Force Base meeting with leadership and Airmen to see first-hand the needs of our warfighters to complete their missions safely and efficiently. Among those missions is the critically important E–8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) fleet, which calls Robins home.
JSTARS is a joint Air Force and Army program that provides airborne surveillance, intelligence, and command and control to our military through on-board radar and computer subsystems equipment that gathers and distributes detailed battlefield information. Combatant commanders utilize the JSTARS fleet around the world, and we’re proud to have them based in the Eighth District.



Recognizing the Success of Our Youth
Our young people are certainly the future of our state and supporting them and recognizing their successes are key to keeping our communities strong and thriving. On Tuesday, I met with Amelia Day, a member of the 4-H Club in Houston County. Amelia was selected as the national winner for the 2017 4-H Youth In Action Award for Citizenship for her leadership as founder of Operation: Veteran Smiles (OVS), a community service initiative she started at age 13. She’s a bright young woman, and I look forward to seeing her continued growth and success.

Keeping Health Care Concerns Front and Center
On Monday I met with doctors, nurses, and administration at the Central Georgia Cancer Care Center in Warner Robins. We spoke on many health care related issues and concerns including Medicare and the rising costs of prescription drugs. It is imperative that any health care reform proposal not only offers patients affordable and easily accessible care but also offers health care providers the resources needed to provide patients with quality care.

In some cases, college students may be able to obtain academic credit.

The Bost Bulletin
Friend:
Great news! This week, the president signed legislation that I authored, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (H.R. 2288), into law. This new law is vitally important for America’s heroes and their families. Too many veterans are faced with intolerable delays during the VA’s benefits claims appeal process. By modernizing the system, we can now ensure they get the help they need in a more efficient and effective manner.  This was truly a bipartisan effort in Congress. Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate came together to help our nation’s heroes.
￼
How did we get here?
When a veteran files a claim for a disability they believe is caused by their military service, VA will issue a rating decision, which either grants or denies the claimed disability and assigns an evaluation of disability level. If a veteran disagrees with VA’s decision, they may file an appeal with VA and move their claim through several levels of the appeals process.   Unfortunately, the appeals process the VA has been using is broken. Between fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2017, the number of pending appeals increased from approximately 380,000 to 470,000 – more than a 20 percent increase. Between fiscal years 2013 and 2016, Congress appropriated nearly $200 million more than the president’s request to address the appeals backlog. Despite the additional resources, the VA estimates that it will take at least five years just to resolve the appeals currently pending.
What exactly does this new law do?  
The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 creates three “lanes” for veterans’ appeals, including the “Local Higher Level Review Lane” where an adjudicator reviews the same evidence considered by the original claims processor; the “New Evidence Lane,” where the veteran could submit new evidence for review and have a hearing; and the “Board Lane,” where jurisdiction for the appeal would transfer immediately to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals.
What’s the bottom line?
The appeals process the VA has been using is broken and the backlog of appeals is out of control. Veterans who experience a disability as a result of their service deserve to have their appeals decided in a timely manner. This new system helps the VA move through the backlog of appeals so veterans waiting on their disability decision can have peace of mind.
Mike

August 27, 2017   Dear Friends,
This week was a busy week in the 15th district. From the solar eclipse to touring an Amazon facility, I spent the week traveling to many towns and meeting constituents throughout the district. 
On Tuesday, I visited Solix in Charleston. Solix assists in the application process for individuals and communities seeking increased access to telecommunications services. 
￼
Shimkus talking with Solix employees.
I also visited Beck's Hybrids facility in Effingham. Beck's is the largest family-owned, retail seed company in the United States. They serve farmers across the Midwest and of their 12 facilities, 5 are located in Illinois. 
￼
Shimkus visiting Beck's Hybrids in Effingham. 
The Edwards, Richland, and Wabash County Farm Bureaus hosted a National Elected Officials Roundtable in West Salem. The Crawford and Lawrence Farm Bureau also held a roundtable in Pinkstaff. Both events were a great opportunity to hear about issues important to constituents and to talk about what the House of Representatives plan to do when we come back to Washington on September 5th.
 
￼

I was honored to announce that a FEMA Grant was awarded to Lawrence County Ambulance Service. They received an Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) and used the $135,000 to purchase 12-point diagnostic EKG machines. AFGs help enhance public and firefighter safety by providing funding for critically needed resources to equip and train fire departments, EMS organizations, and state fire training academies.
 
 ￼

If you need assistance with federal grants, my office can help. 
Along with AT&T, I hosted a Senior Tech Day in Mt. Carmel. This was a great opportunity for seniors to learn to use different applications on their smart phones and tablets. 
￼
Shimkus and AT&T staff help seniors learn to use their technology. 
On Thursday, I attended the first public tour of the new Amazon Fulfillment Center in Edwardsville with Senator Dick Durbin. The facility, which opened a year ago, employs 2,200 people and is still growing. The products at the fulfillment center are mostly delivered to the St. Louis area and the Midwest, but are shipped all over the country and even overseas.

ICYMI: With only one more week left of the district work period, here's a look at what I will be working on in the upcoming session.

News from the 22nd District
Renew NY-22
This week, I focused on revitalizing the agricultural sector here in Upstate. Agriculture is among upstate New York’s most important industries and has for decades been a vital part of our region’s heritage. In recent years, unfair trade agreements, rising regulatory costs, and distortions in the labor market have made it more difficult for family farms to grow and thrive in the Mohawk Valley and Southern Tier.
That's why I am working to protect Upstate agriculture, push back against bad trade deals, and fight federal overreach. I am a cosponsor of H.R. 281, the Family Farm Relief Act. This bill streamlines the H-2A Agricultural Visa program so that it works better for farmers who lack access to a stable and reliable labor pool. I also supported passage of H.R. 26, the REINS Act. This bill would require Congressional approval of significant agency regulations that have the potential to impact agriculture. I am also leading the charge to change and reform the Dairy Margin Protection Program so that it actually works for farmers who are paying into it.
Agriculture Round Table
On Friday, I hosted an Agriculture Round Table at the Chenango County Historical Society in Norwich to discuss issues facing the agriculture sector in the 22nd District. I had the opportunity to meet with leaders in the agricultural community throughout Chenango County and the Southern Tier, including a number of family farmers, the Farm Bureau, the Chenango Chamber of Commerce and Chobani.
During the round table we focused on the many issues that farmers from across the district continue to face year after year, and how Congress can work to revitalize our agricultural sector and ease the burdens on this vitally important aspect of our economy.
In the 22nd District, family farmers are the backbone of our communities and economy. That’s why I’m working to ensure that our policies help family farmers grow and compete. 
It was an honor to discuss the future of the agriculture industry at the Chenango County Histrorical Society’s Loomis Barn, a museum in tribute to the history of farming and agriculture in Chengano County. 
Throughout my time in Congress, I have worked tirelessly to advocate for our Upstate agricultural sector including calling for reforms to the Margin Protection Program for Dairy in the 2018 Farm Bill. I have also called on the President to advocate for our nation’s dairy industry by holding Canada accountable to its trade commitments by enforcing current law and opposing Canadian dairy protectionist policies.
￼￼
Touring Local Dairy Farm
Following the Agriculture round table, I visited the VanAlthuis dairy farm in Sherburne, New York. During the tour, I spoke with the VanAlthuis family about the history of their farm, the issues they face and their daily operations. 
￼
Afghanistan Strategy
The American people want to see results and a strategy to end this long war and preserve American security in the future. Those goals were delivered by the President in his address to the nation.
In February, I visited Afghanistan and met with our military leadership and troops on the ground where I saw firsthand how years of failed strategy and unfinished missions have created a vacuum of instability and increased terrorist activity in the region.
The policies of the previous administrations have not achieved measurable results. It is time for a bold path forward and a clear vision to ensure that America remains safe. Now we have one.
America cannot afford to stand by as Afghanistan remains a safe haven for terrorist organizations that only seek to attack our Western values and our homeland while further destabilizing the Middle East.  We cannot continue to stand down while the illegal drug trade, a top funding mechanism for terrorism, in Afghanistan continues to grow. No longer can arbitrary deadlines dictate our strategy and objectives.
As the mother of an active duty Marine currently serving in the Middle East, I know that we cannot continue to leave our troops without the resources they need to successfully complete their mission.
I commend the President for his commitment to remain diplomatically, economically and militarily engaged in the region. Our mission is not to nation build, but to protect American interests while simultaneously helping train Afghan forces to protect their own country. The President's plan will allow the Afghan people to forge a peaceful way forward while ensuring that we attain a lasting peaceful resolution.
Honoring Vietnam Veterans
It was an honor to join the Ava Dorfman Senior Center in a pinning ceremony honoring our Vietnam Veterans. The ceremony honored all United States Veterans who served active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces any time between November 1, 1955 and May 15, 1975. All Vietnam Era Veterans present were presented with a Vietnam Veterans Lapel Pin during the ceremony. The event was hosted by the Ava Dorfman Senior and Community Center in partnership with the Parkway Center, the South Rome Senior Center and the Daughters of the American Revolution, Fort Stanwix Chapter.
￼￼
Touring MetLife, Employee Town Hall
On Thursday, I toured MetLife's facility in Oriskany, New York. This facility in the 22nd District is one of our largest employers, employing 1,100 people. I had the opportunity to speak with some of their employees to get feedback on what they'd like to see accomplished in Congress and ways we can improve our economy and communities here in Upstate New York.
￼￼
Tenney joins Fox and Friends

On Monday, I joined Fox and Friends to discuss the latest news from the White House and what I'm focused on in Congress. 
The American people are sick of distractions, and they want real results from Washington. Constituents in the 22nd District need relief from crushing taxes and they want to see our Upstate economy thrive.
That's why I'm focused on the issues like bringing jobs back, reforming our tax code, repairing our broken healthcare system and finding a solution to the opioid epidemic plaguing our communities. I'll continue to work to make our community an even better place to live, raise a family and do business.

￼￼
Wednesday was a beautiful morning at the opening day of New York State Fair! It was great to see a number of NY-22 businesses and farms represented throughout the fair.
 
￼￼
I also had the opportunity to tour the VA hospital in Syracuse. During the tour, I met with a number of veterans receiving care and staff at the facility. The staff in Syracuse is dedicated to providing compassionate care for our veterans. Veterans in Central New York are fortunate to have access to the high quality care provided at the Syracuse VA.

8/27/17 11:05,Beyond resistance: Ending the use of private prisons,"Update | Sunday, August 27, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 30th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: ending the use of private prisons.
The United States—with more than 2.2 million people behind bars—incarcerates more of its population than any other country. Mass incarceration destroys lives, families, and communities. We need a criminal justice system that is fair and humane. We need reform.
We can start by eliminating the use of private prisons—which are driven by increasing their profit margin, and where humane treatment of inmates is seldom a priority. Studies show that private prisons have higher recidivism rates and can be more expensive than public prisons despite their shortcomings.
That’s why I support the Justice Is Not for Sale Act, which would prohibit federal, state, and local governments from contracting with private prison companies. This legislation is an important step to reforming our criminal justice system.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

August 27, 2017
Dear Friend, 
“Optimism is faith that leads to achievement,” –Helen Keller.
As I travelled around the district this week meeting with constituents and holding several public forums, I couldn’t help but be filled with tremendous optimism.  While I acknowledge that there are troubling issues facing our nation, I am reminded there are also many wonderful people engaged in our democracy and dedicated to making a positive impact on our community.  I believe that their collective action will lead to remarkable achievements and help to continue moving our country forward.  
On the legislative front, I was thankful the President signed the VA Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act this week.  I proudly co-sponsored and championed this bill throughout the legislative process.  Just this week at my Town Hall meeting, I spoke with a combat Veteran who has been waiting six years for his VA appeal to be considered. He is not alone as my office assists hundreds of Veterans each year facing similar circumstances.  As a reminder, my office is prohibited from forcing the VA to make a positive determination on an individual Veteran’s case, but I can ensure that their claim or appeal is being properly processed and evaluated by the VA.  If you are having difficulty with the VA, please do not hesitate to contact my office for assistance.  The VA has made great strides in tackling the claims backlog in recent years, but their handling of the appeals process has been unacceptable.  I am optimistic that this new law will shorten the time it takes to complete appeals while increasing the accuracy of the VA Appeals decisions.
This week, our nation mourned the loss of ten Sailors, as the USS John S. McCain was involved in a deadly collision.  My thoughts and prayers are with the families of these brave individuals who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.   I look forward to learning more from the Navy’s investigation into the cause of this and other recent collisions so that we may provide the necessary support to avoid future accidents.
I was also encouraged by President Trump’s address to the nation this week regarding our future strategy in Afghanistan.  As with all matters related to national security, we must rely on the trusted counsel of our military leaders.  While I am always cautious about sending our nation’s service personnel into conflict, I believe it is important that we learn from our past mistakes and not allow a power vacuum in the Middle East to create a breeding ground for terrorism.  Our military has been successful in its effort to destroy ISIS in Syria and Iraq, but we have seen a re-emergence of the Taliban in Afghanistan.  The President is correct, we must win the war on terrorism and I am optimistic that this new strategy will help us achieve that important goal.  
Read on for a quick wrap-up of my latest work this week. 
Transportation Summit
￼￼
I believe it is very important for leaders at the federal, state and local levels to work together to solve the major issues facing our constituents.  During my visits to central Pasco, I have consistently heard complaints about the traffic congestion in the fastest growing part of my district.  In response, I invited county and state officials to join me in a Transportation Summit this week. We had a very productive conversation about current and future plans to resolve the traffic problems and took suggestions from constituents about improvements that could be made.
￼
Alzheimer’s Summit
More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease and we know exponentially more will be diagnosed as our population continues to age. This week’s Summit provided valuable insight on how to best support a loved one facing the illness and gave encouraging news about promising research on the horizon. This is an issue that impacts my own family, and I renew my commitment to fighting for continued increases in National Institute of Health research funding in pursuit of a cure.
￼￼
Opioid Roundtable
This week, I was a special guest at the Alliance for Substance Abuse Prevention's monthly meeting in Pasco County. The productive conversation among stakeholders highlighted the extent of the crisis right here in our own community and the wonderful work being done each day to combat addiction. Sadly, there is much more work to be done in order to meet the growing demand for treatment, and the federal government has an important role to play in providing necessary resources to support the work of those on the front lines. I look forward to bringing their ideas to Washington as we continue this fight.
￼￼
Town Hall Meeting 
I was honored to have some of the finest state lawmakers join me for a Town Hall this week. We heard opinions on a broad array of issues including: immigration, the VA appeals process, opioid addiction, environmental concerns and healthcare. It was great to see so many people engaged in civil discourse.  They were all passionate about the issues they discussed and I appreciated their feedback.

8/27/17 9:04,A New Strategy for Afghanistan,"￼ 
  

A NEW STRATEGY FOR AFGHANISTAN

Earlier this week, President Donald Trump outlined a clear-eyed and comprehensive approach to addressing the threats our country faces in Afghanistan and the region.  I commend the President for taking the time to conduct this thorough review, hear from diverse perspectives, and arrive at a clear and concise strategy.
 
I am especially heartened to hear a departure from telegraphing maneuvers in advance and basing our strategy on political timetables.  Instead, we will empower our troops and their commanders to confront the threat head on with the full support of their Commander in Chief.
 
This announcement directly affects the First Congressional District of Georgia as we have the 3rd Infantry Division headquarters leading America’s efforts at Bagram Airfield right now.  We’ve had troops and their families undergo deployment after deployment.  We’ve got the legacy of heroes such as Matthew Freeman from Richmond Hill who paid the ultimate sacrifice and Winston Hencley from Rincon who survived injuries few others could.  For us and for our area, this is personal.
 
Having the honor of representing Fort Stewart, Hunter Army Airfield, Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base, and Moody Air Force Base in Congress, I am confident our troops are ready to do the utmost to protect our nation.  

ILLEGAL CRIMINALS WILL HAVE NO SANCTUARY

President Trump’s unyielding commitment to securing our borders and protecting the American people is already yielding results.  In the first seven months of the year alone, the number of people arrested trying to enter the country illegal has been nearly halved.  It’s clear the world knows America is serious about enforcing our laws.  What’s more, the President’s commitment has also boosted the morale of our law enforcement agents along the border because they know he’s got their backs.
 
The President’s steadfast support for securing our borders is also spurring Congress to action.  I’ve been proud to help deliver to his desk the biggest boost to border security in years with $1.5 billion in additional resources.  In the House, we’ve also fully funded the President’s wall and passed both Kate’s Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act to further bolster our efforts.
 
Our House majority is delivering the President his key priorities.  I encourage the Senate to act swiftly upon the legislation the House has passed so that our nation will remain safe for generations to come.

Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) that will be expiring at the end of September.  The NFIP is a very important program for homeowners and, if not reauthorized, could have a tremendous impact on home buying in our country.  My next two meetings are with constituents to discuss health care insurance.  First I meet with Dr. Alec Jones, a retired orthopedic surgeon who shares with me his thoughts and experiences on health care before meeting with David Rubnitz who is a long time benefits consultant and broker to hear his views.  Although their views and ideas are different from each other, both gentlemen have much experience and knowledge in health care and I am very appreciative of them coming to meet with me.  Afterwards, I meet with representatives from the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics to talk about Next Generation Air Transportation Systems (NextGen) as well as other aerospace issues.  Next, I meet with members of Retirees Unite for the Future (RUFF) to discuss health care followed by a meeting with representatives from the Economic Opportunity Authority (EOA), including board member and Chatham County Commissioner Jay Jones, to learn more about the great work they are doing in our community.  My final office meeting is with Andy

Johnson with the Flight Safety Savannah group to learn more about their program.  Next, I head to the Alzheimer’s Association headquarters in Southside Savannah where I meet with staff and family caregivers to hear their personal stories dealing with this dreaded disease.  I have worked closely with this great organization while serving in the Georgia General Assembly and continue to work closely with them in Congress.  Later, I head to downtown Savannah where I speak at the Highway Safety Conference and thank them for the fine work they do in protecting our citizens by making our roadways safer.  My next stop is at the Assisted Recovery Center of Georgia to learn of their unique and successful addiction recovery program before heading to a tour of the impressive Service Brewing Company in Savannah and visiting with their rescue dog Zoe.  After an informative meeting with staff at Publix on Whitemarsh Island, I head to Great Dane Trailer Company for a tour of their facilities before finishing a very busy day on Skidaway Island where I have a great time speaking to the Skidaway Island Professional Republicans.

Wednesday, August 23, 2017:  After an early morning meeting with WTOC general manager Larry Silberman, I head to midtown Savannah for a Restaurant Roundtable at the 5 Spot, one of

Savannah’s favorite eating places. The roundtable discussion with about 10 different restaurant owners and managers from throughout the District gives me the opportunity to learn more about the issues this sector is facing, including labor shortages and excessive government regulations.  Afterwards, I head out to Savannah Quarters in West Chatham County where I am the keynote speaker at the Pooler Rotary Club’s weekly meeting.  As a charter member of this great club, I am excited to be back visiting with my good friends.  Afterwards, I head to the Chatham County Jail where, along with State Senator Lester Jackson and Chatham County Commissioner Helen Stone, Sherriff John Wilcher leads us on a tour of the facility and shares with us the challenges he and his staff are facing with mentally ill patients.  Later, I head out to Cockspur Island where I board a pilot boat that takes me out to the NOAA Ship Thomas Jefferson as it surveys the sea floor in preparation for the harbor deepening.  The survey they are conducting ensures that larger commercial ships wanting to visit the Port of Savannah can do so with accurate updated nautical maps.  

Thursday, August 24, 2017:  I am honored this morning to address the Greater Savannah Coalition on Aging at their monthly meeting at Candler Hospital in Savannah.  This is a great group of

business and nonprofit executives in the aging/elder Care industries such as hospices, medical professionals and nursing homes.  Afterwards, I head down to St. Simons Island in Glynn County where I have the opportunity to speak to the Effingham County Chamber of Commerce at their annual retreat.  It is always good to be with my many friends from this area that I have had the honor of representing in the Georgia General Assembly and now in the U. S. House of Representatives.  Next, I head to the Golden Isles College and Career Academy where I am led on a tour by Dr. Rick Townsend, Dr. Randell Harvey and other leaders to see first-hand the amazing work they are doing here.  The career, technical, agriculture and academic instruction at this facility is unsurpassed and is a tremendous benefit to the community.  After visiting the Fresenius Kidney Care Golden Isles facility to learn more about the fine work they do with dialysis treatment, I head down to St. Marys in Camden County where I am treated to a tour of the fascinating Submarine Museum that the area is so proud of.

meeting
Friday, August 25, 2017:  I travel over to Tifton in the Eighth Congressional District today where I participate in a Rural Prosperity Taskforce meeting with former Georgia Governor and current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue.  This listening session is most beneficial to myself and Sec. Perdue as we hear from the producers and people in the agriculture industry in our state.  Once I get back to Savannah, I meet with a number of different groups in my Savannah office, including the ONE campaign, a group that focuses on foreign aid funding.  I also meet with representatives from the Georgia Dental Association, Gateway Community Services and Coalition Refugee Service Agencies.  All of these are fine groups that do important work in our communities.

Summer District Work Period Update
From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino: 
Good morning,
During the fourth week of Congress Summer District Work Period, I met with PA-10 businesses, engaged with community leaders and advocated for Americas veterans.
Im also happy to report that a Wayne County fire department has been awarded a grant to help keep our neighbors safe.
Here are some of the highlights of my work serving Pennsylvanias 10th Congressional District:
Bolstering Manufacturing
I joined the hard-working employees of High Steel Structures, LLC, along with local and state elected officials, at its Williamsport plant to celebrate the completion of steel fabrication for the New New York Bridge Project, the largest transportation infrastructure design-build project in the United States.
￼
High Steel Structures, LLC celebrated the fabrication of its final steel girder for the New NY Bridge at its Williamsport plant. (Pictured left to right: Ronnie Medlock, VP Technical Services, High Steel Structures; State Rep. Jeff Wheeland (PA-83); State Senator Gene Yaw {PA-23); Dr. Gabe Campana, Mayor of Williamsport; Congressman Marino; Jeff Sterner, President and COO, High Industries Inc.)
Completion of this project, which added 200 jobs to High Steel Structures workforce, is a huge win in bolstering Made in America manufactured products in Pennsylvania and our region.
Strengthening our Workforce
I took part in a roundtable discussion in Williamsport at PA CareerLink that offers programs and resources to prepare members of our community to compete in a 21st-century global marketplace.
￼
I had a great dialogue with Erica Mulberger (left), Executive Director of the Central PA Workforce Development Board, and Jill Walter (center), administrator of PA CareerLink in Lycoming County.
Our discussion focused on support of the FY 18 federal budget for employment and training, specifically the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act program.
Advocating for Veterans
Americas veterans deserve swift, effective health care and nothing less.  I toured the U.S. Veterans Administration (VA) Medical Center in Wilkes-Barre to learn how expanded treatment options have increased access to quality care for our nations heroes.
￼
I had an informative visit to the VA Medical Center in Wilkes-Barre lead by newly appointed Director Russell Lloyd (center).
During this Congress, my House colleagues and I have passed 25 bills to improve the lives of veterans, including major reforms that expedite a broken VA appeals process, expand education benefits and foster greater accountability at the VA.
Growing our Economy
I did a site visit at Best Buy in Selinsgrove to gain insight on how our broken tax code is affecting the purchasing power of new technology by consumers.
￼
During my visit to Best Buy, I checked out the latest Samsung Galaxy mobile phone technology that is bringing new innovation to our lives.
Congress is hard at work to deliver permanent, pro-growth tax reform that will help middle-class families keep more of what they have earned and lower rates for businesses of all sizes.
Engaging with Community Leaders
I had a fruitful meeting with Father John Manno, a respected PA-10 spiritual leader who recently retired after a half-century of leading Catholic parishes in Northeast Pennsylvania.
￼
I often engage with a wide range of PA-10 community leaders on significant issues confronting Congress.
It is always a pleasure to listen to the perspective of members of the clergy. Our discussion covered health care, social security reform and other social issues facing our nation.
Keeping PA-10 Communities Safe
I am pleased to announce the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has awarded the Prompton Fire & Rescue Unit with an Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) in the amount of $216,000 to purchase a new tanker apparatus. The funds will be distributed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
￼
For almost 60 years, the Prompton Fire & Rescue Unit has responded to emergencies in Prompton Borough as well as Canaan, Clinton and Dyberry Townships.
The AFG program is a critical resource, especially in our rural communities, for firefighters and first responders to protect our neighborhoods and keep our families safe.
As Always
Please never hesitate to contact me at my offices in the district or in Washington, D.C. I want to hear from you and learn what is most important to serve you in the best possible way.
For more information, you can visit my website or follow me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
Respectfully,

Dear ,
￼ 
Tom with Lakeside High 
School students 
I just finished a busy week traveling across the state to meet with Arkansans and give them an update on what’s been going on in Washington. I also introduced several federal officials to the Natural State so they could hear from Arkansans directly about how federal regulations affect them. I want to extend my warmest thanks to all those Arkansans who attended these events. 
Between newsletters, don’t forget to follow me on Twitter or like my Facebook page for daily updates! As always, please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns, or simply want to express your opinion. I’m always happy to hear from you.
Best regards, ￼  Tom Cotton
Remembering an Arkansas Legend 
Earlier this month, college football lost one of the greats. Few people could match Frank Broyles’s dedication to the University of Arkansas: 57 years of devoted, distinguished service. In that time, he not only led teams to multiple Southwest Conference titles and a national championship; he also built an athletic department that was the envy of the South. Everyone involved in Arkansas athletics today owes him a huge debt of gratitude. I join Razorback fans in extending my deepest condolences to the Broyles family and the University of Arkansas.
Jailing of Pro-Democracy Protestors in Hong Kong
￼ 
Tom with HSPD officers
 
Recently, three activists were jailed in Hong Kong after holding a pro-democracy protest. To throw three young activists in jail on trumped-up charges is not a sign of Beijing’s strength, but of weakness. The people of Hong Kong have every right to protest their government—and no amount of intimidation can change that. This sentence is only the latest mark against the heavy hand of Beijing—and it should only embolden the forces of democracy in that embattled city. Beijing’s rulers will learn that jailing dissidents does not extinguish a people’s desire for liberty, but further fans its flame. Earlier this year, I co-sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2017, legislation that would empower the president to impose sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for human-rights abuses against Hong Kong citizens. This week’s offense is evidence that Chinese aggression will only intensify unless it is checked.

President Trump’s Strategy in Afghanistan
￼
 Tom and Comptroller Noreika 
talking with Arkansas bankers
President Trump addressed the nation last week on his strategy in Afghanistan. The president gave a strong speech, and I support his decision on Afghanistan. Al-Qaeda planned the 9/11 attacks in that country, and it’s the one place where we’ve largely dislodged its network, though there’s clearly more work to be done after several recent years of drift. We cannot allow it to fall back into the hands of Islamist terrorists—because they’ll use it to launch even more attacks against us. The rise of ISIS in Iraq was a terrible lesson in the dangers of precipitous withdrawal. As always, at the top of my mind are the men and women of our armed forces. They’ve served long and nobly in this fight, and as many of them prepare for deployment, we owe them our thanks for seeing the mission through.
Around Arkansas 
On Monday, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika joined me for an in-depth discussion with Arkansas bankers on the need to pare back federal red tape. We also met with members of the Arkansas Bankers Association and Small Business Association. Later, I welcomed FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to Arkansas for a stop at the National Center for Toxicological Research in Pine Bluff to visit with employees and learn more about their work.
While in Little Rock, I had the honor of presenting recovered military medals to the family of WWII veteran George Anderson. Mr. Anderson was originally from Black Rock and passed away in 2006 without receiving the medals that were owed to him. If you are trying to recover lost medals or know someone who is, please contact our office. You can visit the website at wwww.cotton.senate.gov and select the contact option or you can call 501-223-9081.

Lake-Geauga Habitat for Humanity

￼
Painesville's Steele Mansion 
It was great to visit Painesville's Steele Mansion on Thursday, a wonderful example of the importance of Ohio Historic Preservation Tax Credits.

Boasting 222 craft breweries, Michigan has the 6th highest number of craft breweries in the entire nation. Drafting Table Brewing Company opened by young entrepreneurs Aaron and Kristen, right here, in Wixom is one of our state's newest breweries.

Ensuring Our Veterans Receive the Healthcare They Have Earned
Our nation's veterans put their lives on the line to protect ours, and when they return home they have earned nothing less than the highest quality healthcare. For far too long, the VA system has failed these brave men and women with years of backlogs, secret lists, and subpar health services. In the first half of this year alone, I've supported legislation that restores accountability to the VA, provides our nation's veterans with high-quality medical care, and, this week, legislation I supported to breakthrough years of backlog and finally provide our nation's veterans with the services they need was signed into law.

Dear Friend,
August has been such an exciting month! I have been traveling throughout the fourth district of Missouri greeting long-time friends and seeing new faces. It has been great to hear all the thoughts, questions, concerns, and ideas on how to make government work better for the people. 
Before discussing the latest events, I want to say my thoughts and prayers go out to the sailors and their families impacted by the tragic USS John S. McCain accident as well as the crewmen from the Black Hawk helicopter crash earlier this month. I am also praying for the people of Texas and Boone County Fire Protection District’s MO Task Force One deploying to Texas to help with Hurricane Harvey. Anyone who goes toward danger to help others should be applauded, and we pray for safety for everyone involved.
Solar Eclipse Comes to Missouri
As I’m sure you know, this week Missouri experienced one of the most amazing events in nature: a total solar eclipse. I watched the incredible eclipse from Sedalia, and I was wowed by how beautiful the moment was. The event was in conjunction with the dedication of a new educational kiosk built by Eagle Scout candidate Will Hooten as part of the Starline Brass Trails End Plaza commemorating the cattle drives that ended in Sedalia.  Ironically, the last time a total eclipse happened in Sedalia was in 1867 when cowboys brought their cattle to trail’s end.  It was fitting we watch the next total eclipse on the same spot. The event allowed me to meet so many new people and say hello to old friends.  Everyone was awe-inspired at the beauty of the spectacle.  As I shared in my remarks, God’s majesty was on display. In the words of David, “When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them? You have made them a little lower than angels and crowned them with glory and honor. You made them rulers over the works of your hands; you put everything under their feet…LORD, our LORD, how majestic is your name in all the earth!”
￼
(The Starline Brass Trails End Plaza was built on the Missouri State Fairgrounds by many dedicated volunteers to commemorate the first cattle drives that ended in Sedalia.)
￼
(Hartzler watched the eclipse with Boy Scout Troop 66, Eagle Scout candidate Will Hooten and State Rep. Dean Dohrman, among others)
Making Lunch Affordable and Putting Parents in the Driver's Seat
This week I am proud to announce the introduction of the School Lunch Affordability Act (HR 3307), legislation that would return all control over local lunch prices to the school districts and school boards. As students return to school this month, this legislation provides freedom to school administrators and enables lower prices for students. Current federal rules require schools to use a formula to determine school lunch prices, but that formula is a one-size fits all approach that is forcing some schools to charge more than necessary for paid lunches. The current formula is intended to ensure that the paid lunch prices can fund the lunch program, but in many cases schools can fund the program without raising lunch prices.
Common-sense changes need to be made to the National School Lunch Program to ensure all children have access to nutritious, affordable meals without putting unnecessary burdens on our local school districts. Local schools require permanent relief and local control, not more mandates and bureaucratically approved waivers.
This bill protects the student lunch program while allowing school lunch decisions to be made at the local level so parents, teachers, and administrators can work together to decide what is best for their children. Let’s get prices down and put parents and schools back in the driver’s seat!
Taking Questions from Home
I’ve spent all week traveling throughout the District, meeting with constituents and taking their questions. Aside from enjoying Missouri in the summertime, one of my favorite parts of August is to meet with my fellow Missourians and hear their questions, concerns, and ideas to get our country moving again. Without their input, I couldn’t do my job in Congress, so I try to fit as many meetings as possible into my schedule each day. 
Whether it’s seeing the important work the Healing Box project is doing in Columbia or visiting the American Family Care urgent care facility in Sedalia, each meeting is an opportunity to learn and to hear from the people I serve. 
Here are photos of the week so you can see some of the highlights!
￼
(Vicky learned how to play the guitar at the Healing Box project with Dave Dunklee and other veterans in Columbia. Dave and his wife, C.J. started this weekly gathering where veterans can be together and learn to play the guitar. It’s fun and healing for these heroic veterans who have given so much for our country.)
￼
 (As part of her efforts to ‘walk a mile in your shoes’, Vicky spent part of a day delivering UPS packages in Columbia. She got to visit with several great people and experience how hard these dedicated drivers work delivering our packages on time. Thank you, UPS, for making this possible!) 
￼
(Vicky visited the American Family Care urgent care facility in Sedalia. This facility fills a need where patients can have access to quality primary care without an appointment even in the evenings and weekends.  Even though this facility just opened, it is already exceeding expectations and being utilized at a high rate by the Sedalia community.)
￼
(Vicky visits with Center for Human Services employees. These hard-working individuals find meaningful work here and contribute to our society. Vicky is very supportive of our sheltered workshops and wants to ensure disabled adults have the opportunity to work here without government impediments.)
￼
(Vicky visited State Fair Community College on their first day of school which was the same day as the Total Solar Eclipse.  Dr. Joanna Anderson and the Board of Trustees do a great job providing relevant education experiences to help students reach their academic and career goals. Enrollment is up, new programs have started, and great things are happening at SFCC!)
￼
(Vicky toured MFA Incorporated Agri Services and Distribution facilities in Sedalia.  With harvest just around the corner, it was great to see the facilities and grain-handling equipment.)
￼
(Vicky flew with Air Evac Lifeteam 119 in Moberly. The Team provides 24-7-365 care for individuals in emergency situations saving countless lives. I was honored to meet them, thank them, and experience a little of what it is like to fly with a helicopter Air Evac Team.)
￼
(It was a great time!)
These are just a few of so many great meetings and conversations this week. I will be continuing to meet with constituents next week before heading back to Washington to take the ideas I’ve gained from our district and apply them to the challenges our nation is facing. Thank you for reading!
Have a great week!
 
Yours in service,
￼

THE SCALISE CAPITOL REPORT
As Hurricane Harvey continues to impact coastal Texas, Congressman Scalise’s office is keeping a close eye on the storm’s path and trajectory. As we in southeast Louisiana know all too well, hurricanes can be unpredictable. Even though our state is not expected to bear the brunt of the storm, the outer bands of Hurricane Harvey will likely impact several parishes throughout southeast Louisiana. We will remain in contact with local leaders, as well as state and federal officials to monitor the storm’s progress. 
As always, our office encourages you to remain vigilant and prepared. Please find information about evacuation routes, preparation tips, and contact information for various state and local agencies here on our website.

Kate Steinle’s murder at the hands of an illegal immigrant is tragic reminder of the need to secure our borders.  
Under President Trump, the executive branch is doing just that.
Illegal crossings on the U.S.-Mexico border are at the lowest point in 17 years, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. 
It’s a big difference from Barack Obama’s approach – he circumvented Congress and granted amnesty to nearly five million illegal immigrants in 2014.
Now Congress needs to help solve the illegal immigration problem by passing Kate's Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. These two House-passed bills, both of which I co-sponsored, would cut federal funds for sanctuary cities and toughen penalties against anyone who re-enters the country after being deported. 
Mitch McConnell and the Senate need to approve these bills immediately!
I believe that we should be doing everything in our power to deport dangerous criminal illegals and prevent new ones from entering our county.
No amnesty. Secure the border. Enforce the laws. Respect the Constitution.

Carl Icahn’s Failed Raid on Washington
By Patrick Radden Keefe, The New Yorker
One day in August, 2016, the financier Carl Icahn made an urgent phone call to the Environmental Protection Agency.

￼
Icahn is one of the richest men on Wall Street, and he has thrived, in no small measure, because of a capacity to intimidate. A Texas-based oil refiner in which he had a major stake was losing money because of an obscure environmental rule that Icahn regarded as unduly onerous. Icahn is a voluble critic of any government regulation that constrains his companies. So he wanted to speak with the person in charge of enforcing the policy: a senior official at the E.P.A. named Janet McCabe.

Icahn works from a suite of offices, atop the General Motors Building, in midtown, that are decorated in the oak-and-leather fashion of a tycoon’s lair in a nineteen-eighties film. During that decade, Icahn made his reputation as one of the original corporate raiders, pioneering the art of the hostile takeover and establishing himself as a human juggernaut—a pugnacious deal machine, all avarice and swagger. By the time he called the E.P.A., he was eighty, and long since unburdened of any personal or dynastic need to make money; according to Forbes, he is worth approximately seventeen billion dollars. Plenty of titans who are not as old and not as rich as Icahn have opted to devote their remaining years to spending their money, or to giving it away. Not Icahn. A tall man with a shambling manner, he recently grew a white beard, which softens his round face, giving him the cuddly appearance of an elderly Muppet. But he has not lost his taste for the kill. A few years ago, he sold his mega-yacht, because cruising on it bored him. He has engaged in philanthropy, building charter schools and a stadium on Randall’s Island that bears his name. But the charity circuit is a snooze. What Icahn loves beyond all else is to rise late each morning, and then to spend the rest of the day and much of the night working the phone, making deals.

The U.S. is risking an academic brain drain
￼
By Shane Savitsky, Axios
Linsen Li is a Chinese-born, 30-year-old specialist in advanced batteries — a postdoc in MIT's material science and engineering program. He received his Ph.D in chemistry from the University of Wisconsin, in all spending the last seven years in the U.S. His infant son, William, is an American citizen.
But he's reluctantly going home: Li tells Axios that, having received no teaching offers in the U.S., he's accepted a $65,000-a-year teaching slot at Shanghai's Jiao Tong University, along with the equivalent of a fat $900,000 in research funding, in addition to $250,000 to buy a house.  The program that grabbed him: Li is returning under China's Thousand Talents Plan, which seeks to lure back under-40 Chinese students and professionals to bolster the country's research sector. ""I just don't want to think about it,"" Li says. "" … I still would like to stay here if I find an opportunity. … I never actually worked in China. I did grow up and go to school, but I've never actually worked in China.""
Why it matters: Absent a commitment to scientific research or immigration reform, the U.S. risks losing significant numbers of the foreign-born Ph.Ds and post-docs at its best universities to other nations. And this brain drain has the potential to accelerate should the White House continue its inaction on these issues.

Markets Eye Debt Ceiling With Unease
By Ben Eisen and Kristina Peterson, The Wall Street Journal
Early signs of concern about the federal debt ceiling are creeping into the financial markets, as President Donald Trump pressured lawmakers over how to proceed on the issue.
While stocks remain sturdy, the yields on Treasury bills that mature shortly after the debt-limit deadline have been on the rise. A Treasury bill due Oct. 12 has a higher yield than one that matures Nov. 24, according to Tradeweb. That is unusual for fixed-income securities, which typically yield more for longer maturities.
That kink suggests investors are worried Washington may fail, and yields are rising to compensate for the risk investors due their money in October won’t be paid on time. The yields have been on the rise this summer, but the differential has picked up in recent days, and sooner than during debt-ceiling standoffs in 2011, 2013 and 2015.
Mr. Trump in Thursday tweets blamed the congressional Republican leadership for what he called the “mess” awaiting lawmakers this fall as they seek to raise the nation’s borrowing limit and, separately, keep the government running when funding runs out at the end of September.

I Want to Persuade You to Care About Other People
By Danielle Tcholakian, Longreads
A few years ago, my middle brother and I were in Boca Raton, Fla. for Thanksgiving, visiting my mother’s parents. We’re very close with my grandparents, and one of the things I appreciate about my grandfather is that he has taken me — us — seriously for as long as I can remember. I spent every summer with him and my grandmother out on Long Island from when I was born into my teenage years, and I still can’t recall a time when I didn’t feel entitled to vigorously share my opinion with my grandfather, regardless of whether he would agree with it. When he would include me on forwarded political or (debatably) humorous e-mails with his Boca Raton pals — mostly politically conservative, Jewish guys like him — I would reply-all to any I found false or offensive in any way, lecturing men at least half a century older than me. He never yelled at me for telling off his friends and never took me off the email list for those forwards.
During the 2008 presidential election, I was in college, and I convinced him and my grandmother to vote for Barack Obama. It was the first time in our relationship, as far as I can recall, when my opinion wasn’t only given consideration, but prompted real change. I vividly remember running out to my friend’s Chicago porch after watching the vice-presidential debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin to call my grandpa and crow, “Who you gonna vote for now, Papa?” And I remember his good-natured laugh, his heavy sigh, his admission that yes, I was right. He was going to vote for my guy — in Florida, where it mattered.
Another thing I love about my grandfather is how he’s open-minded in a way that’s unusual among men of his generation. He’s no free-love hippie: This is a man who will drink at least one Coca-Cola a day for the rest of his life; who wears his socks pulled up so tautly, I don’t understand how they never fall; who worked hard for every dime he earned; who to this day insists Costco hot dogs are a great lunch; who plays tennis six days a week and pickle ball the seventh; and who spends a good two to three hours every day reading the paper. My grandfather lived through segregation, quietly. He is not a rabble rouser. But he has always been tickled by the rabble rouser in me, always willing to hear my liberal side out. After I worked as a journalist for Metro New York covering Mike Bloomberg as mayor of New York City, the things I learned of Bloomberg from his staff reminded me of my grandpa in that way. Make a convincing argument, and he’ll listen to it.

Dear Friend -   I am here to serve you.   My most important job as your representative is to assist constituents when they have a problem with a federal agency. My office can also assist with tour, flag, and meeting requests and Service Academy nominations.   Below you can find specific information on the most common constituent services my office provides. For a full listing of all the ways we can help, visit my website.   Here are the ways my staff and I can help you:  * Help with a Federal Agency: From the Social Security Administration to the Department of Veterans Affairs, I can help if you're having a problem or need an issue resolved. Although I cannot override the decisions made by a federal agency, I can often intervene on a person's behalf to answer questions, find solutions, or just cut through the red tape. The best way to initiate a case is to call one of my district offices so that the proper staff member can follow up with you. Their telephone numbers are: (804) 730-6595 - Hanover/Mechanicsville; (540) 659-2734 - Stafford; or (804) 443-0668 – Tappahannock.  * Tour and Flag Requests: My office can help you schedule a tour of the White House or the Capitol building during your visit to Washington, D.C. Visit my website to start a tour request. I am also able to assist you in obtaining a flag flown over the Capitol to commemorate a special occasion. Click here to learn more about this service.   * Service Academy Nominations: Each year I have the privilege of nominating a limited number of people to our nation's Service Academies. A great way to start the application process is to attend my annual Service Academy Day. High school and middle school student, parents, and guidance counselors are all invited and will be provided with a comprehensive overview of the United States Service Academies and the respective admissions processes. Students will also have the opportunity to meet with officials from the service academies and representatives from other Virginia congressional offices. To learn more about Service Academy Day, click here.   And you can always contact me anytime an issue that concerns you comes before the House.   It's an honor to serve you and Virginia's First District in the People's House.  Sincerely,  Rob

LISTENING DRIVES RESULTS

Lindsey - 
I always strive to be accessible and accountable to you. This week I held three town halls to hear from our neighbors about the issues that matter most to them, and I also introduced two new pieces of legislation to help create more jobs in our community and restore our water quality.
I always try to tell it like it is, without any BS. So let me say this: I'm on a war path to change the way things work in DC. That starts with listening to you and then bringing your ideas to Washington.
That's how the two bills I introduced this week came about: I listened to what our neighbors had to say and then acted on their ideas. As a result, we have a new bill to help the maritime industry create new jobs and legislation mandating that the federal government gets involved in fixing the algal bloom problems that they've helped create.
To hear more about these bills, watch my weekly update video here:

Dear Friend, 
Another school year has begun and the sights and sounds of Friday night lights are filling the air. The beginning of a new school year and the return of high school football also reminds me about the importance of local choice, local control and local leadership over the education of the children raised here in south central and southeast Missouri.   Parents and educators who live here, who raise their families here and who know what's best for our children should be making the decision about their education, not some bureaucrat in Washington. Our teachers are in these classrooms to teach, not to spend hours pushing paper to comply with federal testing standards which try to compare our children to ones raised in San Francisco. Teachers should be free to educate, not worrying about Washington regulations looming over them as they work to inspire their students.   I was at Jefferson R-7 High School last spring when the school superintendent gave me a MASSIVE stack of papers that the federal government was requiring him to fill out, wasting hours upon hours of his time complying with government rules instead of using his time to focus on the local school district. This kind of interference from Washington in our classrooms is unacceptable.   When I first joined Congress, we were able to pass legislation that would give local control back to our schools. Unfortunately, Senate Liberals and the Obama Administration wanted to keep their federal power over Missouri schools. They sent a watered-down version of the bill back to us, taking away the local control provisions I fought so hard for. I voted against this legislation because I know our schools run best when they are managed on the local level, and this bill left too much decision-making power about your child's education in the hands of Washington bureaucrats.   During my time in office, I have visited schools in all thirty counties which make up the 8th Congressional district. I relish the opportunity to interact with teachers, students and parents to hear more about what issues they are facing in the classroom and how I can help them. Beyond the challenges of keeping up with unrealistic and burdensome federal requirements, teachers consistently tell me they are struggling to keep their classrooms stocked with supplies, with many taking money out of their own paycheck to buy materials needed to help their students learn. Because of this, I co-authored legislation that provided hardworking teachers with a tax cut on the supplies they buy on their own which will help our teachers save money while providing supplies for their students.   At almost all of my stops, I also heard about how much waste was being created by programs like Michelle Obama's federally mandated school lunch plan. In 2010, then First Lady Michelle Obama along with liberal leaders like Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid took their interference from the classroom to the lunch room and unveiled new government rules for how your kids should eat when they are at school, creating more expenses and unfunded Washington mandates for our local school districts - often resulting in schools having to scale back the amount of meals they could afford to serve.   As students get back to school and you head out to enjoy the local high school football game, Congress must get back to work and take action on tax cuts, infrastructure investments, lowering healthcare costs, and improving national security. As we work on these issues, I will continue my fight to keep Washington out of Missourians' homes, pocketbooks, family farms and children's classrooms, making sure you and your family can enjoy the freedom of locally controlled schools. 
Focus On Farms 
During several of my focus on farms stops this month, I've heard concerns about the Electronic Logging Device (ELD) mandate. 

Whether you're transporting sod, milk or watermelons, the ELD mandate is going to cost you. That's why I have coauthored legislation to delay this mandate and search for a better solution that doesn't put unnecessary regulatory burdens on small farms, agribusinesses and the hardworking folks who transport their goods and supplies. 

￼ 

At Spring Hill Pumpkin Patch in Texas County, I talked with owner Duncan Smith about the ridiculous government rules and regulations he faced and how he ventured into the pumpkin patch agribusiness. 

Last October, Duncan had more than 5,000 folks visit his pumpkin patch, and is looking forward to hosting even more this year! If you're in the area, make sure to take your family to check out the fun and games they have to offer. 
  
￼ 

I also got to visit with the Dowdens at their family dairy farm in Wright County. The Dowdens are some of the hardest working folks I have ever seen and keep Dowden Dairy running with the help of their four children.

Like me, the Dowdens are worried that big-government regulations are going to put small family farms out of business. Farms like Dowden Dairy and so many others family farms in our area are why I continue to fight to keep Washington bureaucrats out of Missourians' lives and off of Missouri family farms 
What's Great in the 8th 
￼ 

We kicked off this week with the 2017 Great American Solar Eclipse. It was definitely a once in a lifetime experience. I hope you enjoyed watching with family and friends! 

￼ 
We also learned that more jobs are coming to our area! I have always said that Missouri's 8th Congressional District is home to the most hardworking, talented and dedicated folks found anywhere in the world, glad employers feel the same way! AT&T is adding 150 call center jobs in Cape! 
You can read the full story here. 
￼ 
Finally, I got to talk with folks from the Butler County Chamber of Commerce. I am grateful for all of the work their organization does for the local small business community in Poplar Bluff and the surrounding areas!

The Battle Over Confederate Statues
￼
Click on the image above to watch the clip “Confederate statues in the US Capitol? Your Lawmakers Weigh In” as reported by WAVY-TV.
Last week, in Charlottesville, Virginia, a domestic terror attack was carried out by white supremacist groups.  Following the attack, protestors in Durham and across the country spoke out against the attack, the continued racial disparities in our communities, and President Donald Trump’s reluctance to take a firm stand against hateful ideologies.

There is no doubt that our country has a long and painful history with race, and the presence of confederate statues are part of this history.  

The American people, including the president, must stand up and confront the scourge of racism, bigotry, and domestic terror in our country.  That is why I am calling for the immediate removal of all confederate statues and monuments that are displayed on government property, including the United States Capitol.  These monuments depict a history that must be taught to future generations, but not celebrated.

You can read my full statement following the domestic terror attack in Charlottesville and the demonstrations that followed in Durham here.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Arkansas has the nation's second-highest opioid prescribing rate.This statistic should not be taken lightly; opioid addiction is real and is affecting our communities. 
In 2015, more than 50,000 Americans died of drug overdoses. This is now the leading cause of death for people over 50. Because a majority of Arkansans live in a rural part of the state they are unable to find the help they need. To make matters worse drug-related deaths are nearly 50 percent higher in rural areas.
A few weeks ago I introduced the ARRC Act, Addiction Recovery for Rural Communities Act, that would give rural communities the ability to fight the opioid and addiction epidemic. To learn more about my bill, click here.

WHEN POLITICAL CORRECTNESS GOES TOO FAR On Monday, I had a column published in Fox News that discussed when political correctness goes too far in our society.  I believe history is an opportunity to learn from one’s mistakes and that what's most important is that our nation remembers and learns from them.  When we censor our history by disguising our scars, we belittle the struggles our ancestors fought so hard to overcome. America doesn't cower behind political correctness. It defiantly and courageously moves forward, with its history as a reminder of where we have been.  Read my entire op-ed via Fox News at this link. 
TRAVELING THROUGH OKLAHOMA It was a productive week in Oklahoma! I spoke at the Northeast Board of Realtors’ meeting to discuss real estate on the state and federal level on Tuesday.  Later on, I visited with Kit Coughran of the American Boxing Association.  I also had the opportunity to tour the Orizon Aerostructures manufacturing facility in Grove. Day in and day out, they work hard assembling components to send to leading manufacturers. It was great to see the skilled jobs and economic benefits Orizon brings to this side of Oklahoma. I ended my day after meeting with a few constituents for coffee in Grove.   
￼
Thanks to Orizon for the wonderful tour!
On Wednesday, I spoke at the Owasso Chamber legislative affairs luncheon. It was great to meet with our local business owners to discuss regulations affecting their small businesses.  That afternoon in Inola, I held a coffee with constituents to hear about what issues are on their mind.  
￼
Great conversation at the coffee in Grove this week.
On Thursday, I met with those attending the Red River Valley Association Water Conference and was able to talk with them about some of our infrastructure needs in Oklahoma.  Afterwards, I toured Cardinal Glass in Durant to see how their float glass is produced and shipped off to its distributors for use in window units.  The plant keeps jobs right here in Oklahoma, and I was glad to see the high quality products they export each day.  That afternoon, I met with Dr. Dib, a cardiologist in Durant, to discuss issues directly affecting delivery and quality of cardiovascular care.  
￼
Neat to see how float glass is made at Cardinal Glass!
￼
Thanks to Dr. Dib for showing me around the Durant Hospital.
To wrap up my week, I spoke to the Navigate Entrepreneur Conference on Friday in Yukon about getting started as a young entrepreneur and what I’ve learned since taking over the family business.  I finished up my day by meeting with Delta Dental of Oklahoma about upcoming legislation that would affect the dental industry.     
Next week, I’ll continue my travels throughout Oklahoma. Make sure to visit my Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr pages to see how I’m working on your behalf in Congress.

8/26/17 11:36,Beyond resistance: Closing the wage gap,"Update | Saturday, August 26, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 29th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: closing the wage gap.
Pay equity has been the law since 1963, yet women are still only paid 77 percent of men's salaries. In fact, a recent study of college graduates showed that in their first year after graduation, women earned only 80 percent as much as male graduates. Pay disparity continues to be discriminatory and only worsens over time.
The numbers are more disturbing for women of color. African American women, on average, earn 63 percent of the salary of a white man – and Latina women make only 54 percent of their white male counterparts, losing more than a million dollars over a 40-year career. We must address the lost income over a lifetime and its devastating impact on the lives of women and their families.
I was proud when President Obama was elected and we passed the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to make it easier for women who have been discriminated against to make their case for equal pay in court. This was a small, but impactful step in the battle for gender equality. Now, I’m fighting for the Paycheck Fairness Act to further address the unfair and unjust wage gap that persists. 
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage,

National Security Strategy
 

This week President Trump gave a national security address where he presented the new U.S. military strategy for Afghanistan. His strategy consists of remaining in Afghanistan with a ""shift from a time-based approach to one based on conditions.""  I agree 100% with him.  This is something I have been discussing for years, especially after the mess that was made when President Obama made the decision to pull troops out of Iraq.  
His deliverance of the new strategy was vague in language, but clear and concise on the fact that we now have an end goal and a strategy in place to achieve it. We should NEVER tell our enemies exactly what our plans are or give them a time frame. Obama made the major mistake of announcing a timeline in which he planned to withdraw troops, opening up windows and doors for terrorists to begin plans to flood the area and take over.  I'm pleased that President Trump took time to listen to the generals and those with the expertise around him and make the best possible decision on the strategy moving forward in Afghanistan.   
Around South Mississippi

￼

This week I spoke at the Grand Opening of the Department of Homeland Security's new Unmanned Aircraft System Site at Camp Shelby.  This means all small drone technology across the country will now be tested right here in South Mississippi!

￼

￼

Last week I met with folks from the Mississippi Rural Water Association including Mayor of Ellisville, Lynn Buckhaults, Mayor of Lumberton, Quincy Rogers, and the Mayor of Sumrall, Heath Sumrall. I was happy to speak and take questions about issues important them and provide a legislative update. Thanks again to Mr. Kirby Mayfield for inviting me to take part in this event.

Dear Friend, 
When visitors from around our region and across the world visit Mt. Rainier they are taken by its beauty and magnificence. It is one of our nation’s prized natural treasures that we are fortunate to have in our home state. What often goes unrecognized are the brave and committed individuals who risk their lives to make our visits safe and enjoyable. On Friday, I spoke at a memorial dedication ceremony for four park rangers (Margaret Anderson, Nick Hall, Sean Ryan, and Philip Otis) who lost their lives on Mt. Rainier between 1995 and 2012 while on rescue missions or doing their job of keeping the park’s visitors safe. I am eternally grateful for their sacrifice and admire the love they had for our nation’s national parks and the many people who come from across the world to witness Mt. Rainier’s beauty.
￼
It has been a full week on the west side of the mountains and I had the privilege of sitting down with many constituents, business owners, and young people from our district. Here are some of the highlights!
Advancing Global Health
Decreasing child and infant mortality and strengthening maternal health care across the globe are causes we can all get behind. It has been a pleasure to work with Save the Children over the years and I remain committed to championing global health issues. 
￼
Welcoming the New Youth Advisory Board
Every year I have the opportunity to welcome new members from across our region to my Youth Advisory Board (YAB). YAB was formed to hear from high school constituents and learn about what issues concern them most. I am always impressed by the passion and drive from the many bright young minds in Washington’s Eighth District. This week I met the members for the coming year and I look forward to getting to know them as we tour businesses around the district, meet community leaders, hear from guest speakers, and engage in roundtable discussions.
To learn more about the YAB program, click HERE. 
￼
Creating Memories at Local Parks
Our local parks are places where our children can run free, we can meet other members of our community, and we can make memories to carry with us as our children grow into adults. I’m working in Congress to protect funding and permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) that supports local projects like the Covington Community Park, which is one of the great parks in our region where families create life-long memories. Over the past several years, the park has continued to expand and add additional resources, including trails and soccer fields. It was a pleasure to attend the park’s groundbreaking ceremony for stage two of the park’s development this week! 
￼
Supporting Small Businesses and Tax Reform
I had the opportunity to speak with State Farm agents and constituents Eric, Nancy and Luis about how tax reform and a high-standard trade agenda are critical to supporting our local small businesses. Thanks for stopping by! 
￼
Meeting With Leaders in Aerospace Engineering
Our region is home to some of the greatest leaders in aerospace engineering who employ countless workers throughout our region. I spoke with members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) about some of their top priorities, including immigration reform and supporting the Ex-Im Bank. 
￼
Hearing from Local Veterans
It is always a pleasure to visit with our veterans. I enjoyed speaking with Vietnam veterans John and Mike when they stopped by my Issaquah office. Thank you for your service! 
￼
Training the Next Generation of Air Traffic Controllers
Thanks to the members of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) for stopping by my Issaquah office. Our air traffic controllers provide a critical service to our country and we must ensure they have the resources they need to train the next generation working in the field.
￼

Have a wonderful and safe weekend and I will speak with you next time! 

Sincerely,
Dave

Afghanistan... 15 Years Later
Dear Friend:
This past week, President Trump announced his Administration’s plan for Afghanistan and, in doing so, changed the restrictive rules of engagement for our troops, increased force levels, and announced that all future decisions will be based on the situation on the ground and not an arbitrary timeline. 
No doubt, I think that the United States made a terrible mistake, after the defeat of the Taliban in 2001, in turning Afghanistan into a major nation-building operation that has given the Afghan people a Western-style form of governance that does not reflect the political culture of the country. I was very relieved to hear President Trump state his opposition to nation-building and that the end state for our policy in Afghanistan will be limited  to eliminating Afghanistan’s use as a safe haven and as a training ground for terrorists who threaten our security and the security of our allies. 
Previously, our armed forces have been heavily restricted from firing on Taliban forces unless they were determined to have shown “hostile intent” to U.S. forces.  Even when the Taliban were attacking Afghan Security Forces and U.S. military personnel could see them massing in preparation for an attack, we could not fire on them unless U.S. forces were also objectives of the attack. This was clearly a significant mistake that both ultimately jeopardizes the safety of our troops as well as our Afghan allies. With President Trump’s new guidelines in place, we can now apply increased military pressure on the Taliban to drive them to negotiate an end to the war. In the speech, President Trump also mentioned the possibility for a shared governance with the Taliban. There are rural Pashtun areas of the country where the Taliban are popular and where their conservative Islamic values reflect the culture. However, the Taliban have no incentive to reach a negotiated settlement so long as they believe that they are winning.
I also agree with the President’s call to base force levels on the conditions on the ground rather than the previously announced time lines. The war in Afghanistan has been under sourced starting when President Bush diverted attention and resources to the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and subsequent nation-building operation in Iraq. By 2011, the Taliban were back in Afghanistan and were rapidly gaining ground. President Obama was given a number of options for increasing our troop strength in Afghanistan to keep the Afghan government from collapsing. The lowest option was a surge of 40,000 troops but labeled as “high risk/low probability of success.” President Obama dramatically under sourced the smallest surge option by approving only 30,000 troops and then publically stated exactly when they would withdraw before they were ever deployed sending a clear signal to the Taliban on how to structure their plans around the temporary increased U.S. troop presence.  
When I return to Washington, as the Chairman of the Armed Services subcommittee on Military Personnel, and as a Marine Corps combat veteran, I will do all I can to ensure that our servicemen and women serving in Afghanistan are given the resources they need as they seek to implement President Trump’s new approach in Afghanistan. 
Sincerely,

Weekly Review
 
August 19

￼

The National Debt: I caught this cartoon recently and thought to myself, “This would actually be pretty funny...if it weren’t so true.”

Instead, it’s an all-too-realistic summary of where we are as a country….

There’s no telling when that exact moment will come, but we are rapidly approaching a financial day of reckoning with regard to federal spending. What is transpiring presently and into the Fall with regard to spending underscores this. It was for this reason that I voted against the so-called ‘minibus’, and it is the larger financial complexion of our country that will make difficult a number of votes this Fall on spending.

Today, it’s estimated that our country’s liabilities are greater than our assets. More significantly, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio is presently at peace-time highs and is expected to almost double that over the next 30 years. We are rapidly approaching the level of debt that Greece had at the time of their financial implosion… but it’s always important to remember that we don’t have a European Union to bail us out as they did.
 
￼

August 22

Partisanship and Political Animosity: It would seem that if there’s one thing we all agree on nowadays, it’s that our country stands very bitterly divided.

In fact, the Pew Research Center conducted a recent survey that noted that 86% of Democrats had an unfavorable view of the Republican Party. What’s more, over 90% of Republicans had the same negative opinion about Democrats. These numbers are up an average of 20 points from when the same survey was last conducted in 1994, and they paint the picture of an America torn almost entirely in half.

In the last few weeks, I’ve touched briefly on the breakdown in civil discourse in America, and I thought it was interesting to see these thoughts backed up by real numbers. Abraham Lincoln once warned that “a house divided against itself cannot stand…” and while I don’t think we’re due for another Civil War, his words still matter.

For one, a bit of civility and grace can go a long way in helping us make our arguments to others. It was in fact Benjamin Franklin who coined this “Golden Rule” of life, which was to always treat others as you would expect them to treat you. Imagine debating with your neighbor or relative…if they aren’t screaming in your face you will probably be more agreeable.

George Washington himself warned us against the dangers of partisanship when he compared the “domination of one faction over another” to “frightful despotism.” In simpler terms, we should always be wary of the ways parties can put themselves before ideas and people.

Government Spending: Early last night, I spoke on CNN about where we go next on government spending. It's the problem of Washington that no one talks about - yet with each day we wait, our problem grows to be more complex on the spending front. This is not a partisan, Republican perspective. Indeed, it was Erskine Bowles, President Clinton's former Chief of Staff, who once observed that not addressing our spending represented the path to the most certain financial crisis in the history of man.

Shooting in Charleston: I had a busy day moving across the tri-county area, but my last stop this evening was briefly with WCIV | ABC News 4 here in Charleston. They asked me to share a few thoughts on the tragedy that occurred today on King Street. You can never articulate as well as you’d like in the immediate back and forth that goes with live television. And one person’s horrific actions can in no way be seen as the responsibility of the rest of us, but part of what we talked about in the brief interview was on the degree to which we really are at an inflection point in the way we relate one to the other as Americans. Let me say again, one person’s guilt in a horrific shooting does not mean that the rest of us are guilty of horrendous actions and the consequences that come with them, but I really do believe we are at an inflection point.

It’s one that I believe suggests that we should all take a little bit deeper look on how we see others and react to others. At least in the political world, it seems to me that people are reacting faster and faster. In some cases they rush to judgment without looking at the underlying facts. My friend Cubby Culbertson in Columbia used to always say when emotion is high, discernment is low. And what I have seen over the last month in my comings and goings in the district is a level of frustration and tension that in some cases is palpable. What we do next in diffusing this will rest on the actions and deliberations of all of us.

None of this directly ties to the tragedy that occurred on King Street, and I’m still not articulating the thought that is running through my mind that well, but to see my attempt at doing so, please take a look at the video below…

Now Law: Michigan job and public health legislation  



Friend,
Welcome to your weekly update. As always, you can learn more about these and other legislative issues at my website: upton.house.gov. 
Now Law: Michigan job and public health legislation 
Recently, the president signed into law a bill I championed, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017. Workers, job creators, and patients here in Michigan and across the country depend on this legislation, and we delivered. This bipartisan legislation is about two things: Local jobs and improving public health. 
As I’ve visited with local workers and leaders of innovative companies like Pfizer Inc., which recently announced a multi-million dollar expansion in Portage, they’ve told me first-hand how important this legislation is to protect these good-paying, local jobs. I’ve also heard from patients who have benefitted from the new therapies the FDA helps get to market thanks to this legislation. It’s a win-win. This action is so important to Southwest Michigan and I’m pleased to see it signed into law.
You can learn more about this important legislative win here.
Encouraging job creation in Southwest Michigan 
On Wednesday, I was able to participate in a roundtable discussion hosted by local small business owners, the Michigan Restaurant Association, and the National Restaurant Association.
Our local small business owners are the heart and soul of Michigan and our economy. Southwest Michigan is home to more than 1,160 eating and drinking establishments, employing more than 23,400 people. Roundtables like these are the perfect opportunity to listen to business owners and learn about the issues and regulations that are impacting their restaurants. These discussions facilitate a chance to get feedback as to what we can be doing in Washington to lessen their burdens as they look to grow our local economy and create more good paying jobs.
You can learn more about the event here.
One more thing….
It was another week full of events and productive listening sessions with folks back home.
Had a good chat about the need for pro-growth tax reform at the Kalamazoo Kiwanis Club, met with Metropolitan Kalamazoo Branch NAACP President Strick Strickland, gave a welcome at the Kalamazoo County Substance Abuse Task Force “Live Above the Influence” Youth Summit at WMU, stopped by the Saugatuck-Douglas History Museum, met with the leadership for Allegan County Community Mental Health services, spoke at the Van Buren Farm Bureau Legislative Dinner, attended the Women’s Equality Day Annual Luncheon at WMU, and more. I also met with individual constituents in Kalamazoo about issues like healthcare and tax reform. 
You can see pictures from all these great events and more right on my Facebook page. To set up meetings or one-on-ones call any of my offices anytime. 
Have a great weekend and God bless,
-Fred

Friend,

Throughout this August District Work Period, I've had the opportunity to sit down with constituents throughout Ohio's Second District, to listen to your thoughts on issues of the day and important policy topics like healthcare and tax reform. Check out a few highlights below. 

Your thoughts and feedback are important to me as I work to effectively represent you in the House of Representatives. Click here to share your thoughts, and here to schedule a meeting. I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours in service,
￼

Legislation: Tax Reform
￼
Across Ohio's Second District -- as I sit down and talk with small business owners, manufacturers, restaurant owners, and other constituents -- I've heard three common requests when it comes to tax reform:
	•	Competitive. Right now America has the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. Our employers need to be able to compete on a global scale -- which is why we need to lower the corporate tax rate to 20%.
	•	Comprehensive. The tax code hasn't been overhauled since 1986. To say it is complex and convoluted is an understatement. At this point, it doesn't just need a tweak here and there - we need to streamline the entire code into a 21st century, pro-growth system that benefits everyone, from families to employers.
	•	Concrete. Uncertainty cripples small businesses -- what our employers need is permanent reform, so they can plan for growth and success 5, 10, 20 years down the road.

Honoring Heroes
I was honored to have been a part of the Easterseals Military Appreciation Ceremony at the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati.

On Military Appreciation Day at the W&S Open, there were 25,000 attendees to thank our men and women in uniform for their service to this great country. Thank you to everyone in our community who joined us.

Last stop before flight

￼

Last week, I toured General Electric's (GE) test facility in Peebles, OH. This facility is the 'last stop before flight,' where engines are tested and must go through simulations of real-world hail and ice storms, typhoon conditions, and winds up to 100 mph. During my discussion with GE employees, they stressed the importance of comprehensive and permanent tax reform to allow companies like GE, start-ups, and small businesses in Ohio and across the country to continue to provide jobs to our communities and spur American innovation for generations to come. 
  

SOMC

I had the opportunity to hold a roundtable with the healthcare providers at the Southern Ohio Medical Center facility in West Union to hear their thoughts on how our country's healthcare system can better serve our rural communities and increase access to care.  Learn more here.

Ramp It Up
'Ramp it up for Veterans' provides renovations for Cincinnati veterans' homes, including the installation of ramps to make it easier to enter the home in a wheel chair.

This week, I helped install a ramp at the home of a veteran in Milford. It's little things like this that we can do everyday, to help our neighbors and thank those who have served for our freedom. 

Council on Aging
￼
Throughout August, a variety of constituent groups joined me in my office in Cincinnati to share their thoughts and ideas with me about legislation in Congress. 

One of these groups was the Council on Aging of Southwestern Ohio, which is a nonprofit organization dedicated to enhancing quality of life for older adults, people with disabilities, their families and caregivers. It was great to sit down with them to hear their thoughts on how our community can better serve the elderly. 
 Cincinnati VA
￼
I spoke at the Cincinnati VA Medical Center on the importance of leadership in the VA as our country continues to work to make sure we are providing our nation's heroes with the best possible care and treatment. I also hosted a Q&A session afterward and answered questions on topics like VA reform and healthcare.

Thoughts on Charlottesville
Last week, neo-Nazis, KKK members, and other white supremacists came together for a rally in Charlottesville at the heart of the University of Virginia’s campus, which led to the death of a 32-year-old counter protestor, Heather Heyer. We must be clear and unequivocal in rejecting and denouncing this hateful ideology. I am extremely saddened by these acts of violence, bigotry and hate that occurred last Saturday – my heart is still grieved. In order to move forward from this act of domestic terrorism, we must shine light on the darkness and talk openly and honestly about this abhorrent ideology. 
As I said last week in response to this tragedy, racially-motivated intimidation and violence have no place in today’s society, and groups fueled by hate must be condemned in the strongest terms. These groups are not representative of American values. 
While we must be unequivocal in condemning these groups, protest groups on the left, such as Antifa - which advocates violence in response to speech it disagrees with, also escalated the conflict unnecessarily. The right to free speech can lead to discourse that must be condemned, but as a free society we must also be committed to addressing it peaceably.  
When America declared its independence, we aspired to create a nation in which “all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” While the path to equality hasn’t always been straight, we can unite around this founding moral principle and become stronger as a country.
As always, feel free to contact my office if I can be of assistance to you or your family.

WHAT OUR TROOPS NEED TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE
￼
Terrorist networks like ISIS and al-Qaeda continue to pose a serious threat to Americans and our allies.
Defeating these terrorist organizations is critical to our national security, but its clear the current strategy in Afghanistan isnt working.
This week, President Trump presented to the American people a path forward to deny terrorists safe haven and achieve long-lasting stability in the region.
I applaud the presidents decision to prioritize conditions on the ground rather than arbitrary timetables.
For the new strategy to be successful, we must ensure the the brave men and women of the military have the tools, training, and resources necessary to confront any threat.
Thats why I am working with my colleagues to ensure our servicemembers have what they need to be successful in their missions.
￼
The House recently passed the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, which provides critical resources to strengthen Americas national defense, secure our borders, and support servicemembers and veterans.
From boosting military funding to starting construction of the border wall, this legislation makes the investments needed to keep our nation safe.
And it supports our men and women in uniform by funding the biggest pay raise in eight years for our troops and providing more resources than ever before to care for our veterans.
￼
We also passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which continues rebuilding our military with investments in maintenance, modernization, and training.
Our troops put their lives on the line each day to keep us safe and free.
I am committed to supporting servicemembers in this vital mission.
As always, it is a privilege to represent 2nd District Hoosiers in Congress.

About Grassley

Grassley Direct
I spoke with Ed Funston of KILR radio in Estherville and Mike Hohenbrink of the Calmar Courier about President Trump’s announcement on Afghanistan, the events in Charlottesville, VA reform, EpiPen-maker Mylan’s settlement with the Department of Justice and international trade negotiations.
Q&A: 99 County Meetings
Q. What’s on the minds of Iowans as you visit each of Iowa’s 99 counties this year?   Q. Why do you prioritize your county meetings?
Quick Links
President Trump signed into law the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act. This bipartisan legislation, of which I was the lead co-sponsor, makes certain types of hearing aids available over the counter to Americans with mild to moderate hearing impairment. Consumers are interested in new hearing aid products to improve their quality of life at an affordable price. The more products available, the more consumers will be able to find something they can afford that works for them.
In May, I asked Energy Secretary Rick Perry a series of questions about a study he directed that appeared geared to undermine wind energy. The report was released, and I appreciate that it treats wind energy fairly. Iowa is the first state in the country to generate more than one-third of its electricity from wind. Wind energy is the source of 7,000 jobs in Iowa and thousands more nationwide. It's here to stay. 
For 37 years, I’ve held an hour-long Q&A with Iowans in every county at least once annually. Throughout August, I’ve been traveling to 30 counties to meet and speak with Iowans. As I often say, representative government is a two-way street. I’m one half of the process, and the people of Iowa are the other half. I appreciate the opportunity to take questions and hear concerns. You can watch a local news segment below on my town meeting in Mount Ayr. 
￼
I pressed for better oversight of a $9.6 billion program meant to help homeowners who suffered during the housing crisis after it came to light that a Nevada state agency engaged in “widespread waste and abuse in spending” and “abused the Hardest Hit Fund."" Congress didn’t intend this program for bureaucrats to live high on the hog, yet the bureaucrats in question did exactly that. They bought barbecue and gift cards for themselves with taxpayer dollars. Every agency that squandered this money needs to pay back every penny to the American taxpayers.

Dear Friends,  
Hurricane Harvey is a serious storm that brings life threatening conditions. Governor Abbott has already declared a state of emergency for 30 counties in advance of the hurricane's landfall. Harvey was just recently updated to a Category 4 Hurricane and will bring strong winds and heavy rains. We are expecting 15 to 25 inches of rain, with some isolated areas receiving 35 inches. Everyone needs to take this storm seriously and heed directions from officials.
I fully support Governor Abbott's request for expedited federal funds in response to this storm. I sent a letter to the President – urging him to quickly grant the Governor's initial request for assistance, as well as any additional requests following the disaster. You can view a copy of my letter here.
I have been in contact with local emergency managers as they carry out their necessary preparations. FEMA is on the ground to provide resources at the direction of local and state officials and both have been in constant contact.
Texas hasn’t seen this type of damaging storm in a long time. This will be a significant hurricane lasting days and will have a severe impact on the infrastructure of Texas. I encourage all to prepare properly. You can visit ready.gov/hurricanes or click on the image below for preparedness tips.

Dear Friend,  This week, I celebrated the ratification of the 19th Amendment and Tennessee’s role in the process as the Perfect 36, introduced a series of sixteen appropriations amendments to prohibit federal spending at Trump-owned hotels and other businesses, spoke to local and national media outlets about my decision to draft and introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump, joined the City of Memphis in welcoming the 2017 class of inductees into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, and met with constituents to discuss important issues such as access to healthcare, the future of SNAP benefits, and transportation and infrastructure. Keep reading to learn more about my week and follow me on Twitter and Facebook to see more updates as they happen.

 Celebrating a Woman’s Right to Vote   ￼  Bas-relief commemorating women’s suffrage by Alan LeQuire, hanging in the Tennessee State Capitol
This Saturday, August 26 is Women’s Equality Day, celebrating the official ratification of the 19th Amendment nationally. It is also the anniversary of Tennessee becoming the Perfect 36—or the pivotal 36th and final state needed to ratify the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution giving women the right to vote—when Tennessee State Representative Harry T. Burn became a hero by casting the single deciding vote in the Tennessee General Assembly in 1920 to ratify the 19th Amendment in the State of Tennessee.  When I served in the Tennessee State Senate, I was proud to sponsor a resolution that created the Women’s Suffrage Commission to celebrate women’s right to vote. I served on the commission along with the number one advocate and hero of women’s suffrage in all the world, Paula Casey. As part of the effort I was able to put together legislation that authorized the funding and placement of a memorial to Tennessee’s role in the passage of the 19th Amendment and the greatest day in the Tennessee General Assembly’s history: a bas-relief sculpture installed in the State Capitol (above) commemorating women’s suffrage. I remain committed to fighting in Congress for issues important to women, from equal pay for equal work to access to women’s healthcare services such as Planned Parenthood.
 Ending Federal Spending at Trump-Owned Hotels and Other Businesses   ￼  Copies of Congressman Cohen’s 16 appropriations amendments prior to Rules Committee filing deadline  On Wednesday I introduced a series of 16 appropriations amendments to prohibit federal spending at Trump-owned hotels, resorts and other Trump-owned businesses. According to press reports President Trump has spent approximately 22 percent of his days in office at a Trump-branded golf course. It has also been reported that the Secret Service has spent $73,000 on golf cart rentals at Trump properties. Furthermore, it has been estimated that the government has spent $100 million-plus dollars on travel for President Trump and his family. This is outrageous.
Congress should not allow the President to use his office to profit himself and his family, and the President’s refusal to divest himself from his privately owned businesses created a conflict of interest when steering federal spending—taxpayer dollars—to his own resorts and other businesses. His refusal to divest also continues to raise serious questions about his compliance with the Constitution’s Foreign Emoluments Clause, a vital protection against the corrupting influence of foreign governments.
The American people should have total confidence that their President is working in their best interest, not with his own financial enrichment in mind. President Trump’s refusal to disclose information to Congress or to seek Congress’s authorization to accept profits from foreign governments stemming from his sprawling foreign financial interests is a flagrant violation of the Constitution and is a danger to our democracy.   Drafting Articles of Impeachment Against President Donald Trump
Last week I announced my intentions to draft and introduce articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. Because of reasons enumerated in my No Confidence Resolution and, subsequently, the President’s comments following the tragic events in Charlottesville, Virginia, I believe that it is morally and ethically incumbent upon me as a United States Representative to make an effort to begin the process of impeaching the President and removing him from office.   Over the past week I have been pleased to join various local and national press outlets to discuss my decision, and have read on as written publications throughout the country have reported on my announcement. The announcement has also “gone viral” on social media platforms. You can watch and read more here:
On August 17 I spoke with MSNBC Live’s Ali Velshi and Stephanie Ruhle   On August 22 I talked with Larry King on PoliticKING   The Tennessean reported on my announcement
NowThis Politics shared my announcement in a video on social media, it currently has over 12 million views on Facebook
NewsWeek discussed my plans for impeachment in an article titled “Black Caucus Could Move to Impeach Trump Over His ‘Fitness’ To Serve As President”    Honoring 2017 Memphis Music Hall of Fame Inductees

This week the Memphis Music Hall of Fame announced inductees to their seven-member class of 2017, which included Roy Orbison, Maurice White, Cowboy Jack Clement, Frank Stokes, Cassietta George, the Memphis Horns, and my good friend Irvin Salky (above).  Irvin helped to promote and manage the careers of Memphis music luminaries such as Furry Lewis (above), Phineas Newborn (above) and Memphis Slim, among others. Through his work he crossed paths with iconic musicians and bands like the Rolling Stones (above).  Irvin was a great friend of mine for over 45 years. He passed on in May of this year, and had one of the largest funerals in the history of the Baron Hirsch Cemetery. Irvin embodied law, civil rights, music, jazz, sports, cool hats, sartorial style, classic aged cars and Midtown. He was a U.S. Navy veteran, a Vanderbilt Law School graduate and a Memphis State graduate. Irvin is among great company in the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, and they are fortunate to have him among their ranks.     Working for Memphis
￼￼￼   This week I joined the Kiwanis Club of Memphis, SisterReach of Memphis, and the Memphis Urban League at separate events to discuss issues of importance to Memphis including housing and infrastructure investments, access to health services, the future of SNAP benefits and more. 
I am always grateful for opportunities to join these outstanding groups who are active in making Memphis a better place to live.   Sign Up for My New Grants E-Newsletter

“The political lesson of Watergate is this: Never again must America allow an arrogant, elite guard of political adolescents…to bypass the regular party organization and dictate the terms of a national election.”                -- President Gerald R. Ford as quoted in The New York Times, 1974   Weekly Health Tip
Each week, I share a health tip in the hopes of promoting a healthy lifestyle for residents of the Ninth Congressional District. As always, it is best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine or lifestyle.
Taking one last vacation this summer? Here is what the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends you know before, during, and after you go: 
Before Your Trip: 
	•	If you are trying to get pregnant, do not travel to areas with risk of Zika. For information on domestic travel, see CDC’s guidance.
	•	If you or your partner are trying to get pregnant, consider avoiding nonessential travel to areas with a CDC Zika travel notice. Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider about your travel plans.  
During Your Trip: 
	•	Protect yourself from mosquito bites, strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites to protect yourself and your family. 
	•	Keep mosquitos outside: stay in places with air conditioning and with window/door screens; use a bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors
	•	Protect  yourself during (or do not have) sex to prevent getting or spreading Zika
After Your  Trip: 
	•	Protect yourself from mosquito bites after your trip by following these preventative steps
	•	Protect  yourself during (or do not have) sex to prevent getting or spreading Zika
	•	See a doctor or healthcare professional if you have symptoms of Zika after travel, if you are pregnant after travelling to an area with a risk of Zika, or if you’re thinking about trying to become pregnant after travel to an area with a risk of Zika.    
As always, I remain. Most sincerely,  ￼￼   Steve Cohen Member of Congress

Dear Friend,
This week we lost yet another member of our law enforcement community – Sgt. Michael Pershall – an off-duty Modesto police officer who was struck and killed by a drunk driver. Sgt. Pershall was a nine-year veteran, canine handler and beloved member of the force. Sonia and I are praying for Sgt. Pershall’s family, friends and colleagues as they go through this difficult time. For tributes and updates on his memorial, follow the Modesto Police Officers Association Facebook page.
Supporting DACA Supports Our Economy On Tuesday I joined colleagues in asking President Trump to support Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) following reports that he may choose to end the program. While I believe that we need to strengthen our border security and deport violent criminals who prey on our communities, I also believe that young adults brought to America as children through no fault of their own should be provided an opportunity to earn citizenship in the country they love. Many of these individuals may not even speak the language for their country of origin; they have been educated alongside our own children and may be pursuing college degrees, working in our local businesses, or maybe they wish to serve their country in the military. According to the CATO Institute, these individuals would contribute $60 billion in tax revenue to the American economy over the next decade; instead of focusing our resources on deporting young adults who want to build a better future for themselves and America, we should be pressing for immigration reform that will bring them out of the shadows and allow them to fully participate in our society and economy.

Take My Mid-Year Survey  As you know, I like to regularly poll constituents to make sure I’m addressing the issues most important to you in Washington, and this week I launched my most recent survey to do just that. Please take a few moments to let me know how you feel across a variety of issues (if something isn’t listed, fill in the form at the bottom of the survey), and please feel free to share it with your friends and neighbors. Thank you in advance! CLICK HERE TO TAKE THE SURVEY
Mosquito Safety With the extra rain we experienced this year, our area has seen an increase mosquito breeding pools and populations, and for the first time in roughly 40 years, Stanislaus County has reported cases of mosquitoes infected with St. Louis encephalitis. Similar to West Nile virus, this virus can cause inflammation of the brain. While most people who are infected with the virus have no symptoms or only mild non-specific flu-like illness, some people can be far more seriously affected. I urge you to exercise caution when enjoying our beautiful outdoors as the summer comes to a close. For more information, such as how to contact your local mosquito abatement district, visit http://westnile.ca.gov/.

Dear Friend,                                       
As Hurricane Harvey approaches, I want to share information that will help keep you and your family safe during the storm. 
	•	Monitor NOAA Weather Radio and the local news for updates and directions provided by local officials.
	•	Visit Ready.gov or Listo.gov to learn preparedness and safety tips, including what to be sure you have in your disaster supplies kit.
	•	Stay inside and away from windows.
	•	If you are outside and encounter floodwaters, remember – turn around, don’t drown.
	•	Follow FEMA online at Twitter.com/FEMA and Facebook.com/FEMA for emergency updates.
	•	Download the FEMA app to locate and get directions to open shelters across the state and receive weather alerts from the National Weather Service.
Again, during this severe weather, the safest place for you and your loved ones to be is inside, away from windows. As much as possible, monitor the local news and weather to remain informed of any developments and available assistance here in San Antonio. 
I hope that everyone in our city and across Texas in the storm’s path stays safe over the next few days.  
Sincerely, ￼  Member of Congress

Dear Friend, 

This week, we joined Senator John McCain and Congressmen Tom O’Halleran, Andy Biggs, Ruben Gallego, and Trent Franks to listen and learn from cybersecurity experts at Arizona State University’s Congressional Conference on Cybersecurity.
As part of our Kyrsten Means Business initiative, we have toured and visited dozens of Arizona businesses of all sizes and across industries. We’ve had the opportunity to learn about their companies and listen to their concerns. Too many Arizona businesses don’t fully understand cybersecurity and aren’t prepared to respond. Here’s the truth: cybersecurity affects every business, large or small. Going forward, we should assume that every business, whether a family farm or a local bakery, will have some sort of online or digital presence. 

Institutions like Arizona State University hear the concerns of these businesses and are preparing a long-term response by expanding the number of cyber-proficient graduates to enhance Arizona’s workforce. The demand is there for cyber Monday skills. Larger businesses need to hire specialists to ensure their businesses are resilient and responsive to emerging cyber threats. Small businesses need employees that possess the technological savvy to take basic precautions and follow best practices. 

How we choose to educate our workforce is essential to advancing our cybersecurity goals. Congress can do its part by supporting programs like Pell Grants and Perkins Loans that help Arizonans afford college, while also protecting federal research funding, which empowers Arizona universities to maintain our competitive edge. I’m committed to working across the aisle to identify and advance bipartisan solutions that help businesses and our workforce be resilient and responsive to emerging cyber threats.
We are honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Arizona families like yours. We always appreciate hearing from you on current topics and issues that are important to you. If there is an issue that concerns you, please let us know by clicking this link or by calling our Phoenix office: 602-956-2285. Be sure to stay connected through our Facebook and Twitter accounts, and let us know how we can be of service.

Sincerely,
     ￼
 
Kyrsten

CALLING ALL INTERNS!
My office is now accepting applications for interns in my Washington, D.C. office, as well as my district offices in Rogers, Fort Smith, and Harrison, for the following session:
Fall 2017 September  December* *Dates are flexible.
A congressional internship is a rewarding experience, and both Washington, D.C. and district office interns will work closely with my staff and constituents while learning the inner workings of the United States Congress and about issues affecting Arkansans. College students and recent graduates interested in political science, government, public policy, business, and social work are encouraged to apply.
Internship requirements and application materials are available on my website.
For more information, please call my office at (202) 225-4301.

WEEK IN REVIEW
￼
To start off this week's From the Front... I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nations capital, particularly the Vanderpol family from Fort Smith. Safe travels back to the Natural State.
 
￼
I had a very productive week traveling throughout Northwest Arkansas. On Monday, I started my day in Berryville with a tour of Ducommun. Ducommun is a global provider of value-added innovative electronic and structural solutions for complex applications in aerospace, defense, and industrial markets. It was great to tour the facility and visit with the employees at their company picnic. That afternoon, I took the ferry to Peel for Coffee with the Congressman. It is important for me to travel to all areas of my district  including the counties that are difficult to reach. These smaller, more-intimate gatherings allow for purposeful engagement with constituents. I would like to thank everyone who came out to Coffee with the Congressman to partake in the meaningful dialogue. 
 
￼
On Wednesday morning, I started my day meeting with the Fort Smith Regional Council. We discussed a wide range of topics, all geared toward bettering the community. That afternoon, I toured the expansion of the Childrens Emergency Center in Fort Smith. The expansion includes the Residential Life Skills Training Program and the Independent Living Program. Did you know that 1 in 5 young adults who age out of foster care will become homeless? Only 3% of former foster youth will earn a college degree, and only half of those 
￼
who age out will be employed at age 23. The Residential Life Skills Training Program will provide help and shelter to those in need. The Childrens Emergency Center is and will continue to do great things for Fort Smith and the State of Arkansas. Later that day, I met with the Arkansas Intermodal Authority in Fort Smith. We discussed the status of an inland port and intermodal project on the Arkansas River at the Port of Van Buren. I was thrilled to learn how well the project is progressing. 
 
This has been a wonderful week meeting with many constituents throughout the Natural State. 
 
Remember to keep an eye on my Twitter page, my calendar, and my Instagram to find out where my staff and I will be throughout the remainder of the August work period!

POLICY IN REVIEW: HEALTHCARE 
In late July, the United States Senate failed in delivering a healthcare bill that would rid the country of the failing Obamacare mandates. Now, entering the final week of the August recess, we remain in a position of stagnation without any true results. With stalled appropriations bills, a delayed budget, and other looming priorities for Congress, healthcare remains an important hurdle that must be addressed. 
With no room left for any to argue that that Obamacare is failing, it is imperative that we remain committed to fixing the nations healthcare market. A recent report released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has projected that approximately 1,478 counties, over 45 percent of the nation, could only have a single option for insurance in 2018. This, combined with the continuous rise in premiums and additional out-of-pocket costs is exactly why we must not cease to push for a repeal of this burdensome and federally-invasive law. I stand by Secretary Tom Price at the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS Administrator Seema Verma in supporting their efforts toward getting our country out of this unfortunate mess and giving all Americans a healthcare system they deserve.  
Although the Congress has yet to pass the comprehensive legislation on healthcare that we need, I, along with many of my colleagues, have continued in our complimentary initiatives to chip away at the American Healthcare Act (ACA) by supporting legislation to dismantle some of the most burdensome aspects of the law. Two items that I am particularly proud of supporting are the elimination of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) and the repeal of the Health Insurance Tax (HIT). IPAB is a fifteen-member board of unelected officials created by the ACA to help reduce Medicare costs. There is absolutely no reason why unelected officials should be in a position to make these types of decisions, which is why I fully support the boards elimination. Eliminating the HIT is also an important priority. In effect, the HIT would serve as a direct tax on health insurers for the services they provide to individuals, families, and other beneficiaries. The Congressional Budget Office projects that this hike in taxes would trickle down into higher premiums and an increase in out-of-pocket costs, something we must do all we can to prevent. 
While some members of the upper chamber have stated that healthcare is in the rear view mirror as they instead begin to make focus on tax reform, others remain committed to a solution. The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee has recently announced they will be having a series of hearings in early September focused on ways to stabilize the previously-noted collapsing Obamacare insurance markets, to lower premiums, and to bring more insurers back to a market that should give Americans real choice. I bid them good fortune on their venture and I stand ready and willing to succeed on this push once again in the House pending their success.

The Hill Report  A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions Week of August 21 – 25, 2017
It was another busy week in the 32nd Congressional District of Texas. I had the opportunity to meet with organizations who make our community a better place,  learn more about the efforts of veterans organizations in our community, talk with healthcare professionals, discuss tax reform with North Texas job creators, and more.  I always enjoy spending time with my constituents and talking with them to learn how I can help create more opportunities for North Texas families. 
Meetings Across North Texas  Uptown Rotary  I had a wonderful time joining the Rotary Club of Dallas-Uptown at their weekly lunch meeting. I was delighted to be their guest speaker and share my experiences about my time in Congress. I wanted the members of the club and their guests to know that I am committed to the families in my district and supporting programs that develop and educate our young children and students. The Today Foundation’s Texas Leadership Forum program fosters civic involvement, leadership and character building in high school students, and prepares them for college and after. I am proud to be the Honorary Chairman and host these students for a week in Washington D.C. each year. Also, through my commitment to the National Institutes of Health, I was delighted to share an excitement with members in the Uptown Rotary Club about our country’s medical research discoveries and advancements in health. I hope to continue to be involved with this unique club in Uptown.

Jewish Family Services  For over 65 years, Jewish Family Service of Greater Dallas has been a blessing to our North Texas community, by providing professional, effective and affordable mental health and social services to over 10,000 Texans a year, without regard to their race, religion, or ability to pay. From distributing low or no-cost food to offering career skill training to providing mental health services, Jewish Family Service is an example of the effectiveness of the public-private partnership model in tackling the tough problems facing our society, and its success serves as a testament to the charitable and giving spirit of North Texas.
￼  Members of the Jewish Family Services team meeting with Congressman Sessions
Meadows Foundation  The Meadows Foundation on Tuesday graciously hosted lunch for me and many others from the philanthropic community, including the Communities Foundation of Texas, the Dallas Foundation, Lydia Hill Holdings, the Rees-Jones Foundation, and the King Foundation. Through public-private partnerships, Texas, and specifically the Dallas population and economy, has grown and advanced dramatically in the past year. In order to continue this prosperity, we must have conversations like we did on Tuesday about supporting fellow Texans, helping our neighbors, and eventually, self-sustainment to avoid overbearing government programs and regulations. I look forward to contributing to the success of these institutions and their commitment to a thriving Dallas.
BAPS On Sunday evening, I was honored to have been asked by BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir to help welcome the present guru and president of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, Mahant Swami Maharaj, in his first trip to the United States. It was humbling to spend time in direct conversation with His Holiness, and I will forever remember discussing the healing power of faith and the importance of ensuring our actions everyday are inspired and guided by our individual spirituality. I want to sincerely thank my friends in the Indian-American community for allowing me to be a part of such an incredible occasion.

Working with Our Veterans  Veterans Coalition of North Texas Our veterans across the nation deserve our utmost respect and the best services. This is why on Tuesday, I met with the President of the Veterans Coalition of North Central Texas. This coalition is committed to providing comprehensive care and networks for veterans needing a variety of types of help, advice, or sense of community. Focusing on initiatives such as mental health, faith based ministries, and employment/career development counseling, they are committed to working with veterans’ families to begin these conversations. I am committed to working with VCNCT to connect veterans with the resources they may need because those who sacrificed so much for our country deserve the best.
￼  Congressman Sessions with the President of the Veterans Coalition of North Central Texas
Meeting with Healthcare Professionals
Pediplace and Healing Hands  Thursday afternoon I was delighted to spend time with two local Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers serving the people of the 32nd District and North Texas.  PediPlace is a non-profit pediatric healthcare practice for children who are uninsured or who qualify for Medicaid or CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program) benefits. PediPlace is designated by the State of Texas as a site serving a medically underserved population, and provides a medical home for children that tend to be from low income families who otherwise would go without care or who would unnecessarily use the emergency room. Healing Hands Ministries is the medical and dental home for 6,600 uninsured Dallas County residents, and has become a network of donors, faith-based partners, medical communities and volunteers that helps connect patients to a medical home that generates quality care for the body as a whole. These institutions provide much needed care to some of the most vulnerable members of our society, and do so in an efficient manner, saving countless trips to the emergency room. I applaud the men and women who give so freely of their time, energy and financial resources to help better our community here in North Texas.

Texas Oncology  On Monday I had the privilege of meeting with Texas Oncology. These physicians have successfully created a network vital to ensuring quality care for our community. Through Texas Oncology, cancer patients share a common bond and a sense of belonging and comradery. We had a positive discussion on the impact of the discrepancies in reimbursements in the health care system, along with topics including access to affordable health care and pain management. We started this conversation with Texas Oncology in the past, and I look forward to continuing this conversation in the future.
￼  Congressman Sessions with physicians from Texas Oncology

Discussing Tax Reform with Job Creators  Texas Association of Business  For almost a century, Texas Association of Business has been a leading advocate for all Texas businesses, both in Austin and in Washington, D.C. Guided by their mission statement, “To make the Texas business climate the best in the world”, my friends in TAB have worked tirelessly to ensure our elected officials are well versed in the issues encountered every day by Texas businesses, and advocated for policies more conducive to growing the Texas economy. I was delighted to get to spend time with representatives from the wide range of industries represented by TAB and have a conversation with them about how the Republican House of Representatives is working to pass pro-business legislation and roll back the disastrous federal regulatory overreaches implemented by the previous administration.
NAIFA  I was delighted to speak at the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors Dallas Chapter lunch. I am proud our Dallas chapter is the largest financial services association in the country, working to protect our financial security and livelihood. These experts are among the brightest in the field, and I am dedicated to continuing working with them to make tax reform a reality and improve our financial system as a whole. Through conversations between members of the association and myself, we can maintain fiscal responsibility and create opportunity for individuals in Dallas, Texas.

8/25/17 17:45,31 Reasons for Tax Reform,"News from Representative Tom Emmer
￼
Dear Friend,
August is flying by, and I am using this valuable time spent in Minnesota to my full advantage! This week I had the pleasure of catching up with Minnesotans at a “Coffee with Your Congressman” event hosted by the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits, where I answered questions about the work we are doing in Washington DC…
￼
And, I had the chance to visit and tour Caribou Technologies to learn about this incredible Minnesotan company that started out in a garage and quickly evolved into a massive success. The perfect example of the American Dream!
￼
￼
Some of my favorite events this week were speaking events about some very important issues that affect our state and nation…
31 reasons for Tax Reform
Americans for Prosperity hosted an event where we discussed the need for tax reform to fix our nation’s broken tax code. American families and businesses are struggling because of this nation’s confusing and outdated tax system. My Republican colleagues and I know that we cannot tax our way into prosperity while forcing hardworking taxpayers to foot the bill.
￼
That’s why House Republicans have been pushing for massive tax reform, which will restructure our tax code so that American families can keep more of their hard-earned money, American businesses have the chance to grow and expand, and our economy can return to the superpower it once was. 
To learn more about our broken tax code, and how we propose to fix it, be sure to follow me on twitter: @RepTomEmmer. It has been 31 years since our last major tax overhall and there are 31 days in August, so the House Committee on Ways and Means has prepared 31 reasons why tax reform is critical - many of which I have tweeted out! Be sure to go take a look!
￼
￼
Guarding Our Open Skies
I also spoke at a Delta Employee Rally where I highlighted the importance of enforcing our Open Skies Agreements. Over the past 25 years, the United States has entered into more than 100 Open Skies Agreements in efforts to encourage fair trade, expand international relations, and improve ease of diplomatic and military travel. Unfortunately, not everyone has been playing fair.
While violations to these agreements hurt the United States as a whole, states like Minnesota who are home to international hubs, like the Minneapolis/St. Paul Airport where we are right now, get hit extra hard. Violations of these agreements can impact thousands of jobs in our great state of Minnesota – in fact, for every route lost due to subsidized carrier expansion, nearly 1,500 American jobs are lost.
￼
This is why I will continue to support the Open Skies Agreements, because one of my top priorities will always be protecting our economy and the Minnesotan worker!
Having Difficulty with a Federal Agency?
The main role of a Congressman is service – more specifically, constituent service. My office offers a variety of constituent services and among our excellent staff, we have a number of individuals who specialize in casework. If you have been unable to get an answer from a federal agency in a timely manner or feel like you have been treated unfairly, my office caseworkers may be able to resolve the problem or get you the information that you need.
To make these services more accessible, my district staff will be holding mobile office hours on September 6, 2017 at the Anoka City Hall from 9:00-11:00 AM. While I will not be at this event, my staff will be able to help you! To fill out a form to get the process started, click here.
￼
Are You Looking for an Internship this Fall?
If so, look no further! My office is currently accepting applications for interns for the fall semester. Our internships offer students a firsthand look into the inner workings of our nation’s Capital and the legislative branch. If you are interested – don’t wait – apply here today!
￼
Once again, thanks for staying up to date with the work I am doing for Minnesota’s Sixth District. Until next week…
Sincerely,  ￼

Dear  , 
During the August district work period, I have the opportunity to spend several weeks crisscrossing the district to meet with local residents and business leaders. It is a great chance to speak with these people about the great work they are doing in the local communities and what they would like to see Congress prioritize in Washington. I thought you might enjoy a quick look at some of my work across eastern Connecticut during this past week!
￼
At the ribbon cutting for the Community Speaks Out HQ in Groton
On Saturday morning, I joined the unveiling of the brand new HQ for Community Speaks Out in Groton. CSO provides full service support for families with a loved one struggling with addiction, including financial assistance for treatment, community support for families, and addiction education and prevention. The organization was founded by local residents who have been impacted by addiction and loss, including my good friends State Rep. Joe DeLaCruz and his amazing wife Tammy. With the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic continuing to rage all around - we need an all hands on deck effort to address this crisis at every level – community-driven places like CSO are so important.
￼
Announcing the Medicare Buy-In plan with Rep. John Larson from Hartford
When Sunday morning came around, I was very pleased to learn that The Day editorial board wrote in support of my brand new bill called the Medicare Buy-In and Health Stabilization Act. They agreed that the bill would reduce costs and bring down the price of health insurance for older Americans. The purpose of the bill is to allow Americans age 50-64 to purchase affordable health plans offered through the Medicare program. Medicare is a popular and cost-effective program that works, and expanding access will save money for Americans approaching retirement without adding to the deficit. I am ready to work with my colleagues from both parties to improve the healthcare system for all Americans. The Medicare Buy-In plan is a great place to start.
￼
With a young constituent after a town hall meeting in Enfield
On Monday evening, I held a town hall meeting in Enfield for area constituents. Around 50 people turned out to discuss important topics such as healthcare, crumbling foundations, and education. I would like to thank Mayor Scott Kaupin of Enfield and Suffield First Selectwoman Melissa Mack for joining us. Thanks to everyone who came out!
￼
Watch WTNH's story on a medal ceremony for WWII veterans in New London
I headed down to City Hall in New London on Tuesday morning to join Mayor Mike Passero in presenting military medals to the families of two deceased World War II veterans. These families contacted my office for help obtaining these long overdue awards for the brave family members who served our nation honorably more than 70 years ago. I was honored to present the families of Private First Class John A. Chambers and Boatswain’s Mate Second Class Albert C. Johnson with the decorations they have long deserved.
￼
With Carla Bartolucci, an SBA Small Business Person of the Year and the Jovial Foods employees
It was great to visit Carla Bartolucci, President and CEO of Euro-USA Trading/Jovial Foods who was named as U.S. SBA 2017 Connecticut Small Business Person of the Year, the Small Business Administration’s top award!
￼
With the Connecticut Pharmacist Association in Waterford for a Narcan demonstration
After that, we headed to Waterford where the Connecticut Pharmacist Association was waiting to provide me with a demonstration the lifesaving drug NARCAN. NARCAN is used by first responders to quickly revise the effects of severe prescription opioid or heroin overdose. As the nationwide opioid crisis continues, NARCAN has already saved countless lives in the short time it has been available for use. Sadly, 917 people in Connecticut died of opioid overdoses last year, a 25% increase over 2015 – making the distribution of NARCAN critical for our local communities.

Had a great meeting with local seniors at the Madison Senior Center on Wednesday afternoon. After lunch, we discussed the future of Social Security and Medicare along with other topics from my work across eastern Connecticut and Washington.

Visiting Lavender Pond Farm in Killingworth to see their new Smartflower solar power system
After visiting the seniors, I headed up to Killingworth where I was toured several local farms with First Selectwoman Cathy Iino. We had the opportunity to tour Lavender Pond Farm, Chatfield Hollow Farm Inn, and Killingworth Cranberries. Thank you to the owners for opening your doors and showing off what your farms have to offer.
￼
At the Clinton Food Pantry with the National Diaper Bank
To wrap up Wednesday, I participated in the Clinton Food Pantry Night with National Diaper Bank Network. During the visit, I toured the facility to learn more about how they assemble packages for local families in need.  The Clinton Food Pantry does incredible work as well as the National Diaper Bank Network supporting families with diapers for infants across the country.

Leading a roundtable on manufacturing job training in Bozrah
My final major event of the week was a roundtable discussion in Bozrah with stakeholders in our local workforce-training program known as the “manufacturing pipeline.” According to a Connecticut Bureau of Labor Statistics report released yesterday, the Norwich-New London area is the fastest-growing labor market in the state and added 1,200 jobs just last month. This confirms that the hard work to bring jobs to the region is paying off. It validates the impact of the increased workload at Electric Boat, which in turn creates jobs at the hundreds of Connecticut-based parts suppliers on the EB supply chain.
We are also making sure these local jobs are being filled by local residents by collaborating with area community colleges, the Eastern Connecticut Workforce Investment Board, and the US Department of Labor to create a manufacturing pipeline job-training program. The pipeline has been an unprecedented success, placing 94% of graduates with jobs at local manufacturers. This is great news- our region is on the right track.
As always, if you have any questions or concerns about the items I have mentioned in the newsletter, or if you need any assistance in working with a federal agency like Social Security, Medicare, or Veterans Affairs, please do not hesitate to contact my Norwich district office at 860-886-0139.
Have a great weekend,

8/25/17 17:31,Staten Island Will Take Columbus Statue If City Removes It,"￼
WEBSITE           ABOUT           CONTACT           ISSUES           MEDIA CENTER           SERVICES           
Dear Friend,
 
With protests and calls to remove the Christopher Columbus statue in Manhattan's Columbus Circle, I have made it clear that Staten Island will gladly accept the monument -- which represents the rich Italian American heritage in New York and the United States -- if the City makes the unreasonable decision to remove it.
 
Learn more below: 
Donovan to City: Staten Island Will Take Columbus Statue If You Don't Want It
Amid calls to remove the Christopher Columbus statue in Manhattan's Columbus Circle, Congressman Dan Donovan (NY-11) today asked Mayor de Blasio to resolve the matter by donating the statue to the National Parks Service, which controls Great Kills Park on Staten Island.
Donovan said, ""Christopher Columbus is a permanent fixture of our national history. Rarely can we trace the wheels of progress over 500 years back to the actions of a single person. If a radical group bent on sanitizing history doesn't want the statue at Columbus Circle anymore, Staten Island will gladly accept it.""
Donovan represents Staten Island and South Brooklyn in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Approximately one-third of Staten Island residents are of Italian descent, among the largest concentrations in the country, and South Brooklyn also has a high density of Italian-Americans.
Donovan continued, ""Columbus is a symbol of Italian-American culture. He discovered our land, and generations of Italian-Americans helped build New York. I will fight tooth and nail to see to it that his statue remains a fixture in our city.""
Donovan and his office spoke with senior Department of Interior officials on Thursday afternoon about the matter.
New York Post: Congressman wants Columbus Statues for federal park if city takes them down
Staten Island Advance: Move Columbus statue to Staten Island if city removes it, Donovan says
Press Release: Donovan to City: Staten Island Will Take Columbus Statue If You Don't Want It

￼ Daniel M. Donovan, Jr. Member of Congress 11th District of New York

It's a true honor and privilege to serve you in Congress, and I'll continue to work to pass policy solutions to our nation's greatest problems. Please don't hesitate to contact my office at any time with questions, concerns, or problems with an agency.

8/25/17 17:18,You'll never believe what a Republican colleague said about me,"￼
""If you want to pick somebody to work in a bipartisan manner and get something done... you ask Claire McCaskill because she does get the job done.""— Republican Senator Pat Roberts (Agriculture Committee Chair)
Friend, that's what my friend and colleague, Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, said about me last week as we hosted the Missouri National Guard, regional experts, and federal leaders, for a bipartisan roundtable on threats to America's farms and food supply. I was honored by his words and his leadership.
￼ 
In what is arguably one of the most partisan, gridlocked Congresses we've seen in a long time, we were able to work together to pass into law a bill that will help protect the vibrant agriculture industry that exists in Missouri and Kansas.
It's proof that bipartisanship still exists, and good work can still get done in Congress. People just have to be willing to come together and make it happen.

That's what I've always done and that's what I'll continue to do, no matter what.
Thank you again,

Lake of the Woods
 
Dear Friends,
 
This week I joined U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the Northwest Angle to distribute border identification check technology for a new pilot program. This project is an instructive example of what can be accomplished when government listens to local communities. I also joined Douglas and McLeod County 4-H auctions this week, where I took home the ribbons for several top-quality animals. Finally, I made visits to 3M and toured a remodeled nursing home, both in Hutchinson.
 
Sincerely,
￼
 Congressman Collin C. Peterson
Minnesota 7th District
 
New Pilot Program at the Lake of the Woods
￼
Michelle James, Director of Field Operations at the Seattle Office; speaking at the Angle Inlet
 
On Monday, I joined U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to distribute new border identification check technology to local resort owners to officially begin the first phase of a new Lake of the Woods pilot program. CBP could have selected several other remote areas for this pilot program, and I fought hard for the Lake of the Woods region to be selected as a testing ground for the new technology. 
 
This technology will make it easier and safer for anglers and visitors who come to Lake of the Woods for its world-class fishing and other outdoor activities. Instead of boating or snowmobiling back to one of the three remaining Outlying Area Reporting Stations (OARS), which is often dangerous during the winter months, travelers can now check in at their resort after visiting Canada to report their arrival back into the United Sates via CBP as required by law.
 
On Monday, there was a joint press conference with CBP and local resort owners to commemorate the start of the pilot program which was followed by fishing and a fish fry at Flag Island. This is an excellent example of what government should be doing, which is working together with locals to solve problems. 
 
Douglas County Fair
￼
 
Last weekend I attended the Douglas County Fair, where I connected with several groups including part of the Presidential Turkey Flock and the Science of Ag Team, who I joined for a televised segment on KOOL-TV. I was also honored to be able to kick off the 4-H Livestock Auction. The Grand Champion Rabbit – Single Fryer was raised by Kodi Bundermann who is part of the Lake Mary Troopers 4-H club.
 
McLeod County 4-H
￼
 
I also participated in the McLeod County 4-H auction recently and left with two ribbons from the McLeod County 4-H Riders Club, won by Kianna Dolezal and Dayne Morton. As a former 4Her myself, I’m always proud to support an organization that does such a great job with youth development. 
 
3M Hutchinson
￼
3M Hutchinson Tape Plant; Lisa Propps Hutchinson (3M plant manager) and Mike Mueler (Stationary Products division manager)
 
Last Friday, I met with 3M in Hutchinson to tour their facilities. The Hutchinson plant is their largest physical plant in North America, comprising nearly 1.5 million square feet (about 33 acres) under roof. 3M ships over 20,000 semi-trailer loads of products each year. I’m proud to help support our home-grown companies that keep our local economies strong. 
 
Minnesota Housing Development’s Housing Institute
￼
 
This week I was able to speak at the Minnesota Housing Partnership (MHP)'s Housing Institute, a training event for rural communities. These events take place throughout the district with the goal of adding housing to our local communities. The MHP is a non-profit organization that receives federal money through the USDA’s Rural Communities Development Initiative (RCDI), as well as the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The RCDI supports new housing in rural communities by providing local leaders with technical assistance and training. I will continue to support efforts that bring affordable and stable housing across the district.
 
Rehab-Authority
￼
 
I visited the Rehab-Authority in Thief River Falls this week. Kim Rosendahl, the Rehab Director and owner, explained how people suffer from bodily disabilities, and if given the right therapy, can go back to work and live fulfilling lives. Kim demonstrated how shoulder injuries can be identified and repaired. In the Thief River Falls clinic, they have several physical therapists helping clients. 
 
University of Minnesota
￼
 
On Thursday I met with University of Minnesota Extension staff to learn about their current work in nutrition, leadership, education and research. Their continuous work in the area of bio-security, specifically avian influenza, has provided valuable research and education. From early detection testing to new best practices, Extension has been on the front lines with producers working to reduce the impacts of future outbreaks. I look forward to their continued work and innovation in this area.
 
Harmony River Place
￼
 
Last week, I toured the Harmony River Place in Hutchinson, a new state-of-the-art nursing home with separate houses for nursing homes, transitional care, and a memory care facility. The facilities include separate living and activity areas, family sitting areas, and kitchen and dining areas with 18 private rooms. I’m proud to say I was able to help Harmony River receive an $18 million low-interest loan to create a space where we can help protect senior citizens in our communities.

Local Veteran takes Honor Flight
￼

At 91, Elvin “Speed” Homan took the trip of a lifetime. Homan, who lives at Harmony River Living Center in Hutchinson, joined 24 fellow World War II and Korean War veterans on April 21 for the St. Cloud Honor Flight. The trip was hosted by VFW Post 428 in St. Cloud, which is a member of the Honor Flight Network, a nonprofit organization that provides all-expense-paid trips for veterans to Washington, D.C. Since the nationwide program began in 2005, hundreds of flights have ferried thousands of veterans to see the war memorials in the nation’s capital. You can read more about his Homan’s story at the Hutchinson Leader.

This Week in American History
￼
 
On this day in 1937, Congress established Minnesota’s first national monument: the Pipestone National Monument in Pipestone County. Catlinite, otherwise known as pipestone, has been used to make ceremonial pipes by many native communities including the Dakota and Lakota people, and to this day tribal communities are still able to access this sacred stone at the national monument.

Carper's Connection
August 25, 2017
Dear Friends,
￼
On Tuesday, I joined with Senator Coons and Congresswoman Blunt Rochester to host the first of two veterans job fairs this year. We had 40 employers come out to Wilmington University’s Dover Campus looking to hire Delaware’s veterans. Our obligation to our veterans is life-long and that’s why our entire Congressional delegation is committed to our tradition of hosting job fairs specifically for our vets looking for career opportunities. Our second job fair for veterans will be on September 15 at the Middletown Fire Hall. Be sure to spread the word to family and friends.
On Thursday, I traveled to Bridgeville to announce federal funding for a new wastewater initiative that will help small, rural communities in Delaware. Without this funding, people in Bridgeville may not have access to central sewer services. Clean Water Solutions (CWS), Delaware’s first non-profit wastewater utility, will have the ability to own, operate and maintain a rural community’s wastewater system when necessary. I’m proud that Delaware is leading the way with this innovative solution that I think could serve as a model to solve similar problems in small, rural communities across the country.
￼
This morning, I was at Beaver Valley in our First State National Historical Park. Beaver Valley consists of 1,100 acres of rolling hills and wooded areas along the Brandywine River. This land was first deeded to William Penn and reflects early Quaker settlement patterns and Native American migration. Serving as a privately-owned park for the past 100 years, the property was donated to the National Park Service in 2013 so that future generations of Delawareans can visit and explore this beautiful piece of history.
And earlier this afternoon, I was in Smyrna at the homecoming ceremony for the 261st Theater Tactical Signal Brigade of the Delaware Army National Guard. The 261st Forward team is returning from Operation Inherent Resolve where they assisted in maintaining and defending the communications network within Central Command's Area of Responsibility. It’s always a joy to see Delaware’s Guardsmen return home safely, thank them for their service and see the incredible reunion with their families.
￼
I’d love to hear from all of you about your travels around the First State this week and throughout the summer! Connect with me on Twitter @SenatorCarper and Facebook at facebook.com/tomcarper.

Unity in the Face of Hatred


￼

No Hate in Our Hearts   From the start, I have had grave concerns about the public safety hazard the National Park Service would create by permitting a white supremacist rally in the middle of a park for families and children.  I had hoped that the NPS would take a serious look at its capacity to protect the public at Crissy Field.  Instead, the NPS is strangely using public safety as the reason for granting the permit, while placing an inordinate burden on the City’s resources for safety.   For a long time, our city has been a beacon of peace, openness and love for many people, some of whom faced discrimination elsewhere.  Those experiences are written into the soul of our community and inform our reverence for peaceful dissent and free speech.  However, free speech does not grant the right to yell fire in a crowded theater, incite violence or endanger the public in any venue.  As we ponder where and by whom the ill-conceived decision to approve this permit in a national park was made, we must all pray it does not become an invitation to incite violence.   This weekend, let us honor the values of love that make our city and our community so extraordinary.  Let us embrace the spirit of our namesake, St. Francis, and the Song of St. Francis that is our city’s anthem. 
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace: Where there is hatred, let me sow love; Where there is injury, pardon; Where there is doubt, faith; Where there is despair, hope; Where there is darkness, light; Where there is sadness, joy.   O divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console, to be understood as to understand, to be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive, it is in pardoning that we are pardoned, and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.
￼
In celebration of Women's Equality Day, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi and other female leaders held a press conference Tuesday to launch their economic agenda that promises better jobs, wages and future for women in San Francisco.
No to the Immoral, Ineffective, Expensive Wall
This week, President Trump yet again threatened to shut down the government cause chaos in the lives of millions of Americans if he doesn’t get his border wall.  Make no mistake: the President said he will deliberately hurt American communities to force American taxpayers to fund an immoral, ineffective and expensive border wall.    The last time Republicans shut down the government, their callous recklessness cost the American economy $24 billion and 120,000 jobs.  With the House, Senate and White House under one party control, Republicans have absolutely no excuses for threatening America’s families with a destructive and pointless government shutdown.    Democrats strongly oppose President Trump’s multi-billion dollar border wall boondoggle, and will stand fast against this immoral, ineffective border wall and its unacceptable poison pill riders.

My constituent, a foreign graduate of a U.S. university, recently requested my assistance with obtaining his employment authorization card from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Pursuant to his student visa, my constituent is allowed to work for one year post-graduation so that he gains practical experience in the field of his study. Several months ago, he received an approval notice in the mail from USCIS stating that his employment authorization was approved and that he would receive his card in the mail within a month. However, after waiting for a month, he discovered that the card had been returned to USCIS as undeliverable despite the fact that it was sent to the same address as the approval notice. Complicating matters, my constituent was to start his new job the following week. Upon learning of the situation, my staff immediately contacted USCIS on my constituent’s behalf and was able to have his card resent to him. My constituent was able to begin his new job as planned. 

Caseworkers in my San Francisco office work to address any problems or concerns you may have with a federal government agency. To submit a Casework Authorization Form, please visit my website.

8/25/17 16:23,News from Nita: Censuring President Trump Over Charlottesville Response,"￼
ABOUT NITA           CONSTITUENT SERVICES           NEWSROOM           LEGISLATIVE ISSUES           17th DISTRICT           CONTACT ME 
Dear Friend:
I'm fighting hard to keep Lower Hudson Valley communities safe, healthy, and secure by: 
	•	Cosponsoring Legislation to Censure President Trump 
	•	Helping Secure Funding for Local Drinking Water Improvements 
	•	Assisting a Hartsdale Resident with Medical Bills 
	•	Securing Funding for the Tappan Zee Bridge Replacement 
Cosponsoring Legislation to Censure President Trump The President's heinous comments since the violence in Charlottesville have stained the office of the presidency. That is why I became an original cosponsor of legislation to censure the President. The President's defense of neo-Nazis and white supremacists is a failure of moral leadership. For more statements like this on issues that matter to you, connect with me on Facebook by clicking here or on the image below.  
￼ 
Helping Secure Funding for Local Drinking Water Improvements This week, I was pleased to announce $1.4 million in federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) grants to the Ossining Water Department to help finance a water main replacement project. The funding was awarded through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) program. New Yorkers deserve access to safe, reliable drinking water, so we must ensure that our communities have the funding to improve their water infrastructure. These critical resources will allow Ossining to move forward with a water main replacement project that protects water quality and safeguards the health of the community. As Ranking Member on the House Appropriations Committee, I will continue to fight to make sure New York receives the resources to keep our drinking water clean and safe. 
Assisting a Hartsdale Resident with Medical Bills A Hartsdale resident contacted my office for assistance with his daughter's medical bills. After she went to an upstate facility for medical attention, they received a notice that her insurance paid the entire bill. Six months later, however, the daughter received a bill for the same visit, including more charges for which the facility said she was responsible. After I inquired with the facility and its CEO on the validity of and delays in the charges, the charges were waived. 
Securing Funding for the Tappan Zee Bridge Replacement 
￼ 
Rep. Lowey marks the opening of the Tappan Zee Bridge replacement, which was partly financed by more than $1 billion in federal funding she helped secure. 
I participated in a ceremony Thursday with Governor Andrew Cuomo to mark the opening of the first span of the Tappan Zee Bridge replacement. I was proud to help secure a $1.6 billion Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) loan, the largest in history, to help finance the bridge, as well as a $10 million TIGER grant to finance bus rapid transit through the Hudson Links Program. The investments in the Tappan Zee Bridge mean less waiting in bumper-to-bumper traffic, more time spent with our families, and local economic growth. 
Staying in Touch It is an honor to represent the Lower Hudson Valley in the United States Congress. To stay in touch and get the latest updates, please connect with me on Facebook and on Twitter.  If you have questions or need assistance, please contact my office in Westchester County at (914) 428-1707, Rockland County at (845) 639-3485, or Washington, D.C., at (202) 225-6506, and we will do all we can to help.

Government shutdown threatened over border wall President Trump traveled to Arizona this week to hold a campaign-style rally where he threatened a government shutdown over funding for his proposed border wall and defended his statements on the events that took place in Charlottesville, Va. House Speaker Paul Ryan pushed back saying most people, including members of Congress, do not support shutting down the government.
￼
Secretary of the Interior supports scale-back of monuments Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has recommended a “handful” of federal monuments – land preserved by federal statute that have varied objects of historical, cultural, and/or scientific interest within their borders – be scaled back. The recommendation aligns with President Trump’s agenda to reapportion traces of federal land for economic development after arguing that the Obama administration had abused the Antiquities Act of 1906. 
￼
Revised Texas voter ID law blocked A federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas has blocked the state from enforcing a revised version of its voter identification law. The ruling states that the new law perpetuated “discrimination against black and Hispanic voters” and that it “did not go far enough.”
Indiana NAACP and League of Women Voters file lawsuit The lawsuit, which was filed against the Indiana Secretary of State and the Indiana Election Division, states that the new method of cross-checking names on voter rolls – called the Interstate Voter Registration CrossCheck – is discriminatory and violates federal law. The program, which Tennessee also uses, has been cited for its unreliability in properly notifying and verifying voters who move out of state.  
Partisan gerrymandering before federal courts again On Thursday, a panel of three federal judges declined to invalidate Maryland’s congressional voting map. Seven Republican voters challenged the map, arguing that Democrats unconstitutionally redrew the Maryland districts to favor their party. The panel placed the dispute on hold while the Supreme Court considers the Wisconsin gerrymandering case, which is scheduled for October. This sets up another partisan gerrymandering case that will be ripe for appeal should the Supreme Court agree on a new standard for unconstitutional gerrymanders. 
￼
All counties have coverage in 2018 This week, the last “bare” county – a county without an insurer on the Marketplace – was covered in Ohio. That means every county in the country will now have at least one insurer selling Obamacare plans next year. Insurance markets are proving more resilient than many anticipated, with insurers jumping in to cover regions other companies fled, undercutting Republican predictions of widespread market collapses.

Breaking Ground in #TN7

This was a big week for our district as LG, the popular electronics maker, broke ground on its new 829,000-square-foot home appliance manufacturing facility in Clarksville! I was honored to join Commerce secretary Ross, South Korean Ambassador Ahn and other local leaders at this event to welcome the company to our state. The 600+ jobs it will bring and the potential for future expansion are very welcome in #TN7. We are grateful for President Trump's and the Administration's emphasis on putting Americans first and reviving manufacturing jobs here in America.

You Asked, I Answered

I met with many of you this week during my Listening Tour through Humphreys, Williamson and Davidson counties. Each meeting was enlightening and engaging, and I value hearing your thoughts on the issues and how I can best represent you in Washington.
￼
Throughout each day, I met dozens of you and took questions at every stop. Those questions are critical reminders that my staff and I need to be focused on what matters to YOU in our district, state and country. Here’s a recap of what we talked about:
Health Care – You asked about insurance subsidies, pools and rates, and stressed how taxes and regulations are thwarting medical research.
￼
Rural Broadband – You stressed the cost of rural broadband is prohibitive. Is Congress working to keep costs reasonable?
￼
Energy – You asked how we could put more focus on food waste as a renewable source. You also want Yucca Mountain to reopen their nuclear waste repository. Will the Senate act?
Media – You’re concerned about the excessive focus on the Senate when the House has accomplished so much this year. Why won’t the media focus on important issues and progress? 
Click here to get more information on what the House has accomplished this year
Industry – With Toyota/Mazda looking at Tennessee for its new assembly plant, you wanted to know: What are the odds we’ll get the 4,000 jobs?
Tax Relief – You asked about keeping the state tax deduction in the tax code, fiduciary law, and achieving tax relief in general.
Bipartisanship – You wanted to know how the House can help the Senate get things done. Do they know the American people are frustrated? What can we do about fragmentation within the parties? Can we collaborate? 
Click here to read about a great example of bipartisanship at work for you
And more…  – You asked about our telephone town hall survey results, flood insurance reauthorization, the EPA, civil discourse, and middle-TN growth.
￼
 
Can you hear me now?

Recently, President Trump signed the FDA Reauthorization Act into law. This bill includes a measure I sponsored in the House, the Over-the Counter Hearing Aid Act, to make hearing aids more affordable and more accessible by allowing certain types of hearing aids to be regulated by the FDA and marketed over-the-counter in your neighborhood drug stores, malls, and shopping centers.
￼
This is a true win for the millions of Americans struggling with hearing loss and the costs associated with it. Making hearing aids more accessible and affordable is a commonsense measure, and I am glad to see this signed into law! 
 
Health IT comes to Nashville

Health Information technology plays a large role in Tennessee, and with technology advancing at unprecedented rates, it will continue to impact our area more and more. It was a great privilege to provide a “View from Congress” to the Healthcare Information & Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Summit of the Southeast attendees and Health Forward Conference in Nashville this week.

August 25, 2017
Dear Lindsey,
          I am glad that Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke accepted my invitation to come out to Montana to see for themselves Montanas battle with wildfires. Check out our day in these four photographs below.
1. Representative Greg Gianforte and I greeted Secretary Perdue and Secretary Zinke at the airport.
￼
2. From the airport, we headed straight to the Rocky Mountain Training Center to be briefed on the Lolo Peak fire, which has already consumed more than 34,000 acres and has forced over 1,000 evacuations.
￼
3. At the Missoula Smokejumper Base, we learned more about the efforts of the highly skilled men and women who are often the initial suppression force against wildfires.
￼
4. We also had the opportunity to visit the Lolo Peak fire camp  we all walked away extremely thankful for the hardworking firefighters on the front lines.
￼
          It was an honor to host the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior in Montana so they could see first-hand the impact wildfires are having on our great state. We must not allow extreme environmentalists to dictate how we manage our forests. A healthy forest is a managed forest and we heard that message loud and clear from both Secretary Perdue and Secretary Zinke. We must work across party lines and at all levels of government to ensure that forests are managed in a way that protects both the environment and wildlife and reduces the severity of wildfires.
          Secretary Perdue and Secretary Zinke both saw hardworking men and women who put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities. I know they will take those images back with them to D.C. as they continue to tackle ways to improve the health of our forests.
          As always, I encourage you to contact my office to express your concerns or opinions on policy issues important to you. And if were not already connected on social media, I invite you to follow my daily updates on Facebook.
          Its my number one priority in Congress to represent the values and interests of the people of Montana, and your input is very helpful as I do. I also invite you to visit my website, www.daines.senate.gov, so we can stay in close touch.
Best Wishes, 
￼

Visit my website for more updates at Hassan.Senate.Gov. 
￼ 

Several Measures I Championed were Signed into Law 
Recently, several measures I championed were signed into law: 
The bipartisan Opioid Addiction Risk Transparency Act, which I introduced with Senator Todd Young (R-IN), was the first bill I authored that was signed into law. The bill, which was included in the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017, takes important steps to help ensure that doctors understand that all opioids – even ones that are called “abuse-deterrent” – are addictive. 
The bipartisan Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2017, which I introduced with Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Johnny Isakson (R-GA), was also signed into law as part of the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017. That legislation would make certain types of hearing aids available over the counter to Granite Staters and Americans with mild to moderate hearing impairment. 
Another bill I helped introduce - the bipartisan Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act – was also signed into law. The bill would help reduce wait times and improve the process for New Hampshire and America’s veterans seeking benefits from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. 

Penned an Op-Ed on How We Can Address Our Broken Campaign Finance System 
Wednesday, the Concord Monitor published an op-ed I wrote on my efforts to fix the broken campaign finance system and get dark money out of politics. I particularly highlighted the DISCLOSE Act of 2017 – a bill I helped introduce with 45 of my colleagues – to increase transparency and close loopholes that allow foreign nationals and foreign companies to use dark money to interfere in our elections. Click here to read my op-ed at the Concord Monitor. 

Called for Homeland Security Committee Hearings on Domestic Violent Extremism 
This week, I joined a number of my colleagues on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in asking for a hearing on violent white supremacism following the domestic terrorist attack in Charlottesville that killed one woman and injured many others.  
In a letter to Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, we emphasized the importance of “examin[ing] the root causes that fuel terrorism in order to understand the threats that we face…[which includes] investigating the root causes behind violent white supremacy in the United States.” 

Announced Upcoming Bipartisan Health Care Hearings 
I am pleased that the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee is moving forward with bipartisan hearings on how to bring stability to health insurance markets, and it is critical that President Trump drops his efforts to sabotage health insurance markets – especially as Republicans and Democrats are working together to make improvements to the law that will lower costs. I have long called for members of both parties to come together on common-sense solutions to improve upon the Affordable Care Act and lower health care costs, and these bipartisan hearings are an important start. 

Thanked Our Service Members, Veterans and their Families at the Marine Corps League Annual Picnic 
￼  ￼ 
It was a beautiful afternoon on Saturday for the Marine Corps League Annual Picnic in New Castle, and it was an honor to join service members, veterans, and their families who have sacrificed to help keep America safe, secure and free. 

Called On the Air Force to Take Responsibility for the Contamination at Pease 
I joined Senator Shaheen and Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter in sending a letter to the United States Air Force requesting a community update on efforts to treat water supplies contaminated with perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) at Pease International Tradeport, the former Pease Air Force Base. The letter also asks for specific responses to concerns raised by Members of the New Hampshire State Legislature. 

Responded to President Trump’s Ban on Transgender Individuals Serving in the Military 
According to news reports, the White House is starting the process of enforcing a ban on transgender individuals serving in the military. Transgender Americans serve with honor to protect our country. Trump's decision is reprehensible and I will fight it at every turn.

A Note from Congressman Faso
 As the August district work period nears a close I want to pass along a special thank you to all of those who participated in events and meetings in the 19th District with me and my staff over these past several weeks. Traveling scenic Upstate, meeting with our neighbors, and learning about the real-world problems people are facing is the best way to inform the decisions I have to make down in Washington. Thus far, I have taken close to 500 individual and small group meetings, as constituent services are vitally important to me and my staff. In this spirit, I want to pass along a reminder of all the great services we provide and encourage you to reach out to our office if we can be of any assistance.  Congressman John J. Faso New York’s 19th Congressional District


Learn About our Constituent Services
 Visiting Washington and Touring the Capitol  Are you a 19th District resident and planning a trip to Washington to see some of our nation’s monuments? We would love to meet you. So don’t be a stranger and let us know you’re coming our way. While the schedule is often crazy and unpredictable down here, my dedicated staff will do everything they can to coordinate a time for us to meet. At the very least, we can provide tickets to some Washington, D.C. attractions, including a tour of the U.S. Capitol building. All tickets are free and are provided to constituents on a first-come, first-served basis. Due to the large number of visitors, please request tours with as much advance notice as possible   *White House tours require at least three-months advance notice.  We have an easy to fill out form to schedule tours that can be found here.  Help with a federal agency  If you can't get an answer from a federal agency in a timely fashion, or if you feel you have been treated unfairly, our office may be able to help resolve a problem or get you the information you need. While we cannot guarantee you a favorable outcome, we will do our best to help you receive a fair and timely response to your problem. For help with a federal agency, contact one of my district offices:  Delhi District Office 111 Main Street, Delhi, NY 13753 Phone: (607) 746-9537
Kinderhook District Office 2 Hudson Street, Kinderhook, NY 12106 Phone: (518) 610-8133  Kingston District Office 721 Broadway, Kingston, NY 12401 Phone: (845) 514-2322
Help with federal grants  Our office stands ready to help your organization understand grant eligibility and the often convoluted processes associated with submitting an application. Our website is a good place to start – and it will provide you with a central location to search the wealth of information available from both government and private entities who offer financing to individuals, businesses and state and local governments. The links on this page offer helpful information that will enable you to research information efficiently and will guide you on writing grant proposals.  Service academy nominations  Are you a high school student looking to serve your country? There are many ways to serve – but for some of our nation’s most dedicated and gifted young people there is the potential for attending one of our nation’s fine service academies. This includes The U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Air Force Academy, and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. My office can help you through the application process and will support your laudable efforts in any way we can.  Activities for kids  We even have a section of our website dedicated to guiding you on how to best entertain and educate the kids when you come down for a visit! Learn more about these activities here.


Save the Date: Esopus Town Hall
 As a reminder, a third town hall event will take place at Esopus Town Hall on August 31. Our last town hall event in April was a big success, and I look forward to engaging on the serious issues facing our district and our nation.  While the size of the venue limits the amount of tickets available, the town hall will be broadcast live on Public Access Channel 23 out of Esopus. Our office will also provide video from the event following its conclusion.  Who: Congressman Faso, Move Forward New York, and moderators Dr. Gerald Benjamin (SUNY New Paltz) and Debra Clinton of Move Forward New York  Note: Move Forward New York is a left-leaning organization of citizen-activists, and after meeting with Congressman Faso, in June they presented Congressman Faso with a proposal for a joint town hall event over the August work period. The details for this event are as follows:  When: Thursday, August 31, 2017, at 6:30PM – 8:00PM. Doors open at 6:00PM  Format/Schedule: Dr. Benjamin and Ms. Clinton will welcome everyone and set ground rules about asking questions, the format of the town hall, and civility. Congressman Faso will deliver 10 minutes of opening remarks, which will be followed by Q&A from 6:45PM to 7:45PM.  Asking Questions: As attendees sign-in they will have the opportunity to submit questions on index cards. The moderators will alternate selecting questions – which will be asked by the person who wrote it in the audience. Moderators will determine whether a follow up question is appropriate.  Tickets: The venue holds approximately 200 attendees – 70 tickets will be distributed by Move Forward New York; contact: mfny19@gmail.com. 70 tickets will be distributed by Congressman Faso’s office; contact: 202-225-5614. 60 tickets will be distributed at the door on a first come first serve basis. Limit 1 ticket per request.  Press: The event will be open to the press, but press credentials will be required. To request press credentials please contact John Lange – john.lange@mail.house.gov.  Special Note: This event is intended to serve ALL residents of New York’s 19th district, including those who may not be able to attend but want to hear from their Congressman – not just to those called on to ask a question, or those in attendance to protest. With this in mind, we will ask that all in attendance respect their neighbors, and act in a civil manner so that as many questions as possible can be asked, answered, and heard. Any person(s) who cannot honor this request for respect and civility will be asked to leave.  Due to security reasons there will be no signage permitted into the town hall.

The summer is almost over and it has been a busy August. I attended a number of meetings and community events in the past few weeks, and have met with many of you who requested meetings with me.
Dear Friend,
It is always a priority for me to be back in Fort Worth as much as possible. I recently calculated that I spend at least 60 percent of the year in the district.
When I am in the district, my goal is to hear from as many constituents as possible. My schedule is always filled weeks in advance with meetings and community events. If I am not available, my staff is always happy to meet with you.
In the past week, I attended a groundbreaking for the new Northside Community Health Center, a meet-and-greet in Weatherford, and a sit-down with church groups about the plight of refugees living in the Fort Worth area.
I also attended one of my favorite events this week. Each year, I host a meeting with community mayors from across our corner of North Texas. This nonpartisan gathering is exceptionally helpful because I get the chance to learn what issues are affecting our communities.
Many of these types of events do not attract coverage in the media, but the Wise County Messenger wrote about a meeting I had Monday with constituents in Decatur. If you have not read the article, I encourage you to do so here.
While the meeting was arranged by a Republican group, many Democrats attended and everyone had a chance to ask questions. Topics included healthcare reform, national security, and education.
Much has been written about the current state of our political system and our inability to have a civil debate. I thank everyone who turned out Monday for showing respect for their neighbors by allowing us to have a constructive conversation.
If we lose the ability to have a civil public discussion about the issues we most care about then we lose a key component of our democracy.
Sincerely,
￼

Report on the August Work Period 
Dear Neighbor,
This August District Work Period we have visited throughout the District, meeting with hundreds of people every week in their neighborhoods, workplaces, community events, coffee shops, fairs, cultural celebrations, places of worship, and more. Our office has held mobile office hours throughout the District in libraries, community centers, county fairs, and had many meetings in our offices as part of our ongoing efforts to serve Virginia’s 10th District.   Since I was first elected as Delegate, I’ve always found going to people and meeting them where they are, and hearing from them is the most informative way to stay in touch with our diverse district and hear directly from constituents. My staff and I have also had individual and small group meetings throughout the August work period -- from attending “National Night Out” events, to roundtables on the opioid epidemic, to opening new veteran offices and new businesses or visiting our local county fairs or cultural events representing our diverse community -- we appreciate your input on the many issues of the day or getting the opportunity to assist on a constituent casework matter. 
Charlottesville
The events in Charlottesville earlier this month shook us to the core. My oldest son, Danny, attended the University of Virginia. This historic university means so much to my family, the Commonwealth, and the country. The neo-Nazi march and the hate and racism on display there was vile, and has no place in this great Commonwealth. We mourned the death of Heather Heyer, who was simply exercising her first amendment rights on that tragic day, as well as Virginia State Police Lieutenant H. Jay Cullen and State Police Trooper-Pilot Berke Bates who were killed in the line of duty when their helicopter crashed while hovering over Charlottesville during that tragic day. The Justice Department has committed to thoroughly investigating the violent crimes that occurred.   
As I hear from many across our district, they want to find ways to come together and stop such hate and violence. Our interfaith community is strong and has been engaged in these efforts on a regular basis and it is some comfort that most of the people who incited the violence were not from the Commonwealth. Two of my colleagues in Congress, Senators Tim Scott (R-SC) and Tom Lankford (R-OK), started “Solution Sundays” last year and it is a great model for how we can bring communities together. The simple idea is to bring people of different races and backgrounds together and have a Sunday dinner and talk face to face to each other and most importantly, listen. They point out that this facilitates breaking down walls and building trust across our communities. It is harder to stereotype when you know people first-hand. When the cameras are turned off and it’s just personal conversations, you don’t have the kind of ugly spectacles we saw in Charlottesville with people picking fights and shouting vile things while they taped themselves doing it. Earlier this week, I got together, along with other local officials, with African American and Latino clergy in Manassas. Our mutual friend, D.J. Jordan, a senior staffer to Senator Lankford, and active in many outreach activities in the community himself, brought the group together to discuss race relations in our community. I look forward to continuing the conversation with leaders from around the District in this same fashion.

My staff and I once again enjoyed visiting with neighbors and constituents, law enforcement, and first responders across Virginia's 10th Congressional District for 10 National Night Out events.  These events are community-police awareness-raising event that are held the first Tuesday of August.  We had the opportunity to discuss neighborhood safety issues such as the growing problem of MS-13 gangs and opioid and heroin addiction, and the importance of community policing.  In July, I introduced H.R. 3249 the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act which would establish a grant program to provide resources to state and local entities to curb the rise in gang activity and violence.  This legislation authorizes $70 million annually for FY2018 through FY2022.  Twenty percent of the authorized $70 million will go directly to already-established gang task forces, like the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force, who are experiencing elevated transnational gang activity from gangs such as MS-13.  Also in July, I was able to secure legislative language to fight MS-13 and other gangs in the report accompanying the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.  The language urges the Department of Justice to prioritize grant funding for existing Regional Gang Task Forces, such as the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force. 
Thanks to Loudoun County Sheriff's Office, Fairfax County Police Department, Leesburg Police Department, Winchester Police Department, Frederick County Virginia Sheriff's Office, Winchester City Sheriff's Office, Clarke County Sheriff's Office, Manassas City Police Department, City of Manassas Park Police, Prince William County Police Department, Berryville Police Department, and Purcellville Police Department for participating.
Heroin and Opioid Epidemic Round Tables with Local and National Leaders

￼
Loudoun Round Table
Loudoun
We held two round tables with the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) in Loudoun and Winchester to discuss our heroin and addiction challenges and how we can better coordinate and deliver services and provide community wide support with our federal, state and local resources.  We brought together our leaders in law enforcement, treatment and education efforts to highlight our best practices.  ONDCP is going to continue to work with our leaders as a model for the country.
We joined with Chip Muir from the Office National Drug Control Policy and our dedicated law enforcement officers, faith and community leaders, medical and legal professionals and local elected officials in Loudoun where we inaugurated the multifaceted Heroin Operations Team with Sheriff Mike Chapman over two years ago. We invited ONDCP to hear from a diverse group of leaders such as recovery coach Nick Yacoub and Ginny Lovitt, Executive Director of the Chris Atwood Foundation.  Ginny lost her brother Chris to the disease of addiction.  Both Nick and Ginny lent important perspectives to ONDCP officials that will provide future dialogue and additional working relationships.  In addressing substance abuse disorder we face diverse challenges and it was important for ONDCP to hear a variety of voices.  

￼
Winchester Round Table
Winchester
In Winchester we met with and heard from the Northern Shenandoah Valley Substance Abuse Coalition for our 2nd heroin and opioid roundtable. Executive Director Lauren Cummings, Dr. Nicholas Restrepo of Valley Health, Delegate Chris Collins, Delegate Randy Minchew, Delegate Dave LaRock, our law enforcement, medical, business and faith community provided details on the model programs that the coalition is implementing. This year we are once again working to increase HIDTA funding for our local law enforcement, as well as learn about new efforts in education, prevention, and treatment.

10th Congressional District Young Women Leadership Program Events
￼
10th CD Young Women Leadership Program
This is the 5th year in a row we have held this program and over 1,200 young women have now participated and had the unique opportunity to learn from women leaders in medicine, business, government, and many other professions.
We brought young women from around the District to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) to experience speed mentoring sessions with women leaders throughout different levels of the Agency leadership. The NGA provides a variety of geospatial intelligence about Earth so our military, intelligence professionals, policy makers, and first responders can best serve our country.  We held our Young Women Leadership Program on women in service and education in Winchester.  Young women around the District have learned from inspiring women with successful careers in a variety of jobs and our Service and Education event allowed participants to meet women immersed in our education system as well as women who have bravely served our country. Participants also had the opportunity to spend a morning at the Kennedy Center with special guests, including Deborah Rutter, President of the Kennedy Center.
The STEM fields were well represented for this summer’s program during a dynamic discussion with a diverse group of women who have been leaders in the STEM fields from Northrop Grumman.  Over 350 students participated in the 10th District Young Woman Leadership Program this year and we had events throughout the District where our young women were mentored by women leaders from NASA and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, women leaders in business, medicine, philanthropy, education, law enforcement and first responders, women in Congress, and more. Thank you to all of this year's speakers who imparted their great knowledge and experiences to these young women and inspired the next generation of women leaders. We look forward to following the futures of these young women leaders in our community. This year’s final program featured speakers Corliss Udoema, 2017 Virginia Small Business Person of the Year; and the Women Giving Back Board - Emilia Philip, Nicole Morris, and Patricia Leader.

Loudoun Therapeutic Riding
Loudoun Therapeutic Riding with our Veterans
We enjoyed the Loudoun Therapeutic Riding event with Blue Star Families and the Wounded Warrior Project at Morven Park where we met with veterans and their families and discussed the new GI Bill the House passed and the Veterans Accountability Act. Executive Director Joanne Hart has a goal of raising awareness as to the benefits of veterans connecting with horses through their Equine Services for Heroes program.  A number of veterans brought up the new GI Bill which takes away the 15 year limit to the GI Bill for our service members.  Thanks to Supervisor Geary Higgins and Joanne Hart, Executive Director of Loudoun Therapeutic Riding, for joining us on this wonderful day.             
￼
Dept. of Veterans Services Opening
Opening of Our Local Ashburn Virginia Department of Veterans Services Office
We celebrated the grand opening of the Virginia Department of Veterans Services Loudoun Office in Ashburn where we joined with federal, state, and local elected officials in honor of our veterans. This office will provide local veterans and their families in our community with access to federal and state benefits, help with employment opportunities, and be a resource for those in our community who have served.  

￼
Honoring Master Police Officer Stephen Lewis
Honoring the late Master Police Officer Stephen Lewis
We were privileged to join Jenny Lewis and her family to honor her late husband, Master Police Officer Stephen Lewis of the Winchester Police Department. We presented a certificate and a flag flown over the United States Capitol in his memory and met with his fellow officers on the force and his son, Richard, who also serves.  Throughout his service he was lauded for his incredible work ethic and great attitude and was someone who always enjoyed making people laugh.  He will be missed by his family and the community which he called home and on which he had such a positive impact.
￼
Expansion of Heritage Brewing
Celebrating the Expansion of Veteran Owned Heritage Brewing Company
We celebrated the expansion of veteran owned and operated Heritage Brewing in Manassas with veteran owner Sean Arroyo, Governor Terry McAuliffe, Manassas Mayor Hal Parrish, Delegate Jackson Miller, and other local officials. Heritage Brewing Company’s workforce is over fifty percent veteran and uses locally sourced and organic ingredients including hops grown in Loudoun County. We presented Sean, a Marine Corps and Army veteran, who served in Iraq, with an American flag that was flown over the United States Capitol. Sean started Heritage Brewing right after he got out of the service in 2013. The expansion will include a new brewery and restaurant space in one of the largest development projects in the history of the City of Manassas.    
Frederick County Public Schools Convocation
￼
FCPS Convocation
 
We joined with parents, teachers, and students for the Frederick County Public Schools Convocation Ceremony at Millbrook High School to celebrate and honor the teachers and those nominated for Teacher of the Year, which has been going on since 1990.  Each school nominates a teacher for this award and applications are reviewed by educators and community leaders.  Congratulations to Suzanne Miller, this year’s Frederick County Teacher of the Year. She teaches at Frederick County Middle School.

Meeting with our Businesses and Discussing Economic Growth in our Region
￼
Rep. Comstock at the 84 Lumber Opening
84 Lumber Opening
Joined local and state officials, our local economic development team, and the President and CEO of 84 Lumber Company, Maggie Hardy Magerko, for the grand opening of their new store in Stephenson. 84 Lumber's $3.9 million investment in our community provides much needed, good paying jobs for our region and I appreciate the strong culture of hard work and integrity Maggie Magerko fosters among all those who work with her.  Maggie is an inspirational leader and she spoke to her employees and all those present at the opening on the value of helping lift up those around you and giving your best effort. Always great to see a business run by a dynamic woman. We were also joined by Delegate Dave LaRock, Supervisor Blaine Dunn, Chairman Chuck DeHaven, and other leaders in our community.

￼
Realtors Dialogue
Dialogue with our Realtors
We met with our realtors for a dialogue at the Dulles Area Association of Realtors (DARR) for an informative discussion on our ongoing tax reform efforts, the local opioid epidemic, transportation and Metro issues, as well as our work on the National Flood Insurance Program, an important program that we are working to reauthorize in Congress. Thank you to Mike Taylor from Flags of Valor, Bradley Boland from the DAAR and Patty Foster from Access National Bank and all of our realtors for joining us.            

￼
Rep. Comstock at Kingspan Insulation
Kingspan Insulation Manufacturing Plant Upgrades 
We congratulated Kingspan Insulation on the recent upgrades to their manufacturing plant which was supported by the Virginia Economic Development Partnership in Frederick County. Kingspan continues to innovate in their manufacturing and these upgrades will help them utilize new technologies to produce more efficiently and effectively.  It is partnerships like these that will help create more good paying jobs in our region.
 
￼
Franchise Roundtable
Franchisee Round Table
 Met in Sterling with Rosemarie Hartnett, Co-founder and President of Abrakadoodle, former Delegate David Ramadan, owner of REVOLISM franchise, and other franchise owners in the hotel, pet, and other industries, for a round table on franchises in our District. Abrakadoodle is a woman owned company that brings art classes onsite to schools and community centers like the McLean Community Center. Franchise owners in Virginia provide 238,000 jobs and $8.6 billion in payroll and $21.1 billion in revenue. We discussed bipartisan legislation, HR 3441, the Save Local Business Act, which I have cosponsored and provides needed support and legal certainty for franchise owners and businesses who are often subject to frivolous lawsuits. In 2015, the Obama National Labor Relations Board handed down a new joint-employer standard that radically rewrote U.S. labor law and upended thousands of business relationships. The NLRB opinion threw out three decades of legal precedent that protected these small business owners and was estimated to kill 1.7 million jobs. H.R. 3441 restores the previous bipartisan law that had existed for decades.             

￼
Polo in the Park
Polo in the Park at Morven Park
Supervisor Tony Buffington and I attended Polo in the Park at Leesburg's Morven Park. This is the inaugural season of Polo in the Park and it has seen great success and economic impact in its first year. The event brings together our equine industry, with local food trucks and features Stone Tower Winery and Catoctin Creek Distillery.  Polo matches were played every Saturday night in July and August at the Morven Park International Equestrian Center and these matches get our young families engaged in a kid-friendly environment and at the same time helps boost our economy by bringing families from all over to Morven Park and the Leesburg region to visit our local businesses downtown.  Morven Park Executive Director Stephanie Kenyon has done a great job in bringing these polo matches to Loudoun County and making this a popular gathering in the community, with up to 2,000 people attending each event.  
 

￼
Visiting Premier Birth Center
Visiting Premier Birth Center
Thanks to Kim and Barry Pekin for the visit and tour of the Premier Birth Center, which is only the second accredited center in Virginia. Kim, a midwife, is the founder and clinical director of the center and partners with local doctors in providing services for women in our region.  I appreciated Kim and Barry’s passion for helping women through the birth of a child and the great care they give the women who come through their doors is admirable.  

Visiting with Constituents at Local Fairs and Festivals 
￼
Winchester Greek Festival
Winchester Greek Festival
Every year it is always a delight to visit with our friends at the annual Winchester Greek Festival, where we have delicious Greek food and enjoy the dancing and music with families in our community, as well as hear from constituents directly on some of the issues most important to them and tell them some of the efforts we are working on in Congress, such as increasing the Child Tax Credit, that will help parents and their families.  Wonderful to see the family of Manny Sempeles and Father Peter at the festival also. 

￼
Celebrating Korean Independence Day
Celebrating Korean Independence Day
We joined our Korean-American constituents to celebrate the 72nd anniversary of the Korean Independence Day with the Korean American Association of the Washington Metropolitan Area to help inspire future generations and honor the rich history of Korea that has greatly contributed to the diversity of our region.

￼
Frederick County Fair
 Local County Fairs
The Frederick County Fair is one of the biggest fairs of the year in Virginia. It was wonderful to see so many constituents out enjoying the fairs with family and friends and my staff and I enjoyed our time meeting with everyone.  We had staff ready to assist constituents at the Frederick County Fair and the Loudoun County and Clarke County Fairs as well.  I enjoyed visiting with constituents at each of our mobile office booths at the fairs.  We also attended the African American Festival in Manassas where we joined with local elected officials and friends to celebrate the diverse culture of our community.    

￼
Honoring Jimmy Wilkins
 Honoring Jimmy Wilkins in Winchester at the Shenandoah Valley Civil War Museum
We honored Jimmy Wilkins with the Graves Family Philanthropic Leadership Award and celebrated Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National Historic District for its historical and economic impact on our region. Jimmy has been an instrumental figure in preserving this museum.  I spoke at the ceremony to rename the Old Court House Civil War Museum to the Shenandoah Valley Civil War Museum.  The museum is housed in the former Frederick County Courthouse, which is managed by the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation. We were joined by Winchester Mayor John David Smith and Delegate Chris Collins.  

Reception with our Interns
￼
Summer 2017 Interns
 
We are so fortunate to have such a great group of interns from throughout the District working in our D.C., Sterling, and Winchester offices. We appreciate the important service they provide to the 10th District and we look forward to following their future successes. We wish them a wonderful school year.  

Welcoming our New Grandson, Henry, to the Family!
￼
Rep. Comstock with Caity, Hailey, and Henry
 
We kicked off the work period with my daughter, Caity, giving birth to our newest grandson, Henry.  We were running back and forth between the hospital and votes on the morning of Friday, July 28!   Mom, Henry and family are doing great and my husband, Chip and I have been pitching in to help with some special time with big sister, Hailey, and her new brother over the work period.  Hailey is a regular at the Children’s Science Center at Fair Oaks Mall and she loved visiting all the animals at the Loudoun County Fair.   
For all of our constituents with young or growing families, we remember well and are now reliving those days of juggling the enormous challenges of work and family.  This also informs many of the priorities I focus on in Congress from providing tax relief for families (we’ve introduced legislation to increase the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000), transportation solutions to ease traffic congestion so families have more time together and less on the road, and promoting flexible work policies in government and the private sector.  As we take up tax relief policies this fall, providing tax relief for our hardworking families will be a top priority for me.

CW bill now law
President Donald Trump has signed into law the Northern Mariana Islands Economic Expansion Act. I introduced the bill earlier this year to address the crisis caused by Chinese construction companies using up some 4,000 CW permits, which hurt the hospital and local businesses and forced long-term, essential foreign workers to leave the Marianas. The Act bars the use of the limited CW permits for new construction workers, who can instead be admitted under the unlimited H-2B visas. The Act also puts more money into the training fund for U.S. workers seeking jobs, requiring any employer who hires a CW worker to pay $200 into the fund, up from $150. Finally, the Act adds 350 CW permits for fiscal 2017, reserving at least 60 for healthcare workers and at least 10 for power plant operators; in general, these CW permits will be valid for one year.  Although the Act is intended to be a short-term fix, it does contain elements of a long-term solution, such as set-asides for specific, high-value occupations, more restrictions on the use of the CW program for certain occupations when other visa categories are available, and more funding to train locals. My next goal is to work on long-term legislation for the Marianas through a bipartisan, bicameral working group. I have asked my colleagues in Congress to include the Governor’s office in this working group. Though we are starting with a clean slate in terms of drafting legislation, we have agreed on two general goals: to make sure the Marianas has enough labor to support a growing economy, and to make sure the percentage of U.S. workers keeps going up.



Farewell, Tony de Brum 
Climate Change Ambassador and former Foreign Minister of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Honorable Tony de Brum, died on Tuesday in Majuro. Mr. de Brum dedicated his life to serving the people of the Marshall Islands, and was renowned for his passionate advocacy for international climate action and a world free of nuclear weapons. His legacy lives on in the many he inspired. My wife Andrea and I extend our sincere sympathies to Mr. de Brum’s family, and to the government and people of the Marshall Islands.

Real Action to Help Our Veterans
In its ongoing efforts to reform the way the Veterans Administration (VA) does business, Congress is making good on its promise to ensure that our nations veterans have ready access to the benefits they earned and so richly deserve.  This week, the President signed two more pieces of bipartisan legislation designed to provide tangible assistance to the men and women who have served in uniform:
	•	The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act is legislation that will streamline the lengthy process that veterans undergo when appealing their claims for disability benefits with the VA. More than 470,000 veterans are still waiting for decisions regarding their appeals.
	•	Also signed into law this week, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act which allows veterans to use their education benefits whenever they choose, rather than during the current 5-year time limit on the use of GI bill benefits. Thats why this is often called the Forever GI Bill. This bipartisan expansion of the GI bill  which passed in the House and Senate with unanimous support  also makes it easier for post-9/11 Purple Heart recipients to get GI bill benefits, and gives veterans a better shot at in-demand science and technology jobs. This is a landmark effort in helping our veterans make a good transition and pursue their passion. It is the biggest expansion of the GI bill in a decade.
Once again, I commend the Republicans and Democrats who came together in bipartisan fashion to get these bills done. We will keep working to see that our veterans get the world-class care and treatment that they and their families have earned. 
In June, Congress passedand President Trump signed the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, a direct response to the national scandals of the last three years. Recently, the House approved the FY 18 Military Construction-VA Appropriations bill, drafted by my Committee, which included the highest level of funding ever for the Department of Veterans Affairs.
For more information on the MilCon-VA Appropriations bill, please click here.
For more information on the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, please click here.
A stable Afghanistan will mean a safer America.
This week, the President unveiled an expansive new strategy for South Asia aimed at bolstering American security here at home.  The new strategy encompasses Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and the Central Asian nations.
As you are aware, I have visited our troops and military leaders in Afghanistan several times in recent years to gauge our progress against the Taliban, al Qaeda, ISIS and other jihadist terrorist groups that call Afghanistan home and to determine what resources our deployed warfighters need to succeed.  My conclusion: the Taliban is resurgent and now controls large swaths of the Afghan countryside.  We need to regain the initiative.
Why is this important to us, here at home in New Jersey?  We must prevent terrorists from regaining a foothold in Afghanistan  the country from where al-Qaeda, aided by the Taliban, planned and directed the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
Yet the previous administration publicly placed an arbitrary end date on military operations in Afghanistan, enabling the Taliban to bide its time and begin a renewed campaign to reconquer its lost territory. We need only look toward Iraq, and the rise of ISIS following the last administrations withdrawal of U.S. forces, to see where this strategy leads.
At first blush, the new approach appears to be a reasonable plan that begins with being honest about the challenges in the region. The mission is very complex and the President is giving our Commanders the latitude and the resources they need to be successful.  
As Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, I recognize Congress responsibility.  Exercising rigorous oversight, Congress must step up and provide timely and adequate funding for this vital mission.
Its all about our homeland: a stable Afghanistan will mean a safer America.
To learn more about the new strategy for Southwest Asia, please click here.
By the way, Jessica Donatis opinion piece, A Reporters Anguished Farewell to Afghanistan, in the Wall Street Journal last weekend is worth a read.
Federal Funding for New Jerseys Highlands 
This week the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced that New Jerseys Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council will receive $2.4 million to protect 586 acres in the critical Highlands Region.  These funds are a part of the $10 million I secured for the Highlands Conservation Act funding in the Fiscal Year 2017 appropriations package, which cleared Congress and was signed into law by the President in May.
This grant will preserve 10 properties in the Upper Delaware and North and South Branch Raritan Watershed Management Areas. Lands within the project area have been identified as resources at risk and provide important ground water recharge, critical wildlife habitat, and outdoor recreation.
A major source of drinking water and in the most densely populated metropolitan area in the country, the Highlands is a critical area in need of protection. Since 2004, the Highlands Conservation Act, legislation I sponsored, has directed funding to preserve open space from willing sellers in the Highlands region of New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.
Looking forward, the FY 2018 Interior Appropriations bill, which cleared my Committee in July, includes another $10 million in funding for Highlands conservation projects. To learn more about this legislation please click here.  
ICYMI  End the Hatred with Words that Unite, Not Divide
In case you missed it, please see my remarks in last weeks e-News regarding the events in Charlottesville. 
Salute: Congratulations to Ryan Houser of Morristown, a member of the Morris Minute Men First Aid Squad, on his recent selection as EMT of the Year.  A fulltime student at Rutgers University, Ryan will be honored during a ceremony in Las Vegas in October for the National Association of Emergency Medical Technician's 2017 National EMS Awards of Excellence. Thanks for your service and your dedication, Ryan!

Build The Wall
Dear Friends,
On Monday, Dave and I put on our cardboard glasses and joined thousands of middle Tennesseans in sharing an incredible view of the total solar eclipse. I hope that you had an opportunity to take advantage of this once in a lifetime event, and as we get ready to wrap up the week, I wanted to share with you some fantastic news that the liberal media refuses to cover.  
You may have heard that this week President Trump visited a Border Patrol facility in Yuma, Arizona – a town that sits along our Southern border. What the liberal media won’t tell you is that since the construction of a fence along the region in 2006, arrests of illegal immigrants have dropped by a staggering 90 percent and assaults on Border Patrol agents have fallen dramatically. With a Commander in Chief committed to getting tough on immigration, we are seeing outstanding success. 
We’ve known all along that real immigration reform cannot be achieved without a secure border, and as our nation continues to face a costly immigration crisis, investing to secure our border is paramount. For that reason, the House Budget Committee’s Building A Better America budget resolution calls for increased funding for our homeland security, which includes protecting our border. Not only does our budget increase defense spending by $72.4 billion, but also includes the biggest mandatory spending cuts in 20 years, and reduces the total deficit by $6.5 trillion over ten years. Learn more about our budget resolution by clicking HERE or visiting BalancedBudget.gop. 
Yuma is just one example of how a physical wall at our Southern border is producing great results and keeping our families safe. Now, it is up to Congress to step up to the plate and pass our budget resolution to provide the resources needed to make this strategy a nationwide success. 
Sincerely,
￼ 
Diane Black Member of Congress

Congressional Youth Advisory Council

Last year, I launched a Congressional Youth Advisory Council (CYAC) for motivated high school juniors and seniors. Through this council, I gained insight from civic-minded students around TX-11. This year, we'll be expanding on last year's successes by adding more students to CYAC. 

The CYAC will meet three times within the school year and includes a roundtable discussion on current events and specific issues impacting our country, as well as learning the fundamental role of lawmakers, experts and citizens in our republic. These high-achieving students will also be asked to provide their views on current legislation working its way through Congress.

I'd encourage high school juniors and seniors interested in government to submit an application. To be considered, the completed application must be submitted to the Midland office no later than September 15, 2017.

Each year, Congress hosts the Congressional App Challenge (CAC), a competition for high school students to highlight the value of computer science and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education. I am very excited to extend an invitation to all high school students in my district to participate in the 2017 App Challenge. Students can choose to work on their own or in teams of up to four students to create an app on any topic for mobile, tablet, or other computing devices on a platform of their choice. 

As the technology industry plays a growing role in our economy, STEM education is an increasingly important component of today’s schooling. All students are welcome to submit an entry, regardless of their level of experience with coding. Students will expand their knowledge of programming during the development of their app and will have the opportunity to work with our partner technology experts for a fun and educational experience.

The competition extends to November 1, 2017, and students may participate either as part of a school assignment or on their own. Registration for the CAC takes place online, where students will submit their app along with a short demonstration video. The CAC website contains all the guidelines for the challenge: www.CongressionalAppChallenge.us. Additionally, there are resource organizations and companies listed on the website which offer professional volunteers whom will assist students in their coding and App Challenge journey. 

If you have any questions about participating in the Congressional App Challenge, please contact Diane Williams in the Granbury office at 682-936-2577 or Diane.Williams@mail.house.gov. I look forward to working with students, educators, and parents to expand computer science and STEM education efforts in the 11th District.

8/25/17 14:44,A Better Deal for the Heartland," 
News from Representative Bustos
￼
Dear Lindsey,
This week, I visited nearly every corner of our Congressional District to discuss our Better Deal for the Heartland economic agenda. A critical component of this work is getting input from hardworking families in our communities as we work collaboratively to develop regional solutions that will create more good-paying jobs and strengthen our local economy. Here are a few of the highlights from the week I would like to share with you: 
A Better Deal for the Heartland
￼
This week, I hosted a series of economic roundtables in the Quad-Cities, Peoria and Rockford to discuss our Better Deal for the Heartland plan and to generate new ideas. These discussions allowed us to bring together small businesses, manufacturers, educational institutions and local leaders across the 17th Congressional District to share the challenges they are facing as they work to create good-paying jobs in our communities. I’ll continue listening to their concerns and collaborating on policies that lead to better jobs, better wages and a better future for all Illinoisans.
Hearing Directly from Our Workforce
On Thursday, I held my 50th “Cheri on Shift” at AAR Corporation in Rockford, a leading provider of aviation services and a large employer in the community. “Cheri on Shift” is part of my on-going effort to visit local businesses and shadow workers at their job sites to hear about the issues that matter most to our families. During this discussion, I learned about AAR’s great workforce development efforts and their new facility in Rockford which will provide more than 500 good-paying jobs.
Fighting for Farmers
￼
As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, I’m committed to fighting for a Farm Bill that puts Illinois’ family farmers first. That’s why this month, I’ve been visiting farms across our Congressional District to hear their concerns and priorities as we gear up to write the next Farm Bill. One of my top priorities is securing a strong crop insurance program to give farmers the certainty they need to succeed in a 21st century agricultural economy.
As always, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office if we can be of assistance to you or your family.
 
Best, Cheri

Dear Friend, 
Governor Abbott has declared a state of emergency for 30 counties in advance of Tropical Storm Harvey’s arrival in the coming days. According to weather service models, the storm is expected to strengthen into a Category 3 hurricane before making landfall late on Friday and then slowly move up the coast. Here in our area, we can expect up to 10-15 inches of rain over the weekend. This is similar to what our region faced during the Tax Day and Memorial Day floods and we must be prepared.
We are not that far removed from the effects of Hurricane Ike that tore through our region in 2008. As Gulf Coast residents, we are no strangers to the devastating effects of hurricanes. We also know that early and thorough preparation is vital to minimizing the damage done and ensuring the safety of our community.    
Here are five tips from NOAA’s National Hurricane Center on how to best prepare for and survive a hurricane:
1. Know the difference between hurricane and tropical storm “watches” and “warnings.” A hurricane watch is a notification for residents to be on alert of a potential storm. Areas that are reported to have a storm warning are required to take immediate actions to safeguard life.
2. Keep emergency contact information handy. Phones numbers for local emergency management officers, local law enforcement, hospitals, utility service providers and insurance information are recommended to be kept nearby during storms.
 3. Pack emergency kits ahead of time. Packing essential items such as bottled water, snacks and canned foods are useful and at times, life-saving after storms frequently cause homes to lose gas and electricity. Items such as batteries for hand radios and flashlights are also helpful and difficult to find following hurricanes and tropical storms.
4. Prepare an emergency evacuation plan. Create a plan regarding where you can stay and temporary housing locations for your animals prior to a storm warning. In the event of an evacuation, follow FEMA’s Evacuation guidelines.
5. Stay alert in case of other natural disasters. The passing of the hurricane eye is not the end of a storm. NOAA warns that tornadoes, high winds and the possibility of a hurricane changing its course makes it important to remain alert following a storm.
The ReadyHarris App helps its users to stay prepared and protect their loved ones should an emergency occur.  
Here is how you download it:   Apple/iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/app/readyharris/id1038485677?mt=8    Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quickseries.Harris
Our county offices also have important local emergency management information if you need it. Here are links to TX-22 county emergency information - Fort Bend County,  Brazoria County, and Harris County.
Additionally, in the event of a hurricane or excessive flooding, my office stands ready to help. Should you need assistance please contact one of my Texas offices or my Washington office. Be safe and be prepared.
Very respectfully, Pete Olson

Longs Short Report  The importance of investing in childhood cancer research
By: Rep. Billy Long
While great strides have been made against cancer over the years, much more lies ahead to be done. Cancer affects most everyone, whether a friend, relative or even yourself, many have experienced its devastating effects. In the U.S. alone, approximately 15,700 children are diagnosed with cancer each year. The National Cancer Institute estimates that 10,270 children under the age of 14 will be diagnosed with cancer this year. While protocols have made great strides and survival rates have improved significantly still sadly 1,190 of these children wont survive. No child should have to go through this, and no parent should have to watch their child suffer. 
I recently cosponsored the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research (STAR) Act. This bill would expand childhood cancer research, enhance the lives of children who survive cancer and improve efforts of reporting childhood cancer. It also ensures children have access to compassionate use policies, which are treatments that are still in development.
By the time a child in the U.S. turns 20, one in 285 will be diagnosed with cancer. That statistic alone is reason enough to expand research for childhood cancer. However, there are challenges when it comes to accomplishing this. Limited resources and smaller population of cancer patients have drastically affected the amount of research thats available. The Childhood Cancer STAR Act would expand the National Cancer Institutes ongoing research efforts and collect vital information on children participating in clinical trials. 
This bill would also expand research and resources for children who survive cancer as they age. More than 95 percent of children who survive cancer will have a related health issue, such as a secondary cancer or organ damage, before the age of 45. Typically this is related to the cancer itself or the type of treatment they received. The Childhood Cancer STAR Act would increase research on aging childhood cancer survivors. It would also establish a pilot program that works towards establishing programs that care for cancer survivors as they age. 
Its equally important to make sure that childhood cancer is being properly monitored and reported. With limited research, every child matters. This bill would expand upon current efforts by authorizing grants to states to establish cancer registries that will help better track childhood cancer.
Finally, this bill would ensure a child has access to compassionate use policies. If a child is unable to receive treatment that works, they would have the ability to access treatment that is either still in development or outside the clinical trial setting. Over the last 37 years, fewer than 10 drugs have been developed for children with cancer.
The good news is in the U.S. alone more than 80 percent of children diagnosed with cancer become long-term cancer survivors. I look forward to increasing that percentage by passing bills like the Childhood Cancer STAR Act. I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure its passage in the House and the Senate and signed into law by the president.

It's been a busy August working in our district. As I travel around the North Country meeting with constituents, businesses, and community leaders, my offices continue working on behalf of constituents. I wanted to take a moment to share some important updates with you, just in case you missed them.
Newly Confirmed U.S. Ambassador to Canada, Kelly Knight Craft
￼
This month, the United States Senate confirmed Kelly Knight Craft to be our next Ambassador to Canada. In the North Country, we know that Canada is more than a bordering nation -- they are our neighbors, friends, and trading partners.  I look forward to working with Ambassador Kraft to further strengthen our special relationship with Canada, and to improve commerce and tourism between our two nations. Read more here.
Northern Border Regional Commission Infrastructure Grants
￼
I am pleased to announce significant grants awarded from the Northern Border Regional Commission will go a long way toward improving our North Country infrastructure. I’m proud that my office was able to help secure this necessary funding.  Infrastructure is critical to creating jobs and increasing economic opportunity, and I applaud the NBRC for their announcement.  Click here for my full statement.
FEMA Assistance to Firefighters Grants
￼
I am pleased to announce that two of our district’s fire departments have been awarded crucial grants under the AFG program, and I’m happy to support our district’s firefighters as they navigate the Federal grant process. To read more about the grants and to see which fire departments received them, click here.
Perkins Loan Extension Act Update
￼
Perkins Loans are an important resource for eligible students in our district who are pursuing their higher education dreams. I am pleased to announce that this month, my bill to extend the Federal Perkins Loan Program exceeded 80 cosponsors! I am excited that this legislation continues to gain momentum, and I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure this legislation gets brought up for a vote.

Afghanistan
President Trump delivered yet another disappointment in his address on Afghanistan Monday night. During his campaign, I found myself agreeing with two points candidate Trump made over and over – the need to tame Wall Street and the need to get out of Afghanistan.
 
As soon as he made his first appointments, it was clear to me Trump would not govern as he had campaigned relative to Wall Street, even though I suspected this would be the case.
 
Monday’s speech shows Trump has now also abandoned his promises about Afghanistan.  Instead of finding a way out, he committed the United States to remaining there during his entire Presidency, without any possibility of “winning” anything.
 
I voted to send American troops into Afghanistan in 2001 with a specific and achievable mission: to kill, capture and destroy the people who attacked America on September 11th - Al Qaeda.  That mission was accomplished long ago as far as Afghanistan is concerned.  No one ever suggested that America was embarking on a 20 year effort in nation building.
 
I know Al Qaeda and their off-spring and affiliates are not gone, but they have not been in Afghanistan in any large numbers for a long time.  The war against terror is not a static war confined by geography. The enemy moves amongst countries, blends into various societies, and emerges where and when they choose. I am not sure how to finally defeat this enemy, but I know it will not be done with large standing armies occupying foreign lands.
 
I recognize that, if the United States leaves Afghanistan, we may have to go back someday to continue the war against terrorism.  That may justify a fixed forward base in Afghanistan and maybe other countries as well.  It does not justify a never-ending territorial deployment of our forces who are putting their lives at risk or the billions of wasted dollars every year.
 
I am open to any suggestion to win the war against terror, but I know we cannot do it by occupying every country where terrorists hide.  I also know we cannot demand perfection against terrorists - otherwise we would be occupying England, France, Germany and virtually every country on earth.
 
Flexibility, tenacity, intelligence and commitment are the virtues we need to win THIS war -not tired old tactics that have been repeatedly proven failures.
 
It is long past time to bring our troops home and adjust our tactics and policies to address the realities of today’s war - not the history of yesterday’s wars.
 
A Note about President Trump Threatening a Government Shutdown
There is a whole volume of criticism to offer after President Trump’s rally in Phoenix Tuesday night. I’d like to focus on his threat to shut down the federal government if he doesn’t get money to build a wall along the Mexican border - despite declaring repeatedly on the campaign trail that Mexico would pay for this wall. The current federal fiscal year ends on September 30th. Republicans have made virtually no progress advancing legislation necessary to fund the government for Fiscal Year 2018, which begins on October 1st. 
This is not about immigration reform or debate over the most responsible way to secure our borders. This is about priorities. Trump is apparently willing to deliberately sabotage the government he was elected to lead if he doesn’t get his way. Make no mistake, this reckless threat prioritizes a border wall over health care, housing, transportation, community development, the Veterans Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and on and on and on. American families will be directly and negatively impacted by this – in every community in the country.   
Ruggles Station Transportation Project
I participated in a groundbreaking celebration for the Ruggles Station Transportation Project. Ruggles Station is a key component of our public transit system where commuters can access public and private bus lines, the commuter rail and the MBTA’s Orange Line. Station upgrades include new platforms as well as new elevators and improved busway access. The project is being partially funded by a $20 million federal Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Grant. It’s a great example of how targeted federal dollars can make huge improvements in American communities.  I am proud of my role in securing these federal dollars and look forward to celebrating again when the work is complete.
Greater Boston Fair Trade 
I met with representatives of Greater Boston Fair Trade (GBFT).  They are concerned, as I am, with the impact of trade agreements on human rights, including the right to organize and environmental safeguards.  I made clear that I am not a protectionist and believe trade can be beneficial - but it must be fair – not simply “free.”   The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was ratified before I was elected to Congress.  I voted against the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) and would not have supported the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).  I am open to negotiations with the European Union, whose laws and regulations are similar in most respects to our own.  GBFT also raised important questions about dispute resolution and the protection of national sovereignty.  They expressed serious concerns about the ability of investors to challenge local and national laws that protect workers and the environment. I appreciated their time and insight.
National Fire Protection Association
I met with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) President Jim Pauley and other organization members. The mission of the NFPA is to reduce fire related deaths and injury through training, education, research initiatives and other tools. The NFPA also explores ways to minimize the property damage and economic hardship that fires cause. We talked about several initiatives including one featuring Sparky the Fire Dog that helps teach children about fire safety. I also learned more about the organization’s work educating the construction industry on ways to improve workplace safety to better manage the risk of a fire. Their knowledge and dedication impressed me.
Iora Primary Care
I met with staff, patients and community members in the offices of Iora Primary Care in Hyde Park. They invited me for a coffee hour discussion to talk about what is happening in Congress. Iora Primary Care is a network of offices servicing patients 65 and older. Not surprisingly, we had a lengthy conversation about health care and the future of the Affordable Care Act. There is great concern that the push for full repeal will be revived once Congress goes back into session. I share that concern and am working with my colleagues to protect access to affordable care. Staffers shared their experiences with the ACA, both from an administrative perspective and through their work with patients. I also heard from patients about their experiences. Our discussion expanded to cover other work that Congress is focusing on, including the budget and transportation. I thanked them for their time and hospitality.
Greater Boston Food Bank
The Greater Boston Food Bank (GBFB) invited me to join them at the Ralph and Jenny Senior Center in Somerville where they operate the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP). The CSFP is a federal Department of Agriculture program that provides income eligible seniors with nutritious food. Many seniors who are on fixed incomes often have difficulty meeting their monthly budget and the CSFP helps ease the burden of their grocery bill. I helped distribute grocery bags and talked with GBFB staff about their work. I also talked with local seniors who are benefiting from this program and are concerned that the Trump Administration’s proposed budget cuts will jeopardize it. I assured them that I would do everything I can to preserve the CSFP.  
Our Revolution
I had a lengthy meeting with members of the activist group, Our Revolution, to talk about their legislative priorities. Constituents from almost every community in the 7th Congressional District came to discuss ways to advance a progressive agenda in these difficult times.  They are working to build support for several bills introduced in Congress this session.  They thanked me for supporting legislation establishing single-payer health care, raising the minimum wage and reforming the federal prison system.  After discussion with group members, they convinced me to also support making “motor-voter” registration federal law, to thwart any efforts anywhere in the nation to suppress the vote in communities of color. Members also advocated for legislation to make public higher education free.  While I certainly support this goal in principle, the legislation does not include a revenue source for what would be a multi-billion dollar expenditure. We had a frank and far-ranging discussion about our shared principles: freedom and justice, wider civic participation and equal opportunity for all our people. I thanked them for their commitment and their advocacy.
Behind the Curtain – More House and Trump Administration Actions You Don’t Want to Miss
Here are this week’s additions. If you need to catch up or share with friends, you can find the full list here:
141.     On August 21, 2017 the Washington Post reported that so far in 2017 Republican political organizations, including the Republican National Committee, have spent almost $1.3 million dollars in Trump owned entities.  The Trump International Hotel in Washington has been a big beneficiary of this money. Once again, this raises conflict of interest questions for the President, who refuses to divest from his businesses. 
142.     Sam Clovis, who is President Trump's nominee for the Agriculture Department’s Chief Scientist position does not appear to have any actual scientific experience. In addition to being concerned over his apparent lack of qualifications, Clovis also holds very troubling views on homosexuality. CNN reported in August of 2017 that just 5 years ago, Clovis was insisting homosexuality is a choice and LGBTQ individuals shouldn’t have the right of equal protection under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. He further argued that by legalizing same sex marriage, it was logical to project that pedophilia could be legalized. Clovis was a talk radio host and CNN reviewed his broadcasts as well as other primary source material as part of their report. 
143.     In August of 2017 the Department of the Interior directed the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine to stop work on a study assessing the health effects of coal mining on residents in Central Appalachia communities. There is broad scientific agreement that coal mining is damaging to the environment and has adverse health impacts. Interior Department officials stated that the termination of the study was related to Trump’s proposal to cut the department’s budget by 13%. Trump has long called for a revival of the coal mining industry. This decision ignores the impact of the coal mining industry on the environment and health of some of the poorest rural communities in the country.
What’s up Next Week
The House is in the midst of a district work period. The next votes are scheduled for Tuesday September 5th.

Dear Friend,

Hurricane Harvey is expected to make landfall as a Category 3 near Corpus Christi early Saturday morning. The 36th District will experience very heavy rain and potential life-threatening flooding over the next several days as the storm is expected to stall over Southeast Texas. I have been receiving briefings from federal, state and local officials on preparations for the storm and will continue to be in constant contact throughout the duration of the storm and its aftermath. I encourage everyone to heed warnings, take precaution, and avoid all high water areas. Our office is here to help in any way possible. Please do not hesitate to call my D.C or District offices. Please be safe.

￼

CANCELLED: Constituent Services Days in Buna and Kirbyville

Due to the storm, we have cancelled our Constituent Services Days in Buna and Kirbyville on Tuesday, Aug. 29th. We will notify constituents when a future date has been set. We apologize for any inconvenience.

Voluntary Evacuations in Texas 36

Chambers County - A voluntary evacuation order has been issued for Smith Point, Cedar Point, all RV parks, those living in unanchored mobile homes and other low-lying areas known to flood.

Harris County - A voluntary evacuation order has been issued for Nassau Bay, Shore Acres, Taylor Lake Village, Seabrook and El Lago.

A full list, including places outside the 36th District, can be found here.

￼

Dear friends,
As I travel across Idaho this month  meeting with folks in Coeur dAlene, Lewiston, Meridian and so many places in between  I hear a lot about what some people call kitchen table issues: jobs, the economy, education, healthcare, retirement security, etc; how we can make Idaho a more prosperous place to live, work, and raise a family. I dont hear a lot about whatever the national media is obsessed about these days. Never before has the disconnect between what regular Idahoans are focused on and what the DC elites are focused on been greater. 
And theres a reason for that: Idahoans, like most Americans, know our government is broken, especially at the federal level. We want reform. We demand reform. So it shouldnt be surprising when those who benefit from the status quo want to distract us from the reform agenda and get us talking about anything but what the people want and what our politicians were elected to do.
Take the economy, for instance. While the media refuses to talk about it, President Trump is making important strides in growing our economy and creating a better climate for job creation, investment, and innovation. Working closely with a Republican Congress, President Trump is creating the strongest American economy in at least 15 years. Consider:
·         So far this year, more than a million jobs have been added to the economy
·         Unemployment is at a 16-year low
·         Since President Trump was elected, the stock market has surged 19 percent
·         In 2017, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has set an all-time record 34 times
·         The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort measure recently reached a 16-year high
·         The National Association of Manufacturers Outlook Survey recently showed the highest two-quarter average for manufacturing optimism in the surveys 20-year history
·         According to Junes CNBC All-America Economic Survey, 54 percent of Americans think their home prices will rise in the next year.
This is not an accident. President Trump is taking a smart approach to the economy. He is trying to unleash the talent and ingenuity of the private sector by reducing the cost of government rules and regulations.
Specifically, he is using number of executive orders to reduce and shrink government power over the economy and unleash free enterprise. Among other things, President Trump has nixed or is in the process of reforming several Obama-Era regulations on land and water use that would have been especially detrimental to Idaho.  These include the Obama-Era power grabs pertaining to national monuments, sage grouse, and the so-called WOTUS Rule, (which affected puddles, ditches, and other water sources that have no connection to interstate commerce).
Congress is doing its part too. So far in 2017, the House has used the long-dormant Congressional Review Act (CRA) over a dozen times to repeal last-minute Obama administration regulations, most of which would be detrimental to the economy. Through CRA, we were able to eliminate the Bureau of Land Managements (BLM) Planning 2.0 Rule, which would have given federal bureaucrats and radical environmental groups control over land use and resource planning in Idaho and other Western states.I voted for every CRA bill that has been signed into law. 
I appreciate President Trumps commitment to letting government get out of the way so our citizens can grow our economy, and I will continue working closely with him to encourage new jobs, bolster American competitiveness, and expand opportunity.  
Thank you,
Congressman Raul Labrador

Hurricane Harvey Preparations
 

 
Dear Neighbor, 
As you know, Hurricane Harvey will make landfall late tonight. I have been briefed by the National Hurricane Center and the Harris County Flood Control District on the latest predictions for Hurricane Harvey. We should be prepared for extended heavy rainfall in the Houston area over a five to seven day period beginning this weekend. 
With this information, please be sure to stock up on food, water, and all other essentials. Driving through a flooded area can be extremely hazardous. As little as six inches of water may cause you to lose control of your vehicle. If you encounter floodwaters, please remember – turn around, don’t drown. 
For the most current and accurate information, I encourage you to rely on information from National Hurricane Updates, Harris County Flood Control District, and Ready Harris. Please pay particular attention to the flood gauges nearest your home, which can be found here.
As updates about the storm are released, I encourage you to follow the instructions of state, local, and federal officials. Please ensure you receive your updates on the storm from the Harris County Office of Emergency Management, local elected officials and agencies. Be careful of spreading stories on social media about the storm that may not be factual. I encourage you to monitor the following entities for current and relevant updates: 
	•	Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
	•	Ready.gov
	•	Ready Houston: Regional Disaster Preparedness
	•	National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
	•	Harris County Office of Emergency Management (HCOEM)
It is important to stay informed before, during and after a hurricane. You can sign up to receive weather and emergency alerts from Ready Harris here. Additionally, Ready Harris also has a free app for your mobile phone which is available for download. The app has preparedness tips as well as real time weather alerts, locates local emergency services and many other helpful guidelines.  
As always, my office is ready and able to help after any natural disaster. Once this storm has passed, my office works in conjunction with local, state and federal government officials to coordinate relief efforts. You can read more information about what assistance we can help with here. 
It is an honor and privilege to represent you and Texas in the United States House. 
Sincerely,  ￼  John Culberson

Blaine's Bulletin
  

For several years, I have discussed an Obama Administration program called Operation Choke Point in this bulletin. Today, I am incredibly pleased to report that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has informed me that this program will come to an end once and for all. 
You may recall that Operation Choke Point was an attempt by the former administration, specifically the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the DOJ, to intimidate financial institutions from offering services to certain licensed, legally-operating industries the Obama Administration did not ideologically like in an attempt to choke off those industries from our country’s banking system and run them out of business.
After learning of this unprecedented program, I sprang into action. The last four years, I have sent letters to and held meetings with FDIC and DOJ officials, engaged in conversations with other federal financial regulators and my colleagues in Congress, introduced legislation to end the program, and continuously kept the pressure on the Obama Administration here in the House of Representatives.
In early August, I joined several of my House colleagues, including House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, in sending a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Federal Reserve Board of Governors Chair Janet Yellen, and Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika calling on the Department of Justice to abandon this program. Days later, my colleagues and I received a response stating that the DOJ will end this ill-advised program.
I am incredibly pleased the DOJ finally made the right decision in terminating this unconscionable program, and it is my hope the federal banking regulators will immediately follow suit. Additionally, while this administration has made the right decision, it does not mean future administrations will continue to do so. Therefore, I will continue my efforts to ensure my legislation, the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act, is signed into law. My legislation dictates that agencies such as the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, among others, could not request or order a financial institution to terminate a banking relationship unless the regulator has material reason.
Operation Choke Point, while devastating to too many businesses, does demonstrate the importance of working together. Several years ago, I established an email address so people could share their stories of Operation Choke Point. Without input from consumers, small businesses and financial institutions, we would not have uncovered this initiative nor shut it down. This announcement is a true victory. It is reassuring to see that the Trump Administration’s Department of Justice understands its job is to pursue lawbreakers, not legally-operating businesses.

Share on Facebook | Share on Twitter | Permalink 
￼
UPDATE: Forever GI Bill Becomes Law
Rep. Murphy helped pass, and the President recently signed into law, an updated post-9/11 GI Bill, known as the “Forever GI Bill.” The updated law removed a 15-year restriction on the use of GI Bill education benefits so that our veterans may utilize them at any time over the course of their lives. The law also gives additional benefits to Purple Heart recipients and offers enhanced support to veterans earning a degree in science, technology, engineering or math (STEM). Rep. Murphy said she was proud to help pass the law through the U.S. House because it builds on the time-honored American tradition of serving those who serve our country.  
Championing Small Business Growth
Rep. Murphy recently held a small business roundtable at the National Entrepreneur Center in Orlando to discuss the challenges facing small business owners and entrepreneurs, particularly when it comes to access to capital. The roundtable consisted of representatives from various lending and business development organizations and from the small business community. The participants applauded Rep. Murphy's Microloan Modernization Act, which recently passed the U.S. House, and will help more small businesses and startups get critical loans of up to $50,000. The group further discussed ways to connect more central Florida small businesses to the capital that will help them grow and hire more workers.

Supporting Military Readiness
Rep. Murphy toured the Naval Ordnance Test Unit (NOTU) at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station last week, where she saw how innovative technology helps protect our service members and our country. These advances are key to deterring our adversaries and to keeping Americans safe from harm. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Murphy is supporting innovative technologies that strengthen our national security and improve America's capacity to respond to foreign threats.

Listening to Workers 
Rep. Murphy held a meeting of her Labor Advisory Board in her Orlando office last week for a conversation about the issues affecting working families in central Florida. The group raised concerns ranging from workplace safety for airport workers, to the modernization of agencies like the U.S. Postal Service, to the funding of our public schools. The Board consists of labor leaders who represent teachers, nurses, letter carriers, bus drivers, airport workers and many more. The group thanked Rep. Murphy for her willingness to listen. She also reiterated her support for bills that strengthen working families by raising wages and improving their quality of life.

My week in review: Honoring heroic actions of U.S. Postal Service Mail Carriers
￼
The U.S. Postal Service and its employees play a central role in the lives of those in rural America, enabling rural communities to get regular mail, prescription drugs, and other critical deliveries. Serving as a mail carrier in a rural community is about more than a job, it’s about a relationship with those they serve. Read on to hear why I presented two rural letter carriers from Minto and Drayton with awards for going above and beyond their daily responsibilities to help customers in need. 
Honoring local mail carriers herosim
In Fargo, I was honored to present Joshua Hefta from Minto and Meredith Gozdal from Drayton – both rural mail carriers -- with the Postmaster General Hero Awards. Rural mail carriers work every day for their customers, and North Dakotans know they won’t just get their mail, but will also have someone looking out for them each day. Joshua and Meredith are wonderful examples of that.
￼
Joshua assisted a 94 year old woman, Alice Paschke, who is a regular customer on his delivery route. He had been bringing the mail up to her house every day to help her. One morning in January, he knocked several times to deliver her mail, and she didn’t answer. He could hear someone moving around in the house and faintly heard her calling for help. Paschke lived alone and had fallen in her home 20 hours earlier, and she was unable to reach a phone to call for help. Joshua jumped into action and broke the door down to reach her and save her.
Meredith, who also received the award, noticed the mail of an elderly customer had piled up. She wanted to make that that customer was safe and called the house and checked the garage but didn’t receive a response. Eventually she called the police who broke down the door to find the elderly resident who was unresponsive and taken to the hospital. The resident survived thanks to Meredith’s due diligence and the fact that she realized something was wrong.

Celebrating the new home of my good friend and local veteran, Eric Marts
￼
Last Saturday, I was honored to join members of the Fargo community and the nonprofit, Home for our Troops, for the key turning ceremony of a new home for Eric Marts, a local wounded veteran who has been an inspiration to me and so many others across North Dakota. Click here to watch his story on WDAY-TV. I consider it to be some sort of fate that I met Eric back in 2013 when he participated in a discussion I held on veterans issues. I was so moved by him that I brought him to Washington to be my guest at the State of the Union in 2014. I greatly appreciate that Homes for Troops read about his trip to Washington and decided that they would build him a home suited to someone who is blind.
Ten years ago, Eric Marts joined the National Guard and was deployed to Iraq for 22 months. While on patrol outside Fallujah, he was hit by a roadside bomb that exploded. Eric survived, but the bomb fully blinded him. And now as a veteran, Eric uses his experience to help other veterans and to serve as an example that they can overcome whatever obstacles they face. Read more about his story and service here. 
I was inspired the first time I met Eric and continue to be inspired by him. Eric and his wife Bobbi are beyond deserving of this new home and it was a honor to be at the key turning ceremony for it and celebrate with them and the community.
Highlighting role of community health centers
￼
As part of Community Health Center Week last week, I toured Valley Community Health Centers in Grand Forks. For decades, Valley Community Health Centers has taken the lead to provide quality, affordable health care for low-income North Dakotans. It’s an example of what can happen when smart federal investments are made in our communities through Community Development Block Grants which support economic development, though the president’s budget would unfortunately eliminate this important program. The visit also reinforced why it’s critical to maintain federal programs that enable these health centers to operate and serve those in rural communities.
As the debate on health care continues, it’s also important to make sure Medicaid and other federal programs that rural clinics, like Valley Community Health Centers, rely on to operate remain strong. The Republican health care bill threatened to rip away Medicaid from thousands of North Dakotans, hurting health centers and their patients. But visiting clinics like this one reinforce why health centers are essential for communities across North Dakota.
Some of my favorites from social media
￼
I was humbled to be featured in the Hankinson News Monitor for its ‘Where Are They Now’ series. Growing up in the small town of Mantador where my family was one-tenth the population taught me a lot about supporting rural communities and helping out your neighbors – and that’s the same mentality I take with me every day to the U.S. Senate. Click here to read about the unexpected turns in my journey that got me to where I am today and my solutions-oriented approach to getting results for North Dakota and rural America.
￼
Following my two-day, seven-stop drought and Farm Bill tour across western North Dakota earlier this month, I outlined what I learned from folks on the ground, and what needs to be maintained and strengthened in the 2018 Farm Bill. Check out this video that includes stops on my drought and Farm Bill tour, and click here to read my post on Medium recapping the eventful two-days. 
￼
The newest episode of my podcast, ‘The Hotdish,’ focuses on the role immigrants, refugees, and New Americans play in our communities, how they support our towns, and what challenges they face as well as what challenges they pose for our towns. In the first interview, I spoke with Fowzia Adde, a refugee from Somalia whose incredible journey has led her to become a leader in the Fargo-Moorhead community for refugees and New Americans. I also spoke with Fargo Police Chief David Todd to hear about the department’s work to help integrate refugees and immigrants to the region. We also discuss Chief Todd’s recent widespread attention for his work to bring together a woman from Mapleton, ND and three Somali teenagers who were involved in a verbal altercation in a parking lot in Fargo that went viral. Listen to the podcast on SoundCloud, iTunes, or on my U.S. Senate website.

8/25/17 11:08,Beyond resistance: Ending the failed War on Drugs  ,"Update | Friday, August 25, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 28th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: ending the failed War on Drugs.
It’s past time to end the failed War on Drugs. Our country has spent more than a trillion dollars at home and abroad to stem the tide of drugs coming into our country. What did we get? The world’s largest prison population, a broken criminal justice system, and rampant opioid addiction in communities large and small. 
The drug war has been used as a tool to militarize the U.S. border, fuel racial profiling, and increase detentions and deportations. We don’t need more of the same. We need to reform our current drug laws, starting with the legalization of marijuana. We don’t need more punitive measures, but instead greater access to drug rehabilitation to help people struggling with addiction. 
While the United States is home to less than 5 percent of the world’s population, we have nearly 25 percent of its prisoners, due in large measure to the convictions of non-violent drug offenders and mandatory minimum sentences. The consequences of any drug conviction are life-long, severe, and disproportionately affect African Americans and Latinos. We need to end the failed practice of mandatory minimums and reform sentencing laws. 
We must also end the practice of civil forfeiture. This policy was designed to seize the property of drug kingpins. In reality, it allows law enforcement to seize private possessions without due process. Even before a guilty conviction, government agencies can legally confiscate property, and then keep it. In fact, under federal law (as well as many state laws) property can be seized and forfeited even when criminal charges are never filed against a property owner. I support H.R. 1551, the Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration Act, which reforms civil forfeiture laws and holds agencies accountable for the property they seize. This is an important step toward a more equitable criminal justice system. 
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage,

Lindsey --  From Washington state to Washington D.C., I'm always proud to represent the 7th District.  It is an honor to elevate your voices and fight for you every day. What our district has seen and knows to be true is the driving force for the policies I push for here in Congress.  In my support for a national $15 minimum wage, I am proud to be able to point to Seattle as a leader in that movement.  When I stand up and fight for environmental justice and legislation promising 100 percent renewable energy by 2050, I do so because Native and frontline communities, salmon populations, our Puget Sound and our maritime economy are all impacted by the adverse effects of climate change.  As the Senate debated a skinny version of health care that would have gotten rid of baseline insurance benefit standards and eliminated coverage mandates for individuals and businesses, I was able to point to the similar plan Washington had in the 1990s and know it would not work. When our state attempted this, our insurance commissioners office deemed it a death spiral.  Our district offers insight into policy and practice here in D.C., time and again. From the lessons learned by state legislation, to the constituents who write in, to the advocates I meet, our district is making change here in Congress.
Are you proud to live in our district?

Investigation: How many lives are lost to opioids? No one knows. 
The Tennessean
In 2015, state officials reported at least 1,451 men, women and children died from drug overdoses in Tennessee – but that's far from an accurate count. There are likely hundreds more. No one knows the true number.

Report says Appalachians’ health is ‘dramatically’ poorer than U.S. as whole

John Kelly’s Latest Mission: Controlling the Information Flow to Trump 
The New York Times
For months, the White House under President Trump operated with few real rules, and those were barely enforced. People wandered into the Oval Office throughout the day. The president was given pieces of unvetted information, and found more on his own that he often tweeted out. Policy decisions were often based on whoever had last gotten Mr. Trump’s attention.

At CIA, a watchful eye on Mike Pompeo, the president’s ardent ally 
The Washington Post
As CIA director, Mike Pompeo has taken a special interest in an agency unit that is closely tied to the investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, requiring the Counterintelligence Mission Center to report directly to him.

POLITICO
The veteran senator has mentored many senators — from both parties — to carry on his foreign policy worldview.

Gary Cohn, Trump’s Adviser, Said to Have Drafted Resignation Letter After Charlottesville

POLITICO
RACINE, Wis. — For all its power and prestige, the speaker of the House is one of the most thankless jobs in Washington — just ask John Boehner. Now, with Congress barreling toward major fiscal fights this fall, Paul Ryan is about to get a taste of the Boehner treatment — and then some.

Dear Lindsey, 
￼
￼
￼
There will be a Hurricane Preparedness Seminar this Monday, August 28, 2017, from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, at the Brookhaven Town Hall Auditorium, located at 1 Independence Hill, Farmingville, NY 11738, to provide residents with information regarding hurricane preparedness and recovery. 

As you know, Long Island homeowners and businesses were deeply impacted by Super Storms Sandy and Irene. This year, forecasters predict an above-normal hurricane season in the Atlantic. Hurricanes and tropical storms have the potential to cause serious damage to Long Island coastal and inland areas including storm surge, heavy rainfall, coastal and inland flooding, high winds, and tornadoes.

To help Long Islanders prepare for these types of storms, representatives from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), American Red Cross and Suffolk County Fire Rescue and Emergency Services (FRES), will provide information to help you prepare for, stay safe during, and recover from hurricane storm systems. Additionally, you will also learn how these organizations measure, track, and forecast hurricane activity. 

If you have any questions about this event, or would like to discuss any of this further in depth, please contact my office at (631) 289-1097. 


With Best Regards,
  ￼

Dear Friend,


Several important announcements concerning Hurricane Harvey:

- The Galveston “Kolaches with the Congressman” event, originally scheduled for this Saturday, has been postponed until September 9. As soon as we have more information, the event page on my website will be updated, and I will share the information across my various social media pages.

- Download the FEMA mobile app to set up alerts for the latest weather updates, shelter information, disaster resources, preparedness information, and safety tips, in English and in Spanish. The app provides a customizable checklist of emergency supplies, maps of open shelters and recovery centers, disaster survival tips, and weather alerts from the National Weather Service. The app also enables users to receive push notifications reminding them to take important steps to prepare their homes and families for disasters.
 
- According to the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Harvey brings the potential for prolonged heavy rains, flooding and a storm surge along the Gulf Coast. The storm is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 10 to 15 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches over the middle and upper Texas coast and southwest Louisiana through next Tuesday. Heavy rainfall begins as early as Friday morning.

- FEMA encourages individuals and families in the affected areas to continue to monitor local radio or TV stations for updated emergency information, and to follow the instructions of state, tribal and local officials. Additionaly, take inventory of your home and locate your flood insurance policy before the storm hits. Only enter areas that have sustained damaged after local officials have said it is safe to do so.

- Additional Resources May be Found Here:

Dear Neighbor,
All eyes are on Hurricane Harvey as it makes its way closer to Texas shores. Current weather reports expect the hurricane to reach category three levels, reaching Houston by Friday. Harris County is currently under a storm surge watch. Several schools across Texas 02 have already closed. Please follow local news and radio channels for other school district closures. A full list of current closures can be found here. My office stands ready to assist with answering questions, directing to resources and on-site assistance, and helping to navigate the FEMA process. 
To be prepared for high winds, rain and flooding, please take a moment to read through the following best practices: 
Prepare for Hurricane Harvey
	1.	Know your plan. Houston and Harris County Hurricane Evacuation Routes can be found here.   
	2.	Have a ""Go-Bag"" prepared, including a flashlight, batteries, cash, first aid supplies, medications, and copies of your critical information if you need to evacuate. Don't forget about your pets, pack pet food and water. 
	3.	Have a family emergency communication plan. Follow @ReadyHarris on Twitter and Facebook for updates on weather updates and emergency instructions or online at Readyharris.org 
	4.	Prepare your home and vehicles for high winds and water.  
	5.	Bring loose, lightweight objects inside that could potentially become projectiles in high winds. Cover your homes windows. 
	6.	Charge electronics and cell phones so you will have fully battery in case you lose power. 
	7.	Download Harris County's comprehensive plan here.
￼ 
During the Storm
	1.	Listen to local officials for updates and instructions.
	2.	Evacuate if necessary. 
	3.	Click here for a list of hurricane emergency contact phone numbers.
	4.	For Federal Emergency Assistance, please refer to the following sites: 
	a.	Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 
	b.	Ready.gov
	c.	Ready Houston: Regional Disaster Preparedness
	d.	Citizen Corps
	e.	National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
After the storm
	1.	Watch out for debris and downed powerlines
	2.	Avoid high flood waters. Turn around, don't drown. Flood waters can be electrically charged from underground or downed powerlines and my hide dangerous debris. 
	3.	Photograph your property in order to assist in filing an insurance claim. 
	4.	Do what you can to prevent further damage to your property.
	5.	Check in with family and friends by texting or using social media.
What Can My Office Do?
My office is always ready and willing to help in the aftermath of disaster; however, please note that we are not ourselves a relief agency. When a natural disaster occurs, my office works with federal, state and local government officials and tries to restore normalcy as fast as possible. However, preparedness is the best line of defense and the most efficient way to help return our community to normal in a timely manner.

Dear Friend,  Assisting my constituents is one of the best parts of my job as the U.S. Representative for Washington’s First Congressional District.  Take John, for instance. John, an Air Force veteran from Duvall, kept getting stonewalled for the past six years while trying to get the compensation he was owed from the Veterans Administration (VA). My office worked with him, and was able to secure the $239,000 in back pay and monthly increase in his benefits the VA owed him. John was even able to apply for additional grants to help modify his home and purchase a wheelchair-accessible vehicle. 
￼
There’s also the Collins family (at right). Erin and Austin Collins were adopting three siblings from the Philippines, when, near the end of the process, communication stalled. They reached out to my office, which was able to contact the U.S. Embassy in Manila to resolve the situation. Now, Denmar, John and Roquena are with their parents in Redmond!  And Dave from Mill Creek. The Social Security Administration (SSA) determined he was eligible to receive Social Security Disability Income, but he wasn’t receiving the money. My office contacted SSA to figure out what the issue was. Turns out, it was simply a misplaced number on his account, and we got it resolved so Dave is now getting the monthly benefit he was promised.  So whether you are returning home from military service, trying to adopt, opening a business or entering college, my office is here and ready to help you navigate federal agencies.  It's my job to listen to you and advocate on your behalf. If you have questions or comments about the topics that matter most to you, I encourage you to contact me through my website. I also invite you to stay connected with me by signing up for my e-newsletter. You may also stay up-to-date on my work through social media. My office is here to serve you, so please do not hesitate to contact us.  Sincerely, ￼  Suzan

Friend,

For too long, the three regimes of Iran, Russia, and North Korea have continuously threatened the peace and human rights of their neighbors and undermined American national security and democracy.

That’s why I voted for the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (H.R. 3364), which passed the House and Senate by strong bipartisan votes – and was signed into law by President Trump. There’s no silver bullet in these situations, but it’s critical that we utilize both economic and diplomatic tools to hold countries accountable when they act repeatedly and aggressively against our interest and our security. 

Yours in service,
￼

Dear Friend,
The last three months at the Capitol have seen significant developments on issues both domestic and international. It has also been extremely busy at my CA-33 district office where my staff has handled 888 constituent cases and held 74 events in Los Angeles. Below is an update on what has been going on in Washington D.C. for the past few months. You can also follow all my work on Facebook (www.facebook.com/RepTedLieu) and Twitter (www.twitter.com/RepTedLieu).  
Your voice in Congress, Ted W. Lieu
---
Rep. Lieu leads Congressional Progressive Caucus in introducing bold infrastructure and jobs plan
￼
America’s infrastructure is desperately in need of repair--this year, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated $4.6 trillion in infrastructure needs, of which more than $2 trillion did not have estimated funding. That’s why Ted, along with his Congressional Progressive Caucus colleagues, authored the 21st Century New Deal for Jobs. The plan is designed to supercharge the American economy by addressing our nation’s infrastructure needs and by creating millions of jobs without sacrificing protections for workers and the environment.
Rep. Lieu talks rising tensions with North Korea
￼
Ted, a member of the House Foreign Affairs committee, digs into the details of the ongoing crisis with North Korea over the rogue nation’s expanding nuclear arsenal.
Rep. Lieu speaks out on Russia’s attempts to undermine American Democracy
￼
Given disturbing revelations about a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and the Russians, Ted took to the House Floor to call attention to this grave issue and to call for full disclosure and accountability on the part of Team Trump.
Rep. Lieu stands up against cruelty to animals
￼
In May, Ted, along with eight other House Members, sent a letter to the Department of Veterans Affairs Inspector General, Michael J. Missal, raising concerns about the lack of transparency and accountability in the VA’s controversial dog research experiments. On June 9, the VA announced it was terminating the research program. In July, Ted co-sponsored a Department of Defense Appropriations Amendment (#21) to prohibit the Department of Veterans Affairs from spending money on any study that causes significant pain or distress to dogs. On July 27, the House passed Amendment 21.
Rep. Lieu confronts the humanitarian crisis in Yemen
￼
For the past two years, Ted has been at the forefront of an urgent mission to call attention to the death of civilians in the ongoing civil war in Yemen. Ted was honored that in mid-July, the House passed his Amendment (#93) to the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act to require the Departments of Defense and State to report to Congress on whether the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners are abiding by their commitments in Yemen and thereby reducing the risks of civilian casualties.

Dear Friend,
Do you have a federal tax problem that you havent been able to resolve with the IRS? My office can help!
Join my office for an IRS Problem Solving Day on Tuesday, September 12th from 12:00 PM to 4:00 PM at 223 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd., Suite 220, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360.
The Taxpayer Advocate Service  an independent organization within the IRS that protects your rights as a taxpayer and helps resolve tax problems you cant resolve on your own  will be on hand to meet with Ventura County residents to assist with ongoing tax problems. Our goal is to provide one-on-one guidance and direction on the next steps needed to help resolve these issues.  
This service is free, but space is limited and appointments are required! For more information or to schedule an appointment, please call my office at (805) 379-1779.
Cant make it to IRS Problem Solving Day? My district office staff can still help you.
As your Congresswoman, I am here to serve you. My office is available to help all of my constituents with federal agencies like the IRS. For example, Cassandra B. of Oxnard recently contacted my office for assistance with obtaining her tax refund, which she had filed for but still had not received for well over a year. My office contacted the IRS, and was able to help Cassandra receive her refund check expeditiously.
If you or someone you know needs assistance, please reach out to my office by calling (805) 379-1779.
Sincerely,
 
￼
Julia Brownley

8/24/17 14:33,Rep. Grothman Newsletter- In Loving Memory of My Dad,"￼ 
  

In Loving Memory of My Dad
My dad, Harold Warner Grothman, passed away on Tuesday, Aug. 22, 2017, at the age of 91. He was a loving husband to my mom, Joan, for 63 years, a caring father to his four children, a proud alumnus of the Badger Band and an American hero who served his country honorably in the U.S. Navy.

I will forever treasure the 62 years I spent with my dad. He instilled in me a love for country and Wisconsin, and never wavered in his support of his children as we pursued our dreams. He was one of my biggest cheerleaders throughout my career, and in life.

My dad was a wonderful man. I will miss him dearly.

8/24/17 12:30,Washington Thinks It Knows Better Than Wisconsin," 
￼
 

August 24, 2017
 
Dear Friends,
It's that time of year again for the kids of the northwoods to head back to school! One of the more fundamental things students across Wisconsin will learn about in their Social Studies classes is the genius of our federal system: our Founders knew that power should not be concentrated in Washington, and that individual states should be allowed to make laws that best meet the needs of their communities.
Sadly, when it comes to delisting the gray wolf, Washington Thinks It Knows Better Than Wisconsin.
Earlier this month, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled against the Obama Administration’s 2011 decision to delist the gray wolf under the Endangered Species Act. Just because wolves might not appear as a problem at environmentalist galas in Washington, they are a very real concern to farmers and ranchers in Wisconsin. This outrageous act of government overreach will continue to endanger Wisconsin livestock. Wisconsin farmers and ranchers deserve the right to protect their livestock and manage the Gray Wolf population.

Time For Tax Reform
Our current tax code is too complex and burdensome, and it kills American competitiveness against other nations with lower taxes. We can provide an instant jolt to our economy and create jobs right here in America by overhauling our tax code and leveling the playing field for American businesses.
I recently spoke on Fox News to discuss the need for massive tax reform. Click HERE or the image below to watch!

Dear Friend,  As our children return to school and families begin a busy fall, I want to keep you updated on what is ahead in Washington. Over the summer, I have enjoyed spending time in our community, meeting with small business owners and organizations that provide services to our most vulnerable neighbors, and hosting my 15th annual Senior Fair to share with senior citizens resources that are available to them. 
When Congress reconvenes in September, we will confront several looming deadlines. On September 30th, funding for the federal government will expire. Soon after, the Treasury Department will exhaust its statutory authority to issue government bonds, otherwise known as the “debt ceiling.” Funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which provides health care for nearly 9 million enrolled children, is also set to expire. 
Working families depend on essential services, like CHIP, so that they can strive for a better future for their children. Procrastinating on fulfilling our most basic obligations, like funding our government and maintaining access to needed services, is unacceptable regardless of which party is in power. I will continue to fight for timely passage of legislation to meet these important deadlines in the House of Representatives so that our community is not interrupted by needless partisanship. 
As a mother, I know that one of the earliest lessons we teach our children is to get their homework finished on time. We should expect the same from our nation's leaders.
Sincerely, ￼  Linda Sánchez Member of Congress 
￼

Washington Update
The Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
Since 1997, CHIP has helped families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to purchase private insurance, ensure their children receive quality health care. CHIP provides matching funds for states to administer health plans that cover children in this affordability gap. In California, CHIP funding allows children up to and including 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Level access to quality, low-cost health insurance through Medi-Cal. In his Fiscal Year 2018 budget proposal, President Trump proposed a 20 percent cut in CHIP funds over the next two fiscal years, in addition to harsh limits on federal support for state-run Medicaid programs. This short-sighted proposal would take away health care coverage for millions of children. I am determined to fight for robust funding for CHIP as Congress considers Fiscal Year 2018 appropriations. 
Government Funding and the Debt Ceiling
In May, the president signed a short-term extension of government funding, known as a continuing resolution, to fund the government through September 30, 2017. Every year, Congress must pass 12 regular funding bills, which often are packaged together in a larger “omnibus” bill. If Congress fails to reach an agreement on these bills, it must turn to continuing resolutions to maintain funding at current spending levels. If no action is taken, many portions of the federal government, including national parks, are shut down and federal employees are furloughed. 
Since 1917, Congress has statutorily limited the size of the federal debt. The debt limit prevents the Treasury Department from issuing any government bonds once the limit is reached. The failure of the Treasury Department to meet its obligations would place the federal government in default, and severely damage the full faith and credit of the United States, as well as send ripple effects throughout our entire economy. Managing the debt limit has been a non-controversial issue for most of the past century, but in the past decade, some members of Congress have tried to use the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip for their priorities. This brinkmanship does not benefit anyone, least of all the working families of our community. I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure our government pays its bills on time and remains open.

8/24/17 11:11,Beyond resistance: Reforming outdated cannabis laws,"Update | Thursday, August 24, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 27th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: reforming outdated cannabis laws.
Federal cannabis laws need to change. More than 95 percent of Americans now live in states or territories that permit, to varying degrees, legal access to medical marijuana and/or cannabis derivatives. Marijuana, however, is still treated the same as heroin at the federal level. This makes no sense.
Earlier this year, I established the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, a bipartisan forum for members to discuss, learn, and work together to establish a better and more rational approach to federal cannabis policy. This caucus is the first of its kind, and another sign of progress being made on Capitol Hill. I’ve also worked with Senator Wyden to introduce the most comprehensive marijuana legislation to date that would bring the federal government in line with the will of the American people. These bills would protect state marijuana laws and offer a responsible pathway for the legalization and regulation of marijuana.
Without congressional action, the discrepancy between state and federal law will continue a confusing patchwork of laws that trap businesses, patients, and state regulators in the middle. It’s time to reform our cannabis laws at the federal level.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

8/24/17 11:00,Bipartisan Reform to Overhaul VA Appeals Process Now Law,"Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email


￼


 
Dear Lindsey,
You and I know the current VA appeals process is confusing, redundant, inefficient and downright broken. 
Too many Wisconsin veterans are waiting too long – sometimes years – to hear back on their appeal. That is why I helped introduce the bipartisan Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 to overhaul the current process for veterans’ appeals at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
My VA reform expedites appeals before the Board of Veterans Appeals and gives veterans clear options after receiving an initial decision. Earlier this month, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 unanimously passed the House and Senate, and yesterday the President signed this bill into law. 
I am proud to have worked across party lines to pass the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, and I remain committed to ensuring our veterans receive timely decisions on their appeals so they can make the best decisions for themselves and their families.
Specifically, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 allows certain veterans already going through the appeals process to opt in to the new system and gives the VA secretary the authority to test facets of the new system prior to full implementation. 
The bill also requires the VA to provide a comprehensive plan for both implementing the new system and processing the existing appeals. Under the new process, veterans dissatisfied with the initial decisions on their claims will be able to:
	•	Seek a higher-level review by a regional office on the same evidence presented to the original claims processors
	•	File a supplemental claim with a regional office that would include the opportunity to submit additional evidence, or
	•	Appeal directly to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals, resulting in a possible hearing and/or the opportunity to submit additional evidence
Too many Wisconsin veterans have already waited too long. I will continue my work across party lines to fix the VA appeals process, and provide timely decisions for our veterans. 
Sincerely,
￼
U.S. Senator for Wisconsin

8/24/17 10:16,I'm glad to be back in Nevada ,"  
￼
Hello Lindsey, 
The last few months in Washington have been busy as I continue to work on issues important for Nevada families. In addition to continuing the fight to raise wages for hardworking Nevada families, and defend Yucca Mountain from becoming a dumping ground for nuclear waste, my team and I have been working on some key pieces of legislation that will benefit all Nevadans.
Here is a quick recap of my work over the last couple of weeks. 
EDUCATOR PREPARATION AND REFORM ACT 
￼
Last week, Senator Jack Reed and I introduced the Educator Preparation Reform Act (H.R. 3636) which would modify federal laws governing teacher preparation, including reporting requirements, accountability provisions, and the TEACH Grant scholarship program. As a product of the Clark County public schools, making sure all Nevadans have access to a quality education is not only one of my top priorities but important to me personally.  If we want to guarantee our kids have a strong foundation, we must provide teachers, principals, and other educators with the tools they need - a comprehensive system that supports their preparation, professional growth, and development. 
AMERICAN HOPE ACT 
￼
On July 28th my colleagues from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and I introduced the American Hope Act of 2017. The bill would provide a permanent solution for young people enrolled in DACA and put thousands of others on a path to earn permanent legal residency. The American Hope Act is the first step in fixing our broken immigration system.  
EASTERN NEVADA ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND LAND MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT 
￼
During one of the final voting sessions, the House Natural Resources Committee passed my bill, the Eastern Nevada Economic Development and Land Management Improvement Act (H.R. 2374). This bill makes changes to existing land bills to spur economic development in Clark, Lincoln, Nye, and White Pine counties. Creating an environment where businesses can succeed is an essential part of building a strong and diversified Nevada economy. 
Your Congressman, 

Ruben

Court order to remove Gallatin coal ash would cost TVA $2 billion, impact other coal plants  Chattanooga Times Free Press KNOXVILLE — The Tennessee Valley Authority ""is very likely"" to appeal a federal court order that the utility dig up and remove coal ash stored for decades at its Gallatin coal plant in Middle Tennessee, TVA President Bill Johnson said Thursday.
Federal judge throws out Texas voter ID law — again  The Associated Press AUSTIN — A federal judge Wednesday again threw out Texas’s voter ID requirements she previously compared with a “poll tax” on minorities, dealing another court setback to state Republican leaders over voting rights.
Science envoy resigns over Trump's Charlottesville comments  ABC News One of the State Department’s science envoys has announced his resignation on Twitter, citing President Trump's ""attacks on core values of the United States.""
Trump-Congress conflict escalates  The Washington Post The conflict between President Trump and Congress escalated a day after he threatened to shut down the federal government over funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall as well as targeted opponents in Congress, aggravating tensions as a difficult legislative agenda looms.
Is a Government Shutdown Inevitable?  The Atlantic President Trump’s threat at his Phoenix rally set up a fight over funding for a border wall that Republican leaders don’t particularly want—but may not be able to avoid.
Military Transgender Ban to Begin Within 6 Months, Memo Says  The New York Times WASHINGTON — President Trump is preparing to give the Defense Department formal authority to expel transgender people from the military in an upcoming order, barring the Pentagon from recruiting transgender troops and cutting off payment for sexual reassignment surgery and other medical treatments for those already serving.
Analysts: More troops means billions more in war costs  The Washington Post President Trump said the U.S. commitment to Afghanistan was “not a blank check,” but his decision to send more troops will add billions of dollars a year to the already-towering war costs, which have topped $1 trillion in Afghanistan alone over the past 16 years.
Top Trump aide's email draws new scrutiny in Russia inquiry  CNN Congressional investigators have unearthed an email from a top Trump aide that referenced a previously unreported effort to arrange a meeting last year between Trump campaign officials and Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
Trump clashed with multiple GOP senators over Russia  POLITICO President Donald Trump privately vented his frustration over Russia-related matters with at least two other Republican senators this month, according to people familiar with the conversations — in addition to the president's public admonishments of Mitch McConnell, John McCain and Jeff Flake.
The Republican Establishment Stands Behind Trump  The Atlantic President Trump’s response to the deadly white-supremacist protests in Charlottesville earlier this month sparked a fierce national backlash, drawing rebukes from elected officials, corporate executives, military leaders, clergy, and—according to a new poll—a majority of Americans. But it appears there’s at least one influential group that Trump can still count on for support: the institutional Republican Party.                                      Sincerely, ￼  Jim Cooper

Congressman Smith's E-news: August 23, 2017
   ￼   I hope you all had the opportunity to (safely) view the eclipse on Monday! Andrea and I watched from Five Rocks Amphitheater in Gering, where we also enjoyed visiting with former Mayor Doug Leafgreen and his wife, Melody. It was an experience we will not soon forget, and exciting to welcome so many visitors to Nebraska!  
NAFTA talks must prioritize U.S. agriculture   Talks began in Washington, D.C., on August 16 among trade officials from the United States, Canada, and Mexico on modernizing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This has caused understandable concern for producers, but if the U.S. maintains the right priorities in these negotiations, the agriculture industry can benefit from an updated agreement.  Due to the efficiency and productivity of American agriculture, we produce more than we consume. Trade is vital to the health of the industry, and we should be doing everything we can to increase opportunities for our producers to feed the world.  U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is a strong, knowledgeable representative for U.S. interests in NAFTA negotiations. Ambassador Lighthizer has appeared before the Ways and Means Committee at multiple hearings and meetings in recent weeks, and each time he has made clear how well he understands the importance of NAFTA to U.S. agriculture.  There is good reason to be cautious in revising this agreement. Canada and Mexico are not only our neighbors but also two of our top trading partners, representing billion-dollar export markets for Nebraska’s farmers and ranchers. Since NAFTA went into effect, U.S. trade with these two nations has more than tripled. With producers facing low commodity prices and other challenges, we cannot afford to cause further harm by negating the gains made under NAFTA.  Canada is the largest export market for U.S. agriculture products. In 2016, U.S. agriculture exports to Canada totaled $23 billion. Bilateral trade between Nebraska and Canada totals $1.9 billion a year. In 2015, Nebraska also exported more than $1.2 billion in goods to Mexico. Last year, Mexico was our country’s third-largest export market for agriculture products at $18 billion.  Since the Trump administration first discussed its intentions for NAFTA, I have said there is nothing wrong with taking a fresh look at a nearly 25-year-old agreement to see what has been working and what could use some updating. However, the current market access granted to U.S. exporters must be the baseline for renegotiation.  There are opportunities to strengthen NAFTA and expand economic gains for agriculture. Biotechnology is one of the greatest advancements in the industry, allowing producers to increase yields while using fewer finite resources. In the years since NAFTA was negotiated, biotechnology has expanded significantly. A modernized agreement should include updated standards based on sound science for these products.  Removing existing barriers to trade must remain the top priority for negotiators, rather than creating new ones. Our trading partners should be assured quality U.S. products will remain available and affordable for them, with the focus on increasing opportunities for U.S. exporters.  Overall, we must move through this process quickly. The Trump administration has targeted an early 2018 completion, and I am hopeful the negotiations will stick to this timeline. U.S. producers and our trading partners need certainty and as little disruption as possible.  I join with producers in Nebraska and across the country in watching closely as NAFTA negotiations continue. In my role on the Ways and Means Committee, which has congressional jurisdiction over trade policy, I will keep working on removing barriers and opening more markets for U.S. agriculture products.   Argentina agrees to open market to U.S. pork   Also on the topic of trade, Nebraska agriculture received good news last week when the Trump administration announced an agreement to restore trade access for U.S. pork to Argentina for the first time since 1992.   It is great to see this administration continuing to open more markets to producers. In June, U.S. beef producers gained access to China’s market, bringing an end to a 14-year ban. Now, our pork producers can sell to Argentine consumers for the first time in 25 years.   I applaud these efforts to bolster U.S. agriculture. It is vital we continue working to increase market access for producers.   Meet with me next week   It's been a busy August traveling the Third District.

From the Hill to the Mountains
Federal Assistance for Flood-Impacted Communities 
Last week, I was pleased that President Trump issued a major disaster declaration for West Virginia following the July 28-29 flooding that impacted several of our counties, communities, businesses and residents in the Northern Panhandle and North Central regions. This declaration allows immediate assistance for individuals and their homes in the most affected counties, as well as public assistance for several other areas – allowing for assistance for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. 
This means FEMA is now officially on the ground helping people, businesses and communities as they work to recover and rebuild. And yesterday, we got word that U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will speed federal disaster assistance to support homeowners and low-income renters who were forced from their homes.
Following the flooding, I visited with impacted residents in Hundred, McMechen, Wheeling, Farmington,  Littleton, Rachel and Mannington. As a result of these conversations and several visits by my staff, my casework team has taken in well over 400 flood-related cases. We’re helping individuals and families as much as we can, and will continue to be a source of help and support as recovery continues. 
West Virginians across the flood-impacted counties in Northern West Virginia – including Wheeling residents who also dealt with earlier flooding that began on July 23 – need our ongoing support and prayers. This disaster declaration is a huge step in the right direction, and I will continue to do everything in my power to help these communities grow stronger every day. 
On the Road
Old-Fashioned Town Hall
I was honored last Friday to host an Old-Fashioned Town Hall meeting at the West Virginia State Fair.  More than 100 people stopped by to discuss healthcare, Veterans issues, jobs and much more. I always enjoy hearing from my fellow Mountaineers and I appreciate everyone who came to join in the discussion. 
￼
The State Fair is one of my favorite events of the entire year and, prior to the Town Hall, I had the opportunity to tour the fairgrounds, eating delicious food and visiting with my fellow West Virginians. I'm already looking forward to next year!

With UN Forces on top of Golan Heights.  Not many miles from where Syrian forces and insurgents are confronting each other and approximately 40 miles from Damascus.  With ISIS slowly being pushed back, we are seeing an ascendent Iran and Hezbollah presence in Syria.  

Back in DC (or rather, Camp David)
Last week, President Trump headed to Camp David with his military advisors to discuss strategy in Afghanistan. This week, he shared with the nation that we will not withdraw from Afghanistan and I couldn’t agree more. I support the President’s goal in Afghanistan to seek an honorable and enduring outcome through a properly equipped, well trained military with a clear mission.
If we pull out of Afghanistan, we’ll have to invade it again to defeat the Taliban, al Qaida, ISIS and other Sunni Extremists, just like we had to do in Iraq after President Obama’s disastrous withdrawal in 2011.  We are still paying for that terrible decision.  The Taliban currently controls approximately 45% of Afghanistan’s territory, but they always know American forces can target them from the air or ground with no notice.  The goal of our operations in Afghanistan should be to ensure the Taliban cannot use this territory to export terror to our shores like they did on 9/11.  We should also realize that it is up to the Afghans to build the society and culture they want, and that we will not be able to refashion their culture into any kind of democracy that we can easily identify with.
But, the strategy on Afghanistan wasn’t the only matter addressed at Camp David.  This past Friday the President signed into law HR 873, which authorizes the creation the National Global War on Terrorism Memorial in the District of Columbia.  As a veteran of this long war, I was a proud co-sponsor of this legislation but am mindful of what this monument signifies.  During my military service, I had to tell families about the loss of their loved ones numerous times and it was not an easy task.  While this memorial will recognize the brave men and women who served and sacrificed so much fighting terrorism, monuments alone are not enough to honor these patriots or their families.   Our nation owes a debt of gratitude to veterans of all our wars that we can never repay in full.

Visiting OPPD’s methane digester at Elk City. It powers 4,000 homes!
So far in August Recess
Since returning from DC, I’ve had a busy three weeks in the district and in Israel. Before I left for Israel, I had 21 different events where I met with constituents about a variety of topics; visited businesses to see how they operate and hear their concerns; and updated the community through the media on legislation and my work in DC. During the first week in the district, I hosted Chairman Steve Chabot (OH) of the House Small Business Committee who met with local small business entrepreneurs. I was also able to spend some time in the shoes of employees of UPS, which employs 5,000 people in the area. I also visited Project Harmony, which makes an enormous impact on the lives of so many children.
From Omaha, I headed to Israel on a delegation trip of freshman Members of Congress led by Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. While there I heard from an Israeli serviceman who talked about his actions to protect an innocent family being stabbed in a terrorist attack. This man’s courageous and immediate action helped save the lives of three of the family members who were being unmercifully attacked. The assailant was wounded and imprisoned, but he will still receive approximately $37,000 annually from Palestinian Authority while the United States subsidizes 11 percent of their budget. The Taylor Force Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor, will ensure that no money goes to Palestinian Authority until they stop permitting these acts of aggression. I also met with Brigadier General (Reserves) Nitzan Nuriel on the Israel-Lebanon border. He did a great job describing the Hezbollah threat in Southern Lebanon. I visited the border near Damascus, where Syrian forces and insurgents are confronting each other. With ISIS slowly being pushed back, we are seeing an ascendant Iran and Hezbollah presence in Syria. I was fortunate to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and United States Ambassador to Israel David Friedman.  Prime Minister Netanyahu spent about an hour and half with us, and I appreciate his moral clarity and transparency.
While in Israel, I was disheartened by a text from my staff around midnight informing me about the reports of racial violence in Charlottesville, VA. I immediately got up and tried to read and gather as much information as I could about what was happening.
I hate racism and find white nationalists and Nazis repugnant.  I believe God created us all in his image and command we love one another. Our nation was founded on the promise that we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights. Racism in any form is despicable and it should be rebuked. Eradicating racism and bigotry shouldn't be a divisive political issue, but one we all should get behind and support.  We must address ongoing racial disparities in areas such as employment and education, among other issues.  I also believe violence against our fellow citizens should also be rebuked.  We’re seeing racist and politically motivated violence and it must stop.  I commit to handling myself with civility and to lead by example when it comes to respectful communications.
Since I’ve been back in the district, I have visited with many groups of constituents. Last Friday, I spent the day learning about the diverse energy portfolio we have in the Second Congressional District. I started the day off by hosting an employee town hall at Green Plains, Inc., where we talked about the importance of ethanol to Nebraska’s economy. I followed that up with a visit to a couple of OPPD’s facilities and learned about its diverse energy portfolio that includes clean coal, natural gas, methane gas and renewables.  Joe McClelland, Director of the Office of Energy Infrastructure Security-a division of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, joined me at a forum with energy leaders to discuss energy infrastructure security. I was also able to see where electricians are trained to work on wind turbines at the Omaha Joint Electrical Apprentice Committee. We wrapped up the day with a visit to a CNG (compressed natural gas station) located near Werner Enterprises. I learned how to fill a CNG tank and we talked about the benefits of this clean fuel.
In addition to energy being a major sector in the district, urban ag is growing in popularity. Many people think it is gardening, but it is growing crops for a profit in an urban setting. Many of the companies sell the crops to local restaurants. Not only does urban ag promote healthy it also boosts the local economy. The doors aren't even open yet and Whispering Roots, Inc.  is already moving the needle on STEM education, careers in Ag, and economic development. 
During the rest of the August recess I plan on meeting with as many constituents as possible. I am hosting a public town hall at Omaha North High School on Saturday, August 26 from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. I am looking forward to hearing from the residents of North Omaha on a variety of issues related to their community. I am also hosting a Paths to Success: Education Fair that same day from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. at Mercy Hall - Warde Conference Center, at Omaha’s College of Saint Mary, 7000 Mercy Road. Local high school students, home-schoolers, parents, and GED seekers will learn about resources for accessing and affording higher education. Those wishing to attend this free event must register in advance as space is limited. http://ow.ly/3fL330e8Y96

Opioid Emergency Declaration Overdue

 ￼
  ￼
  ￼
  ￼
Ohioans don’t need a declaration to tell them the opioid crisis is a national emergency. Many of them are living this nightmare every day.  
This month, after the White House Commission on Combatting Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis unveiled formal recommendations to address the opioid epidemic, President Trump finally announced he would declare the opioid crisis a “national emergency.”  
While the President’s declaration is a step in the right direction, there’s more work to be done here.  
By declaring the opioid epidemic a national emergency, the Trump Administration can now take important steps that I’ve called for to address the crisis, many of which are recommended by the president’s commission.  
In May, I introduced bipartisan legislation with Sen. Portman that would eliminate the 16 bed cap on the number of beds substance abuse treatment facilities are allowed to cover under Medicaid. The Commission report revealed that this is one of the quickest ways to get people into treatment. And at roundtables I’ve held around Ohio, I’ve heard from local experts who agree. 
The report also includes prevention recommendations to increase access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) and naloxone, an overdose reversal drug. I am continuing to call on the Trump Administration to boost funding, so that our first responders can maintain their supply.  
And finally, I couldn’t agree more with report recommendations to provide more resources to Customs and Border Patrol to keep the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl out of the U.S. I’ve teamed up with Sen. Portman on a pair of bills that would do just that. The INTERDICT Act, which I introduced, would provide Custom and Border agents with additional resources to screen for fentanyl safely and effectively, and Sen. Portman’s STOP Act, which I support, would help detect the drug. 
Recently I met with Chuck Rosenberg, Acting Administrator at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), about reducing the amount of opioid pills allowed to be manufactured and sold in the United States. After our meeting, the DEA announced a proposal to reduce production of prescription opioids by 20 percent. 
Again, another step in the right direction.
Our law enforcement officers are doing the best that they can, but they’ve told me we cannot arrest our way out of this problem. We all need to work together to keep these drugs out of our communities.
I’m glad President Trump’s commission is recommending steps to address this crisis. The president needs to follow through with the actions to get this epidemic that is ravaging Ohio communities under control.

Utilizing the U.S. Census Bureau Data 

Dear Friends,
The U.S. Census does a lot more than just count people every decade. The Census Bureau is the clearinghouse for information that tracks much of what we know about the economy, education, housing, emergency preparedness, poverty and employment. In addition, Census data is often used to determine income eligibility for many federal programs.  
When I was first elected to Congress, business leaders in Albuquerque met with me to point out a mistake in Census data that was bogging down their efforts to develop a Downtown property. I worked with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to fix the mistake and make the development and surrounding area eligible for more than $12.5 million in low-income housing tax credits. 
As a result, we now have a vital economic development project,
￼
the Imperial Building, which provides Downtown with affordable housing and access to the area’s first locally owned grocery store, Silver Street Market. Please join my office this Friday, August 25th at 11 am to celebrate the Market’s one year anniversary.

￼


 
Dear Lindsey,
After repeated requests from Senator Baldwin, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has finally released the Brandon Road Study to the public.This study lays out the Army Corps’ recommended plan to block Asian carp that are in the Mississippi River basin from reaching Lake Michigan.
“I’ve been sounding the alarm on the threat Asian carp pose to our Great Lakes, our quality of life in Wisconsin and our freshwater economy,” said Senator Baldwin. “The release of the Brandon Road study is a crucial step towards preventing Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes. I am pleased the Army Corps has finally released their plan and following stakeholder input, we must act swiftly to implement it.”
As a member of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, Senator Baldwin worked to pass legislation directing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to proceed with the study recommending specific measures to prevent Asian carp from getting beyond the Brandon Road Lock and Dam - a crucial chokepoint in the Chicago waterway system.
The Brandon Road Study was originally set to be released at the end of February, but was delayed by the Trump Administration.
In April, Senator Baldwin sent a letter to President Trump urging that the report to be issued immediately. With the report still delayed, Senator Baldwin worked across party lines to include a provision that directed the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed with the Brandon Road Study in the bipartisan omnibus funding legislation that was signed into law in May. 
In June, Senator Baldwin also introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation, the Stop Asian Carp Now Act, that would have required the Trump Administration to release the Brandon Road Study within seven days of the bill’s enactment.Then in July, she secured an amendment in next year’s spending bill to require the study be released.
Read a copy of the Brandon Road Study and submit your comments on the report here.

In 2017, it's unacceptable that 61 percent of rural Missourians lack access to broadband. Without high-speed internet, students, teachers, health care providers, and small business owners in rural areas are at a competitive disadvantage compared with people who live in bigger towns and cities. 
That needs to change. 
Unfortunately, the government has directed limited resources to expand broadband in cities and other urban areas that already have acces. Some of these places even have multiple providers. 
From the State Fair to the Senate floor, I've voiced my commitment to eliminating this digital divide and ensuring rural Missouri communities have the same opportunities to grow, compete, and succeed. 
￼
There is good news for Missourians. Federal Communications Committee (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai, who was appointed by President Trump, is taking positive steps to expand access to broadband. 
I'm pleased that Chairman Pai took action after I urged him to make available $2 billion in funds for rural broadband, and to open this money up to auction so new entrants in this field could competitively bid. The FCC is also working to expand mobile wireless service to rural areas and reduce costs for companies upgrading from copper to fiber optic networks. 
There is, however, a lot more that needs to be done. I hear from Missourians all the time who are frustrated with the lack of broadband acccess. If your family or business has been affected, I hope you'll share your story with me on my website at blunt.senate.gov so I can make sure your voice is heard. 
As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I look forward to continuing to work with Missouri families and communities, my colleagues in the Senate, and the FCC to bring high-speed internet to every corner of Missouri. 
You can join the conversation by sharing your thoughts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 
Sincere regards,
￼

Poll: Debt Limit
 

Today, the United States’ national debt is over $19 trillion. According to a recent report from the Congressional Budget Office, if the debt limit remains unchanged, the Treasury will run out of funds in mid-October. Because of this impending deadline, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been urging lawmakers in Congress to lift the debt ceiling, which is a limit on the amount of money the U.S. government can borrow.

Supporters of lifting the debt ceiling believe that another option, defaulting on the nation’s debt, would lead to a deep recession. Critics believe that further increasing the debt limit is unsustainable for future generations of Americans. 

Question of the week: What action do you think Congress should take regarding the debt ceiling?

[_] Don’t raise it.  We cannot keep borrowing money to pay our bills.
[_] Raise it. We cannot default on our debt.
[_] Raise it with the condition that future spending is decreased.
[_] Raise it with the condition of entitlement reform.  
[_] I don’t know.
[_] Other (share your thoughts). 

Take the poll here.

News from Representative Lee Zeldin

Dear Lindsey, 
￼
￼
￼
Throughout August, as part of my NY-1 Economic Growth Tour, I have been touring NY-1’s businesses, large and small, to meet with employers and employees and discuss their top priorities to grow their businesses here on Long Island and create more good paying, private sector jobs. Throughout the tour, I have had the opportunity to meet with many of our area’s employers and their workforce to discuss ways we can improve the business climate and allow local commerce to flourish.   On the first stop of my NY-1 Economic Growth Tour, I visited Cobham in Hauppauge. Cobham is a defense and aerospace manufacturing firm that employees 136 workers, many of whom are NY-1 constituents. One of many great products it manufactures, this facility designs and builds actuators, advanced technology used for the Mars rover Curiosity. We discussed how we can work together to grow our local economy, as well as the need for STEM programs in order to best educate our students for generations to come. Read more here. 
￼  Rep. Zeldin is pictured above speaking with employees at Cobham discussing health care
My second stop was at Positive Promotions in Hauppauge. Positive Promotions is a Long Island-based manufacturer of custom promotional products, which employs over 500 people, including many NY-1 residents. During the visit, which you can read about here, I toured the company’s operations and met with the employees who keep the company running on a day-to-day basis. I also met with management personnel, where discussions included the negative, unintended economic impacts of certain governmental tax and regulatory policies. 
￼  Rep. Zeldin is pictured above, right, with Nelson Taxel, owner of Positive Promotions discussing federal economic policy
My third stop was at Finish Line Technologies in Hauppauge, a manufacturer of bicycle lubricants and care products, such as chain lubricants, drivetrain degreasers, and specialty suspension and brake fluids. During the visit to Finish Line, which employs 40 Long Islanders, I toured the manufacturing facility and met with Finish Line management and staff. We also discussed policy issues of importance to the bike industry, including infrastructure investment, which you can read more about here. 
￼  Rep. Zeldin is pictured above, right, during the Finish Line tour discussing policy issues relating to the bike industry
This month, I also hosted Mobile Office Hours at the Mastic Fire House in Mastic and Smithtown Fire Department in Smithtown, where I was able to meet with many NY-1 constituents to discuss a wide range of issues, such as the National Flood Insurance Program, veterans’ affairs, and health care. You can read more about these events here, and here, or by clicking the FiOS1 video below. 
￼
My days have also been filled with great meetings with so many constituents who have requested time together to discuss issues, which have spanned the ideological spectrum. These are meetings with constituents who have requested one on one time to discuss issues of importance to them.   In my Patchogue office, I held several meetings, speaking with the New York State School Boards Association (NYSSBA), National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and many other NY-1 constituents, pictured below, which you can read more about here. Topics of discussion during the meetings ranged from scientific research, animal abuse, healthcare, education, and much more.   I also recently met with braiNY Long Island members, pictured below, about recent advancements in neuroscience and the importance of maintaining neuroscience research funding. The organization is a nonprofit group that advocates on behalf of scientists and researchers, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology groups involved in the neuroscience field. Read more here. 
￼
I am always willing to work with absolutely anyone to move our country forward, no matter what your ideological background is, and I welcome any opportunity to engage in substantive, productive dialogue.   With Best Regards,   ￼  Lee Zeldin  Member of Congress

￼
Dear Friend,
In order to preserve the history and sites related to the African American struggle to gain equal rights as citizens in the 20th Century, the National Park Service (NPS) has committed to providing over $12millon in FY 2017 through the African American Civil Rights Historic/Preservation Grant to assist in the archival of documents and maintaining the structural integrity of buildings. Last year, Alabama organizations were awarded nearly $1.5million through the African American Civil Rights Preservation Grant to protect three sites across the state, including two within the 7th Congressional District. My hope is to increase the number of grant recipients in our district and to preserve the history of the African American struggle for equal rights for generations to come.
African American Civil Rights Preservation Grant
Quick Facts:
	•	Funding Opportunity  Number: P17AS00578
	•	Estimated Funding: $8,400,000

	•	Cost Sharing or Matching  Requirement: No
	•	Current Closing Date: Sept 29, 2017  11:59 Pacific Daylight Time
To have a successful application, organizations will need to focus on creative projects with measurable results that will make sure that projects are available to the public for years to come. The projects should be public-private partnerships that will ultimately serve as a model to communities in the future. The three categories for the history grants are: Survey and Planning, Research and Documentation, and Interpretation and Education. Your project does not necessarily have to be just one category; your project could include aspects of all three. 
Click here to read the National Park Service’s Fact Sheet on these two grants. 
I believe there are several projects in this district that could greatly benefit from these grants. Whether you are trying to preserve a church or trying to educate future generations, these grants are available to any non-profit organization working to educate and preserve the African America Civil Rights struggle. If you have any questions or need any assistance with these grants, please contact my Birmingham office at (205) 254-1960 or kaia.greene@mail.house.gov or email the National Park Service directly at preservation_grants_info@nps.gov.
I look forward to hearing from you,

Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 26th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: establishing more visionary, equitable, and cost-effective food & farm policies.
The Farm Bill is the most important, yet under appreciated, piece of federal legislation that impacts every American. Hopelessly complex and needlessly expensive, it sets priorities for federal investment in our food and agricultural system, and impacts many sectors of our economy. Unfortunately, the bill gives too much to the wrong people to grow the wrong food in the wrong places. These misguided investments benefit large agribusiness, while undermining human health, nutrition, carbon reduction, economic development, land conservation, and animal welfare.
Reforming this costly yet inefficient bill is one of my top priorities. I will soon introduce comprehensive food and farm legislation to refocus federal resources on those who need it most, foster innovation, encourage investments in people and the planet, and ensure access to healthy foods.
You can learn more here.
I’ve spearheaded an effort to unite people cheated by the current Farm Bill to discuss the ways we can make it work better for everyone. I’ve written a report that outlines these recommendations, Growing Opportunities, which is available here.
In Oregon, we’re working with thousands of people who understand that they have a stake in what Congress does as it reauthorizes the next Farm Bill in 2018. In a time of deep partisan division and rancor, this is an area where people can unite with common interests to ensure a sustainable future for our nation’s food and agricultural system.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

Vern Buchanan’s Hearing Aids Bill Signed Into Law
Mitch Perry
 
President Donald Trump has signed legislation co-sponsored by U.S. Representative Vern Buchanan that will make hearing aids more affordable for millions of Americans.
 
“This bill could help improve the quality of life for nearly 50 million Americans who struggle to hear everyday conversations,” Buchanan said Monday. “Many people who need hearing aids cannot afford the high price tag of $4,000 or more.”
 
The “Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act” was folded into a broader bill to fund the Food and Drug Administration that Trump signed on Friday. The bill could bring the cost of a pair of hearing aids down from several thousand dollars to only a few hundred dollars when it takes effect.
 
The bill will also reduce costs by simplifying the hearing aid purchasing process. Currently, a formal medical evaluation is required before seniors can purchase hearing aids. In most cases, consumers can only buy hearing aids from audiologists — professionals trained in treating hearing problems — or licensed hearing aid sellers after the evaluation. The Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act would remove these requirements so the hearing aids could be purchased in a simple, over-the-counter fashion.
 
Mild to moderate hearing loss becomes nearly ubiquitous at older ages, affecting more than 60 percent of those in their 70s and nearly 80 percent of those over age 80. Yet only one older person in five currently wears hearing aids, according to the NY Times.
 
The bill had bipartisan support, with Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren and Iowa Republicans’ Chuck Grassley among the sponsors in the Senate version.
 
Buchanan represents the fourth-highest number of seniors 65 and older of any district in the country. He noted that more than 48 million Americans have some degree of hearing loss – more than diabetes, cancer or vision trouble.

Dear Friend, 
I want to fill you in on the work I was doing last week on your behalf in our great district. 
I had the pleasure of hearing from local farmers in Boscawen about the 2018 Farm Bill and ways we can bolster New Hampshire’s agricultural sector. This was the first of three listening sessions I am holding throughout the district and it provided a unique opportunity to hear from folks on the ground in New Hampshire. 
￼
In Boscawen speaking to local farmers about the 2018 Farm Bill 
As the first Representative from New Hampshire to serve on the House Agriculture Committee in decades, I want to ensure that our Granite State farmers are benefitting from the reauthorization of this important bill. These listening sessions allow me to hear about what is working, what is not working, and what we can improve upon as we draft the next Farm Bill. Agriculture and small family farms are a cornerstone of New Hampshire’s economy and this bill provides an opportunity to push for policies that will bolster our agricultural sector, create jobs, grow our economy and protect our environment. The Farm Bill is also a critical tool for supporting our timber industry, land and water conservation efforts, and nutrition programs. In Boscawen, I heard from a diverse group of agriculture leaders and groups, including our Agriculture Commissioner Lorraine Merrill, the NH Farm Bureau, UNH Cooperative Extension, the Society for the Protection of NH Forests, and so many more. 
I also had the chance to join with regional healthcare leaders and local Nashua residents at Lamprey Health Center to discuss my plan to improve the Affordable Care Act and increase Granite Staters’ access to quality health care. While we’ve made tremendous progress since the introduction of the ACA, we must work to improve the individual market and make health care more affordable for everyone. That’s why I’ve put forward commonsense proposals to stabilize the individual market and contain costs. In conversations with my Republican colleagues, I know there is much common ground and I look forward to working across the aisle to improve the ACA for all Granite Staters. 
￼
Discussing ways to improve the Affordable Care Act at Lamprey Health Center
It is important now, more so than ever before, to work collectively to ensure Americans’ health, safety and economic prosperity. I encourage you to reach out to your elected officials to let them know what is on your mind, and to talk with your friends, family, colleagues and neighbors as well. If we join together, we can make a big difference.
Thank you and I hope you're having a wonderful week!       ￼

Come and Read It Report
Dear Friends,
We are deep into the August district work period and I have been traveling around Texas' 25th Congressional District every week. While I've been working hard here, there have been some significant strides in Washington that I'd like you to be aware of:
Recently, President Trump announced his renewed interest in a complete overhaul of the United States' strategy in South Asia. Our top priority has and always will be our national security, which is achieved through the defeat of radical terrorist organizations, rather than nation-building. As the Representative for Fort Hood, I have witnessed first-hand the affects of war and the toll it has on our brave men and women who sacrifice so much for this country. I am encouraged by the President's announcement and look forward to working with my colleagues to achieve a successful military, economic, and diplomatic strategy.  
As some of you may know, I recently released a statement regarding the latest movement to repeal Obamacare.  I fully support signing a discharge petition that will remove the bill to repeal Obamacare from Committee and force a floor vote in September. Right now, Republicans have an unparalleled opportunity to make significant changes in Congress and we need to act. After years of promises to the American people, there is no reasonable excuse for delay - we need to get this to the President’s desk.
I'd also like to touch on the recent events in Charlottesville, Virginia that were not only unacceptable, but un-American. There is no place in this country for neo-Nazis, white supremacists, or any other hate-group. America is better than this and we do not tolerate hate crimes of any kind. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and all of those affected. 
I have included some articles and releases you may find interesting located on the right side of this newsletter. It is an honor and privilege to represent the people of Texas’ 25th Congressional District and as always, please reach out to me with any issues and concerns that are important to you.
Sincerely,
￼
Roger Williams

8/23/17 9:29,Rep. Thompson's Women Veterans Panel Discussion,"￼ 
AUGUST 18, 2017
￼

￼

￼  ￼  ￼ 
Dear Friend, 
I would like to invite you to join me for a Women Veterans Panel Discussion on August 25th in Grant Hall, at the Veterans Home of California Yountville, from 9:30 am – 11:00 am to discuss key issue areas affecting women veterans in our district. 

Women account for about 10 percent of the veteran population in California, a number that is expected to rise to 15 percent in the next 20 years. There are 11,000 women veterans living here in our district alone. Women veterans face many unique challenges, including a lack of services for women in veterans’ clinics, homelessness, post-traumatic stress, and for some, military sexual assault trauma.

I have assembled a panel of experts from across our district who work with and serve women veterans, including representatives from the Veterans Health Administration, Veterans Benefits Administration and local volunteer service organizations. During our panel discussion, we will discuss the unique needs of this community, the existing programs and resources designed to meet those needs, and explore what else we need to be doing to ensure that all women veterans receive the services they need.

If you have questions or concerns about women veteran’s issues, I urge you to join me on August 25th. To RSVP, please go to this link here, email me at rsvp.napa@mail.house.gov or call me at (707) 226-9898. 
Sincerely,
￼
Mike Thompson

In speech, President Trump announces U.S. strategy for Afghanistan  Promising a move from “nation-building” to combating specific terrorist threats, President Trump announced a renewed strategy for the U.S. war in Afghanistan. Details of the plan, including the number of troops deployed and the financial commitment the U.S. is prepared to make, remain unclear. The war in Afghanistan, begun in 2001, is the nation’s longest war. 8,400 troops are stationed there.
+ Jim said: “President Trump reversed everything he has said about Afghanistan for the last 16 years. He broke his campaign promises on Afghanistan. This is his biggest U-turn so far of his presidency.”
U.S. announces Chinese and Russian sanctions  The U.S. Treasury Department has announced new sanctions on Russian and Chinese companies and individuals who have maintained economic ties to North Korea despite U.N. sanctions.
￼
Getting people to enroll in health plans while Trump attacks them  The New York Times came to Nashville to ask residents what it’s like encouraging people to buy health insurance through the Marketplace while it’s still under attack from the administration. Local organizations across the country continue to work signing people up, despite the administration prematurely ending advertising and threatening to cut off subsidies lowering premiums for low-income Americans. 
￼
Secret Service to run out of money on September 30 Including 18 members of the Trump family, the Secret Service is now tasked with protecting 42 people around the clock. Protecting all of them will force the Secret Service to hit a federal cap on overtime pay by September 30, unless the law is changed. They’re asking for a congressional waiver, again.

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 8.21.17
Monday, August 21, 2017–                                 
More Chaos on the Obamacare Exchanges
The health insurance provider Anthem has decided to stop selling individual insurance plans on Virginia’s Obamacare exchange next year. It will also stop selling off-exchange individual plans, except in Washington and Scott Counties and the City of Bristol. As I write this column, information had not been released as to what individual plans will be available for purchase off the exchange. Optima Insurance will replace Anthem in selling individual plans on the exchange, but Anthem’s customers will have to go through the process of finding new plans from this insurer. It is unavoidable that many Virginians will have to start over in finding a health insurance plan.
Unfortunately, Virginia is only the latest state to have major insurers stop selling plans to its citizens. In Iowa earlier this year, the entire state appeared likely to lack options to buy health plans. The state asked for a waiver from the Federal Government to alter big parts of Obamacare in order to keep insurers selling plans. With that waiver pending, a single insurer eventually agreed to participate in the exchange, but it proposed a rate increase of 57 percent for next year.
In Tennessee this past February, Humana pulled out of exchanges in the Knoxville area, threatening to leave people in that part of Tennessee with no options at all. Three months later, another insurer, BlueCross BlueShield, provisionally agreed to sell individual plans on the Knoxville-area exchanges, but even then, it placed conditions before finally agreeing to sell.
These examples suggest what the future of the health insurance market may look like in Virginia. I hope Governor McAuliffe’s administration will work hard to find a replacement provider for those who purchase individual plans off the exchange. But the larger point is that Obamacare has turned topsy-turvy the health insurance coverage of many Americans, which is why I will continue to work for its repeal. We can find better solutions to improve coverage and lower costs.

Right to Try
Recently, the Senate passed a bill sponsored by Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) permitting “right-to-try.” I strongly support the idea of right-to-try, and I have sponsored a bill in the House of Representatives that would put this idea into law.
What is right-to-try? It allows patients with life-threatening illnesses who are out of options to try treatments that have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If someone facing a terminal illness tries everything FDA has approved without success, what does he or she have to lose by trying something else, as long as he or she knows the risks?
According to the Goldwater Institute, 37 states already have right-to-try laws, and Senator Johnson’s bill passed the Senate unanimously. While my bill and Senator Johnson’s are not identical, I am pleased that the concept of right-to-try is gaining attention and support. It’s a common-sense option that might bring relief to people otherwise facing the end.
Housing for Veterans
I was honored to participate in a dedication ceremony on August 16 for Freedom Lane in Wytheville. This housing development was built with the needs of veterans in mind, including those who were wounded in their country’s service. The development includes 24 one and two-bedroom units, and half are already occupied by veterans and their families. All of these units are handicap-accessible, with some adapted to serve those with more specific and severe injuries, such as sight and hearing loss. They stand less than a mile away from Wytheville’s VA community clinic.
I applaud Randy Martin, the Executive Director of the Wytheville Redevelopment and Housing Authority, and the Board of the authority, who are the owners and developers of this project. They saw a need for affordable housing in Southwest Virginia for veterans and worked with local, state, and federal authorities to achieve this goal. The brand new units on Freedom Lane are a symbol of our appreciation to the men and women who have served and a practical way to improve their quality of life.
If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.  You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671. To reach my office via email, please visit my website at www.morgangriffith.house.gov. Also on my website is the latest material from my office, including information on votes recently taken on the floor of the House of Representatives. 
Note: At the writing of this column, information provided by the state indicated that Optima would be participating in Virginia’s Obamacare exchange for 2018. Optima has since informed us that they are still discussing their participation for next year. It does not have to sign a contract that would commit them to participate until late September.
I regret the misunderstanding and no one should interpret this statement as an indication that Optima will not be involved in 2018. It is just premature to say they have made a commitment.

Dear Friend, 
President Trump's address to the nation last night made it clear that the safety and security of America will always be his first priority. I support the Administration's strategic decision to refocus our military efforts by instituting a conditions-based approach, ensuring our troops have the resources they need, and engaging in strong diplomacy. 
See my full reaction to the speech below: 
Statement from Congressman Dan  Donovan on the President's Remarks 
""The President delivered a unifying message that can hopefully bring our nation together, and he settled all doubts regarding his position on prejudice and racism in our country. 
""President Trump gave a strong foundation for an America-first foreign policy. It's a refreshing appeal for our country to act in its own interests - a doctrine that requires decisive action against our enemies and prudent use of our resources. I firmly support the President's conditions-based approach in pursuing victory after 16 years of war.""  
Sincerely,
￼
Daniel M. Donovan, Jr.
Member of Congress
11th District of New York
￼


It's a true honor and privilege to serve you in Congress, and I'll continue to work to pass policy solutions to our nation's greatest problems. Please don't hesitate to contact my office at any time with questions, concerns, or problems with an agency.

President Trump Signs Rep. Cook's Legislation to Ensure Fair Housing Benefit for Student Veterans

President Trump has signed HR 3218, Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017. Congressman Cook was a co-sponsor of the legislation, which includes language from his Veterans Education Equity Act.
Congressman Cook introduced the Veterans Education Equity Act in January 2017 to fix a problem in Post-9/11 GI Bill housing payments for student veterans, which prevented some veterans from receiving a fair housing payment. 
The Post-9/11 GI Bill is a hard-earned benefit that pays for student veterans’ higher education tuition and fees, as well as a monthly basic allowance for housing (BAH) stipend. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) determines the BAH amount based on the zip code where the school is certified as an institute of higher education, not necessarily where a campus is located. For schools with campuses in multiple locations, this policy can result in monthly BAH payments that fall below or far exceed the actual cost of housing. Cook’s Veterans Education Equity Act would fix the problem by calculating the payment based on where students attend their classes, not where the institution of higher learning is certified, ensuring veterans receive an adequate and fair housing allowance while eliminating fraud and waste in the program. While Cook’s bill did not make it through Congress, he succeeding in having the bill language included in HR 3218.
HR 3218 also removes time restrictions to use the GI Bill, enabling future recipients to use their GI benefits for their entire life as opposed to the current 15-year timeline. The bill also includes significant increases in GI Bill funding for Reservists and Guardsmen, dependents, surviving spouses and surviving dependents. The bill is budget neutral and includes provisions that have been proposed and prioritized by Veterans Service Organizations. 
Since 1944, The GI Bill – later renamed the Post-9/11 GI Bill – has provided veterans the opportunity to invest in themselves and their futures through access to education benefits. It has helped millions of veterans pay for college, graduate school, and other training programs. 
Congressman Cook said, “This important legislation is a package of reforms that makes significant improvements to the GI bill and ensures veterans can use their education benefits whenever they choose. I’m pleased that package of reforms includes my language concerning the veterans student housing benefit, which is essential to ensuring they can afford to complete their education. One of my top priorities in Congress is protecting the benefits our veterans have earned while defending this nation, and the President did well by signing HR 3218 into law.”

Dear Friends,
It has been great to spend time back at home after so many busy weeks in Washington D.C. I wanted to take this opportunity to let you know about the work I have been doing in the Valley to help improve the lives of the people that I have the privilege of representing.
Agriculture Roundtable in Salinas
We must reauthorize the Farm Bill to guide federal agriculture and food policy roughly every five years. The current Farm Bill is set to expire on September 30, 2018, and one of my highest priorities in Congress is passing a Farm Bill which serves our Valley, our state, and our nation. This cannot be done without the input of those that grow and manage our nation’s food supply. That is why I joined Congressman Jimmy Panetta and House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Collin Peterson in hosting an agriculture roundtable session at Hartnell College in Salinas. It was great to hear from the local agriculture leaders, farm workers, and nutrition organizations who attended, and I look forward to listening to additional local voices throughout the region in the roundtables and listening sessions we will be holding in the near future. The insights, input, and experiences of our local farmers, workers, and nutrition organizations will help craft our approach to the nation’s food and fiber policy in the next Farm Bill.
￼

Water Managers Meeting
California experienced its wettest year in its historical record this year, on the heels of the worst drought in over 1,200 years. This is leading many people to wonder what plans are being made to prepare for the 2018 water year and whatever it may bring California. We’ll enter a new water year on October 1st, and you’ll be happy to hear that as of August 13, 2017, the major reservoirs up and down California are all at or above 80 percent of their total capacity. This level is significantly over their 15-year average for this time of year, which means that we will enter this water year in a much better place than we have the last few years. 
Despite this reserve, we know that there is no promise to what next year will bring. This is why I brought together Valley water agencies and state and federal water and fisheries management agencies to discuss lessons learned during the last drought and how we can work together to prepare for the next one, which we know will come. It is crucial to continue investing in our water infrastructure and to modify currently flawed policies to move California’s water system into the 21st century and build a more resilient water system to meet the Valley’s needs. This meeting was a great opportunity to work together to increase water storage statewide as well as to remind officials that water allocations must be made in a timely manner in order for our Valley’s farmers to secure loans and keep the economy moving forward.
Protecting DACA Recipients
The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program has allowed young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children the opportunity to reach for the American dream by granting them a deferred action from deportation. Nearly 800,000 young people possess a DACA grant currently, all of whom have been thoroughly vetted by security agencies. Ending this program would be extremely expensive and disruptive to the economy, including companies losing nearly $3.4 billion due to unnecessary turnover costs. With the future of the program still uncertain, several members of Congress and I sent a letter to President Trump urging him to continue the DACA program and to fight for the program in the face of renewed litigation, specifically in the ongoing Texas v. United States case. I look forward to a response from the President, and I hope he will honor our request to direct Attorney General Sessions to use all legal options available to defend DACA.
Thank you for taking the time to read this newsletter update. As always, please do not hesitate to contact me regarding any federal issues of your concern. To stay up-to-date on the work I am doing in Congress, please visit my website at costa.house.gov and sign up for my e-newsletter here.

How Can I Help You?
Dear Friend,

As the August district work period continues, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time back home in the 10th District. I’ve met with many constituents and community groups, which is always rewarding, and my team has assisted hundreds of residents in navigating the red tape of federal agencies, including the IRS and VA. Check out a few highlights below!

In an ongoing effort to provide top-notch constituent services, my staff held Mobile Office Hours in Eatonton and Warrenton last week. At the events, they assisted farmers, veterans, seniors, and more.

It was a packed house at my 2017 Service Academy Day on Saturday! With representatives from all five Service Academies, students heard the best practices of the nomination and application processes. A big thank you to Georgia Military College for providing the venue for the event. Don’t forget, the application deadline for interested students is Friday, October 13, 2017 at 5 p.m.

I was humbled to speak at the 50th Vietnam Commemoration Ceremony in Winterville. Our veterans, from the State of Georgia and across the Nation, represent the very best of America, and while we can never repay them for their service and sacrifice, we must honor them as best we can. I was pleased to inform the group that H.R. 3218, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, and S.114, the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017, were recently signed into law. Both of these bills will greatly improve educational benefits for our heroes.

My office recently received word that the Monroe Fire Department was awarded the 2016 Assistance to Firefighters Grant, which will enable the department to hire an additional six firefighters to address the needs of the community. I’m incredibly proud of our first responders and cannot think of a better group to help strengthen our community’s ability to respond to fire hazards. I’m also pleased to have a full-time grants coordinator who stands ready to help with research or letters of support.

Upcoming Events
I’m pleased to announce two opportunities for 10th District residents to meet with me for candid conversations over a hot beverage. On Thursday, August 24, I will be hosting two “Coffee with Your Congressman” events, where I will provide a brief legislative update, listen to your concerns, and take questions you may have. That morning from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., I’ll be at Home Café in downtown Lincolnton. Later in the day from 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m., I’ll be at the Hancock County Farm Bureau in Sparta. 

These meet-and-greets are a great chance for constituents to speak with me and my staff one-on-one. I look forward to catching up with some old friends, and I hope to see some new faces too as we discuss the topics that are most important to you. As your representative, hearing from you and receiving feedback is a critical part of my job, and I encourage you to stop by if you’re in Lincoln County, Hancock County, or the surrounding area. 

￼


The Week Ahead
I’ll be traveling throughout the 10th District meeting with different folks and community leaders. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to keep track of my work on your behalf!

Sincerely,

8/22/17 11:07,Beyond resistance: making sure everyone has access to safe drinking water,"Update | Tuesday, August 22, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 25th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: water infrastructure investment.
From Flint, Michigan to schools in Portland, access to safe water is increasingly one of the most pressing challenges we face today. Too often out of sight and out of mind, our water systems are literally falling apart while we ignore the problem. Congress should do more to meet our desperate need for water infrastructure investments.
While there is no single solution to this problem, I’ve introduced the Water Infrastructure Trust Fund Act to create a dedicated source of revenue for the replacement, repair, and rehabilitation of wastewater and drinking water systems. The fund would support investments in aging sewer systems and water treatment plants, as well as address the systemic challenges affecting access to safe water in low-income populations.
In addition to funding, we need regular, rigorous, and transparent testing for lead and other contaminants – especially as our water infrastructure continues to age. Last year, after my community was shocked to learn of widespread lead contamination in drinking water at our schools, I joined Rep. Jackie Speier to introduce the No Lead in School Water Act, legislation that would help schools test for lead contamination and then fund remediation to get rid of it.
It’s past time we take action. We must do more to fix our crumbling water infrastructure—the safety and health of everyone depends on it.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼
Earl Blumenauer
Member of Congress

This Week in Congress
Presidential Address on Afghanistan
￼ Click here to watch a replay of President Trump's address to the nation.
Over the last 16 years, Americans have spent vast amounts of time, money, and most importantly, lives in the fight to win this war following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Last night, President Trump acknowledged those sacrifices and pledged additional resources and troops to the fight that continues today, laying out a new strategy to prevent terrorists from using Afghanistan as a base to attack the United States or our allies around the world.
I very much agree with the President that we should no longer announce arbitrary timetables and we should get the job done so that conditions on the ground are stable and secure. Congress stands ready to ensure our men and women of the military have the tools they need to achieve a path to victory. It's important that we work with the Administration, but also thoroughly do our job when it comes to oversight, keeping in mind Americans remain war weary.

Last Week in Congress
Terror Attack in Barcelona
￼ ￼ Click here to read the full story from CNN. 
Last week, suspects drove a van into a crowd of people in Barcelona, Spain without warning, killing at least 14 and injuring more than 50 people. Later, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claimed credit for the attack, which resembled similar attacks by extremists across Europe - and in Charlottesville, Virginia by a white supremacist attacker - over the last year. 
America stands with Spain as we have with our allies in France, Germany, the United Kingdom and others who have been victims of similar barbaric attacks over the last year. Terrorists choose hate and violence to inspire fear. Instead we have to show strength and love. Brooke and I join everyone in praying for the victims in Barcelona after the deadly attack last Thursday. 
Landmark Veterans Legislation Signed into Law
￼ Click here to read more about the Forever GI Bill.
Republicans and Democrats came together to prioritize our veterans. The result is the biggest expansion of the GI Bill in a decade is now law. 
Earlier this month, I joined my colleagues in the House of Representatives in voting to pass HR 3218, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, which improves and expands the GI Bill benefits available to veterans and their families. Over the years, the GI Bill has helped millions of veterans pay for college, graduate school, and other training programs  and we've updated it to meet the times. HR 3218 is called the ""Forever GI Bill"" because it will allow new service men and women to use the GI bills education benefits throughout their lifetimes.
￼ Click here to watch House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on NBCs TODAY Show discussing Congresss efforts to expand the GI Bill.
An important provision in the ""Forever GI Bill"" is the Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses (VET TEC) Act, which I'm proud to have been an original cosponsor of. This provision will open up new education opportunities for veterans and help them close the skills gap in todays workforce. 
Last Wednesday, the President signed this great bill into law to ensure that veterans receive the treatment that they and their families have earned. 
Across the District
Great American Eclipse
￼ ￼ Click here to read more about the eclipse from 41 Action News.
Yesterday, Kansans in the Northeast portion of the state had the privilege of watching the total solar eclipse in the path of totality - where the moon completely blocked the sun from visibility. This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that was especially fun for our community as the path was narrow, spanning from Oregon down through South Carolina and Georgia. As you probably noticed, we had many visitors from around the country and around the world come and experience the eclipse right here in our state!

Childcare Roundtable Discussion & Tour of Mastin Street KinderCare
￼ Kevin discussing the rising costs of childcare with advocates, experts, and parents.
Childcare and early childhood education is an issue that affects every single family in our community and around the country. Thats why it's important that we stand together  Republicans and Democrats  to help working families deal with the exploding costs of childcare, which have increased by 168% over the last 25 years. Last Wednesday, I hosted a roundtable discussion on this issue at the Mastin Street KinderCare location in Overland Park to talk with KinderCare Education officials, childcare experts, parents, and advocates about my bipartisan bill, the Promoting Affordable Childcare for Everyone (PACE) Act.
 
￼
Mastin Street KinderCare Center Director Rachel Dorman giving Kevin a tour of the facility.
 
The PACE Act makes important updates and reforms to our childcare tax credits and flex spending accounts to help middle class and low-income families pay for care for their children. The bill: 
	•	Raises the value of the childcare tax credit by 15% for all families.
	•	Indexes the credit to inflation to help keep up the pace with rising costs.
	•	Makes the credit refundable so families who are at or near the poverty line will have access to it.
	•	Enhances the childcare flex spending accounts by increasing the amount of pre-tax dollars families can put into FSAs by 50% and indexes the new cap to inflation.
 
￼
Center Director Rachel Dorman presenting Kevin with artwork made by students at Mastin Street KinderCare.
 
I want to thank Mastin Street KinderCare and Center Director Rachel Dorman for hosting this discussion, Kim Engelman and other advocates from Child Care Aware who have been strong proponents of our bill, and to all the parents who made time in their busy schedules to be there last week. Representative Stephanie Murphy (D-FL), the bills lead Democrat sponsor, and I are going to continue advocating for the PACE Act so we can deliver tax relief to the families who need it most.
￼
Immigration Roundtable Discussion with Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce
￼
Diversity and inclusion are things that make our American culture, democracy, and economy better and stronger. Immigrants who come to our country legally, respect our laws, and work hard to contribute to our economy deserve every opportunity to achieve the American Dream. That's why I'm working to reform our legal immigration system to help these people, many of whom are stuck in massive green card backlogs due to our current laws.
 
I'm pushing for my bill, the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, that would remove the per-nation caps on employment-based green cards that are forcing immigrants from larger nations like India or China to wait decades for permanent residence while others from smaller nations only have to wait one or two years. And on top of that, many of these people who live and work right here in our community are forced to choose between keeping their job and legal status in the United States or attending a family funeral in their home country. No one should have to make that choice.
 
￼ ￼
 
It was great to meet with the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce for a roundtable discussion including Immigration Voice, to hear from local business leaders and individuals who are affected by these laws. Right now, our bill has more than 240 cosponsors - including more than 100 Republicans and Democrats - and we are working to garner more support. I want to thank everyone who attended for sharing your stories with me and helping me in this effort, and thank you to Cathy Bennett for organizing the discussion.
￼
Agricultural Business Council of Kansas City
￼
Kansas farmers and ranchers work hard every day to feed the world, but theyre being left behind in todays economy. American farmers incomes will drop 9% in 2017 according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which will extend the steepest slide since the Great Depression into a fourth year. Net farm income is expected to fall to $62.3 billion, half the record $123 billion farmers earned in 2013. There will soon be fewer than two million farms in America for the first time since pioneers moved westward after the Louisiana Purchase.
 
I spoke to these concerns at the Agricultural Business Council of Kansas City, whose members include more than 350 agriculture leaders in the community who represent businesses that account for almost 115,000 jobs and $29.3 billion in economic impact. I renewed my commitment to farmers and ranchers in my role in Congress on the Agriculture Subcommittee on House Appropriations and as the Chairman of the Congressional Beef Caucus. We discussed the importance of protecting crop insurance, reducing burdensome regulations, and opening markets through trade. Thank you to Bob Peterson for the invitation and thank you to Mary Birch of Lathrop & Gage for the kind introduction.
￼
Hispanic Chamber of Commerce
￼
The Hispanic community is a vibrant community in Kansas City and the Third District, and I enjoyed joining the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Greater Kansas City for a roundtable discussion held at Titan Environmental Services in KCK last week. It was great to hear their thoughts on issues that were debating in Congress, including how tax reform, overregulation, health care, immigration, and other big issues affect economic opportunities within the Hispanic market and business community.
 
I want to specifically thank Titan Environmental Services CEO Angie Rodriguez-Gunion for hosting us, as well as my friend President/CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Carlos Gomez, for facilitating the discussion and meeting  and congrats on the 40th anniversary of the Chamber! 
￼

Fact of the Week

Dear Friends, 
As I said last week, we must condemn the hate which fueled the violence we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia. Racial intolerance deserves no place in America and we cannot let this hatred and bigotry continue. Last week we also stood with our allies in Barcelona, Spain as the city fell victim to a terror attack. These two attacks in just one week shows us terrorism, whether foreign or domestic, is an evolving threat that needs to be countered. 
In light of this, I announced that I will host a hearing on September 12th to discuss the most serious threats America faces.  Leaders from the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the National Counterterrorism Center are invited as our witnesses.  I strongly encourage Members of both parties to engage the witnesses on the dangers posed by domestic terrorists and other extremist groups. 
You can read my full letter regarding the hearing by clicking here.
Now Law: Bill to Improve Pediatric Cancer Research   Friday was a big win for children battling cancer – the number one cause of pediatric deaths. My RACE for Children Act is now law, giving these children a hope for the future! 
The legislative process is not always easy, but achieving significant victories such as this one for our children is one of the most rewarding aspects of my job. I believe it is incumbent upon each of us – especially those elected to serve – to do our part to rid this world of cancer, for the sake of my children and yours. Legislation like this is not signed into law without a lot of help, and there are many people who played an important role in this bill becoming law. A special ""thank you"" to my dear friend Sadie Keller from Texas who traveled to Washington advocating for this bill and always reminds me that ‘together we can make a difference.'
￼
As the picture illustrates, it may be cloudy now but Sadie and I are looking into the bright future because ""together we can make a difference.""
Israel    As a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and Chairman of Homeland Security, I joined some of my fellow Chairmen on an educational trip to the Holy Land. Aside from the natural beauty and fantastic experience, the trip was educationally intense. We learned about the national security struggles Israel faces. This country is surrounded by bad actors on every side, which is why the United States' support of Israel has always been and continues to be critical. I had the opportunity to see tunnels that were used by Hamas in Gaza and witnessed Jewish people praying at the Western Wall. One of the highlights was the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (pictured below).
￼
""A Common-Sense Approach To Border Security""   At the end of July, I unveiled the Border Security for America Act. This legislation pairs physical infrastructure, such as fencing and walls, with technology and personnel to provide comprehensive security on our southern border. This is a historic, multi-layered defense system that makes it nearly impossible for bad actors to slip through the cracks.
Other members agree that it is time for us to fix this national security issue. Earlier this month, Chairman Bob Goodlatte wrote an op-ed with me to promote this important legislation. Then, just last week, Congressman Mark Meadows wrote an op-ed in the Daily Caller voicing his support for my legislation. 
""The time has come for Republicans to ditch the dangerous policies that have dominated in the past and fulfill our promise to the American people by securing our border. Chairman McCaul’s bold legislation and common-sense approach brings us one step closer to achieving that goal.
For the safety and security of our homeland, we need the Border Security for America Act.""

Legislative Update
The House remains in District Work Period until after Labor Day so there are no votes.

￼
Friends,
The Congressional calendar offers time in August for representatives and senators to spend more time home in our states and districts visiting with those we represent. Over the last few weeks I’ve had the chance to travel around Alabama’s Second District taking meetings, attending events, and listening to the concerns of my constituents. I wanted to share a few visits I’ve made along the way.
AN AFTERNOON IN DOTHAN
￼
I spent time in Dothan where I spoke to a lunchtime meeting of the Associated General Contractors of Alabama. We talked a lot about challenges and opportunities facing our state workforce development. Those who build and repair things for a living understand better than most the importance of training more young people in the trades. I was glad to share the good news that the House has approved needed funding to strengthen career and technical education. 
HEARING FROM THE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY
￼
Agriculture is Alabama’s largest industry, and I make it a point to hear directly from the agriculture community about the issues they face. I had the opportunity to visit Auburn University’s Wiregrass Research and Extension Center in Headland. Auburn scientists are conducting some truly incredible research that is leading to breakthroughs in agriculture technology, including a new high-yielding, disease-resistant peanut variety. Of course, peanuts have a major economic impact in the Wiregrass, and I know this is welcome news to a lot of local producers.  
￼
I also participated in a roundtable discussion hosted by the Alabama Farmers Federation where we talked about a variety of issues facing farmers, from crop insurance to irrigation improvements. Soon Congress will begin working on our nation’s next farm bill, which makes this the perfect time to be receiving briefings from our state’s farmers. I will continue to advocate for policies that treat Alabama products like peanuts, cotton, timber, poultry, soybeans, and catfish fairly. 
""MEET WITH MARTHA""
￼
Last Thursday I hosted a ""Meet with Martha"" event at Chappy's Deli in Montgomery and invited the public to come visit with me and members of my staff one-on-one to share their views and concerns. 
It was a great turnout, and I want to thank those who took time to come by and speak with me. We may not see eye to eye on every issue, but I respect and value the opinions of all those I represent. Taking the time to listen to the concerns of my constituents makes me a better voice on your behalf.
￼
The next ""Meet with Martha"" event will be TOMORROW, August 22 at 2:00 p.m. at the Andalusia Area Chamber of Commerce. I hope you'll stop by if you live in the area! Stay tuned on social media for the announcement of future public events. 
August has been busy so far, but my travels continue! This week I'll be spending time in Luverne, Montgomery, Dothan, Enterprise, Greenville, and Andalusia. I hope to see many of you along the way!  
As always, you can follow along on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. It is an honor to serve you in Congress. Please never hesitate to let me know if there is a way my office can be of assistance.   Sincerely, 
￼  Martha Roby
Member of Congress

8/21/17 20:36,Ryan's Report,"Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email
News from Representative Ryan Costello
￼ 

Welcome to Ryan’s Report, my weekly e-newsletter, and thank you for reading. This was another busy week around our community, as I’ve been visiting all four counties of the District during the August District Work Period to hear from constituents, and visit businesses and other organizations. As a reminder, the District Work Period means the House is not in session, and there are no votes or House committee hearings.
Before I update you on my week, I want to make sure you’ve seen each of my statements and my thoughts on Charlottesville, Virginia. On Saturday, August 12, I issued the following statement:
I condemn this hate and violence in the strongest possible terms. Hate is a dangerous thing. What happened today goes against our nation's character. Demonstrations by white nationalists to spread hate and intolerance are a stain on our national identity as an open, inclusive country that welcomes diversity.
This Wednesday, I spoke with WFMZ 69 News regarding Charlottesville, and below is an excerpt of my conversation. Click here to read the entire transcript.
What happened was someone drove a car into a crowd and killed one person and injured 19 others, and that was a white supremacist. That’s what happened. So he [President Trump] should call it what it is and not get into this broader question of who else out there may be causing noise and contributing to the situation that we’re in right now. We're a better country than what happened in Charlottesville. And we’re a better country than these remarks that sort of equalize or marginalize or create an equivalency between various forms of hate. Hate is bad and it’s ugly, and we should be pushing back against it on all cylinders.
You can also read my op-ed in the Chester County Times and Pottstown Mercury, ""Hate is a dangerous thing.""
Vigils for Charlottesville
Across our District, our communities are holding vigils as a part of the healing process. I stand with our neighbors to raise our voice in unison and peace to say that hate, bigotry, and violence have no place in our community.
You can click here and here to learn more about some of the vigils in Pennsylvania.
August 14 - August 18: Unity and Respect
Town Halls in the District
￼
On Thursday night, I held another town hall for constituents – this time in Lebanon. I first want to thank each of the constituents who came out and asked questions, I greatly appreciate your time and your feedback. Topics discussed included Charlottesville, Virginia and the President’s response, education, the economy, healthcare, and foreign policy, particularly the threat from North Korea.
If you're interested in reading more, see below for local news coverage:
	•	Lebanon Daily News: Trump comments, N. Korea, health care addressed at Costello town hall in Lebanon
	•	PennLive: Rep. Costello holds quiet town hall meeting as small rally held outside
If you were unable to attend my previous town halls, you may click here for West Chester, here for Berks and here for Pottstown.
I’ve had several questions on North Korea at town halls over the past few weeks. Before the August District Work Period, the House passed a sanctions bill -- H.R. 3364, Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act -- which is now law, that sanctions North Korea, Iran, and Russia. Click below to hear more about what this sanctions package would do:

Opioid Epidemic Update
The ongoing opioid epidemic has rapidly emerged as one of the most urgent public health challenges facing our nation today. In our home state of Pennsylvania, which in 2015 had the sixth highest rate of drug overdose deaths in the U.S., we are witnessing the devastating impact of this crisis every day.
This past week, the President directed his Administration “to use all appropriate emergency and other authorities to respond to the crisis caused by the opioid epidemic.”
It is critical we fight against this crisis that damages communities and families. As a member of the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic, I have focused on finding solutions to the crisis and hearing from local stakeholders on how Congress can better assist those on the front lines. You can learn more about that work here and here.
Additionally, as a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I participated in a hearing to examine how states engage federal support to bolster their prevention, treatment, and intervention efforts. Understanding the success and effectiveness of state-based initiatives — whether by deploying coordinated community response teams, implementing and strengthening prescription drug monitoring programs, or working with providers and prescribers to limit opioid exposure — is critical to conducting oversight of existing federal efforts and developing new policies to combat the evolving menace of addiction and abuse. You can read about the hearing by clicking here. 
Honoring and Thanking Those Who Serve
Civil Air Patrol Award
￼
I was pleased to congratulate Akash Damle on receiving the Civil Air Patrol Earhart Award for reaching the rank of Cadet Captain – an accomplishment achieved by few. The Civil Air Patrol plays a vital role in supporting our country’s defense and homeland security – as well serving local communities and teaching young adults about the importance of public service.
To earn this award, Akash met impressive aerospace, fitness, and leadership standards, such as showing a sense of responsibility and demonstrating critical thinking skills.
I appreciated having the opportunity to congratulate Akash and thank the entire Chester County Composite Squadron for their service to our country and our community.
Service Academy Reminder
For young adults interested in attending one of the Service Academies of the United States, I wanted to offer a reminder that completed materials from constituents of Pennsylvania's Sixth Congressional District will be accepted until October 6, 2017for the class entering in the summer of 2018.   
Please contact my Academy Liaison, Mary O’Connor, directly at mary.oconnor@mail.house.gov or (202) 225-6843. Please make sure you have the following information when you do so:
	•	Full Name

	•	E-mail address
	•	Phone number (please include area code)
	•	Academy/Academies in which you are applying
	•	Current high school
	•	Current grade (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th)
Infrastructure Reform
This week, the President outlined his thoughts on infrastructure plans, and I wanted to make sure you knew my thoughts on the importance of this topic, as infrastructure reform has been a priority of mine since coming to Congress in 2015.
We need to make sure our roads, bridges, passenger rail, waterways,pipelines,and other infrastructure are safe and reliable, and that requires incorporating climate and environmental factors into building or repairing our country’s infrastructure. We must also have efficient and modern infrastructure for the realities and challenges of the 21st century, which requires secure smart technologies, an efficient electric grid, and robust broadband coverage connecting rural, suburban, and urban communities.
I look forward to hearing more from the Administration about their plans to build and modernize our infrastructure.If you recall, last session of Congress, I served on the House Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure. And, as you know, this session I serve on the Energy & Commerce Committee.  Each of these committees has jurisdiction over critical infrastructure policies, and I encourage you to check out some of my thoughts during my time in Congress on innovative pipelines, creating a 21st century transportation network, and enacting a long-term highway bill. 
Intern Applications
￼

My offices are seeking intern applications from college students for the fall! Opportunities are available in all of my offices, located in Washington, DC, West Chester, and Wyomissing. 
A Congressional internship is a great opportunity to learn more about the legislative process, and in some cases, gain academic credit. Priority will be given to Pennsylvania residents with ties to the 6th District, but exceptions may be made depending on the qualifications of the applicant.
The deadline for intern applications for the fall is September 8, 2017. To learn more about the internship application process, please click here.
Next week is another District Work Week. I look forward to seeing you around the community!
Sincerely,
￼ 
Ryan Costello
Member of Congress

Dear Friend, 
Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to review some of the highlights of what happened last week.
Congressional Award Ceremony  Last week it was an honor to recognize six outstanding young students from TX-22 who earned the Congressional Award. To earn the award, young people between the ages 13 – 23 years old set goals in four program Areas: Voluntary Public Service, Personal Development, Physical Fitness, and Expedition/Exploration. The requirements for the six levels of the program increase based on the level the young person is applying for. The six students from TX-22 who received the Congressional award include, Rehman Memon and Keshav Srivaths, both Bronze Medalists, Catherine Phillips and Meiling Tang, both Silver Medalists, and Karen Yang, Lauren Yang, and Elizabeth Zhang, all Gold Medalists. It’s inspiring to see young people set a goal, work hard and earn it. Kudos to these award winners!  ￼  Olson and Congressional Award winners   Bipartisan Support for FDA Reauthorization  Friday night, President Trump signed into law a bipartisan health care bill, H.R. 2340, the FDA Reauthorization Act. This bill ensures the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the tools it needs to more efficiently deliver safe and effective drugs, devices, and treatments to patients. Passing this bill was the result of our hard, bipartisan work in the Energy and Commerce Committee to improve the use of fees paid by the medical products industry. These fees provide critical resources to get reviews done in a timely way, get life-saving products to market faster, and to help ensure the safety and effectiveness that American patients depend upon. I’m proud of this work and pleased the president signed this bill into law.
I’m honored to represent you in Congress. For more information on constituent services, current legislation or to sign up for my E-newsletter, please visit my website, www.olson.house.gov.

The Webster Wire
Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends:
Last week when touring Oak Hill Hospital in Brooksville, I had the opportunity to discuss health care with doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and med students and receive feedback on America’s healthcare system. They all agreed on one thing: Americans deserve a healthcare system that will ensure health care coverage for all. 
Healthcare driven by consumer choice that puts the patient-doctor relationship at the forefront offers a wider range of affordable healthcare options while preserving the quality of care that Americans deserve. Americans deserve better than the Affordable Care Act. Americans deserve a healthcare system that provides them with the care they need, from the doctor they choose, at a price they can afford.
_______________
Last Tuesday, I was honored to speak at the Inverness Rotary and provide a congressional update. 
￼
I also had the opportunity to tour the Inverness Airport and hear about the plans for the new airport business park.
￼
It was great visiting the Floral City Heritage Museum and learning about the rich history of Floral City.
￼ ￼
_______________
Learning more about the work of local business leaders and their employees and hearing how the federal government is streamlining and obstructing their work helps me be a better representative in Congress. It was great to be at the Cemex plant in Bushnell this morning and learn more about their contributions to the economic development of our local communities. Every day they make over 9,000 concrete blocks, enough to build 4 homes, with cement from local quarries.
￼
_______________
On Thursday, I was honored to be a guest at the August meeting of the Red Tail Memorial Chapter 136 of the Air Force Association where I discussed what Congress has done so far in 2017. We have passed VA reforms and stronger investments in military and we are working hard to expand and streamline infrastructure projects.
￼
_______________
I enjoyed discussing what is happening in the homeschool community with Florida Parent-Educators Association (FPEA) Chairwoman Suzanne Nunn. The FPEA supports thousands of families in their homeschool journey.

Kansas Common Sense  August 21, 2017
Hello,
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. 
Standing Together Against Racism
White supremacy, bigotry and racism have absolutely no place in our society, and no one – especially the President of the United States – should ever tolerate it. We must all come together as a country and denounce this hatred to the fullest extent. 
Hosting Townhalls Around Kansas
Throughout my time in Congress, I have been committed to holding townhall meetings to hear from the Kansans I serve. This week’s stops provided me with valuable feedback from Kansans that I need in order to do my job representing you in Washington. I have always had a responsibility to Kansans to make myself available for questions and discussion, regardless of what the day’s “hot button” issue may be.  Last week, I hosted townhall meetings in Thomas and Shawnee counties.  Thomas County Listening Tour Stop I continued my Kansas Listening Tour with a townhall meeting in Thomas County on Wednesday afternoon at the Colby Community College Cultural Arts Center. We had a productive discussion surrounding veterans care, education and healthcare, where I expressed my continued support of ensuring any new healthcare bill protects those with pre-existing conditions. We also discussed international issues – NAFTA and trade – and the farm bill. Kansans in attendance shared their concerns about USPS' inefficiencies in rural communities.  Thank you to former U.S. Senator Sheila Frahm and to all those from Thomas County for attending the event.  ￼
Shawnee County Listening Tour Stop On Friday I conducted a townhall meeting in Topeka. We had a turnout of over 120 Kansans and had a serious discussion about our short- and long-term goals for Congress and America, including healthcare reform, national security and education. Kansans made clear their desire for stability, civility and bipartisan cooperation in Washington.  I walk away from every one of my townhalls knowing that the concerns we feel reflect our dedication to building a better nation for the next generation. I’m always proud to represent Kansans in the Senate.  ￼   Click here for more information on upcoming Kansas Listening Tour stops.
Attending the Colby Community College Ribbon Cutting Ceremony
After the townhall meeting, I joined Colby Community College staff, students and community members at a ribbon cutting ceremony to celebrate the newly remodeled Living Center East dormitory. Construction of the 40-bed living center began in May, and the first of three phases of improvements to the residence hall were just completed. The project was largely funded by grants and private donations – proving that when something in our local communities needs to be done, our communities get together to make it happen. Thanks to CCC President Seth Carter for asking me to take part in the ceremony. 
Touring Schriever Air Force Base
I toured Schriever Air Force Base and its National Space Defense Center in Colorado Springs, Colo. on Wednesday to learn more about how the Air Force – and the military at large – is protecting our homeland with precision technology. The 50th Space Wing operates the 175 Department of Defense satellites and satellite programs, including the Global Positioning System (GPS), the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) and Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS).  Supporting these cutting-edge technologies and the service members who operate them ensures America will remain the most advanced military in the world. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, I will continue working to make certain our warfighters are trained and equipped to defend our nation.  As a bonus, I met Airman Fruit from Emporia and was able to thank him for his service to our country. Thank you to Schriever Air Force Base for hosting me. 
Speaking at Independence Health Care Center Ribbon Cutting Ceremony
Saturday morning I joined Labette Health and the community of Independence to celebrate the opening of their new Independence Healthcare Center. Two years ago, we learned Mercy Hospital was preparing to close. Since that time, area health care providers have stepped forward to provide medical services to the residents of Independence. Now, thanks to Labette Health, the community will once again have its own emergency room. This modernized facility will deliver quality emergency and medical care to residents right in their own hometown. The smaller facility with a greater focus on efficiency is part of a new approach Labette Health and others are utilizing. I appreciated CEO Brian Williams’s invitation to speak at the ribbon cutting and the warm welcome from Mayor Fred Meier and members of the community.  ￼
Touring Fab Lab at Independence Community College
During my Independence trip, I toured the Fab Lab at Independence Community College. This creative space provides entrepreneurs and community members access to manufacturing and digital fabrication tools encouraging experimentation, creativity and the entrepreneurial mindset. Although it’s not an academic program, the Fab Lab does offer college students introductory training in electronics, robotics, welding, 3D printing, prototyping and more. This month, the United States Economic Development Administration awarded the Fab Lab a grant to expand their facilities. The planned expansion will provide an additional 8,000 square feet to house an “entrepreneurs’ bullpen,” innovation center, paint-powder coating booth, welding booth and other improvements.  Thank you to the dozen entrepreneurs I met at Fab Lab and to Independence Community College President Dan Barwick and Jim Correll and Tim Haynes of the Fab Lab for the tour. I’m already looking forward to the Fab Lab's upcoming ""Community Boot Camp: How to Start a Fab-Lab From Ground Zero"" in February.  ￼
Honored to Serve You in Washington
It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

You'll want to see this                                                 

￼

Dear Lindsey,


With so much going on over the past few weeks, I wanted to take a quick moment to share some important updates on what I've been working on:
￼
Making it Easier for Americans to Get to Work
Senator Mike Lee and I introduced new legislation that could help create as many as 2.8 million new jobs by rolling back overly burdensome and often unnecessary licensing requirements keeping too many Americans out of the work place.
Read more on this problem in The Atlantic.
￼

On The Tragic Events in Charlottesville   Following the terrible events in Charlottesville, I've called for a hearing in the Judiciary Committee to examine the persistence of these extremist, hateful ideologies and their impact on American civil rights.
Read my letter here.
 ￼
Breaking The Cycle of Homelessness   One-size-fits-all regulations are forcing many local homeless shelters to close their doors. I'm taking action to keep them open, and to ensure that other good programs aren't kept out of the picture.   See more on my efforts in this week's Union-Tribune.
 ￼
Serving Disabled Veterans
Honored to have helped Segs4Vets present new wheelchairs to disabled veterans in our community. Thank you for all of the great work you do for our heroes!
See more on Facebook
￼
Supporting Musicians and Performing Artists
I'm working across party lines with Congressman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) to update copyright laws for the 21st century and close a long-standing gap in our system that denied some artists the same protections as their modern peers.     Read the column I wrote for Variety Magazine here.
 ￼
Meeting with Constituents   From discussing ways to reform our tax code with students at USD, to honoring our Sailors and Marines at the Gator Bash, helping our future leaders with nominations to the nation's military service academies, and holding Q&A's with constituents in Dana Point, this week has been full of great events all over our district.        See more on my Facebook page here.
 ￼
Tax Reform: What Do You Want To See?
Please take a few minutes to voice your opinion on what you think is most important to include in our upcoming tax reform plan.   Make Your Voice Heard!


Have a great week! Have an idea you want to share? Need help with an issue? Feel free to send me an email any time or contact my offices for help! 






Sincerely,
￼
Congressman Darrell Issa

8/21/17 17:25,Making the case for industrial hemp,"Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email
           
￼ 

Making the Case for Industrial Hemp
Industrial hemp isn’t a new crop. In fact, hemp production was prevalent at the very beginning of our nation. Our Founding Fathers grew hemp for its fiber, and it was one of the largest cash crops in Colonial America. Thomas Jefferson even directed that “an acre of the best ground” at his Poplar Forest estate in Bedford County be kept as a permanent hemp patch. More recently, during World War II the federal government created a “Hemp for Victory” campaign to encourage cultivation of hemp fiber for the war effort.  
￼
However, despite the thousands of uses for hemp, including fabrics, paper, auto parts, carpet, construction materials, food, nutritional supplements, and cosmetics, commercial production of industrial hemp is no longer legally allowed in the United States. Unfortunately, industrial hemp is often associated with its more well-known and dangerous cousin, marijuana. While marijuana is cultivated for its psychoactive effect, hemp is an agriculture crop cultivated for its fiber – you cannot get a “high” from it. The two varieties of cannabis are extremely different, and should not be lumped into the same category. 
Photo on the left: Examining fabric made from hemp fiber - one of the many uses of this crop.   Frankly, leaving commercial industrial hemp production in the United States off the table is a missed opportunity. Hemp products are popular in the United States, but because of our nation’s restrictions, they have to be imported from countries like Canada and China. Some studies show that the sale of hemp products in the United States totaled over $600 million in 2016. Why not allow farmers in Virginia and across the country to tap into this market potential?    I’ve met many Virginia farmers who are ready to commercially produce and create a market for industrial hemp in the United States, but outdated, though well-intentioned, federal restrictions on the cultivation and commercialization of this crop stand in the way. That’s why I recently introduced the bipartisan Industrial Hemp Farming Act along with Congressmen James Comer (R-Ky.), Jared Polis
￼
(D-Colo.), and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.). The Industrial Hemp Farming Act, which falls partly under the jurisdiction of the House Judiciary Committee, removes industrial hemp from the definition of a controlled substance and gives states the authority to carry out responsible hemp cultivation programs, should they so choose. The bill also permits increased research opportunities on hemp production at state departments of agriculture and universities.   Last year, I had the opportunity to visit the Rockingham County farm of a participant in James Madison University’s industrial hemp research program to see firsthand how this crop is grown and harvested (Pictured on the above). As I have talked with farmers and researchers and learned more about hemp’s uses, it has become abundantly clear to me that we should take steps to start the responsible commercial production of industrial hemp in the United States. The Industrial Hemp Farming Act is the product of many months of robust discussion between lawmakers and stakeholders. I look forward to moving this legislation through the House, and opening up a new opportunity for America’s farmers and economy.
NEW ￼ Rapid DNA Act signed into law! This bipartisan bill updates current law to allow Rapid DNA analysis machines to be used at local police stations. Rapid DNA technology expedites DNA analysis for suspect identification purposes and allows local law enforcement to accurately identify a suspect in 90 minutes.
Helping Out at Feeding America's Foodie Truck
 ￼
Recently, I had the opportunity to help out at Feeding America Southwest Virginia's new Cafe to Grow foodie truck. Over the summer, they've served lunch at several locations in the Roanoke community as part of their Summer Food Service Program. I joined them for a stop at the Boys and Girls Club. This is a great resource for the community.

On a tour of Dynamic Aviation in Rockingham County, I got to see the first plane designated ""Air Force One"" -- President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s plane, the Columbine II. Thanks to the team at Dynamic Aviation for showing me this piece of history!

Dear Friend, 
America’s tax code is now more than 2.4 million words long. To put that into perspective, the King James Bible is roughly 783,137 words – or less than one third as long as our tax code.
When the House returns to Washington in September, we will begin the process of passing comprehensive tax reform.
In just a few words, what that means for Missourians is lower taxes and a simpler filing process.
A streamlined process and lower rates for individuals and businesses means more time spent growing the economy and more money in the pockets of everyday Americans.
Need proof? A few recent studies have shown that Americans spend $99 billion each year complying with income tax requirements. That’s really outrageous. And it’s got to change.
At the end of the day, I'm a firm believer that the American people should decide how to spend their money – not the federal government. And federal regulations also shouldn’t be allowed to distract our focus away from growth and prosperity
Right now, with both Congress and the White House controlled by Republicans, we have a chance to pass the first comprehensive tax reform in 31 years.
What that means is pro-growth tax reform that will grow jobs and paychecks, make the tax code flatter and fairer for all Americans, and help middle-class families – not Washington special interests.
But again, the first priority here is simplification. And as a proponent of the Fair Tax system for years now, I’ve always felt that this is the most important part of any tax reform discussions. Simplification will continue to be my priority during discussions on tax reform, but with the opportunity to do something about as rare as a solar eclipse, I will continue working with my colleagues in Congress to pass commonsense, comprehensive, pro-growth tax reform. 
Sincerely,
￼ 
Sam Graves

After Charlottesville, Standing for Real American Values 
This last week, we all witnessed anti-American white supremacists in Charlottesville engage in acts of violence and terrorism that have no place in our society. Their campaign of hatred, racial bigotry, and anti-Semitism must be stopped before it provokes further violence. There should be no room for relativism when it comes to condemning the KKK and neo-Nazis, from the White House down to our communities.

As a father of young children, I strongly believe we must teach the next generation to stand up to intolerance and bigotry in all forms. Our ancestors fought to defend this American value, and it has helped us create the greatest country in the world. If we come together, there is nothing we can’t beat back.

To say as much, I joined friends and neighbors in Glen Rock for a vigil in honor of Charlottesville. Watch my remarks to the crowd HERE.

And to find more examples of our communities standing up to this violence, I encourage you to read these articles in the Herald and Record. 

￼

Helping a Real American Hero 
I was honored to help a veteran from the Greatest Generation and a hero, Calvin Wagner, who served our country in the Navy during World War II. He represents the fight for real American values. We helped deliver him the service medals that he never received -- more than seventy years later.

Our government's top priority must always be the security of our country and communities and having the backs of those who risk their lives to keep our families safe. That's why I voted in the House to support veterans, strengthen the VA, and get America's troops the much-needed pay raise they deserve.

I encourage other veterans and their families to contact to my office for any assistance by phone at (973) 814-4078 or or (201) 389-1100 or online at Gottheimer.House.Gov.

￼

Stabilizing the Health Care Market with Bipartisan Common Sense 
This week, the Trump Administration announced that it would be making its August cost-sharing payments, which help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans enrolled in individual healthcare plans under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). These payments are critical for keeping premiums from skyrocketing for all Americans on the market. I'm glad that the Administration is listening to the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus on making these payments to help stabilize the market, but we need long-term solutions in the form of our health care fix to guarantee long-term stability and prevent rate hikes.

To read more about our proposal, see Wednesday's story in the Record HERE. And to read more about the problem of rising premiums in New Jersey, read the Record's editorial ""ACA instability will cause premiums to spike.""

Dear Lindsey,  While the summer may be winding down, we just capped off an active week of events and visits throughout the Tenth District, including a federal budget workshop, tours of local businesses and health care organizations, and meetings with constituents at Neighborhood Office Hours in Grayslake, Waukegan, and Glenview.
We still have many great events coming up in the next week too. Please read on for invitations to our Service Academy Information Session and Senior Health Care Forum.
We’re also running a fun contest over the next week and a half to replace the cover photo on our Facebook and Twitter pages. Read below for rules on how to submit your photos of the Tenth District!
PROMOTING FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY
￼
Last week, we held a budget workshop at the Glenview Public Library in partnership with the non-partisan Concord Coalition. This was an opportunity to engage in a realistic discussion about the federal budget, examine how several recent policy proposals could impact our nation’s economy, debt and deficit, and work in small groups to formulate fiscal solutions. It also demonstrated it’s possible for us to disagree without turning disagreeable and find ways to work together and compromise toward a common goal.
Our debt is irresponsible and threatens the prosperity of future generations. A more sustainable budget will require difficult decisions, but we must not balance our budget on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens.
My thanks to everyone who came out to learn more. I hope you enjoyed this educational and engaging event as much as I did!
TENTH DISTRICT PHOTO CONTEST
￼
As the summer winds down, I’m holding a contest to replace the cover photo on my Facebook and Twitter profiles. Submit your original, high-quality photos to TenthDistrictPhotoContest@gmail.com. Please include your name and the location of the photo, which must be inside the Tenth District. We’re accepting submissions until Wednesday, August 30. I can’t wait to see what you submit!
Contest Rules: 
	•	Photos must be high-quality and taken in Illinois’ 10th District (check here: https://schneider.house.gov/about/our-district).
	•	Photos must be taken by the person submitting the photo.
	•	By submitting your photo to the contest, you give permission for Congressman Schneider to post the picture with credit to his Facebook page, Twitter page, and website.

DSU Announcement an Investment in South Dakota's Future August 21, 2017
Yesterday, Dakota State University (DSU) announced the grand opening of the Beacom Institute of Technology at Dakota State University and that a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) will be built on the campus, bringing additional cybersecurity opportunities to South Dakota.   DSU's role as a leader in cybersecurity is only strengthened by this announcement. Currently, 85 percent of DSU computing students leave South Dakota after completing their education. By building a new, state-of-the-art SCIF right here in Madison, our young people who earn degrees in cybersecurity or related fields will be able to work directly on national security and cyber issues without having to leave home. It is a testament to the incredible work being done by the faculty and students at DSU, the state of South Dakota for their continued support, and the generosity of Denny Sanford and Miles Beacom, whose belief in DSU's mission has led to this investment in its future.   As recent events have shown, the U.S. is not immune to cyber-attacks by hostile foreign actors. It is the newest, most sophisticated form of attack threatening our national security today with serious potential consequences. I am proud of DSU's role in protecting our nation against cyber threats and look forward to watching the campus continue to play a vital role in our national security efforts.

August in Wisconsin
Last week, I had a wonderful time visiting local businesses in Wisconsin's Sixth District.

I enjoyed a tour of the Apache Stainless Equipment Corporation in Beaver Dam, where I met with employees to discuss technical school, college loans and health care.

￼

￼

I also discussed health care services during two tours of healthcare facilites in the area, including Family Focus Eye Care and St. Agnes Hospital in Fond du Lac.

￼

￼

After traveling across the Sixth District, it was nice to stop by Smucker's in Ripon for a tasty treat. The Smucker's plant in Ripon produces the company's ice cream toppings. It was great to learn more about this American-made product!

August 20, 2017
Dear Friend, 
At a time when our country seems deeply divided, I am reminded of the words of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, “The point in history at which we stand is full of promise and danger. The world will either move forward toward unity and widely shared prosperity - or it will move apart.” Now is the time to come together, to celebrate our diversity, to be kind to one another and to uphold American values.  To be clear, the events of last weekend were a tragedy.  There is no room in our society for hatred, racism and white supremacy.  These are not American values, and groups like the KKK that seek to perpetuate these beliefs are abhorrent.  Furthermore, any group that advocates or engages in violence toward others should not be tolerated.  I will continue to work in a manner that focuses on what unites us as Americans and to represent all of my constituents to the best of my ability.  
I am also deeply saddened by the tragic events that occurred this weekend in Kissimmee, Jacksonville and Pennsylvania with the shooting of six law enforcement officers while in the line of duty.  Our brave law enforcement officers work hard every day in the face of grave danger to protect our community.  We must support them and their families. May the memory of the fallen officer in Kissimmee be eternal.  My thoughts and prayers are with each of the officers involved and their families.  
This has been a very active week for our nation and within our community.  I had the distinct privilege of meeting with many constituents throughout the district.  I’d like to thank these groups for the productive dialogue, and I promise to continue working on your behalf to accomplish our shared goals.  Read on for a quick wrap-up of my latest work this week. 
Celebrating Heroes Among Us
During my Heroes Among Us event, I was truly inspired by the stories of many outstanding leaders in our community. More than 70 everyday heroes were nominated for special recognition for their service to our community. I was humbled by their tales of bravery, selflessness and generosity of spirit. It was indeed an honor to be among so many special people to celebrate their tireless efforts. Here are just a few pictures from this great celebration!
￼￼￼

Providing a Legislative Update to Small Business Leaders at Chamber Events 
This week, I had the privilege to speak at both the Dade City Chamber of Commerce and the Tarpon Springs Chamber of Commerce to provide a brief Legislative Update.  I also had the opportunity to answer questions and learn about their priorities.  I look forward to working on the issues raised including: fighting for tax reform, addressing the opioid crisis, making an investment in infrastructure and championing health care reform.
￼￼
Snapshots from the District
 
￼
Touring the Pasco Hernando State College Aviation Program, which is preparing students for high skill/high wage jobs in a growing industry. 
￼
Visiting TRAK Microwave Corporation to learn about how the parts they engineer are used on military equipment and other aircraft.  Also had the opportunity to meet 170 of their employees, 20% of which are Veterans, to discuss industry issues.
￼
Always a pleasure to meet with my Veterans Advisory Committee to discuss issues facing the Veteran Community.  I look forward to working on fixing the problems we discussed. 
Upcoming Events
We have many exciting events coming up next week.  Please join us as we work to address pressing needs in our community!
￼
We will be having an important conversation about opioid abuse on Tuesday, August 22, 2017 starting at 11:45 a.m. at the Alliance for Substance Abuse meeting held at the Land O’ Lakes Community Center.  The address is 5401 Land O' Lakes Blvd, Land O Lakes, FL 34639.  Please join us if you or your loved one has been impacted by this crisis as we work to find innovative solutions to the problem.

8/21/17 15:01,"Carlos Curbelo Around the District: We’ve Already Fought This War, Tax Reform Work Moves Forward, Fighting for Flood Insurance, Door-to-Door in Florida City","
   
￼


Here’s what’s happening in the office of U.S. Representative Carlos Curbelo (FL-26):  

WE’VE ALREADY FOUGHT THIS WAR: Carlos shared his thoughts on the events in Charlottesville last weekend in his biweekly column for the South Dade News Leader. “Our nation's greatest generation and our freedom-loving allies put their lives on hold during World War II to defeat the hate-filled Nazi ideology that was the purest form of evil,” Carlos wrote. “Our nation, and the world have already fought this war. Hundreds of thousands, just like Benjamin Meadows, gave their lives for it. Unequivocally condemning the hate and violence in Charlottesville this weekend is the least we can do to honor their sacrifice.” Keep reading here.
 
￼
 
TAX REFORM WORK MOVES FORWARD: On the 31st anniversary of the last major overhaul of our tax code, Carlos joined fellow Ways and Means Committee members  in Santa Barbara, California to address the American people from President Ronald Reagan’s ranch about the importance of delivering pro-growth tax reform in 2017. As reported in the Miami Herald, Carlos is the sole South Florida representative on the tax writing Committee and has been working on comprehensive, permanent tax reform that would help South Florida families and small businesses keep more money in their pockets. Watch Carlos’ remarks from Rancho del Cielo here.
 
￼
 
IRRESPONSIBLE WASTE OF TAXPAYER $$: Carlos criticized the President’s decision to sign an Executive Order rolling back the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard that requires the construction of federal property take future sea level rise and flooding into account. “When you’re on the front lines like South Florida, we know the importance of having more resilient building codes to protect our infrastructure, especially when taxpayer dollars are used,” Carlos said. “This Executive Order is not fiscally conservative, it’s irresponsible, and it will lead to taxpayer dollars being wasted on projects that may not be built to endure the flooding we are already seeing and know is only going to get worse.”
 
FIGHTING FOR FLOOD INSURANCE: Carlos reaffirmed his commitment to a flood insurance re-authorization that works for South Florida in a conversation with Keys Weekly.
 
 ￼ 
PERMANENT SOLUTION FOR HAITIAN FAMILIES: Carlos held a roundtable discussion with constituents and local stakeholders to exchange ideas about the future of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians. Carlos reiterated his support for an 18-month extension of TPS for Haitians and said it may be time to consider a permanent, legislative solution given their critical contributions to the Florida economy. Watch the exclusive coverage from WPLG Local 10 News here.
 
￼
 
RUNWAY CONSTRUCTION: Carlos announced an $894,900 U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) grant for taxiway construction at the Miami Executive Airport (TMB). “Miami Executive Airport is a hub for general aviation in South Florida, and this grant will help ensure it remains equipped with the proper resources and technology to maintain the safety of all passengers and airport personnel,” Carlos said. Learn more here.
 
DOOR-TO-DOOR IN FLORIDA CITY: Carlos joined Walking One Stop, an initiative that brings local, state and federal officials into communities that have been affected by crime to offer assistance with government services, in Florida City last week. Curbelo and his staff were joined by officers from the Miami-Dade Police Department and staff from local and state organizations as well as several South Florida non-profit organizations. The group offered community residents on-site employment search assistance, free HIV testing, and assistance navigating state and federal agencies. “Listening to the community and helping constituents in need is the most important responsibility my staff and I have, and I was glad to share that with my daughters today as they joined me going door-to-door,” Carlos said.

Dear Friends,

I am writing to highlight some recent items in our community that you may be interested in. 

1. Fighting for Programs that Grow Good-Paying Jobs 
2. Strengthening and Improving Affordable Healthcare 
3. Meeting with the Mayors of the Third Congressional District 
4. Defending the Priorities of Older Americans 
5. Town Hall on Jobs and the Economy


Fighting for Programs that Grow Good-Paying Jobs 

￼
Congresswoman DeLauro visits Proton Onsite to learn about how they use the Advance Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) grant to grow good-paying jobs in the Third Congressional District. 

I visited Proton Onsite in Wallingford to tour their facility and learn about the work they have been doing with support of Advance Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) grants from the Department of Energy. ARPA-E grants enable energy researchers to create good-paying jobs by advancing high-impact energy technologies for new ways to generate, store and use energy.

Proton On-Site was awarded a $2.5 million ARPA-E grant to develop a high-efficiency hydrogen-iron flow battery, which can be recharged using grid electricity or through exposure to sunlight. The project began in May 2015, and will continue until 2019. 

Under the Congressional Republican’s budget, ARPA-E funding has been completely eliminated. This will have profound negative consequences for job creation and the future of these energy projects. Congress must support programs that support innovation and create jobs across the country. 

Strengthening and Improving Affordable Healthcare

￼
Congresswoman DeLauro stands with Jim Wadleigh of Access Health CT, Ted Doolittle, Connecticut’s Healthcare Advocate, and Mayor Toni Harp as they discuss ways to strengthen and improve access to affordable healthcare. 

I stood with healthcare leaders in Connecticut to call for important reforms to the Affordable Care Act after Senate Republicans failed to pass their healthcare repeal bill. 

We have an opportunity to write the next chapter on healthcare in this country: one characterized by cooperation and reforms that make coverage more affordable for working families. Congress must bring down the cost of premiums and deductibles. It should reduce the uncertainty and unpredictability in the insurance marketplaces by preserving the Cost-Sharing Reduction payments and creating a new reinsurance program. And it should bring down the price of prescription drugs, which are driving up insurance rates.

To lower premiums and deductibles, Congress should create robust reinsurance programs in order to help insurers manage the risk of insuring enrollees with high medical expenses. The Affordable Care Act created a temporary reinsurance program when the bill was passed. Since that program expired, premiums have increased, making it clear that we need a permanent reinsurance program, similar to what Congress created for Medicare Part D. Congress should also include a public option on the healthcare exchanges and reduce the Medicare eligibility age to 55. 

Congress must work together on healthcare reforms like these that will benefit all working families, making their care more affordable and accessible. 

Meeting with the Mayors of the Third Congressional District

￼
Congresswoman DeLauro hosts the leaders of municipalities across the district for their annual discussion of the most pressing issues in their communities. 

Every year, the leaders of towns and municipalities across the Third Congressional District convene to discuss the most pressing issues facing their communities. The Mayors shared their top priorities and asked questions about funding opportunities at the federal level, and learned more about what is going on in Washington and how it may affect their towns. 

We discussed priorities ranging from public safety to grants, social services, education and veterans issues. 

As always, my office in New Haven is ready to assist constituents on any number of issues they may face. Last year we opened nearly 1,600 new cases for families dealing with everything from problems with the IRS and VA to those who were having trouble with their mortgages and utilities. We were able to secure more than $665,000 in one-time payments, and more than $249,000 in recurring monthly or annual payments. 

Defending the Priorities of Older Americans

￼ 
Congresswoman DeLauro hosts a discussion at the Dixwell-Newhallville Seniors Club at the Bethel AME church on the issues most pressing to our communities' seniors. 

I was proud to join the Dixwell-Newhallville Seniors Club at the Bethel AME Church to discuss federal programs that support older Americans. 

It is a critical moment for programs that affect older Americans. Congress must to pursue public policy that upholds our promise to seniors through Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and social safety net programs like Meals on Wheels and LIHEAP. 

We discussed proposed cuts to Medicaid, which would result in older Americans in nursing homes losing a lifeline. Supporting our parents, our grandparents, and the millions of Americans who have worked their entire lives should be a top priority for all leaders in this country. 

Many people asked questions about Senior Nutrition and Meals on Wheels, which the House Bill continues funding in 2018. According to Meals on Wheels, in Connecticut, approximately 22,600 seniors are served by Meals on Wheels Program — over two million meals. In Connecticut, federal funding supplies 42 percent of the cost of Meals on Wheels in Connecticut. Congress has an obligation not just to maintain the funding we have now for these programs, but to increase our resources to meet the growing need of our seniors. 

Town Hall on Jobs and the Economy 

￼
Congresswoman DeLauro hosts a Town Hall discussion about economic policies that can strengthen local communities. 

Members of our community joined me at the Hagaman Memorial Library in East Haven for a town hall discussion.

At the town hall, a panel of experts from both Connecticut and Washington addressed the ways in which we can support and rebuild our communities, create jobs with high incomes through improving our nation’s infrastructure, and enact public policy that supports keeping good paying jobs from being shipped overseas. 

The biggest economic challenge of our time is that too many people are in jobs that do not pay them enough to live on. We need a country that works for the middle class and the vulnerable, not just the wealthy and those with the most lobbyists. 

Congress must enact policy that ensures that everyone can benefit from the economic recovery, and that everyone has the skills training they need to get good jobs with high wages. Right now, we grow jobs, but not incomes. We are shrinking, not growing, the middle class. Continued input from the community will be crucial as Congress focuses on creating an agenda that supports income growth for all Americans. 

Sincerely,

￼
Rosa DeLauro

8/21/17 14:47,Israel: Maintaining Our Unique Bond,"￼ 
August 21, 2017

Dear Friend, 

It is a top priority to make sure Mississippians and all Americans are safe. As we continue our work in Congress to rebuild our national defense readiness capabilities, we must also focus on the relationships we build and maintain with our allies. If there is a threat to our country or theirs, we have to have a spirit of cooperation - and a joint plan of action.

We have that relationship with Israel, America's most reliable friend and democratic ally in the Middle East. At the invitation of the American Israel Education Foundation (AIEF), my colleagues and I traveled to Israel recently to discuss our shared commitment to democracy and freedom. We talked with commanders and soldiers at Israeli Air Force Bases who experience firsthand the threats and turmoil in the Middle East. We examined their rocket defense systems which are supported by the best technology has to offer. We traveled to Israel's borders with Lebanon and Syria to view checkpoints, their last lines of defense.

We have much we can learn from this young, powerful nation. The conversations we've had and will continue to have will be our best defense in this dangerous world. 

NORTH MISSISSIPPI VETERANS MEMORIAL CEMETERY

Last week, I joined federal, state and local officials for the dedication of the North Mississippi Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Kilmichael. It is the second state veterans cemetery in the state and the fifth in a network of state and federal veterans cemeteries in Mississippi. The cemetery is a special tribute to those who proudly wore an American uniform and served our nation. Following the ceremony, my colleagues and I unveiled the interpretative plaque for the carillon, the centerpiece of the cemetery. The inscription describes what the carillon represents - the strength and resolve of those who defend our great nation.

￼
                                           
Every service that takes place will be an opportunity to recognize veterans once more for their service to America. Sue Donnelly was among the hundreds of people who came to the dedication ceremony. Her husband, Retired Chief Warrant Officer 4 (CWO4) Eugene Donnelly, was the first veteran to be interned at the cemetery. His funeral was held today.   

￼
Sue Donnelly and Laura Lee Donnelly Smith

Laura Lee Donnelly Smith, CWO4 Donnelly's daughter, said her father was the most patriotic person she's ever known. ""I'm very proud of him,"" Mrs. Smith said.  ""He loved every minute of his service which included fighting in the Korean War and 32 years in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves."" 


LIBRARY OF CONGRESS HISTORY PROJECT

Every person who has served our nation in times of war has a story to tell. We want to hear them. Earlier this year, William Brooks became our Veterans Outreach Coordinator. He travels throughout the First District assessing the needs of veterans who may need assistance through our office.

￼
William Brooks interviews WWII Veteran 
Harold Turner of Okolona

William is also working on a special project with the Library of Congress. He is interviewing veterans to record the details of their service. He captures their stories on video for the Veterans History Project of the American Folklife Center. His work will be placed in the archives so that future generations may hear directly from veterans to understand the realities of war. He recently interviewed Harold Turner, a WWII veteran and Okolona native. William, an Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran, says he is honored to talk to others who have fought to protect the freedoms we all enjoy. For more information about the project and to recommend a veteran, send William an email at William.Brooks@mail.house.gov or call him at (662) 687-3518.


VIETNAM VETERAN LLOYD YOUNG

Mississippi's Vietnam veterans hold a special place in my heart. So many fought for our nation, but did not return home to a hero's welcome. They deserve our upmost respect for their courage and bravery. Recently, I met Lloyd Young, a Vietnam veteran who lives in Eupora. He trained to become a helicopter pilot in the U.S. Army and served in Vietnam from 1968 until 1969. It was during one of his many dangerous missions to rescue wounded soldiers that his helicopter was shot down over south Vietnam. Lloyd is proud of the training he received in the military which led to his next job back home. He was one of the first helicopter rescue pilots in Mississippi.

￼

Lloyd is among the thousands of Vietnam veterans nationwide who are being honored in a special way. As part of the 50th commemoration of the Vietnam War, he will be eligible to receive a book called A Time To Honor: Stories of Service, Duty, and Sacrifice. Last week, Governor Phil Bryant announced that Vietnam veterans can begin the process to request a free copy by calling the Mississippi Veterans Affairs Board at (601) 576-4850. 
 

LISTENING TO OUR CONSTITUENTS

The best part of being your First District Representative is being able to spend time with you. We will continue to travel throughout the district during the month of August to listen to your concerns. The best way to affect change on Capitol Hill is to begin with your suggestions on issues of national defense, the economy, healthcare, and burdensome regulations.

More Chaos on the Obamacare Exchanges
The health insurance provider Anthem has decided to stop selling individual insurance plans on Virginia’s Obamacare exchange next year. It will also stop selling off-exchange individual plans, except in Washington and Scott Counties and the City of Bristol. As I write this column, information had not been released as to what individual plans will be available for purchase off the exchange. Optima Insurance will replace Anthem in selling individual plans on the exchange, but Anthem’s customers will have to go through the process of finding new plans from this insurer. It is unavoidable that many Virginians will have to start over in finding a health insurance plan.
Unfortunately, Virginia is only the latest state to have major insurers stop selling plans to its citizens. In Iowa earlier this year, the entire state appeared likely to lack options to buy health plans. The state asked for a waiver from the Federal Government to alter big parts of Obamacare in order to keep insurers selling plans. With that waiver pending, a single insurer eventually agreed to participate in the exchange, but it proposed a rate increase of 57 percent for next year.
In Tennessee this past February, Humana pulled out of exchanges in the Knoxville area, threatening to leave people in that part of Tennessee with no options at all. Three months later, another insurer, BlueCross BlueShield, provisionally agreed to sell individual plans on the Knoxville-area exchanges, but even then, it placed conditions before finally agreeing to sell.
These examples suggest what the future of the health insurance market may look like in Virginia. I hope Governor McAuliffe’s administration will work hard to find a replacement provider for those who purchase individual plans off the exchange. But the larger point is that Obamacare has turned topsy-turvy the health insurance coverage of many Americans, which is why I will continue to work for its repeal. We can find better solutions to improve coverage and lower costs.

Right to Try
Recently, the Senate passed a bill sponsored by Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) permitting “right-to-try.” I strongly support the idea of right-to-try, and I have sponsored a bill in the House of Representatives that would put this idea into law.
What is right-to-try? It allows patients with life-threatening illnesses who are out of options to try treatments that have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If someone facing a terminal illness tries everything FDA has approved without success, what does he or she have to lose by trying something else, as long as he or she knows the risks?
According to the Goldwater Institute, 37 states already have right-to-try laws, and Senator Johnson’s bill passed the Senate unanimously. While my bill and Senator Johnson’s are not identical, I am pleased that the concept of right-to-try is gaining attention and support. It’s a common-sense option that might bring relief to people otherwise facing the end.
Housing for Veterans
I was honored to participate in a dedication ceremony on August 16 for Freedom Lane in Wytheville. This housing development was built with the needs of veterans in mind, including those who were wounded in their country’s service. The development includes 24 one and two-bedroom units, and half are already occupied by veterans and their families. All of these units are handicap-accessible, with some adapted to serve those with more specific and severe injuries, such as sight and hearing loss. They stand less than a mile away from Wytheville’s VA community clinic.
I applaud Randy Martin, the Executive Director of the Wytheville Redevelopment and Housing Authority, and the Board of the authority, who are the owners and developers of this project. They saw a need for affordable housing in Southwest Virginia for veterans and worked with local, state, and federal authorities to achieve this goal. The brand new units on Freedom Lane are a symbol of our appreciation to the men and women who have served and a practical way to improve their quality of life.

8/21/17 14:03,This Week in Georgia-12,"￼ 
THIS WEEK IN GEORGIA-12
 Congress is now three weeks in to our five week district work period. This is my favorite time of year because I get to meet with amazing people across the 12th district! In this week’s newsletter I’ve included some of the people, places and businesses I’ve visited this month.

￼

AT&T made an exciting announcement in #GA12!

(You can call 877-990-0041 to see if this service is available for your home or business.)
I visited the East Georgia Health Center in Millen. 
￼

They recently received a Federal grant which allowed them to open this much-needed health center. With the shortage of doctors and nurses in rural Georgia, health centers like this one are invaluable to our communities!
I also visited the Effingham Health System.
￼
They gave me a tour of their facility including their new Cancer Center.
I stopped by the Sylvania Rotary club to give them a “DC update.” Thanks for having me!
￼

I also traded in my suit jacket for a Starbucks green apron in Augusta!
￼

￼
I went to Starbucks where I spoke with their leadership team and employees about their recent expansion in Augusta.  I also met with some veterans who work with Starbucks; it was great to hear about their dedication to supporting our nation’s heroes.  They also let me try my hand at being a barista!
I met with my constituents impacted by Alzheimer’s disease.
￼

I volunteered with Meals on Wheels to help deliver meals in Augusta. I met so many wonderful seniors in our community! 

￼

 I joined the Reidsville Rotary Club for lunch and spoke to them about how I am working hard on behalf of my constituents in Washington!
￼

When I was in Vidalia I sat down with Zack Fowler for a radio interview. 
￼
I visited Dot Foods in Vidalia.
￼
I stopped by Wheeler County Middle and High School.
￼

￼
I had the opportunity to meet with administrators to learn more about issues they may be facing and how we can assist at the federal level.

I was also able to tour Best Line Door and Sash in Ailey.
￼

I learned more about the work they do, and met their wonderful employees!
Don’t forget – today  all of North America will be treated to a solar eclipse!

8/21/17 13:51,Remove Confederate Symbols of Hate!,"￼

Congressman 
 Adriano Espaillat 
 13th Congressional District of New York
 Reps Espaillat and Evans Introduce Anti-Hate Legislation Following Charlotteville Violence to Prevent Federal Funds to Support Monuments to Slavery or White Supremacy
 Congressman Adriano Espaillat released the following statement regarding his bill, the No Federal Funding for Confederate Symbols Act, which would prohibit Federal funds from being used to create, maintain, or display, as applicable, any Confederate symbol on Federal public land, including any highway, park, subway, Federal building, military base, street, or other Federal property.  “The Confederate Battle Flag is one of the most controversial symbols from U.S. history, signifying a representation of racism, slavery, the oppression of African Americans, and one of the darkest periods of our country’s past,” said Rep. Adriano Espaillat. “We entered a new chapter in American history following the violence and death that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia, at the hands of torch-bearing white supremacists following the city’s decision to remove symbols of its Confederate lineage.”   “American history includes the history of African-Americans. The suffering our ancestors faced and their survival is well documented throughout history, however, Confederate symbols, such as the Confederate Battle Flag, were used during the Jim Crow era to display dominance and intimidate African-Americans. These hateful symbols are a constant reminder of what our ancestors endured. No federal funding should be utilized for any Confederate symbol on Federal public lands. If we want our nation to heal and move forward, we must remove these abhorrent symbols at once,” said Rep. Dwight Evans (PA-02).  There are at least 1,503 remaining symbols of the Confederacy in public spaces, including 109 public schools named after prominent Confederates, many with large African-American student populations; more than 700 Confederate monuments and statues on public property throughout the country, the vast majority in the South that include 96 monuments in Virginia, 90 in Georgia, and 90 in North Carolina. Additionally, there are 17 U.S. military bases named in honor of Confederate military leaders that include: Fort Rucker (Gen. Edmund Rucker) in Alabama; Fort Benning (Brig. Gen. Henry L. Benning) and Fort Gordon (Maj. Gen. John Brown Gordon) in Georgia; Camp Beauregard (Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard) and Fort Polk (Gen. Leonidas Polk) in Louisiana; Fort Bragg (Gen. Braxton Bragg) in North Carolina; Fort Hood (Gen. John Bell Hood) in Texas; and, Fort A.P. Hill (Gen. A.P. Hill), Fort Lee (Gen. Robert E. Lee), and Fort Pickett (Gen. George Pickett) in Virginia.  Added Rep. Espaillat in conclusion, “We recognize these symbols for what they are and for the abhorrence they represent, still today. Charlottesville serves as a reminder that we can make a difference, and my bill would cut funding and the lifeblood from any Confederate symbol on Federal public land, once and for all, to prevent the hateful violent legacy of the Confederacy from continuing to rear its ugly hate. We defeated the Confederacy once, and we must be willing to defeat it once again, now and forever, as the tribute to the legacy we leave behind for the next generation.”  The full text of the bill may be read here.  
Nearly 30 Federal Legislators Have Signed on as ""Cosponsors"" of the 
No Federal Funding for Confederate Symbols Act: 

Rep. Dwight Evans, Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, 
Rep. G. K. Butterfield,
Rep. Mark Pocan, Rep. Yvette D. Clarke, Rep. Katherine Clark, Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Rep. Keith Ellison, Rep. Karen Bass, Rep. Frederica Wilson, Rep. Frank Pallone, Rep. Nita M. Lowey, Rep.

""We shouldn't have monuments to our darker times and must remove these symbols of hate from our community once and for all."" - Rep. Adriano Espaillat during a press conference calling for the removal of the J. Marion Sims statue located in Central Park.

National Action Network (NAN)
""The Confederate symbol is a stain of hate, white supremacy, and divisiveness that should not be celebrated in American history, but instead condemned at every opportunity. Instead of clinging to our dark past, we as a country must focus on the issues that promote an inclusive future -- protecting voting rights, supporting health care, and standing up against police brutality and poverty. In the wake of the Charlottesville attack, the National Action Network is pleased to support this legislation as a symbol of progress against the hate and bigotry on display over the weekend."" - Rev. Al Sharpton, Founder & President, National Action Network (NAN)

League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC)

American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
“Confederate symbols represent racism and slavery. They should be removed from public spaces, and the government should in no way endorse or fund them. With legitimate exceptions for educational and museum displays, this bill finds the right balance between blocking expressions of hate and and respecting the free speech rights of those with whom we disagree.” - Faiz Shakir, National Political Director, American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)

Defending Rights and Dissent

Dems unveil bill to ban Confederate monuments on federal property, featured in The Hill - A pair of House Democrats unveiled legislation on Thursday that would prohibit the use of taxpayer funds to display Confederate symbols on federal property. That would include locations such as the Capitol, military bases, highways, parks and streets maintained by the federal government. Democratic Reps. Adriano Espaillat (N.Y.) and Dwight Evans (Pa.) are introducing the bill amid renewed furor over whether Confederate statues in the Capitol and localities across the nation should be taken down.  Harlem’s Adriano Espaillat Introduce Anti-Hate Bill Following Charlottesville Violence, featured in Harlem World - The No Federal Funding for Confederate Symbols Act, which would prohibit Federal funds from being used to create, maintain, or display, as applicable, any Confederate symbol on Federal public land, including any highway, park, subway, Federal building, military base, street, or other Federal property.  # # #  First elected to Congress in 2016, Rep. Adriano Espaillat is serving his first term in Congress where he serves as a member of the influential U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, and the House Select Committee on Small Business. He is a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) and serves in a leadership role as CHC Freshman Representative to the Democratic Caucus.

￼
It’s Time to Restore Our Democracy - and get Secret Dark Money out of Politics
￼  Click on the screen above to hear me explain why the integrity of our democracy depends on ridding our political process of secret “dark” special interest money.  
Dear Friend, 
The Restore Democracy Revolution
Secret, “dark”, special interest money is an invasive species that infests every nook and cranny of our campaigns and elections, rigging the system for the Wall Street billionaires and powerful forces behind those contributions. We’ve got to put a stop to it. The integrity of our public policymaking process and the very survival of our democracy are at stake in this fight. So the foundation of our Restore Democracy legislation lies in overturning the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision. 
Citizens United granted corporations and other legal entities the right to free speech – just as people have – under the First Amendment. By doing so, the Court opened federal election campaigns to the free flow of enormous amounts of secret “dark” money into phony advocacy groups set up by special interest contributors. Those groups, in turn, buy hateful TV ads that distort the truth, denigrate candidates, discourage voter turnout and destroy people’s confidence in our public policy making process.
As I’ve pointed out many times before, it’s time to establish once and for all that corporations are not “people,” money is not “free speech,” and the formation of our laws and policies must not be up for sale to the highest corporate bidders.
Moreover, the need many members of Congress feel to spend 20 to 30 hours a week “dialing for dollars” to defend themselves against false and misleading campaign advertising has all but transformed Congress from the greatest deliberative and law-making body in the world into a mid-level telemarketing operation. With so little time left for governing, Congress has become less productive than at any time in history, while campaigns have literally become 365 day a year operations.
While we continue to build support to overturn Citizens United, I’m also working hard across the aisle to pass the Stop Act to prohibit members of Congress from directly asking donors for campaign money. When you go to Washington you should go to work on the people’s business – not your re-election campaign. 
The Restore Democracy Revolution
By themselves, any of the measures in our Restore Democracy bill would constitute a major boost for our democratic process. Taken together, they are nothing short of revolutionary in scope. 
The foundation lies in putting a stop to special interests spending unlimited amounts of secret money to influence government and elections. Our legislation would also put Congress on record supporting small donor-public campaign financing and limiting the campaign season. Moreover, we are calling for full disclosure of all campaign contributions, establishment of national online voter registration and a halt to all voter suppression.
We also call for a return to Congress’s traditional process of Regular Order. Under Regular Order, we compromise and find bipartisan solutions by fully considering every idea and amendment under an open rule – and affording each one an up or down vote. That’s how Congress fixed things, solved problems and got things done for more than 200 years. It’s time to get back to that tried and true method of serving the American people.   We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email.
Sincerely, ￼

GOP Attacks Clean Water Rule and Jeopardizes America’s Drinking Water
￼  The Clean Water Rule is intended to protect wetlands, rivers and streams that feed into drinking water sources for one in three Americans. 
The Clean Water Rule that protects drinking water for some 117 million Americans is under attack by the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress, and I’ve joined more than 100 of my colleagues in an effort to stop them. Specifically, the President has ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to rescind the Obama Administration rule clarifying that the Clean Water Act of 1972 covers rivers, streams and wetlands that feed into drinking water sources like Lake Superior and the Mississippi River. 
Last week, we urged EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to immediately halt efforts to dismantle the Rule, and instead work with Congress to fix what needs fixing to ensure the integrity of the natural resources we depend on for drinking water and recreation. I’ve been a long, strong and consistent supporter of the Clean Water Act, and I voted against Republican legislation to repeal the Clean Water Rule. 
Based on facts, science, and input from more than 1 million Americans, the Clean Water Rule simply recognizes that pollution in unprotected streams and wetlands threatens the health of the lakes and rivers we use for drinking water, along with swimming, boating and outdoor recreation. It’s a common sense measure that supports public health and an outdoor recreation economy that underpins nearly 8 million good paying jobs and $887 billion in annual consumer spending across our Nation. 
As we pointed out to Administrator Pruitt, some opponents of the Clean Water Rule have used fear and scare tactics to confuse the public – stating that the Rule includes new requirements for agriculture and covers puddles, drainage ditches and stock watering ponds on dry lands. That’s simply not true. In fact, the Rule clarifies the Clean Water Act, and maintains sensible and necessary exemptions to protect precious natural resources and the health of our farm economy in rural America. It’s solid public policy that should be embraced by Republicans, Democrats and the American people.

Trump Administration Takes Wordy Approach to Climate Change
￼  The Trump Administration may be confused about climate change, but the message from these Americans is clear. Climate change is real, it is man-made and the survival of our planet is at stake in addressing it.
Can climate change be addressed simply by changing what the Trump Administration calls it? Apparently that’s the strategy. After the President referred to climate change as part of an elaborate Chinese hoax and ordered the U.S. out of the worldwide Paris climate agreement, the Administration laid down new rules to alter the jargon federal agencies use in emails, websites, letters and policy positions.
The new wordings would be downright humorous if the Administration’s ignorant and dangerous approach to climate change and global warming didn’t affect the very survival of our planet and life as we know it.
The Pulitzer Prize winning Guardian online publication covering U.S. and world events obtained a series of emails circulating through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service pinpointing changes like these. If you find them confusing and ridiculous, you’re not wrong, or alone. 
Under the new Administration rules, “climate change” has been switched to “weather extremes,” and “climate change adaptation” to “resilience to weather extremes.” 
The term “reduce greenhouse gasses,” which rightly suggests that human beings have caused global warming, has been changed to “build solid organic matter and increase nutrient use efficiency.” And the term “sequester carbon,” fancy lingo for reducing our carbon footprint, has been officially replaced by “build soil organic matter.”  
So there we have it. Instead of using science, facts and overwhelming evidence to address man-made climate change, the Administration is relying on words. That’s not much of a strategy.

Our Week in Crane Lake
￼  ￼  We toured the Customs and Border Patrol facility in Crane Lake with Darrell Scott, owner of Scott's on Crane Lake, a local resort on the Canadian Border.
￼￼  In the top picture, Mark Anderson, owner of Anderson Outfitters on Crane Lake, shows me his operation. Joining our tour in the picture directly above was (left to right) Bruce Besty, Voyageur Country ATV, Gary Cerkvenik, Yours Truly, Mark Anderson, Owner of Anderson Outfitters, and Bill Congdon.
￼  ￼  In the picture directly above, I’m reviewing a map of Voyageurs National Park during our meeting with local officials and community leaders at Voyagaires Lodge on Crane Lake. In the top picture,  Voyageurs National Park Facility Manager, Bill Carlson, reviews a number of important issues facing  the Park.
￼  It was great to take a boat tour of the Voyageurs National Park Visitor Center Site with Gary Cerkvenik (back) and Bill Congdon, our driver.
 Our Week in Grand Rapids
￼  Modern, 21st Century mining relies on remarkable new technologies to protect our precious water and other natural resources. While visiting Grand Rapids, we met with Rob Scarlett (middle) and  Jeff Hansen (right) of Clearwater Layline, LLC for a demonstration of their new Bioreactor Sulfate Reduction Technology.   
￼  I love to stop and sample great local restaurants and watering holes on my travels through the 8th District. After our meeting on new mining technologies, Rob Scarlett, Jeff Hanson and I enjoyed lunch at Mad Dogs in Grand Rapids. 
Our Week in Duluth
￼  Under no condition or circumstance should the President of the United States be giving cover to white supremacists, the KKK, white nationalists or any hate group. That was my message after the president’s response to the tragic events in Charlottesville, Virginia, and that was the message at this vigil the Duluth chapter of the NAACP held last Tuesday.
￼  Protect Minnesota, a group dedicated to the prevention of gun violence, presented me with this shield, signed by their members, in recognition of our work in Congress to stop gun violence while protecting our Second Amendment rights.
￼  It was also great to meet with these local members of the Everytown for Gun Safety organization during our afternoon in the Duluth Congressional office. 
Our Week in Proctor 
￼  Our District Director, Jeff Anderson, spoke on my behalf at Saturday’s ceremony naming Proctor as an official Minnesota Yellow Ribbon community - welcoming our military Veterans home and providing them with all the support and help a grateful city and Nation can provide.
Our Week in Virginia 
￼  Defeating Alzheimer’s is one of the great challenges of our time, and hats off to each and every one of the scores of people who devoted their Saturday morning to the cause by participating in the March to Remember in Virginia. In my letter to the crowd, I pointed out that we have dramatically increased funding for Alzheimer’s research at the National Institutes of Health to $1.3 billion this year. We are absolutely determined to find a cure for this disease that robs humankind of so much life and potential.
Our Week in Pine City
￼  Pine Technical and Community College in Pine City held a graduation ceremony for the first eight women to complete 120 hours of a welding course designed to give them entry level proficiency skills to become welders, which is part of a Minnesota DEED Equity Grant to encourage women to enter non traditional fields. The goal is to provide 84 women the opportunity to learn welding at various locations in small class settings.

Coming Up in Minnesota
This week:
	•	We’ll be continuing our travels throughout Minnesota’s 8th Congressional District this week, meeting with local business and community leaders and folks from all walks of life. I get some of my best ideas visiting with the people I’m so proud to represent, so if you see me in your community please take a few minutes to stop and chat.

Finally...
A College Reminder!
￼
Just a reminder - if you have a high school senior in the family who’s looking toward college, the application process starts this fall. In Congress, I’m working hard to make college more affordable and lower the cost of federally insured student loans. And last week, I joined my daughter Katherine and her daughters for a day that included a college visit for Katherine, Anne and me. Anne, sitting across from me, will be starting her senior year in high school in just a few days. Time flies!

Friend,

Across Ohio's Second District -- as I sit down and talk with small business owners, manufacturers, restaurant owners, and other constituents -- I've heard three common requests when it comes to tax reform:
	•	Competitive. Right now America has the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. Our employers need to be able to compete on a global scale -- which is why we need to lower the corporate tax rate to 20%.  
	•	Comprehensive. The tax code hasn't been overhauled since 1986. To say it is complex and convoluted is an understatement. At this point, it doesn't just need a tweak here and there - we need to streamline the entire code into a 21st century, pro-growth system that benefits everyone, from families to employers.  
	•	Concrete. Uncertainty cripples small businesses -- what our employers need is permanent reform, so they can plan for growth and success 5, 10, 20 years down the road.
Congress has already begun to work towards tax reform. If you're interested in learning more and staying up to date as the process moves forward, here are a few more resources:
	•	Better Way | A full task force report on why we need tax reform.
	•	Update from my Office | Answering your questions on tax reform.
	•	Ways and Means | Follow the committee that's rewriting the code.
	•	Joint Statement | The latest from the leaders of tax reform.
	•	Made In America | Why tax reform with allow job growth here in America. 
Yours in service,

ABOUT BRADLEY | HOW CAN I HELP | CONTACT BRADLEY | WANT TO RECEIVE MY UPDATES?
￼

Dear Lindsey,
As soon as I was elected to Congress, I heard about and realized the need for a new VA outpatient clinic in Mobile. The current facility on Springhill Avenue is outdated and was never intended to serve as a VA clinic. With over 11,000 veterans using the Mobile Clinic each year, we must ensure the clinic is a first-class facility.
So, I went to work. I held meetings with VA officials, sent leaders to VA leadership, and demanded action. Thankfully, the persistence paid off last week as we finally broke ground on the new VA outpatient clinic.
￼
The new, 65,000 square feet clinic will be conveniently located right off I-10 in Tillman’s Corner. This location should be easy for local veterans to access, and the clinic will have adequate public parking.
The new clinic will provide space for primary care, audiology and speech pathology, education, eye clinics, mental health, patient advocacy, radiology, Veterans’ Service Organizations, and women’s health. 
The clinic should be up and running by the end of 2018 or early 2019, depending on construction conditions. Rest assured, I will continue to provide diligent oversight throughout the construction process to ensure things move forward.
Week in Review
It was a pleasure to kick off another exciting week in the First District with a shrimp boil hosted by the Society of American Military Engineers (SAME) and the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) in Daphne. I enjoy visiting with this group every year and updating them on my priorities in Congress.
It is imperative that Congress address the serious infrastructure needs in our country, like the I-10 Bridge project.  It was great hearing from the experts and discussing infrastructure and tax reform with members of the Associated General Contractors Alabama Mobile Section, Mobile County Roadbuilders, and Baldwin County Roadbuilders.  
I also had the opportunity to visit my alma mater, UMS-Wright, for a special ceremony honoring a local veteran. Additionally, I spoke to members of the Mobile Bay Area Apartment Association about issues important to the housing industry, like flood insurance and tax reform.
￼
Last week, I also joined my friends from the Associated Builders & Contractors (ABC) of Alabama for a briefing and tour of a local construction site.  During my visit, we discussed important issues like workforce development, infrastructure, and labor issues.
Also on Friday, I gathered economic development officials from the six counties in the First District for a lunch at Felix's on the Causeway. There is a lot of economic development activity all around Southwest Alabama, especially in manufacturing and technology. I reaffirmed my pledge to always help our local economic developers as they work to bring new businesses to our area.
￼
On Friday, I held a roundtable discussion with representatives from local credit unions. As is common with most groups these days, we discussed tax reform, while also talking about data breeches and cyber security issues. I am committed to doing my part to support local credit unions because they are so important to many people in our area. 
 ￼
This weekend, I had the opportunity to go Red Snapper fishing with my two sons, Patrick and Colin. It is wonderful to be able to fish for Red Snapper in August again, but we must keep working to permanently resolve the issues impacting our local fishermen.

While back in the First District, I will continue spending time visiting with different groups in our area, in addition to holding meetings in my offices.  My schedule for August has filled up, but if you ever want me to visit your group or business, or if you want to schedule an in-person meeting, you can email AL01.Schedule@mail.house.gov to place a request.

8/21/17 11:08,Beyond resistance: Bringing our infrastructure into the 21st century,"Update | Monday, August 21, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 24th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: preparing for the transportation future.
Urbanization, changing travel trends, new modes of transportation, and the rapidly approaching revolution of autonomous vehicles (AVs) all will lead to a radically different mobility landscape. Since the last century, the American way of life was designed around the automobile—a huge part of our economy—and culture will change. We have a rare opportunity to use these changes to solve problems rather than create new ones.
Whether we have market-ready AVs in five years or 25 years, there is no question they will have a large impact in shaping communities of all sizes. AVs will affect the employment of more than 4 million drivers, the largest source of jobs in more than half of the states. It will also change the car repair and car insurance industries. Integrating AVs with ridesharing and carsharing services will only further disrupt employment trends. Driverless cars will also affect the built environment by making many parking garages and wide traffic lanes obsolete, opening spaces for affordable housing, businesses, bike lanes, and parks.
Without proper planning and policies, our infrastructure will fall into further disrepair, and we will squander an opportunity to have smarter, more sustainable cities. Fleets of AVs will be largely electric, contributing little in traditional transportation user fees, like gas taxes, parking fees, and traffic fines. I’m working with my colleagues in Congress to develop forward-thinking legislation to provide for more stable, equitable transportation funding alternatives. This funding can be invested into rebuilding and renewing America to create jobs and build smarter cities to bring our infrastructure into the 21st century.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

In This Edition
I was appalled and deeply saddened by the horrific events that occurred in Charlottesville, and my heart goes out to the families and loved ones of those who were injured or died. It’s more important now than ever that we stand up to the ignorance and bigotry that these events have brought to the forefront of our national consciousness. 
Earlier this month I traveled to Mexico City, where I met with U.S. and Mexican government officials, human rights activists, journalists, and the families of the 43 students who disappeared in Iguala, Guerrero, in September 2014.
I was honored to speak at the groundbreaking ceremony for The Beacon, a wonderful new development that will provide affordable housing and support services to homeless veterans and low-income seniors in Long Beach. 
It was a pleasure to meet 12 year old Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation delegate Miranda Speirs, who visited my DC office recently to talk to me about living with type 1 diabetes and the importance of ensuring federal funding for diabetes research. 
This week in Alan’s Inbox, see my response to constituents who have contacted my office to share their support for the Every Kid Outdoors Act, fantastic legislation that would provide fourth graders free entrance to all federally managed lands, waters, and historic sites.  
Be sure to check out Congress U, where I explain Congressional Recesses and District Work Periods, the breaks in official congressional business in Washington. 
Lastly, don’t forget to take this week’s poll in the right hand column.

Responding to the Appalling Events in Charlottesville
The violence that occurred two weekends ago in Charlottesville is simply horrible. It is difficult to fathom that in 2017, a rally of Klansmen, neo-nazis, white supremacists, anti -Semites, and members of other hate groups could wreak such havoc on an American city and  the nation as a whole—yet here we are. The members of this torch-carrying mob hold views that run counter to everything it means to be an American, and their ignorance and bigotry are at odds with everything our country stands for. We must continue to speak out against this hatred whenever it surfaces.
My heart goes out to those who were injured and to the families and loved ones of those who died. I have deep respect for the bravery shown by the peaceful counter-protesters who risked, and in the case of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, lost their lives in order to stand up for what is right. I can only hope that these events serve as a catalyst for further progress in the fight against a degree of hatred that many Americans had all but forgotten existed in this country.  
Meeting with Human Rights Activists in Mexico City
Two weeks ago I spent two days in Mexico City, Mexico, where I met with U.S. and Mexican government officials, human rights activists, journalists, and the families of the 43 students that disappeared in Iguala, Guerrero, in September 2014.
It was both a humbling and heartening experience for me. The pain and anguish these families have endured is simply unimaginable. I was humbled by the strength they have shown throughout this tragedy and heartened by their perseverance to learn what happened to their children and their determination to never let them be forgotten.
There is one question these families want, need, and deserve to have answered. Where are their children? It is a question that after nearly three years the Mexican government has still not answered. It is critical that everything possible be done to ensure that we discover what happened to the 43 students and hold the perpetrators accountable.

Celebrating New Affordable Senior and Veteran Housing in Long Beach
I was honored to speak at a groundbreaking ceremony for a fantastic new development by the Century Housing Corporation in Long Beach. Beacon Place is a 39 unit supportive housing development for veterans experiencing homelessness, and its sister development, Beacon Pointe, is a 121-unit development for low income and vulnerable seniors. These buildings are expected to open by late 2019, and will provide residents with comprehensive support services such as access to job centers and other amenities to help them gain and maintain their independence. It’s exciting to know that this much needed affordable housing option will soon open its doors to some of our community’s most vulnerable members.

Visiting with Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Delegate Miranda Speirs 
It was an amazing experience to meet recently with Miranda Speirs, a seventh grader from Long Beach who was in Washington as part of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) 2017 Children’s Congress. Miranda, who lives with Type 1 Diabetes, was one of 150 delegates selected by the JDRF to visit their own Congressional representative in Washington, D.C. and discuss what it is like to live with juvenile diabetes and what is needed to advance medical research on the disease. 
I have met with many people during my time in Congress, on a wide range of topics, and Miranda was one of the most engaging, charming, and convincing advocates I have encountered. She shared with me how diabetes impacts her, taught me about the scientific advances being made regarding her disease, showed me how she checks her blood glucose level, and challenged me to keep supporting scientific and medical research on juvenile diabetes. I was moved when she gave me a scrapbook of her life, her friends, and her accomplishments. Miranda is a truly remarkable young woman I was proud to spend some time with her.

Each week hundreds of constituents contact my office to share their views on a variety of topics. I have recently received numerous calls and letters in support of the Every Kid Outdoors Act—a fantastic piece of legislation of which I am a proud cosponsor. 
The Every Kid Outdoors Act would provide fourth graders free entrance to all federally managed land, waters, and historic sites.  This act expresses that free entrance will help families embrace a healthy, active lifestyle, and learn about our country’s natural and historic treasures.
I believe that exposure to our national treasures is an essential element of our children’s growth and success.  America is blessed with many natural wonders, both on land and at sea, which have been preserved because of visionary leaders such as President Theodore Roosevelt and Conservationist John Muir.  By promoting the accessibility and wonder of these sites, I hope to preserve our public lands for future generations to enjoy.
If you have written in to me, please continue to do so. If you have not, I encourage you to share your views and concerns with me, as it is the best way for me to find out which issues you care most about.   You can find out how to contact me on my website by clicking here.

Congressional Recesses and District Work Periods
 For many people, the word recess conjures up ideas of short breaks at school that weren't lunch. In the Congress, recess has several meanings.  In fact, many people don’t even use the word at all, opting instead to refer to them as district work periods.  A common use for the word is to describe anytime there is a break in the House or Senate's business. For example, when a committee takes a break, but returns a short time later to conclude business. This type of recess could last just a few minutes. Another meaning refers to a break following the end of the day's business. Unlike an adjournment, a recess at the end of the day does not interrupt unfinished business.   A longer type of recess is the House’s typical monthly one-week recess, also known as a district work period. This is to allow House Members, especially those whose districts are far from Washington, D.C., to return to their districts and meet with constituents. 
The final type of recess is the more formal August recess. For many years, foreign diplomats stationed in Washington received hardship pay for enduring the city's oppressive summer heat. Members of Congress received no such bonus. Consequently, unless the demands of war or other national emergencies kept them in session, for most of the 19th and 20th centuries Congress tried to take a break before high temperatures and humidity overwhelmed the Capitol.  Despite the advent of cooling systems throughout the Capitol Hill campus starting in the late-1920s, the August recess remained a tradition. Congress legally mandated the August recess with the passage of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970. It remains the only statutory recess on the House and Senate calendars.

Which of the following do you believe would have the greatest positive impact on improving public education in the United States? 
 
32%  Increasing funding for STEM instruction
23%  Increasing funding for arts, music, and humanities instruction 
20%  Increasing funding for teacher salaries 
19%  Other 
6%    Prioritize bringing technology, such as laptops and tablets, into the 
         classroom

8/21/17 5:19,News from Nita: Domestic Terrorism in Charlottesville,"￼
ABOUT NITA           CONSTITUENT SERVICES           NEWSROOM           LEGISLATIVE ISSUES           17th DISTRICT           CONTACT ME 
Dear Friend:
I'm fighting hard for Lower Hudson Valley communities by: 
	•	Standing Against Hateful Violence and Domestic Terrorism
	•	Offering Internships to College Students and Recent Graduates
	•	Securing a Refund from Medicare for a Pleasantville Resident  
Standing Against Hateful Violence and Domestic Terrorism My heart is with the victims of the Charlottesville violence and their families during this difficult time, and I condemn these acts in no uncertain terms. In the United States of America, no one should ever be killed or gravely harmed for exercising freedom of speech. Those who committed hateful violence and domestic terrorism, taking one woman's life while injuring and threatening many more, must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. It is the responsibility of all Americans, especially our highest elected officials, to reject hate and violence, yet President Trump's responses have been heinous. I am an original cosponsor of legislation to censure him for drawing equivalents between the white supremacist and neo-Nazi protesters and the counter protesters in Charlottesville. I will continue doing everything I can to combat hate and bigotry and foster unity in our own communities and throughout the country. 
Offering Internships to Students and Recent Graduates This month, I had the opportunity to meet with the amazing summer interns in our New City office and thank them for their hard work and service. Congressional internships are an excellent opportunity for students to learn about our government and to contribute to my work on behalf of the 17th Congressional District. To learn more about internships in my office, please click the image below or visit https://lowey.house.gov/services/internships.  
￼ 
Securing a Refund from Medicare for a Pleasantville Resident A Pleasantville resident contacted my office because he believed he had been overbilled by Medicare for his monthly premium. Soon after sending an inquiry to Medicare, I was informed that the resident had received a refund of $730. I take great pride in helping my constituents navigate federal agencies. If you are in need of assistance, please contact my White Plains District Office (914-428-1707), my New City District Office (845-639-3485), or my website for help: https://lowey.house.gov/contact.

NEWS FROM THE 2nd DISTRICT
Dear Friend,

This past week we were reminded of the hatred and violence that haunts our world. Leah and I mourn those killed and injured in Charlottesville and Spain. We stand by the men and women in uniform at home and abroad, who risk their lives daily to keep us safe, and we pray for a better world. Until we have a better world, we are committed to giving our fullest support to law enforcement and the military. 

At home, I spent time in Tallahassee meeting with young members of our military along with their mentors, visited with Mayor Brenda LaPaz at the Carrabelle Airport, and met with the Director of the Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve. Please read more about my week below: 
 
Air Force Association 
￼ 
On Thursday, I spent an outstanding night with the Colonel H.M. ""Bud"" West chapter of the Air Force Association in Tallahassee and the Reserve Officer Training Cadet Corps of Florida State University. Our congratulations to the members of the AFA chapter for being recognized as the Small Chapter of the Year! It is always inspiring to spend time with so many of our nation's heroes, past, present, and future.

Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve 
￼ 
We visited the Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve on Friday and met with Director Jenna Harper. This Reserve encompasses 246,766 acres of public lands and waters in the Florida Panhandle and it plays an important role in sustaining a large variety of marine life in the Florida, Alabama, and Georgia Gulf ecosystem.


Carrabelle Airport 
￼ 
Leah and I toured the Carrabelle Airport with Mayor Brenda LaPaz and Airport Director Tim Sullivan to study the grant application for runway and terminal improvements. The airport was built during World War II by the United States Army Air Corps as an auxiliary landing field and is now a fully functioning public airport that can be a great asset to this business community. 

The Refund Rights for Taxpayers Act
My legislation, the ""Refund Rights for Taxpayers Act,"" is one important reform among many to level the playing field for American families and rein in the IRS. This problem was brought to light by one of our constituents who was unfairly hurt by our tax code.

The Congressional App Challenge is a great way to highlight America’s talented young programmers and encourage students to develop their technology skills.

8/20/17 18:03,Meeting with Arkansans,"District Update | August 20,2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email
￼
Dear Friends,

One of the best parts about serving you in Congress is getting to meet with great Arkansans throughout the Second District. This past week I have had the pleasure of visiting with community leaders, job creators, second graders, school teachers, and more, hearing about the issues most important to them and their families. 

Below are a few highlights from this past week. It is an honor to represent you and be your voice in Congress as I fight for policies that work for you!

         ￼
Daisy Bates Elementary School is full of bright second graders who are eager to learn. I had a great time getting to talk with them and hear about what they're learning as they kick off the new school year year. I'm thankful for our Arkansas teachers who give one-hundred percent day in and day out to ensure our children receive the best education we have to offer. 

                    ￼
Great meeting with Pulaski and Saline County job creators. Good jobs are the backbone of strong communities. Thanks to Andy and Julie Mayberry for their leadership in our community and for gathering everyone at the East End Cafe to discuss important policies affecting Arkansans. 

                            ￼
Zak Haley (right) owns West Side Pharmacy, serving Benton families for more than 60 years, and spoke with me about the over regulation that has hurt his business and our central Arkansas families. In Congress, we're working to rollback this kind of government red tape by replacing it with pro-growth and pro-business legislation to help people like Zak and small business in central Arkansas.                                     
          ￼
Our Saline County businesses, including Ferguson's Furniture, Gingles Department Store, McClain & Co., and Access Control Devices Inc.,  are helping to provide jobs and opportunities for hardworking Arkansans. We're working hard in Congress to remove government roadblocks so that we can unleash our economic potential right here on Main Street. 

          ￼
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a bipartisan organization of U.S. citizens focused on promoting the relationship between the United States and Israel, invited me to speak at Synagogue Agudath Achim in Little Rock about our U.S.-Israel relationship. I recently visited Israel to further show my strong support, and was able to share more about my trip and what I learned. As turmoil and terrorism spreads in the Middle East, Israel remains an important economic and strategic ally of the United States, and its stability is critical to peace in the Middle East.
 
As always - if I can ever be of assistance to you, please reach out to my office. 
Sincerely,
￼ 
Representative French Hill

An Update From Senator Dianne Feinstein
￼

An Update From Senator Dianne Feinstein
August 20, 2017
 
STANDING AGAINST RACISM, VIOLENCE



Feinstein Calls on Park Service to Deny Permit for Hate Group (August 16, 2017)

“According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Patriot Prayer attracts white nationalists and other hate groups to its rallies with the intent to provoke unrest between those groups and counter-protesters. I am alarmed at the prospect that Crissy Field will be used as a venue for Patriot Prayer’s incitement, hate, and intimidation.” To read the full statement, CLICK HERE. 




Feinstein Condemns Violence in Charlottesville (August 12, 2017)

“Violent acts of hate and bigotry have no place in America. The attacks we are witnessing in Charlottesville are completely unacceptable and must not be allowed to continue. Violence like this will solve nothing and will only beget more violence and sow more division.” To read the full statement, CLICK HERE. 




TRUMP’S DANGEROUS IMMIGRATION POLICY



Feinstein Slams Trump Administration for Deporting Family (August 16, 2017) 

“This is a travesty, plain and simple, and evidence that Donald Trump’s immigration policy is nothing more than a hateful deportation program targeting law-abiding families. It’s shameful and stands against the very ideals upon which this country was founded.” To read the full statement, CLICK HERE.    
￼
Feinstein on “The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer” (August 2, 2017)

Senator Feinstein spoke about the president’s immigration bill, tension with North Korea and sanctions against Russia. To watch the full interview, CLICK HERE. 




Feinstein Opposes New Trump Immigration Bill (August 2, 2017)

“The immigration bill unveiled today by the White House betrays our country’s values. Our country shouldn’t tell immigrants who perform the most thankless jobs in our society that they can work here but they can’t build lives here. That’s not what this country is all about.” To read the full statement, CLICK HERE. 




THE BATTLE TO SAVE HEALTH CARE




Health care reform will work if Trump abandons ‘sabotage’ By Dianne Feinstein, San Diego Union-Tribune August 10, 2017

“Four failed bills and scathing reports from the Congressional Budget Office should finally convince Republicans to take the lock off of one-party control of health care.” To read the full op-ed, CLICK HERE. 




Feinstein to Trump: Stop Sabotaging Individual Market (August 8, 2017)

“I am greatly concerned that if the federal government does not fulfill its duty in making these payments, it will cause steep increases in premiums and further push insurers out of the market. According to Covered California, halting the cost-sharing reduction payments would result in an additional 12.4 percent increase for Silver level plans in California.” To read the full letter to the president, CLICK HERE. 




Feinstein on Failure of Senate Republican Health Care Bill (July 28, 2017)

“This failed vote on the latest Republican bill should finally break the fever and convince every senator that the only path forward on health care is to scrap their repeal efforts and work with Democrats in an open process to improve the Affordable Care Act.” To read the full statement, CLICK HERE. 




Feinstein Bill Would Halt Excessive Health Insurance Rate Increases (July 27, 2017)

“Democrats are committed to improving the Affordable Care Act. One way to do that is by giving the federal government additional authority to block unreasonable premium increases. If Republicans were serious about addressing affordability, they would work with us on proposals like this one that will help families across the country.” To see the full press release, CLICK HERE.




The devastating effects proposed Medicaid cuts would have on children By Dianne Feinstein, The Hill July 19, 2017

“The latest Republican attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act may have failed, but their long-term goal is clear: reduce coverage, remove consumer safeguards and, most importantly, gut Medicaid.” To read the full op-ed, CLICK HERE. 




PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT




Feinstein to Trump: Don’t Dismiss Climate Change Report (August 8, 2017)

“Up to this point, this administration has rejected the fact that human activity is driving climate change. This willful ignorance has made it almost impossible to address the risks highlighted in this report. Burying this report and refusing to act on its conclusions would be a dereliction of duty.” To read the full statement, CLICK HERE. 




Feinstein Comments on Alarming Lake Tahoe Report (August 8, 2017)

“What this report is telling us is that unprecedented changes to the entire Lake Tahoe Basin are now taking place. This is a clarion call-to-action for all who love this lake, the Jewel of the Sierra.” To read the full statement, CLICK HERE. 




Feinstein: California Leading the Charge on Climate Change (July 18, 2017)

“California has once again shown the world that we have the strength and courage to lead the charge on climate change. California’s success should inspire people throughout the world to realize that victory on climate change is still possible.” To read the full statement, CLICK HERE.




KEY STATEMENTS




Feinstein Supports Bill to Protect Special Counsel (August 4, 2017)

“While Justice Department regulations already state that the president can’t fire a special counsel, passage of this bill by both chambers of Congress, regardless of whether or not the president signs it, would send a clear message to President Trump that any effort to do so won’t be tolerated.” To read the full statement, CLICK HERE. 




Senators Call on Attorney General to Condemn Excessive Use of Force (August 3, 2017)

“We strongly encourage the Department of Justice to join the chorus of law enforcement organizations in making clear that excessive use of force is unacceptable. The men and women who protect our communities on a daily basis deserve your support.” To see the press release, CLICK HERE. 




Democrats Lay Out Key Principles For Tax Reform (August 1, 2017)

“First, we believe that tax reform should not increase the tax burden on the middle class. Second, we believe it is crucial that tax reform legislation go through regular order and not reconciliation. Third, tax reform should be focused on providing a revenue base that meets the needs of our country.” To read the letter to the president, CLICK HERE. 




Senators Demand Answers On Release of Voter Information (July 31, 2017)

“The decision by the White House to publish the emails commenting on the Commission without redacting personal information demonstrates, at best, a lack of sensitivity to and simple disregard for the very concerns raised in many of emails.” To see the press release, CLICK HERE.




Feinstein on Trump Reversal on Transgender Military Service (July 26, 2017)

“It’s nothing more than cruel to tell the 15,000 transgender individuals currently serving honorably that they are no longer wanted just because of who they are. Democrats will do all we can to change this discriminatory policy.” To read the full statement, CLICK HERE.




Democratic Plan Would Raise Salaries, Lower Costs for Families (July 24, 2017)

“Senate Democrats are unveiling an ambitious economic agenda that looks out for everyday Americans, too many of whom are struggling to make ends meet. This plan works for them by creating jobs and raising wages while lowering costs for consumers, families and small businesses.” To read the full statement, CLICK HERE.




Bill Would Provide Equal Tax Treatment for Married Same-Sex Couples (July 13, 2017)

More than 70 members of Congress introduced the Refund Equality Act, a bill to ensure that legally-married same-sex couples are permitted to file amended tax returns back to the date of their marriage. To see the press release, CLICK HERE.




COMMENTARY




Quitting Iran nuclear deal would undermine North Korea diplomacy By Dianne Feinstein, USA Today August 15, 2017

“Diplomacy is the only path to stop Kim Jong Un from obtaining a nuclear weapon capable of striking the United States. Unfortunately, as President Trump grapples with the North Korean threat, he seems to have forgotten that same lesson we learned with Iran.” To read the full op-ed, CLICK HERE.

Terror Attack in Barcelona:
Awful news in Barcelona this week. Please join me in sending prayers and thoughts to the victims and their families of this terror attack. I am thankful for the courageous first-responders for quickly getting to the scene. I will continue to monitor this situation as more news develops.
 
ICYMI - Legislation to Aid and Improve Medical Decisions for Seniors:
Recently, I introduced the Local Coverage Determination Clarification Act to aid and improve medical decisions for seniors.
Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) play a critical role in ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to needed care. However, the opaque process used by MACs to make coverage decisions can limit or deny patients access to necessary care.
For many procedures, doctors must seek reimbursement permission from one of the 12 local MACs that are responsible for designated areas of the country. However, each MAC is independent, meaning that a procedure covered in one state may not be covered in another.
This arbitrary care needs to stop, for the wellbeing of our seniors. By establishing a clear process so that only health experts are making sound health decisions, we can improve transparency and accountability among MACs and ensure our nations seniors receive quality health care treatment.
To read more about this legislation, please click here.
 
Delivering Meals on Wheels:
On Tuesday, I helped deliver Meals on Wheels to folks in Leavenworth. I always enjoy this opportunity as I get to meet so many Kansans and help raise awareness for the program. Thank you for such a great opportunity!
￼
 
Visiting the Leavenworth VA Campus:
This week, I stopped by the Leavenworth VA campus to tour the recent renovations of the 130-year-old mess hall and other historic buildings. It was great to see the renovations and talk about how tax reform can help contribute to economic development. Thank you for the great tour!
￼
 
Touring MGP Ingredients Facility:
Additionally, I toured MGP Ingredients Facility in Atchison to chat about the FDAs new Nutrition Facts Label and the latest happenings in Washington. While I was there, I also stopped by the Bake Lab to taste some vegetarian ravioli and chocolate chip cookies made with MGPs specialty wheat starches and proteins. It was definitely a sweet tour!
￼
 
Visiting Patriots Bank:
On Thursday, I stopped by Patriots Bank in Garnett to chat about how Congress is working to help smaller banks grow and thrive. Community banks are the cornerstone of rural communities and I will continue to work on behalf of these organizations. Thank you for the great visit!
￼
 
Speaking at the Parsons Rotary:
This week, I met and spoke with folks at the Parsons Rotary. We discussed several issues, such as our nations health care system and my work to reform our broken tax code. It was a great discussion and I always enjoy listening to Kansans thoughts on important issues. Thank you for having me and I really appreciate everyone taking the time to speak with me.
￼
 
Touring FMC Chanute Dialysis Facility:
Lastly, I had the opportunity to tour the Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) Chanute Dialysis Center to learn more about the care required to treat patients with kidney failure and meet the staff that is working hard to deliver high-quality care to their patients. This visit comes on the heels of my legislation (HR 3166) to provide independent accreditation for dialysis facilities passing the House of Representatives. This visit was very educational and I look forward to continuing my work to help streamline the accreditation process for dialysis centers.

 The Walker Weekly Report | August 20, 2017
 

￼

We had a big announcement out of Asheboro this week, as another company has decided to call North Carolina home. This is a sign of more good things to come for our state and our community and a testament to the hard work and talent of our people.

This week, I enjoyed visiting with and listening to people and businesses all across our district – like Strata Solar, who is finding innovative ways to help the people of Rockingham County. 

As Congress prepares to head back to Washington, I look forward to taking the concerns and thoughts of all of the great people I have listened to and learned from with me. Please always know that our office is here to serve you. If we can ever help, reach out to one of our offices in Asheboro, Graham, Greensboro, or Washington.

Please keep reading for the full update. Have a blessed week.

Fibertex Personal Care to invest $327 million and create 145 new jobs in Asheboro
￼
I am proud to announce that Fibertex Personal Care has chosen to invest $327 million and create 145 new jobs in Asheboro with the opening of its first American site.

Fibertex calling Asheboro home is a huge step in the right direction for jobs and economic growth in our community. The 6th Congressional District holds all three promising North Carolina megasites – boasting a strong workforce fueled by great people and significant growth opportunities for both businesses and employees.

There is a reason North Carolina is consistently ranked as a top state in the country for business. As Congress looks to enact bold, pro-growth tax reform, I look forward to helping North Carolina lead the way for 21st century economic growth.

Read more about Fibertex and their growth in Randolph County here.

The Courier-Tribune: Changing the Tax Code is Long Overdue
￼

Last week, Haze, a small business owner in Randolph County wrote a letter to the Asheboro Courier-Tribune emphasizing the need for tax reform. Haze is right. We need to change the tax code to level the playing field and provide relief. It’s long overdue.

For too long, small business owners like Haze have had to deal with a broken, complicated tax code that is unfair to taxpayers and small business owners. We need tax reform that levels the playing field and provides relief.

The nonpartisan Tax Foundation released an analysis of our tax reform blueprint, and it had some really good news for North Carolinians. The plan would promote the growth of more than 50,000 jobs and spark a $4,400 pay raise for lower and middle income families in our community. I am dedicated to getting tax reform done and helping our community prosper.
￼
More Corruption at the IRS: IRS Rehires 213 Employees Ousted for Falsifying Documents, Avoiding Taxes, Other Offenses
￼
Another good reason tax reform needs to happen? The IRS. 

The IRS has shown a capacity for outright corruption and political targeting. It has channeled millions of taxpayer dollars away from taxpayer assistance for employee bonuses. It has allowed taxpayer information to be compromised in a data breach. The IRS has even intentionally leaked confidential taxpayer information. These are blatant breaches of trust.

Now the IRS, under the watch of John Koskinen, has ""rehired 213 employees who ducked taxes, falsified documents, were convicted of theft, or made unauthorized use of taxpayer data, an inspector general’s report says.""

Taxpayers in North Carolina deserve better. I have repeatedly called for the removal of Koskinen from the IRS to help restore some accountability and trust. Tax reform would further these measures by making the tax code simple and understandable.

 This week I got the chance to hear directly from some of you at the town hall meetings I hosted in Catawba, Cleveland, and Gaston Counties.  Every year I welcome the opportunity to speak to my constituents to share my thoughts on our work in Congress while also taking your questions about the issues of importance to you. If you were unable to attend the town hall meetings but would like to learn more about what was discussed, you can find more information on the Catawba County town hall here via the Hickory Daily Record, the Cleveland County town hall here via the Gaston Gazette, and the Gaston County town hall here also courtesy of the Gaston Gazette. 
￼

Next week, I will be holding three more town hall meetings for Buncombe, Iredell, Lincoln, Polk, and Rutherford Counties. As you might know, these meetings have been rescheduled from the first week of August when I had to delay them after I was diagnosed with pneumonia. I apologize for any inconvenience this might have caused. The rescheduled town hall meeting dates, times, and locations are below:

A Busy Week in the Tenth District



This week has been a busy for me in western North Carolina. In addition to the town halls meetings I have travelled around the district meeting with companies and organizations to share my thoughts and learn more about their roles in western North Carolina. First I met with the Newton Fire Department to present them with their SAFER grant check. 

￼
Thursday morning, I had the opportunity to tour the Carus Corporation where I learned more about the solutions they provide to environmental concerns involving water, air, and soil.
￼
Next I spoke with veterans at the monthly meeting of the Gaston Veteran Council, which has veterans from all of the veterans organizations and different groups that serve veterans in Gaston County.
￼
Afterwards I had the opportunity to tour the Center for Advanced Manufacturing at Gaston College which will offer enhanced education and training for students. 
￼
I then spoke at the Montcross Chamber of Commerce Growth Forum to share my thoughts on future growth in Gaston.
￼
I also had the chance to stop by a Lowe’s Home Improvement Center in Gaston and get a tour of their store. I really enjoyed meeting some of their store associates and learning more about their roles and how they help their customers. 
￼
Lastly, I stopped by Gastonia's first brewery, Cavendish Brewing, to visit the facility and also meet the owner, Scott Cavendish, and their brewmaster, Will Warren.

The Solar Eclipse is Coming to Western North Carolina



Like so many others throughout western NC and across the country, I am looking forward to Monday's solar eclipse. The Tenth District and western North Carolina is a prime location for viewing the eclipse and I am excited that the Congressional schedule will allow me to be home to see it. I hope everyone has their glasses ready and is prepared to safely watch this incredibly rare phenomenon. If you want to learn more about the eclipse, NASA has some excellent information which you can access by clicking here or on the image below. Additionally, if want to know exactly how much of the eclipse you will be able to see click here for a great interactive map courtesy of the Asheville Citizen-Times.

What I Have Been Reading



Charlottesville Rally Turns Deadly: One Killed After Car Strikes Crowd
 
NBC News 

I was horrified by the violence that occurred this weekend in Charlottesville, VA. My prayers go out to the families of Heather Heyer, Lieutenant H. Jay Cullen, and Trooper Berke M.M. Bates as well as to all those injured in Saturday’s attack. I join with all Americans condemning the hate, bigotry, and racism that spurred this weekend's events. As a nation, we must reject the KKK, neo-nazis, and all those groups whose views run counter to the ideals our nation was founded upon. 


From Age 3 to 80, Barcelona Victims Represent a Wide World
 
Associated Press 

I was also deeply saddened to hear about the devastating terrorist attack in Barcelona. Please join Giulia and me in praying for those injured in these attacks and the families of those who lost their lives. It is disturbing  to again see a group of radical Islamic terrorists attacking a European city. We will stand with our friends in Spain against these horrific acts.

Meet Richard | How Can I Help You? | Issues | Media Center | Contact Me
Friends,
 
The violence and hate we saw last weekend in Charlottesville were both unacceptable and un-American. Like you, I was disgusted by the hatred on display and the violence that erupted. There is no place in our great nation for this evil. I unequivocally condemn these white supremacists and their vile bigotry. 
 
With that being said, I also want to thank the men and women in uniform who keep us safe in even the most dangerous and tumultuous of times.
 
This week I had the honor of visiting with many of our first responders across the 8th District. I met with Emergency Medical Service (EMS) personnel in Rowan, Stanly, Moore and Cumberland Counties, but no matter where I stopped, I was struck by the professionalism and selflessness of these men and women.
 
The men and women who serve as our first responders and medical professionals make countless personal sacrifices for the good of our community. Not only do these community servants provide quality care around the clock, but they also provide peace of mind during some of our worst experiences. It is hard to put my gratitude for them into words, but their service, commitment, hard work and compassion during our times of need deserve our sincerest appreciation.
 
After hearing from our emergency medicine providers in the district regarding a problem they faced with the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), I set to work on the Protecting Patient Access to Emergency Medications Act. In true Washington fashion, the DEA decided last year that first responders would no longer be allowed to carry controlled substances on ambulances and other emergency vehicles-- that means no morphine for car crash victims, no Narcan for overdose victims, or even EpiPens for seizure victims. My legislation will fix this problem.
 
My bipartisan and common sense bill passed the House 404-0 and I am hopeful it will become law this year. Because of my work on this legislation, among other emergency medicine priorities, I was honored to be presented with the 2017 EMS Legislator of the Year Award.
 
￼
 
Along the same lines, I am the voice for veterans and I want to ensure that our service members and veterans have the support they deserve. In an effort to guarantee our veterans are receiving quality care, I visited the Salisbury VA Medical Center again this week to meet with VA leadership.
 
I was able to discuss the recent report by the VA Office of the Inspector General that found areas for improvement at the facility and see the steps staff are taking to address these concerns. There continues to be room for improvement across our VA system, but I am pleased to see the direction the Salisbury VA in particular is headed.
 
I cannot thank our men and women who have chosen a life of service enough. As long as I am your representative, Ill continue to work with my colleagues on bipartisan solutions to support our first responders, keep government bureaucracy out of the way of common sense medical care and preserve our promises to our veterans. 
 
Until next week,
￼
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)

Women in STEM
 
 
This week I had a special visit to Cummins in South Carolina with my incredible wife, Wrenzie. We got a tour of their facility and participated in a panel about the importance of women in STEM and manufacturing. While I participated as a member of Congress, Wrenzie participated as a woman in the STEM field. 

She graduated from Clemson with a degree in Engineering and Industrial Management and is a former Mechanical Engineer for Cummins. American competitiveness is my number one goal, and one way to achieve this goal is through focus in STEM fields and manufacturing. 

People like my wonderful wife, the employees at Cummins, and women in these fields all across the country are leading the way and are essential to making our country competitive in the world!

Solar Eclipse 2017
 
 
I'm sure you've heard tomorrow is the solar eclipse, when the moon's shadow falls on the Earth as it passes between us and the sun. But did you know the last time this was visible in the U.S. was in 1979? It's a rare occurance that will be a near once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and since we live in South Carolina, we have some of the best views for a total eclipse in the whole country. 

I encourage you all to enjoy this awesome event but to do so safely. Please make sure if you plan on viewing the eclipse you have the proper safety glasses and that if you are traveling to follow all posted signs and allow extra time for increased traffic. 

The South Carolina Emergency Management Division has great resources for safely viewing the eclipse, including travel information and where to find safety glasses to view the eclipse. The South Carolina Department of Public Safety is also a great resource. 

You can also visit this interactive model and enter your address to see what time the eclipse will happen near you and what it will look like!

7 More Reasons for Tax Reform
 
 
	•	Reason #14: The death tax, also known as the estate tax, can impose a burdensome tax bill on family-owned businesses and farms when the primary owner passes away. This 40% tax is imposed as a second or third layer of tax on a person's business or other assets when they are passed down to the next generation.
	•	Reason #15: With all the various taxes on savings and investment, the effective tax rate on investment income can now be greater than 50%, penalizing hardworking Americans who save for the future, plan for retirement, and invest in our economy.
	•	Reason #16: Our tax code now forces our global businesses to pay U.S. tax when they bring home income earned overseas. And the U.S. tax comes on top of the taxes our companies have already paid in other countries. This global taxation only makes it harder for American businesses to compete globally and create good-paying jobs on our shores.
	•	Reason #17: The complexity of our tax code imposes a particularly sever burden on American small businesses. Tax compliance costs for the 4 million S corporations in our country are more than $46 billion a year, or $12,000 per company. That's a lot of money that these businesses should be using to hire workers and expand operations.
	•	Reason #18: Agriculture is a huge part of our district and our state's livlihood, but our current tax code is overly burdensome to farmers and ranchers. They should have a tax system that allows them to keep more of their hard-earned income, invest back into workers and their operations so their farms can keep going and growing for the future.
	•	Reason #19: America's tax code is filled with special interest break that encourage people and businesses to make investments based on the most promising tax benefit instead of the most promising innovations or enterprises. This diverts investment and resources away from American start-ups and small businesses who are the lifeblood of our economy and employ 75% of people.
	•	Reason #20: Our current tax code makes America less competitive. Other counries have designed their tax codes to directly compete with America and they are catching up. When American-made products and American workers cannot compete and win globally, the result is a weak economy, fewer jobs, and smaller paychecks.

Don't forget about upcoming mobile office hours this week where my staff will be around the Grand Strand and Pee Dee to help you with federal agency issues. 

Hope to see you this week!

GOOD NEWS
I see inclusive communities with caring neighbors everywhere I go across the Grand Strand and Pee Dee. People go above and beyond or do little gestures to help improve our communities. This week Georgetown County was awarded the Golden Palmetto by the S.C. Commission on Disabilities and Special Needs (SCDDSN) for their work to improve the lives of those living with disabilities. From helping them find jobs, to hosting community events, to providing essential services to make their lives easier, Georgetown County is leading the way.

Babin Leads Effort to Bring Accountability to Special Counsel
I'm asking my colleagues to join me in demanding a public congressional hearing to bring Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team out of the shadows. The Special Counsel and his appointed lawyers are arguably just as empowered—if not more so—than any U.S. Attorney, yet they are allowed to operate largely in secret, with each lawyer selected by and ultimately accountable to only Mr. Mueller himself. Serious questions have been raised about the many conflicts of interest and past political involvement by members of the investigation team he assembled. The American people deserve to know why these conflicted investigators are the best team he could come up with. My letter would not authorize questions about the details of the investigation, only questions about the biases and conflicts of team members with that have been appointed by Mr. Mueller.
Honoring the Family of Fallen Hero Chief Deputy Clint Greenwood
It was a great privilege to attend the unveiling ceremony of the newly named Clinton F. Greenwood Courthouse Annex 8 in Baytown, Texas. At the event, I was honored to present Clint Greenwood’s wife, Leatha, with an American flag that was flown over the U.S. Capitol Building. Last April, Chief Deputy Clint Greenwood was ambushed and killed while arriving at work at this very courthouse. Its new name will serve as an important and lasting tribute to Chief Deputy Greenwood and his family.

Dear Friend,
The past week has been tough for many as multiple events of violence, hate, and global terrorism have gripped not only the United States but also the world.
I like many of you was upset from the violence and hate we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia early in the week as well as the horrific terror attack in Barcelona, Spain on Thursday evening. It’s now more important than ever that we stand strong together to condemn the actions we’ve seen in the last several days.
Our thoughts and prayers are with those impacted by the events in Charlottesville and Barcelona, including with the family and friends of those injured and killed in each attack. 



Young Farmers Roundtable in Gordon
On Tuesday, I had the opportunity to participate in a roundtable in Gray with young and beginning farmers to hear their personal stories and concerns related to on-going Farm Bill negations.
It goes without saying that young farmers are the future of the agriculture industry and integral to the future growth and success of agriculture in Georgia. It is vitally important that as we continue to draft the 2018 Farm Bill we make sure our programs and policies support our young farmers as they contribute to the American agriculture industry and feed the world.

Meeting with Jones County Leadership
On Tuesday, myself and members of my staff met with Jones County leadership.

It was a good discussion, and I thank them for updating me on the concerns of the residents of Jones County.

Supporting Our Community Health Centers
On Thursday, I stopped by South Central Georgia Primary Care Center in Ocilla to get an update from staff and clinic leadership on the challenges our rural community health centers face in providing top-quality care for members of the community.
In many counties in Middle and South Georgia, community health centers are the first—and sometimes only stop—a sick person makes to obtain the medical care they desperately need. Unfortunately, the current climate in the healthcare industry has made it more and more difficult for these centers to provide the necessary services their community relies on.
You can rest assured I am committed to advancing common sense policies that support, not hinder, our community health centers who keep Georgia strong and healthy.

On Thursday, I had the privilege to speak at a Joint Rotary and Kiwanis meeting in Moultrie to give an update on our efforts to fix our broken health care system and return more competition and consumer control into the marketplace. It was a great afternoon and a thoughtful discussion, and I thank these organizations for having me.

August 20, 2017   Dear Friends,  On Monday, August 21, 2017, a total solar eclipse will cross the United States for the first time in almost 100 years. 
￼
What is a solar eclipse? 
A solar eclipse is when the moon passes between the sun and Earth and blocks all or part of the sun. The whole cycle lasts about 3 hours when viewing from the same location. 
Who can see it? 
Everyone in the contiguous United States! The eclipse will pass over the entire country for the first time in almost 100 years. Carbondale, Illinois and the southern part of the 15th district will be some of the best places to watch the eclipse. The sun will be covered for two minutes and 40 seconds, the longest duration on its path. 
￼
Map from NASA
Illinois will be one of the most popular locations to view the eclipse and traffic is expected to be unprecedented. Please prepare for increased traffic and use caution when traveling to watch the eclipse. 
When will you be able to see it?
Times vary depending on your location. Use this interactive map to find out the exact times of the total or partial eclipse where you will be watching. 
How can you safely see it? 
It is NEVER safe to look directly at the sun. The only time it is safe to look at the sun during an eclipse is during the moment of totality, when the sun is 100% blocked by the moon. If you are not in an area that reaches totality, you must use certified eclipse glasses to safely view the eclipse. 
Using certified eclipse glasses is the only way to view the uneclipsed or partially eclipsed sun. Without proper protection, you risk irreparable damage to your eyesight.

The solar eclipse is a once in a lifetime event and I hope that you enjoy this awe inspiring sight. 
More information on the eclipse can be found HERE.

Hi Friends,
As the one voice in Congress for the 63,000 veterans in Texas’ 4th District, it’s my job to ensure these brave men and women receive the care and respect they’ve most certainly earned. That’s why I was pleased when two key bills I voted for were recently signed into law by President Trump to do just that: the VA Accountability First Act and the GI Forever Bill. 
These new laws will improve our VA system and expand post-service educational opportunities for our veterans – both major wins – but more work remains to be done. That’s why, just this month, I introduced my own legislation that will continue our work on this important issue: the VA IT Restructuring Act. 
￼
My bill seeks to improve care for veterans being treated at the VA through the appointment of a Chief Information Officer (CIO) responsible for the procurement, acquisition and management of IT systems and services at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). This will help us to avoid previous IT implementation failures that may have inhibited veterans’ access to care.
I’m very glad that the VA IT Restructuring Act has strong bicameral support – with fellow Texans Ted Cruz and John Cornyn leading the charge in the Senate. After all, with everything our nation’s veterans have sacrificed on behalf of our freedom, we owe it to them to work as hard as we can to ensure they receive the quality and timely care they deserve.

Sincerely,
￼  
John Ratcliffe U.S. Representative for Texas’ Fourth District

NEWS FROM THE 22nd DISTRICT
Infrastructure Week
As week three of Renew NY-22, I toured areas across the 22nd District and met with local officials to discuss the need for infrastructure investment, upgrades and repairs. I visited the Greater Binghamton Airport, ongoing construction on I-81, rural water facilities in Trenton, Prospect and Barneveld and hosted a listen session with local officials on recent flooding and infrastructure at MVCC in Utica.
Renew NY-22 calls on Congress to fully fund the highway and transit programs already authorized under the FAST Act and ensure that funding is sustained over time so that states and municipalities have the resources to actually follow through on projects. Additionally, we must act to modernize America’s air travel infrastructure by passing a proposal to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. Third, we must provide for the maintenance of our nation’s ports, such as the Port of Oswego, by funding existing dredging projects.
Tenney, Garnar Tour I-81 Construction
I toured the ongoing construction on I-81 in Binghamton with County Executive Jason Garnar to discuss the importance of reinvesting in our infrastructure.
With an infrastructure proposal on the horizon, I am committed to making sure upstate New York gets its fair share and that funding is spent in a fiscally responsible way that targets those projects most in need of support.
Due to a lack of strong and sustained investments, America’s infrastructure is lagging behind the rest of the developed world. In upstate New York, too many of our roads and bridges are in dire need of repair and both Albany and Congress have shirked their responsibilities for too long. 
As our infrastructure ages and no new investments are made, local municipalities face a growing backlog of projects and our country risks losing its competitive advantage. I will continue to fight for the resources our region needs to fully fund and complete vital infrastructure upgrades and repairs.
￼￼
Touring the Greater Binghamton Airport
I also toured the Greater Binghamton Airport to highlight the need to reinvest in our Upstate airports and announced a $726,300 federal grant I assisted in securing for the airport.
This grant coupled with the nearly $600,000 in federal funds our office secured earlier this year will help support upgrades and further improve the safety of travelers, air crafts, airport personnel at this important regional asset. The grant will provide the Greater Binghamton airport with the resources to fund a master plan study to address key issues, objectives and goals pertinent to the airport’s future development.
Earlier this year, I called on House leaders to fully fund the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ensure that air traffic controllers have stability and certainty. As a result of this effort, the House Appropriations Committee funded the FAA at $10.2 billion, which is $160 million more than the previous year.
Flood Listening Session
On Friday, I hosted a flood listening summit for local officials in the 22nd Congressional District at MVCC’s Schafer Theater. At the summit, I heard from community leaders about the impact of recent flooding on our communities. Local officials also provided suggestions for needed infrastructure upgrades to mitigate future flooding.
Representatives from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Army Corps of Engineers also attended the event to provide municipalities with information on the resources available to them following a flood. FEMA discussed the federal disaster declaration process as well as state and federal flooding mitigation efforts. Army Corps discussed how they use federal funds, ongoing projects and future proposals. The New York State Department of Conservation (DEC) was invited, but did not attend.
For area residents flooding has become all too common and we must get to the root of the problem to prevent future incidents. The flood listening summit was an important tool to provide our office with a firsthand perspective from local officials on the impact of flooding, along with their experience in dealing with both federal and state agencies. I would like to thank all of the local officials who shared testimony with us and the Army Corps and FEMA for taking the time to share the programs they offer and the current projects underway. I will take this input with me to Washington to craft meaningful legislation to reform processes and better serve those who have been repeatedly devastated by flooding.
In my role as a member of the House Financial Services Committee, which has oversight of the National Flood Insurance Program, I am working to champion FEMA reforms that would improve the flood mapping process. Local leaders and home owners know their communities best and this plan gives these stakeholders a stronger voice in the mapping process. In particular, it provides options for community mapping, which allows for better risk assessment tools and increases the accuracy and fairness of flood mapping.
￼ ￼
Touring Rural Water Infrastructure
On Thursday, I visited Trenton, Barneveld and Prospect to tour rural water systems and speak with local officials about upgrades and resources needed to help our water infrastructure in rural communities.
￼￼
Tenney Receives Health Center Supporter Award
Earlier this week, I toured the Family Health Network of Central New York where I was honored to accept the Health Center Supporter Award for my advocacy and support of federally funded health care centers.
The Family Health Network serves a large number of the neediest citizens across the 22nd Congressional District and throughout upstate New York. In Congress, I’ve fought to ensure that federally funded health care centers receive the resources they need to continue to provide excellent healthcare to those who need it the most. It is an honor to accept this award and to continue my work to secure important funding for the Family Health Network.
Throughout my time in Congress, I have been a strong supporter of Community Health Centers. Recently, I championed an effort to continue federal funding and support of federal Health Centers, which led to the inclusion of $1.5 billion in the House’s recommended fiscal year 2018 appropriations bill. This is nearly one billion more than in fiscal year 2017. 
I also supported an appropriations request calling on House leaders to support a range of programs important to the health of rural communities, including a request to fully fund the Community Health Centers. 
Additionally, I am a cosponsor of H.R. 1955, the Rural Hospital Access Act, which would permanently extend the Medicare-dependent hospitals and enhanced low-volume adjustment programs.
Family Health Network operates 11 locations around Cortland County and is one of four federally-funded health care centers in the 22nd Congressional District. Together, these four locations leverage nearly $10 million in federal funding and serve over 150,000 of the region’s neediest families and individuals.
￼￼
Securing Important Funds for STEM teaching programs at SUNY Cortland
This week, I helped secure an important grant for SUNY Cortland that will advance the knowledge base of STEM teaching while allowing participants to explore challenges and examine successful methods in order to build stronger STEM programs in the future.
Funds from the grant will be used to support three years of the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program at SUNY Cortland. The Noyce program provides support for students looking to pursue a career in STEM teaching.
The Noyce project will be beneficial to both teacher scholars and administrators at SUNY Cortland, providing them with an opportunity to discover innovative ways to develop stronger STEM teaching programs in high-needs districts.
Tenney Secures $82,200 for Griffiss International Airport
On Friday, I announced that Griffiss International Airport in Rome was awarded a $82,200 grant. 
As an important regional asset, Griffiss International Airport has been a key contributor in helping to grow our local economy in the Utica-Rome area. This federal investment I assisted in securing, will allow Griffiss to continue to expand and upgrade outdated infrastructure to better serve the aviation needs of Mohawk Valley.
 Griffiss International Airport is currently undergoing significant renovation efforts to implement runway safety upgrades, modernizing outdated infrastructure. This grant will assist in efforts to remove obstructions near the runway, helping Griffiss to expand and grow.
Charlottesville
As someone who worked closely alongside the Jewish Community Center in Utica to resettle Bosnian refugees who were victims of ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, it is unconscionable to me that anyone in modern day America could display such hatred, violence and racism toward their fellowman. On Saturday, I immediately condemned in the strongest terms possible this tragic display of white supremacy and called on Americans to join together to condemn these acts of intolerance and bigotry, which have no place in our society or our political discourse. I urge the President to continue to denounce white supremacy, racism and intolerance and work to promote an atmosphere of unity in our nation during this troubling time.

8/20/17 11:06,Beyond resistance: Rebuilding and renewing America,"Update | Sunday, August 20, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 23rd day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: rebuilding and renewing America.
One of the few areas of agreement in American politics is the need for dramatic investment in rebuilding and renewing America. No wonder. America is literally falling apart while we are falling behind our international competitors. One of the major problems is that we are trying to meet the challenges of infrastructure in 2017 with 1993 funding. The gas tax has not been increased in 24 years, and the federal partnership is not being maintained with our state and local communities and the private sector. I have introduced the first gas tax increase since 1994. My legislation would raise the gas tax, index the gas tax to inflation, and then replace the gas tax with a more sustainable and equitable funding system for the future.
Our needs are not just roads, bridges, transit, and bikeways – what’s under the surface is in worse condition than what’s on the surface. I’ve introduced legislation that will establish a dedicated water infrastructure trust fund to invest in safe drinking water systems so there aren’t more communities that face dangerous levels of lead in their drinking water. Our inland waterways, electrical grid, schools, and other public buildings are too in need of serious attention, funding, and a vision for planning and constructing more effectively.
I have assembled a broad coalition of supporters who understand that the quickest way to create millions of family wage jobs for a wide range of skillsets is to deal with the funding and the vision. It is a priority we can all support and one that I’m committed to ensuring aggressive action in this Congress.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

Sixth District Report
""We must live together as brothers or perish together as fools."" - Martin Luther King, Jr.
Dear Friend,  It has been a difficult week for our nation.  Violence, hate, and bigotry have no place in our society, and my thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of those killed and injured in Charlottesville, Virginia - a community I care for deeply as home to my alma mater, the University of Virginia.  I pray that Americans will unite in memory of the words of the founder of the University of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson, who wrote that, ""We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.""  I spoke at length with Spectrum Politics about the tragedy and more.  Click here, or on the image below, to read the full story and watch the full interview.
￼
In these difficult times, I pray that our leaders help to heal and unite; that they unequivocally repudiate racism, bigotry and hate; that they also resist the divisive pull of political correctness; that they focus on lifting up, rather than tearing down; and that they work to fulfill the promise of our nation's first founding principle--that all are created equal.
Finally, let us always remember the undeniable wisdom enshrined in the motto of the Commonwealth of Kentucky: United We Stand, Divided We Fall.


Around the Bluegrass
The August work period is an opportunity for Members of Congress to spend extended time in their districts to hear from their constituents so they can better represent their interests and concerns when they return to Washington.  That is why I have been meeting with as many Kentuckians as I can across the Sixth District this month.  Here are some of the highlights from my travels:
￼
I joined the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy for a Regional Regulatory Roundtable in Lexington.  Over 100 attendees joined us to share regulatory burdens and concerns facing their small businesses.
￼
I visited Beacon of Hope, an emergency homeless shelter in Winchester. I was inspired by their commitment to change lives through compassion and accountability.  Click here to read more about my visit and the great working being done at Beacon of Hope in the Winchester Sun.
￼
About 100 veterans attend our Veterans Coalition meeting in Richmond.  As always, I appreciated hearing first hand from those who served about their thoughts on the issues and the challenges they face. 
￼
I held a restaurant roundtable with the Kentucky Restaurant Association to discuss the Department of Labor’s Overtime Rule, Obamacare mandates, and the menu labeling requirements that are burdensome to businesses throughout the Sixth District.
￼
There was a sold out crowd of 200 in Carlisle for the inaugural Farm to Table dinner. I was honored to be the guest speaker for this incredible event benefiting the Nicholas County FFA Scholarship Fund. One of the many highlights of the night was the cobbler made from famous Carlisle blackberries!
￼
I was honored to speak to the incoming Leadership Lexington class at the Get Acquainted Reception. Carol and I are both proud alumni of the Leadership Lexington program. I can't wait to see the positive impact this class makes in our community.
￼
I enjoyed speaking to the Woodford County Chamber of Commerce in Versailles.  We discussed the ongoing efforts to give more Americans access to affordable, quality health insurance and to pass tax reform. 
￼
It was an honor to take part in the Kentucky National Guard Counter Drug Operation with the Kentucky State Police and their marijuana eradication program. I appreciated the opportunity to see how they are fighting illegal drugs in the Commonwealth.
￼
I enjoyed touring the Life Adventure Center in Woodford County and learning about the meaningful therapeutic work they do.
￼
I toured the quickly developing Consolidated Shipping Center at Blue Grass Army Depot in Richmond. Thanks to Col. Hoyle, Col. Fochs, and Lt. Col. Gould for their leadership and devotion to mission readiness. Also, a special thanks to all the civilian leaders and employees for their hard work and dedication in making BGAD a world-class installation.
￼
I was honored to join my friends in Nicholasville at the Military Freedom Fest. For years my staff and I have been proud to be a part of this amazing group of Patriots whose sole mission is to honor our fighting men and women, no matter their branch or era of service.  We were especially honored to have Charles Wilson with us this time.  Charles was awarded the French Legion of Honor for his actions in Normandy and Paris during World War II. Thank you Charles and all the heroes who joined us!
￼
Federally Qualified Health Centers are providing affordable, high quality health care services across the country.  I toured Health First Bluegrass and was happy to honor each of the FQHC's in our district - White House Clinics, HealthFirst Bluegrass, Mt. Sterling Health Center, and Bluegrass Community Health Center, as part of National Community Health Center Week.
￼
The former Millersburg Military Institute campus has a rich history in Bourbon County. I enjoyed touring the property to see the renovations Community Ventures Corporation is making to restore the facilities.   Mobile Office Hours
To better serve the people of central and eastern Kentucky, my staff conducts regular traveling office hours in every county of the Sixth Congressional District.  These office hours are not town hall meetings, but rather are a resource to help constituents who are in need of assistance and want to speak to a staff member in person.   Click here for a complete schedule of all upcoming dates and times for mobile office hours. 
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues facing our community, and I hope you will forward my newsletter to your friends, family and neighbors.
You may also visit my website, Facebook and Twitter, where you can find regular updates about my work at home in the Sixth District and in Washington.
Thank you and have a great week!

Friends,
In July, I held three Iowa Senior Wellness and Security Expos throughout the Third District. At each Expo, representatives from dozens of local, state and federal agencies and organizations were on hand to provide seniors and their supporters with valuable information about the services and assistance available to Iowa seniors.
I also organized sessions at each Expo to provide Iowans with information from experts about topics important to them. One of the more popular sessions detailed what steps seniors can take to stay in their homes and their communities for as long as they are able.
One of the most important factors preventing seniors from continuing to age in place is failing to ensure the home is safe. It is important because, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), older Americans experienced 29 million falls in 2014, resulting in seven million injuries and costing Medicare $31 billion annually.
As a presenter from the AARP noted, the best time to prepare your home for life as a senior is twenty years ago. But, he noted, the second best time to prepare your home for life as a senior is today.
The best way to begin this task is by preparing a home safety checklist. The checklist is a great way to carefully and closely assess an entire living space and determine where potential hazards could arise.
I have prepared a more extensive checklist available on my website which you can download at THIS LINK. Or, contact one of my Constituent Services Offices to request the document be mailed directly to you.   
Home safety is something all seniors should take very seriously. By being prepared and taking action now, you are helping to ensure a longer and easier aging process in your own home and community.
￼
￼
Being an elected official is about accessibility, listening and acting in the best interest of the people you represent. Over the past three years I have had the honor of hosting hundreds of meetings with thousands of Iowans. This year I started a new outreach called Open Office Hours. They are an additional resource for Iowans who reside in the Third Congressional District to meet one-on-one with me to discuss opinions, concerns, and ideas about the issues being discussed in Congress or to get assistance with problems they may be having with a federal agency or program.
Here is a list of the upcoming Open Office Hours:
August 23, 2017: 9:00 to 11:00am – Greenfield City Hall - 202 S. 1st St. Greenfield, IA 50849
August 23, 2017: 1:00 to 3:00pm - Atlantic Public Library – 507 Poplar Street, Atlantic, IA 50022
August 24, 2017: 12:30 to 2:30pm – Ringgold County Courthouse – 109 West Madison Street, Mt. Ayr, IA 50854
August 30, 2017: 2:00pm to 4:00pm – McCreary Community Building – 1800 Pattee Street, Perry, IA 50220
￼
￼
In this photo I am thanking Devon Wood and Scott Hastings - two Iowa student leaders who served as interns in the Washington, DC Constituent Services Office this summer. Devon is from New Market and is a student at Simpson College and Scott is from Shenandoah and is a student at the University of Iowa. Both Devon and Scott did an amazing job on behalf of the people of Iowa's Third Congressional District. Be sure to check out the traditional Intern Exit Interviews to learn more about both Devon and Scott and their experiences in the nation's capital this summer. Devon's Intern Exit Interview is located HERE and Scott's interview is located HERE.
￼
 ￼
Thanks to the Plumbers and Steamfitters Local Union 33 in Des Moines I had the opportunity to tour their training center and learn more about their apprenticeship program. In the above photo I am hearing about the issues they are engaged on. I learned a lot and was impressed with the eagerness of the students and dedication of the instructors to impart their knowledge on these future tradesmen.
￼
￼
I had the privilege of participating in a new farmers roundtable with U.S. Agricultural Secretary Sonny Purdue when he was in Iowa this month. After the roundtable I had the honor of showing the Secretary one of Iowa's true gems - Living History Farms. Here I met with Iowans who volunteer at the farm about current legislative issues they are interested in.
￼
￼
July and August mean county fairs, rodeos and the Iowa State Fair. This photo is from my visit to Sidney Championship Rodeo. Spectators and performers come from all over to take in this annual event. I enjoyed talking with this Iowan about veterans and agricultural concerns.
Thanks for taking the time to read this update!
Take care.

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL
Monday, August 14, 2017: As Georgia’s only representative currently serving on the Energy and Commerce committee, it’s important for me to represent all of our state’s interests and today I’m in Atlanta visiting with companies in the area.  My first visit is with the Georgia Department of
￼
Congressman and Mrs. Carter at the Georgia Department of Transportation
Transportation (GDOT) and Georgia Emergency Management Agency (GEMA) which are located in the same building complex in the South Atlanta area.   I begin at GDOT where I learn of the 511 system in Georgia and get a first-hand look at the traffic monitoring capabilities of GDOT within the I-285 perimeter of Atlanta.  Next, I have a presentation by Southern Linc, an Atlanta-based regional wireless carrier that combines multiple communication options such as Push to Talk two-way radio (PTT), cellular service, wireless Internet access, wireless data, and text and picture messaging, into one hand-held device.  Afterwards, I visit with GEMA where I have the opportunity to meet with various emergency personnel, including my long-time friend Director Homer Bryson, and express to them our thanks for the fine work they did for the State of Georgia and especially for the First District during Hurricane Matthew.  Next, I have a phone interview with WTOC to discuss the situation with North Korea while I travel to Duluth in the North Atlanta area for my next visit with Honeywell, a company that specializes in advanced software solutions in the processes industry.  Honeywell provides companies such as paper mills in our district with software for emissions management, gas regulations, industrial security, and various other services.  My final visit of the day is to the new Mercedes-Benz stadium that is going to be the official home of the Atlanta Falcons and Atlanta United FC (the soccer team).  This phenomenal $1.5 billion structure will host the Super Bowl, Men’s Final Four, and the NCAAF National Championship all before 2020.   

Tuesday, August 15, 2017: On my way back from Atlanta to South Georgia today I make a number
￼
Members of the Brunswick-Golden Isles Chamber of Commerce with Congressman Carter
of stops with my first one being in Macon where I am speaking at the Georgia Chamber of Commerce Congressional Luncheon.  This annual event gives members of our congressional delegation the opportunity to update the business community on Washington issues.  Next, I head
to Vidalia where I have a tour of Bland Farms, one of the area’s largest onion and sweet potato farms, to learn more about their business model and discuss the challenges they face, particularly with labor and the H-2A program.  Delbert and Troy Bland have done an outstanding job in growing their business and have even expanded into other countries.  My final stop is at the University of Georgia Onion and Vegetable Research Center in Lyons where I meet with farmers from the area to discuss the issues they are facing as a result of federal regulations.



Wednesday, August 16, 2017: I’m back in Savannah and the First District this morning and my first meeting is at the Georgia Tech Savannah campus for the Department of Labor Summit hosted by my good friend and former State House colleague Labor Commissioner Mark Butler.  After a meeting with local elected and business leaders to discuss labor issues, including the H-2B program, I have the opportunity to address around 150 attendees from the business sector and bring them up to date
￼
Congressman Carter at Curtis V. Cooper Health Clinic
on labor legislation in Washington.  Later, I head to Curtis V. Cooper Primary Health Care in downtown Savannah to hear of the great work they are doing and help celebrate National Health Center Week.  Next, I hit the road and travel to Nahunta in Brantley County for a tour of the Golden Isles Conservation Center, a project of Cox Enterprises that utilizes organic materials such as wood chips to generate heat to break down tires into their original components.  Once at full capacity this center will be able to remove the equivalent of five tons of tires from landfills daily.  Afterwards, I head to the Brantley County Jail where I am treated to a tour of the facility by Sheriff Len Davis before heading to Jesup in Wayne County where I visit the Healthy Pet facility.  Healthy Pet is a German-based company that is a leader in natural fiber processing for use in pet care and recently announced that they will invest $9.3 million to expand their production plant to provide for a new cat litter line.  

Thursday, August 17, 2017:Built in 1986, the Georgia Pacific Savannah River Mill is located in
￼
Congressman Carter at Southwest Chatham Library
Effingham County near Rincon and is the county’s largest private employer.  This morning they have invited me to their facility for a tour of this impressive plant that contains 5 of the world’s 12 largest tissue machines and make products such as Quilted Northern and AngelSoft.  Afterwards, I head to Pooler where I have the opportunity to speak briefly at the Pooler Chamber Economic Luncheon and where we hear from Armstrong State University Economics Professor Michael Toma about the phenomenal growth that this second fastest growing city in Georgia has experienced during the past few years.  Next, I head to Ditch Witch of Georgia located in Savannah for a tour of their facilitysponsored by the Associated Equipment Distributors.  After a meeting in my Savannah District office with Seth Millican and members of the Georgia Transportation Alliance to discuss transportation issues in our state, I head to the Southwest Chatham Library where they are hosting a science program about the forthcoming solar eclipse before finishing my day in downtown Savannah by speaking to the Conservative Policy Leadership Institute. 

Friday, August 18, 2017: After spending early this morning with my Band of Brothers Bible study group, I head to downtown Savannah where I speak to the Metro Savannah Hispanic Chamber of Commerce followed by a trip to Hunter Army Airfield (HAAF).  After meeting with Col. Sean Bernabe, Lt. Col. Kenneth Dwyer and other HAAF leadership at the garrison headquarters, I head to a memorial ceremony for SSG Alex Bentley-Freeman, who was tragically killed earlier this week in an automobile accident.  One of our nation’s heroes, SSG Bentley-Freeman was a highly decorated soldier who leaves behind a wife and one week old daughter, Eli.  I had the honor of presenting his wife, Andrea, an American Flag I had flown over the Capitol in his honor.  After this somber ceremony, I have a tour of HAAF to inspect the hangers as well as the impressive aircraft that these dedicated professional soldiers fly and maintain.  Following an opportunity to sit down and visit with soldiers for a Q & A session, I head down to Brunswick in Glynn County for a visit to Perry Park Clinic, another of the many fine Community Health Centers in the First Congressional District.

Summer District Work Period Update
From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino: 
Good morning,
During the third week of Congress Summer District Work Period, I honored one of our nations heroes, visited a local manufacturer, promoted affordable access to health care and spoke with advocates for persons with disabilities.
Im also happy to report that two PA-10 fire departments have been awarded grants to keep our communities safe and the Little League World Series is in full swing in South Williamsport.
Here are some of the highlights of my work serving Pennsylvanias 10th Congressional District:
Honoring an American Hero
As a member of Congress, one of the most gratifying experiences is being able to honor our veterans.  I had the privilege of presenting the Congressional Gold Medal to Lt. William H. Farley, U.S. Army Air Forces (Ret.), the oldest known living Tuskegee Airman at the age of 100 years old.
￼
I was honored to sit down and speak with Lt. William H. Farley, U.S. Army Air Forces (Ret.), a great man who defended our freedom during World War II at the Elmcroft Senior Living facility in Reedsville. 
In 2007, President George W. Bush joined Congress to bestow the gold medal to this group of WWII heroes entitling individual members, such as Lt. Farley, to receive their personal bronze replica of the award.
If it were not for the service of Americas veterans, we wouldnt be able to enjoy the freedoms we enjoy today. Whether it is by pinning a Purple Heart on a vet or giving an award to the family of a service member who made the ultimate sacrifice, these instances always humble me.
Spurring Economic Growth
I had an opportunity to tour the Clayton Marlette Homes (CMH) facility in Lewistown to learn about quality manufactured housing options for PA-10 consumers.
￼
During my visit, I had a great discussion with over 100 CMH employees. 
Afterwards, I had an informative question and answer session with over 100 of CMH's hardworking employees on how policymakers in Washington can help grow the economy and create jobs. 
Promoting Affordable Health Care
In celebration of National Health Center Week, I paid a visit to the River Valley Health and Dental Center in Williamsport.
￼
It was a pleasure to chat with James Yoxtheimer, President and Chief Executive Officer of the River Valley Health and Dental Center, to learn how an expanded Williamsport facility is shaping the future of our nations health care system.  (Photo Credit: Rob Crowell)
As a local community owned and operated business, River Valleys staff of 90 health professionals provide access to affordable care for over 13,000 Lycoming County patients per year.
Advocating for Persons with Disabilities
I met with representatives of the Roads to Freedom Center for Independent Living of Northern Pennsylvania (CILNCP) to discuss critical issues for individuals with disabilities to gain freedom in their lives.
￼
I had an informative meeting with advocates from the Roads to Freedom Center for Independent Living (CILNCP) in Williamsport. (Pictured left to right): Jeff Iseman, CILNCP Council Program Analyst; Mark Murawski, Lycoming County Transportation Planner; Congressman Marino; Jon Bausinger, CILNCP Director of Finance and Human Resources and Jill Morrissey, Jersey Shore State Bank Community Reinvestment Act Officer)
Topics discussed included Congress consideration of the ADA Education and Reform Act and support for the Roads to Freedom housing project.
Keeping PA-10 Communities Safe
I am pleased to announce the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has awarded a total of $336,287 in their latest round of Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG)to the Chinchilla Hose Company in South Abington Township and Honesdale Fire Department Hose Company 1.
￼
The Chinchilla Hose Company in South Abington Township is among 15 Pennsylvania fire departments to receive Assistance to Firefighters Grant Awards in the latest round of federal funding from FEMA totaling $1.9 million.
Since 2001, the AFG program has helped firefighters and other first responders obtain critical equipment, emergency vehicles, training and other resources needed to protect our neighborhoods and keep our families safe.
Play Ball!
The Little League World Series is underway in South Williamsport with 16 teams from nine countries competing for this years championship.  The finalists will compete in the title game one week from today.

PA-10 is home to the largest youth sports program in the world. Little League can be found in more than 80 countries worldwide with more than 2.4 million children participating each year. It was all started by Carl Stotz in 1939, and today the original field is on the national historic registry.
I hope to see you at the games!

PROTECTING & STRENGTHENING MEDICARE
Did you know that Ambulatory Surgery Centers like Truvista Surgery Center in Troy save Medicare tens of millions of dollars every year?

A Busy August...
Dear Friend:
August too often serves as a reminder that here in Colorado summer will soon come to an end. Some of these reminders are the end of a much awaited family vacations, getting the kids back to school or noticing that the days are starting to shorten a bit. The important point of all this for me though, is that it signals to those of us in Congress that it is time to ‘gear up’ for what I expect will be a very busy fall and upcoming winter. 
August, of course, is my best opportunity for me to spend a few consecutive weeks in the district meeting with constituents, touring businesses, and engaging the community on the issues that matter most to you!  This week, for example I visited the Birdon/NamJet Corporation. This company manufactures marine propulsion systems recognized nationally for their high-quality and dependability. Birdon’s products are currently used in commercial, military and workboat platforms, and, best of all Birdon makes these products right here in our own backyard. During these visits, as I frequently do, I speak directly with managers, executives, and directly with the workers on the factory floor. I very much enjoy hearing firsthand about their daily duties and routines. 
￼
I truly value these opportunities to speak with those in the 'front lines'. Time and time again, I find that these hardworking Americans are not only looking to provide for their own families, but are looking for new and innovative ways to bring their products to market. They also provide me with their insights on the challenges facing themselves, their employer, their community, and our nation. I take what I hear on these visits straight to Congress and keep them in mind as we consider tax and regulatory policies. The goal is not only expanding already existing businesses in our community and country, but also bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. These visits and conversations help to remind of my time as a Colorado small-business owner and the concerns that I had then, on how to limit government interference in people’s lives and their businesses. These concerns were what ultimately led me to run for office, and today serve you! 
￼
One of the privileges I have as your representative is welcoming new citizens to our great country. This past Wednesday, at the Aurora City Hall, I was invited to speak to and welcome 70 new U.S. Citizens as they took the oath of citizenship. These 70 new Americans will now become part of the history and fabric of our country and the Aurora community. This ceremony also reminded me that our immigration system is in severe need of reform, seeing these new citizens take their oath of allegiance in the presence of friends and families and also reaffirms my conviction that we need to make immigration reform a priority in Congress, while keeping in mind that such reform should secure our borders, strengthen our economy and keeps families together. 
As August comes to an end in Colorado, rest assured that the time I spent at home among all who reside in the 6th Congressional District, has only served in re-energizing me for the heavy legislative agenda I look forward to addressing this fall.

Sincerely, 
￼

Dear Friend,   When I was in 3rd grade, I had a friend named Phillip Brown. My birthday party was nearing, and it was common at the time to invite all the boys in the class to a party. And I did invite everyone, including Phillip, who was a particularly special friend. The party was at a roller skating rink. As I was opening presents, my father came up to me and whispered in my ear, “Jeffrey, is Phillip a black boy?” I said, “Yes.” Then I didn’t think about it anymore.  On the following Monday at school, I saw Phillip. I was somewhat hurt because he had not come to my birthday party. I asked him, “Phillip, why didn’t you come?” He said, “I did. They wouldn’t let me in.”  I was eight years old. The year was 1968. It turns out that my father had to go outside, talk to Phillip’s father, and awkwardly explain to him that this particular establishment was apparently a disturbing remnant of the old ways. Black children were not allowed in.  After business concludes each day in Congress, there is a dedicated period when representatives from each side of the political aisle take time to speak. Democrats can speak and then Republicans, or vice versa. Each side takes turns. One evening, Congressman Al Green, an African-American representative from Houston, was speaking about Black History Month. Congressman Green spoke extensively of both his difficult times as a young lawyer facing a segregated courthouse, and about important progress on civil rights that had been made in the country, adding that there was still the need for more understanding.   As I was preparing my thoughts for my own address next, listening closely as Congressman Green was wrapping up his speech, I kept thinking about Phillip. The thought occurred to me to ask if the Congressman would “yield”—a courteous way of seeking time to interject something. In this circumstance, it would be unusual, but I couldn’t let the thought go.  I decided, ""Yes, this is important,” and said, “Will the gentleman yield?” A bit startled at first, Congressman Green said, “I would be happy to yield to the gentleman.”  So, I thanked him for his words and told the story of Phillip Brown--but with one new detail: the reaction of my own children when I told them of this event from my childhood.  You could see the anguish on their faces.  My children were aghast that such a hurtful thing could happen. They said, “Daddy, you have to find Phillip.”   In the meanwhile, another representative from Texas named Ted Poe had come onto the floor of the House to get ready for his speech, and he began to listen. Congressman Poe then asked, “Will the gentleman yield?” And he began to talk about similar memories of the segregation at the courthouse, and his sentiments about the progress made. He said to me, “Jeff, you’ve got to find Phillip.”  I had occasion recently to go back to the little school that I attended (an all-white school in my time, except, as I recall, for the Brown family). I met the principal, who is an African-American woman.  It is now a school for children with special talents in which most of the students are African-American.  She was kind enough to take me on a little tour.  Some things had been added like air conditioning, but much was the same.   I walked into one of my old classrooms. Memories flooded over me. It even smelled the same! I asked the principal, “Will you look in the records? Will you help me find Phillip Brown?”   Sincerely, ￼  Congressman Jeff Fortenberry

Dear Friend, 
On Monday, August 21, 2017, Missourians and folks all across the United States will experience a once in a lifetime event, the 2017 Great American Solar Eclipse. The last time this happened in the continental U.S. was nearly 40 years ago. What's even more exciting is that a total solar eclipse has not been seen in our area since 1442!
 
For a couple of minutes around noon on Monday, you can expect total darkness. Birds will stop singing, crickets will start chirping, and your farm animals may think it's time to head back to the barn for the night. During this time, while the sun is directly behind the moon, we will be able to see stars and planets we can't normally see. We will also be able to see the ""corona,"" or the outer edge, of the sun.
 
In the parts of Missouri that are along the ""path of totality,"" they are expecting record breaking crowds. Hotels and motels have sold out, and I've even heard about folks renting space on their farms for tourists in RVs and people who want to set up camp to watch the eclipse.
 
According to the St. Louis Eclipse Task Force, the eclipse will cut across Missouri starting at St. Joseph in the West and crossing over to Ste. Genevieve in the East. More than 3 million Missourians live in the path of totality. Areas of our district that will be in the path of totality include DeSoto, Farmington, Festus, Hillsboro, Perryville, Potosi, Ste. Genevieve and Sullivan.
 
The Great American Eclipse is a once in a lifetime event, but it's also a great example of the growing agri-tourism and entertainment industry in our area. As I've taken the month of August to focus on farms, I have seen just how quickly this industry is growing, and I am excited that we have a truly cosmic event to spur this industry along. In fact, at one of my stops in Jefferson County, they were getting ready to host an eclipse viewing event on their farm handing out eclipse viewing glasses, Sun Chips and more eclipse-themed gear!
 
This natural phenomenon is bringing visitors from all over the world to our little corner of the country, and while they are here, they'll see for themselves what makes it great to live in the 8th.
 
We have an awesome opportunity to enjoy Missouri's great outdoors and spend time with friends and family, but we have to do it safely. Remember, you cannot look directly at the sun without damaging your eyes, so you must wear a pair of certified solar eclipse glasses. If you can't find these, you can watch online. For more information about local events near you, visit MissouriEclipse2017.com 
  
Focus On Farms 
We have already logged more than 1,500 miles across southeast and south central Missouri during our 5th annual focus on farms. At every stop, I am hearing directly from farmers and local agribusinesses about issues they have and what I can do to help. 
￼ 

In Wasola at The Concrete Works, I met owners Sean and Cleta Sweeney who founded The Concrete Works in 1990. They operate four distinct businesses on their property - mining, organic farming, cement and machinery. They primarily produce storm shelters and cattle feeders and have hired several local Future Farmers of America students. 

The Concrete Works is an excellent example of the diversity of agribusinesses in southeast and south central Missouri. They are particularly unique because they have designed their concrete mix specifically to withstand the wear and tear that comes along with agricultural and commercial use - ingenuity at it's finest! 

￼ 

At Greek Farms in Phelps County, Bill Mousadakos and his family raise cattle and more than 200 Katahdin hair sheep. Bill told me how he's learned to raise sheep and cattle in the same pastures because they eat different types of grass. 

Farmers are innovators, especially when we get the government out of the way. It's inspiring to see folks like Bill who are dedicated to raising their animals while being a good steward of their land. 

￼ 

Heartland Farms in Crawford County is an awesome example of how the agri-tourism and entertainment industry is growing in our area! They host everything from weddings to murder-mystery dinners and open their farm up each Fall for a corn maze and pumpkin patch. 

￼ 

I also met with the Missouri Fox Trotting Horse Breed Association, Inc. in Douglas County where members told me they were frustrated with our country's complicated and unfair tax code. 

As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, we are meeting almost daily to fix our country's broken tax system and get the government out of Missourian's pockets! 

￼ 

We had a great stop at Ozark Regional Stock Yards in Howell County. In a week, the agribusiness can see upwards of 5,000 calves and cattle sold. 

This is a big economic driver for the West Plains area. I got to visit with folks from home and hear about new hotels that have opened in the area and restaurants that are busier when the stock yards are open - exciting to see people coming from all over to buy and sell cattle for their farms. 

￼ 
Finally, I stopped at Rain Crow Ranch in Ripley County. They are the #1 producer of grass fed beef in the United States and right in the heart of our Congressional District! They have over 15,000 head of cattle on more than 5,000 acres. Agribusinesses like Rain Crow Ranch bring jobs to our area, which is why I'm working with the Trump Administration to open up new markets and grow our ag-economy. 

Our farm stops will continue throughout the month of August! Follow me on Facebook and Twitter for updates from our fifth annual focus on farms. 

As always, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to my office for help. 
  
What's Great in the 8th 
￼ 
Marie and Robert Nowell from Portageville celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary last weekend. The couple met at a street carnival in Portageville and rode the ferris wheel together and then were married August 22, 1928 in Caruthersville. Robert participated in the Battle of the Bulge and various other theaters of WWII. He received a Bronze Star and various other medals of honor for his service. While Robert was at war his wife Marie gave birth to their first son Robert Larry Nowell, and by 1959 they had seven children total - Donnie, Mamie, Patricia, Ricky,  Anthony, and Randy. They now have 20 grandchildren, 39 great grandchildren, and 5 great great grandchildren. They continue to live in Portageville on their farm that once belonged to Robert's parents.

Congratulations to Emerald Loida! He was a member of the board of the Ste. Genevieve Levee District #2 for 50 years! Board President Chris Kertz presented Emerald with a plaque to honor his retirement from the board on Tuesday. We are grateful for your service to the community, Mr. Loida.  
￼ 
The 8th Congressional District is 50 for 50 in community service! 

Not only was Mr. Loida recognized for his 50 years of community service, but West Plains resident Jay Padgett was also recognized for 50 years of service with The Rotary Club.

Dear Friends,  I am writing you today to share the latest edition of Jackie's Reading Picks, a selection of articles that have piqued my interest over the past week and that I thought would be of interest to you. One of the cornerstones of our great democracy is our free press and an informed citizenry. Now, more than ever, it's critical that we remain engaged and keep ourselves informed of the news and issues that impact each and every one of us. I also want to hear your feedback and what you think we should be reading and focusing on at home in the 14th District, and around our great country. By working together and keeping abreast of what is happening in our government, economy, and communities we can continue to contribute to and strengthen our democracy. 
Happy reading and all the best,

Rise of the Machines
By Chico Harlan, The Washington Post
The workers of the first shift had just finished their morning cigarettes and settled into place when one last car pulled into the factory parking lot, driving past an American flag and a “now hiring” sign. Out came two men, who opened up the trunk, and then out came four cardboard boxes labeled “fragile.”
￼
“We’ve got the robots,” one of the men said.
They watched as a forklift hoisted the boxes into the air and followed the forklift into a building where a row of old mechanical presses shook the concrete floor. The forklift honked and carried the boxes past workers in steel-toed boots and earplugs. It rounded a bend and arrived at the other corner of the building, at the end of an assembly line.
The line was intended for 12 workers, but two were no-shows. One had just been jailed for drug possession and violating probation. Three other spots were empty because the company hadn’t found anybody to do the work. That left six people on the line jumping from spot to spot, snapping parts into place and building metal containers by hand, too busy to look up as the forklift now came to a stop beside them.

Charlottesville
￼
A conversation about race and violence in Charlottesville with Reverend Al Sharpton and historian Jon Meacham.
Charlie Rose: We continue our look at the violence in Charlottesville this weekend with the consideration of its broader implications about race in this country. Joining me now from Nashville, Tennessee, is historian Jon Meacham. Here in New York, Reverend Al Sharpton, founder and president of the National Action Network. I'm pleased to have them both on this program. Let me begin, Jon, with how you saw, as a fellow southerner, how you saw the action in Charlottesville, a town that I suspect both of you -- both of us have long admired for because of its tradition there and its education and University of Virginia and all of that. 
Jon Meacham: Absolutely. It was a tragic example of a perennial American tradition of hate and alienation. I think it's been reported that these groups have started finding these blue dots, these blue cities sometimes in red states, so that the drama is more pronounced. It is an old tactic. I think they've tragically taken it perhaps from Dr. King. Reverend Al would know better than I would. But I think it was a critical point to pick the right place during the movement. Birmingham was a strategic choice because of Bull Connor. But what we are living in right now in 2017 is a moment in which the president of the United States cannot find it in his heart or his mind, and one would hope he would find it in both places ideally, to condemn what is self-evidently the darkest part of the American psyche. And I think that until we grapple with that, then we're going to have a continually frustrating conversation about these very important issues.

Down the Breitbart Hole
By Wil S. Hylton, The New York Times Magazine
The editor in chief of Breitbart News is a 31-year-old craft beer enthusiast from Los Angeles named Alexander Marlow. Probably starting about here, the official style guide of The New York Times Magazine would have me refer to him as ‘‘Marlow,’’ but this is a story about storytelling — about the stories we choose to tell and the way we tell them; the fictions that we entertain when we claim to write nonfiction — so I’m going to blow past the usual journalistic claptrap and just refer to our subject as Alex, because that’s what everybody who knows him calls him, and people who don’t know him tend to call him something much worse.
Alex has been the editor of Breitbart for about four years. In 2008, he was the first employee hired by its founder Andrew Breitbart, and he began to lead the editorial staff when Breitbart died in 2012, although it would be another year and change before he claimed the title of editor in 2013. However you cut it, that puts Alex in charge of Breitbart long before last year’s election, responsible for the daily decisions about what to cover and how. If right now you’re thinking that it’s kind of weird how you’ve been reading about Breitbart more or less constantly for the past year, following the daily exploits of former employees like Steve Bannon and Milo Yiannopoulos, but this is the first time you’ve ever heard of Alexander Marlow, that’s by design. People close to Alex refer to him variously as ‘‘a shut-in,’’ a ‘‘misanthrope’’ and a ‘‘hermit,’’ who communicates with his staff primarily by phone/text/email and doesn’t have a lot of friends. In fact, if you have come across Alex before now, it was probably in mid-June, when some of the people on the business side of Breitbart persuaded him to appear on the HBO show ‘‘Real Time With Bill Maher.’’

Court Finds Two House Districts in Texas Were Illegally Drawn
By Bridget Bowman, Roll Call
A federal panel ruled Tuesday that the drawing of two Texas House districts violated federal law and that the state’s congressional map needs to be redrawn ahead of the 2018 midterms.
The unanimous ruling from the three-judge panel found that the 35th District, represented by Democrat Lloyd Doggett, and the 27th District, represented by Republican Blake Farenthold, were drawn primarily on the basis of race, violating the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act. 
The ruling could also have implications for efforts to ensure Texas voting proposals are pre-cleared by the federal government before becoming law.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in a statement called the ruling “puzzling,” and said he intends to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.

8/19/17 11:29,Our greatest weapon against hate,"Share on: 
￼￼ 
 
￼
￼


Dear Friend, 
The organizer’s behind last Saturday’s protest in Charlottesville, VA are committed to causes inspired by hate, bigotry, and selfishness. Let me be clear, there is no defense for the KKK or white supremacists and the racist views they stand for and they must be condemned universally and decisively. The greatest weapon to organizations founded in hate and the desire to divide, is Americans’ pursuit of unity, acceptance, and love for one another. From our earliest days to this past weekend, these values have been challenged and tested, but they have remained constant as an American ideal. As we mourn the senseless loss of life in Charlottesville and consider how to move forward as a nation, we must confront racists with what they fear most by continuing to work toward this ideal. With tensions high in communities across the country, progress can only come with the recognition we are all on the same team, a willingness to walk in each other’s shoes, and a common goal of regaining trust and civility within our neighborhoods and throughout the country. We must all learn to live together as brothers and sisters, as Dr. Martin Luther King said, or we will all perish together as fools.
Hearing Your Concerns in Ellensburg
This week, I met with the Ellensburg Indivisible Group to discuss topics including immigration, tax reform, climate change, and how our country can move forward after the tragic events in Charlottesville. Since my office first reached out to Indivisible in January, I have sat down with groups on many occasions throughout our district to discuss these topics and more.
HERE is the Ellensburg Daily Record’s coverage of my visit to Ellensburg.  
￼
The Healing Power of Horses
Thursday I had the opportunity to watch three young riders during their therapy session at Alatheia Riding Center in Wenatchee. Alatheia serves 85 clients from as far away as Moses Lake. During my visit, I had the chance to meet the parents of the riders and talk to them about how much horse riding therapy has helped their children with their balance, strength, and even vocal skills.
￼
Washington’s Most Talented Mariachi Band
Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of getting to know Ramon Rivera and his Mariachi Huenachi students. Their talent has won them recognition on the national stage and it was my honor to invite the students to perform for Members of Congress and visitors from around the world at the U.S. Capitol during Hispanic Heritage Month. It was a joy to visit with them on Friday!  
￼
Fighting Poverty at Home and Across the Globe
It has been a pleasure to work with the One Campaign and Bread for the World on our mutual goal of fighting to end extreme poverty across the globe. I sat down with them in Wenatchee this week to discuss the Senate’s passage of a bill I have championed, the READ Act, which would strengthen foreign aid programs to fund schools and educational programs in impoverished communities around the world. The READ Act passed the House earlier this year and is now one step closer to becoming law.
￼
Modernizing NAFTA
This week, the Administration began the first round of talks with Canada and Mexico to update the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Over the past several decades, NAFTA has positively transformed the U.S. and North American economy. It has reduced barriers to our exports, allowing American businesses to sell their goods and services more freely and competitively to markets around the world, creating countless U.S. jobs and lowering prices for consumers in the process. While NAFTA has benefited nearly every sector of our economy, the world has evolved tremendously since the agreement was signed in 1994. This week’s negotiating round provides an opportunity for the Administration to begin the process of bringing NAFTA into the 21st century and updating the deal to better serve American farmers, workers, exporters, and consumers. I look forward to continuing to work closely with the Administration to ensure a modernized NAFTA strengthens America’s economic competitiveness while maintaining the benefits that we enjoy today.
This week I also met with Northwest Horticulture to discuss how NAFTA has been a tremendous benefit to the tree fruit industry in Washington State. Mexico is the number one importer of Washington apples!
Visiting with Three Young Scouts
Meeting with Richard, Parker and Payton on Friday made my day. These young Boy Scouts were full of energy and drive to make their community a better place. 
￼
Providing Free Legal Services for Those in Need
As a former member of law enforcement, I met many victims of domestic violence and saw how financial limitations could make it difficult for them to seek the justice they deserve. The Northwest Justice Project offers victims legal support and also provides free legal services for areas of family law. Thank you, Northwest Justice Project for the tremendous good you do and for taking the time to sit down with me this week.
￼
Bringing Healthy Food to Kids
On Thursday, I stopped by the local Pybus Farmer’s Market in Wenatchee. There I met with local famers, representatives from Northwest Harvest, Columbia Valley Community Health, and others who have partnered together to bring healthy food to kids. We also discussed the importance of the SNAP and the Women, Infant, and Children Nutrition Program.
￼
Hearing from Chelan County Commissioners
On Friday, I spoke with Chelan’s County Commissioners about issues impacting the East side of the mountains, including the Stehekin road, the Yakima River Basin, and more. 
Protecting Our Intellectual Property
The U.S. economy and so many jobs depend on the strength of our technology companies, including some of our nation’s leading tech companies headquartered in my home state of Washington. But the ability of our businesses to compete is severely undermined when China robs them of their most valuable assets to benefit its own technology sector. I welcome the Administration’s leadership in addressing Chinese policies that encourage or require the transfer of American technology to Chinese enterprise as the cost of doing business in the country. I am committed to working closely with the Administration as it undertakes its review and decides on appropriate action to end these practices once and for all.
Thanks to Our Summer Interns!
Andrew and Peter were stand-out interns. It was a pleasure to have their help in my Washington, DC office this summer!
￼
It was also an absolute pleasure to have Debbie and Samantha as interns in my Issaquah office this summer. They displayed great enthusiasm and passion for issues impacting Washington’s Eighth and I wish them the best of luck this upcoming school year! 
￼
Have a wonderful and safe weekend and I will speak with you next time! 

Sincerely,
Dave

8/19/17 11:29,Beyond resistance: Publicly funding campaigns,"Update | Saturday, August 19, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 22nd day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: publicly funding campaigns.
“Dark” special interest money has infiltrated our campaigns in the wake of the Supreme Court’s disastrous Citizens United v. FEC decision. It is critical that we make our elections about the people, not about ultra-rich special interests. One way to reduce special interest influence is to publicly finance campaigns.
I joined my colleagues to introduce the Government By the People Act. This legislation would substantially reduce the influence of dark money, diversify the pool of political candidates, and encourage campaigns to build bases of small donors and real people.
By publicly funding campaigns, along with other reforms, we can ensure that money does not act as a barrier to democracy. Everyone should have an equal chance, regardless of support of secret mega donors.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

""Be not overcome with evil, but overcome evil with good..."" These words of wisdom from Romans 12:21 are good reminder for us all in the wake of the horrific events in Charlottesville this weekend. Between the years I spent at the University of Virginia for business school and more recent visits to our sons Marshall and Bolton at UVA, I echo many in saying that's not the Charlottesville I know. My prayers go out to the victims and their families, and I trust justice will prevail. Racist hate is a scourge on our society, and we must overcome this evil with good.

Pentagon Offers Plan to Arm the Ukraine: Can I make another pitch for adhering to the simple and constitutional notion that only Congress can authorize war? The Founding Fathers were so deliberate about this. They knew that war’s costs were borne by the taxpayer...and that the ultimate costs were borne by slain soldiers whose bodies were returned not to Washington but to congressional districts across this country.

Once you start deviating from this, there are all sorts of offshoots for both soldiers…and taxpayers.

The most recent wrinkle in this comes in the Ukraine. The idea of the United States and Russia supplying weapons to opposing sides in various conflicts is not something new. It happened in Afghanistan in the 1980s, the Balkans in the 1990s, and now in Syria. Each serve as a grim reminder that these proxy wars can often devolve into costly, violent, and at times lengthy conflicts.

I raise this point because earlier this month, the Departments of State and Defense sent a proposal to the White House that would send weapons to Ukraine’s military in order to assist in its fight against Russian-backed separatists...one step closer to another proxy war with Russia.

In this conflict, I stand on the side of the Ukraine. But wherever you might stand, it should not be a unilateral decision made by any president. It should be decided by the Congress. I think that given the broad consequences that flow from prolonged proxy engagements, arming the Ukraine military should be a decision made after debate in Congress.

Proxy wars can involve the use of millions (if not billions) of US taxpayer dollars, affect our nation’s overall military strategy, and are just one step shy of outright US warfighting. Founding Fathers like Madison decried the biases that were built into executive and immediate action on war and believed they should be tempered by a Congress that directly bore its human and financial costs.

Here’s a little more on this front…. Take a look….

The GROW Act: Last month, the House voted on H.R. 23, the Gaining Responsibility Over Water Act. I was one of seven Republicans to vote no, but the bill passed 230 to 190. On its face, this bill seemed like a straightforward attempt to solve years of drought and groundwater depletion in the western United States. But in fact, the bill is far more complex than it first appears, and consequently, I had two major reservations worth noting below. 

One was tied to the notion of federalism. If you really believe that the government most local generally governs best, then locals should indeed have some degree of authority in determining what happens in their backyard. The second involved the establishment of a “pay to play” permitting system for water management projects that would unfairly benefit communities with the most resources.

First, the bill overrides the State of California’s environmental regulations as they apply to the federal government’s Central Valley Project (CVP) and the state government’s State Water Project (SWP). What this means in simpler terms is that the federal government would be able to ignore a wide range of environmental laws in California that were passed to protect and manage the state’s own water and wildlife resources. I suspect you and I may disagree with many of the environmental laws passed in California, but if one really believes in the idea of local control, we would recognize it is not up to us in South Carolina to dictate California state law. 

The Tenth Amendment to the Constitution declares that any powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution are reserved to the states or to the people. While I’m sympathetic to the bill’s attempts to help the state and federal governments better prevent future droughts, we should ultimately be leery of any bill that tries to replace local authority with more federal control.

Second, the bill sets up a “pay to play” permitting system for expediting the approval of dam construction in California. Local communities would be allowed under this bill to pay a fee to the Bureau of Reclamation in order to expedite the decision process on their dam permitting applications.

The bottom line here is that wealthier communities that can afford to pay the expediting fee will be approved far more quickly than communities that might be struggling to pay for other services. The law represents the promise of equality under the law, and accordingly, I am uncertain how one can treat two municipalities differently in this instance.

Forever GI bill now LAW



Friend,
Welcome to your weekly update. As always, you can learn more about these and other legislative issues at my website: upton.house.gov.
Forever GI bill now LAW
The Forever GI bill was recently signed into law. This bipartisan legislation is a transformational expansion of GI Bill benefits granted to veterans, their surviving spouses, and dependents. Since 1944 the GI Bill has provided our veterans the opportunity to invest in their futures through access to education benefits. By growing these education and workforce training opportunities we can help ease their transition from active duty to civilian life.
You can learn more here.
We must come together
Given the current events of the past week, I wanted to pass along some thoughts. A week ago, our nation was struck with tragic, senseless violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. I join together with many others in denouncing this sort of unacceptable racism and bigotry and condemning white supremacy, neo-Nazi, and KKK groups –particularly the ones whose actions led to the violence in Charlottesville. 
Let me be clear: there are no “very fine” white supremacists. 
My father fought in the Battle of the Bulge during World War II against the Nazi's. That kind of evil and hatred must be stamped out.
I have always been one who looks to bring folks together. I’ll continue to speak out against racism, divisive rhetoric, and violence just as I publicly did twice this week. 
One more thing….
This week, my friend and former colleague Vern Ehlers passed away. They don’t make them like my friend and former colleague Vern anymore. He was so well respected on both sides of the aisle, hard-working, and always a teacher at heart. He committed his life to the service of others – ensuring our students were well prepared for careers in math and science and raising awareness for protecting our environment and Great Lakes. He was a family man who made his community and country a better place for all. We will certainly miss his common-sense voice, the likes of which is all too rare in today’s political climate.
 Have a great weekend and God bless,
-Fred

WHY HOOSIERS WANT TAX REFORM
￼
This week, I heard from Hoosiers across the 2nd District about why they want tax reform.
Listening to small business owners, manufacturers, farmers, and workers is essential to getting tax reform done right.
Thats why I was in Kewanna meeting with Hoosier farmers to discuss how tax reform can help them invest in the future.
￼
I was in Plymouth learning about how employee-owned companies like Ferrellgas empower workers to invest in their futures.
￼
And I was in Goshen talking to members of the local Chamber of Commerce about how fixing our broken tax code can help them expand businesses.
￼
Our tax code hasnt been updated in 31 years, and its holding our economy back.
Its time to fix our broken tax code and make it simpler, flatter, and fairer so we can unleash economic growth and build a brighter future in America.
Its time for tax reform.
As always, it is a privilege to represent 2nd District Hoosiers in Congress.

Click the above photo to view photos from the 2017 STEM & Manufacturers Tour
This week Arkansas became the first state to launch its own website to help individuals trained in science, technological, engineering, and mathematical fields to find jobs in their own home state. 
STEM education prepares future generations for invaluable jobs that, frankly, states across the U.S. are having a hard time filling. 
A few weeks ago educators from the 1st District visited manufacturing facilities in the district to better understand what opportunities are available for their students. Part of the reason we have a hard time filling these manufacturing jobs is because of lack of communication between educators and manufacturers.
Just like the new job website, the STEM tour will help equip future generations with the knowledge of opportunities that are available to them. I hope you take time to watch my short video over-viewing the STEM tour this year! 
 

Crawford in the News
Trump missed mark in painting 'both sides' at rally as aggressors, some in Arkansas say
""The president missed a window of opportunity to reject categorically the white supremacy groups that marched in Charlottesville and to name singularly their blame in the death and violence,"" said U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford, a Republican from Jonesboro. ""Had the White House handled the aftermath more bluntly and forthrightly, we probably wouldn't be having this conversation right now.""
Proposed Legislation Would Shift USDA Funding to Combat Opioid Epidemic
The proposed legislation also has Republican support. Senate Ag Chairman Pat Roberts and member Luther Strange have signed on to support the measure in the Senate and House Ag Committee members Rick Crawford, Roger Marshall, Ann McLane Kuster, and Dwight Evans support the House version.
Rep. Crawford talks Charlottesville, Healthcare, Agriculture in China
Representative Rick Crawford talks with KASU News Director Johnathan Reaves about Charlottesville, what should be done about Confederate statues, where to go from here on Obamacare, and opening the China market to Arkansas agriculture. (Click on the link to hear the interview.)
Rep. Crawford introduces opioid bill
A bill in Congress will help deal with the opioid abuse problems in the United States, especially in rural areas, Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Jonesboro said Thursday. Crawford said he has introduced a bill that would try to boost efforts to fight abuse and addiction in rural areas.

NEW BILL: HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS SOLUTIONS ACT
￼
Lindsey - 
There's no doubt that the poor water quality in our area is our most important regional priority. The water discharged by Lake Okeechobee into the Treasure Coast last summer destroyed our community, putting people out of business, killing sea life and even making people sick.
This cannot continue. We cannot wait any longer. Our lagoon and beaches must be restored!
But when I talk to experts about the challenges of cleaning up harmful algal blooms, one of the most frequent roadblocks I hear about is the difficulty in scaling technology to the size needed to clean huge bodies of water. 
That's why I'm introducing the Harmful Algal Blooms Solutions Act. This new bill would go a long way toward improving the type of technology that cleans algae out of fish tanks to be able to keep our rivers clean.
Watch the bill introduction:
￼
The bill creates a program to recognize and award financial prizes to individuals who develop technology to assist with removal of toxic algae. Learn more and read the bill here:

This Week's Events in Charlottesville and Durham
￼
c/o Press Herald
I was deeply saddened by the events that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia.  The American people must understand and confront the scourge of racism in our country.  America cannot tolerate white supremacy in any form.  President Trump's response to the domestic terror attack in Charlottesville was weak and disappointing.  His failure to outright condemn the actions of the KKK, Neo-Nazis, and other extremist groups is unacceptable and below the moral leadership expected of an American president.   You can read my full statement on the events that took place here.
 
Counter-Protests that took place in Durham
￼
c/o McClatchy DC
The demonstrations led by the people in Durham are sending a loud and clear message to those around the country that racism and bigotry are not welcome here.  Like Governor Cooper, I call for the immediate removal of all confederate statues and monuments that are displayed on government property, including the US Capitol.  You can read my full statement on the Durham counter-protest here.
 
Brenda Howerton, President of NC Association of County Commissioners
￼
Congratulations to my good friend, Durham County Commissioner Brenda Howerton, on becoming President of the North Carolina Association of County Commissioners.  Commissioner Howertown is the first Durham County Commissioner to serve as president of the Association.  As a hardworking and dedicated public servant with a passion for public service, I have no doubt that she will successfully serve those in Durham, as well as her fellow commissioners throughout the state. You can read my full statement regarding her election here.

In the News
The News & Observer: Confederate statue falls in Durham. Democrats blame white supremacists for incitement
North Carolina Democrats kept their focus – and their blame – on violent white supremacists and white nationalists Tuesday, even after a group of protesters destroyed a Confederate soldier statue in Durham on Monday evening. “The continued display of racial hatred by white nationalist organizations is damaging to families and communities all across America. What we saw in Durham (Tuesday) night is an outgrowth of the actions by white nationalists,” said Rep. G.K. Butterfield, a Wilson Democrat whose 1st Congressional District includes Durham County. 
Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald: Forward Together
1st District US Congressman G.K. Butterfield answers a one-on-one question from a local resident after addressing a crowd of more than 300 at Bertie High School’s Auditorium on Tuesday night in a town-hall style meeting. He jumped from topic to topic in a 45-minute speech, and then took over a dozen questions from his audience in the auditorium at Bertie High School.
Rocky Mount Telegram: 'The bigger they are, the harder they fall'
A historical marker to many and a symbol of hate to others, the Confederate monument at Battle Park has stood for a century, but its days may now be numbered. “The bigger they are, the harder they fall,” Rocky Mount Councilman Andre Knight said of the large granite monument to the Confederacy on Falls Road at Battle Park. The monument was erected in 1917 on private land, which was gifted to the city in the 1970s.

There's Nowhere Else I'd Rather Be
By Sen. John Thune
 
￼
Photos from several of Sen. Thune's recent 
stops in South Dakota.
 
Everyone has his or her happy place  a special location you would teleport to if you closed your eyes and wished hard enough, if it were only possible. Some people dream of the warm sand and a cool breeze on a beach, others prefer the bright lights and tall buildings of a big city. For me, its easy. Theres nowhere else Id rather be, especially in the summertime, than crisscrossing the state and spending time with fellow South Dakotans. 
 
Whether we see each other at an organized event or at the fair or in the hardware store and whether the discussion is about federal policy or which school your son or daughter is heading off to this fall, Im always interested in catching up. Listening to folks about the issues that matter to them and their family are what help recharge my batteries and refocus my attention on the most important part of my job: you.
 
The last few weeks at home have been busy for me, which is exactly how I like to keep things, and fortunately, we still have plenty of summer days and nights to enjoy before the season comes to an end. Ive already visited Webster, Redfield, Buffalo, Bison, Lemmon, Aberdeen, Arlington, Hayti, Milbank, Parker, Marion, and Mitchell, just to name a few. There are a plenty of stops yet to come. 
 
One of the most humbling experiences Im fortunate to be a part of is when I get to present South Dakotas military heroes with medals or awards that are long overdue. When I recently stopped in Webster, I had the privilege of presenting John B. Sinner, a World War II veteran, with the Bronze Star Medal. John has an amazing story. He served under General George Patton and was stationed in Belgium when the Battle of the Bulge broke out. Hes a true American hero, and I was honored to be a part of his day. 
 
Other highlights from my recent travels include discussing my farm bill proposals with the folks at Precision Soil Management in Redfield, hearing from Perkins County commissioners and residents about how theyve been dealing with the drought, hosting a town hall meeting in Lemmon, stopping by the Turner County Fair, Brown County Fair, and Sioux Empire Fair, and summer wouldnt be complete without visiting Dakotafest. These are my happy places.
 
There are plenty of things in the world to be disappointed about, but Im constantly reminded of how lucky we are in South Dakota to be surrounded by determined, optimistic, and friendly people. Whenever Im in Washington, I take that attitude with me, and I have all of you to thank for it. 
 
Its already been a great summer. Thanks to everyone who Ive been able to meet and catch up with so far, and I look forward to seeing more of you soon!

Dear Friends,
In light of recent media coverage, I wanted to make sure you were aware of all the good, conservative legislation the House of Representatives has passed in the last few months.  While the press continues to report on a “dysfunctional” Congress and White House, our unified government has been able to pass a lot of common-sense legislation that will help create more jobs, strengthen our borders, protect our veterans, strengthen our military, and more. 
Under the leadership of President Trump and with a Republican majority in the House and Senate, the following measures have been signed into law:
	•	The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act to empower the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to fire, demote or suspend any VA employee who does not do their job.  This legislation will improve services at the agency and ensure those involved in misconduct are held accountable, while also strengthening whistleblower protections.
	•	A record breaking 14 pieces of legislation, under the Congressional Review Act, to roll back job-killing regulations.
	•	A $1.5 billion boost to strengthen our borders which will enable the Border Patrol to hire more agents, enhance technology, and update infrastructure – including a wall at our southern border where it is determined to be the most effective option to help deter and prevent illegal aliens from crossing our borders and stem the flow of illegal activities, such as the smuggling of drugs, into our country.
	•	A $21 billion increase in defense funding to help rebuild our military and enhance our influence abroad, provide for our troops and ensure our military has the necessary resources and equipment to defeat terrorism at home and abroad.
	•	A $781 million increase in funding to fight the opioid epidemic – including grants, treatment and prevention, and support for our law enforcement community.
	•	Overturning an Obama-era regulation that would have required states to provide Title X funding to abortion providers, such as Planned Parenthood.
	•	The Russia, Iran and North Korea Sanctions Act to increase economic and political pressure through the use of sanctions on these hostile regimes.
Some of the other items passed by the House of Representatives include:
	•	The American Health Care Act to repeal and replace Obamacare with a patient-centered system that will lead to lower costs, protect those with pre-existing coverage, and restore access to quality, affordable options tailored to individual needs. 
	•	The Financial CHOICE Act to replace Dodd-Frank, promote free markets, end bailouts, restructure the Consumer Financial Protection Board, and provide relief to smaller, community banks that our businesses rely on daily.
	•	Kate’s Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act to protect citizens and strengthen and enforce immigration laws already on the books.
	•	The REINS Act, the Regulatory Accountability Act, the Midnight Rules Relief Act and the Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome (SCRUB) Act is designed to increase transparency, eliminate duplicative and inefficient regulations and enhance oversight over the rule making process.
	•	16 bills to help victims of human trafficking, punish the criminals engaging in these activities, raise awareness, aid law enforcement and crack down on child abuse in all of its forms
	•	The National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2018 to boost defense spending by 10%, ensure no terrorist detainees at Guantanamo Bay are transferred to American soil, provide for thousands of additional personnel for the Army, Navy and Air Force, and increase missile defense funding by $2.5 billion to ensure we can protect our country from the threats posed by advanced, long-range missiles.
	•	The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act to support innovative learning opportunities, build better community partnerships and encourage stronger engagement with employers.
The House of Representatives will continue to pass more common-sense reforms to jumpstart our economy, create jobs, protect our homeland, strengthen our military, provide more regulatory relief, take care of our veterans, and more.  Tax reform, reauthorization of the federal flood insurance program so critical to coastal counties, and the Fiscal Year 2018 appropriations bills will be front and center of our activities upon our return to Washington after Labor Day.

I recently spoke with Cindy Kohlmann of KDTH radio in Dubuque about the Iowa State Fair, U.S. relations with North Korea and China, the investigation into Russian interference in the U.S. election, FBI Director Christopher Wray, my over-the-counter hearing aids bill and government purchase and travel cards. 
Q&A: Biofuels Are Good for Iowa 
Q. How has your support for renewable fuels helped Iowa?   Q. What does the recent federal court decision mean for renewable fuels?
Quick Links
I am in my 37th year of holding meetings in every one of Iowa’s 99 counties. This month, I will hold town meetings in Ringgold, Taylor, O'Brien, Osceola, Monona and Shelby counties in addition to question-and-answer sessions at local businesses, high schools and service clubs in two dozen counties. 
The Justice Department and EpiPen maker Mylan announced a settlement of $465 million over EpiPen’s misclassification under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, far below a government watchdog’s overpayment estimate of $1.27 billion over 10 years. The settlement amount is a disappointment. A company got away with overcharging the taxpayers for a long time. The agencies that are supposed to look out for taxpayers should not be pulling their punches. If there’s any good news, it’s that EpiPen will be classified the right way going forward. Watch a local news segment on the settlement announcement below.

Drafting Articles of Impeachment Against President Donald Trump   ￼   Because of grave concerns about President Trump’s ability to lead our country, in July I introduced a Resolution of No Confidence (H.Res. 456) along with 29 of my colleagues. Because of reasons enumerated in the No Confidence Resolution and, subsequently, the President’s comments he made about the tragic events in Charlottesville, I believe that the President should be impeached and removed from office.   Instead of unequivocally condemning the hateful actions of neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Klansmen, the President fed the flames and insisted that “there were very fine people on both sides.” There are no good Nazis. There are no good Klansmen. Read my press release here.   I was pleased to be able to join MSNBC Live to discuss my intent to introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump, as well as to discuss efforts to remove the statue of the Nathan Bedford Forrest from Health Sciences Park and Jefferson Davis from Memphis Park. Watch my interview here.   Condemning White Nationalists, Neo-Nazis, the KKK and other Hate Groups  
￼
The events at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia last weekend were saddening and frightening. The domestic terrorism is unacceptable and Americans, regardless of their political affiliation, should reject these hate groups as well as the equivocal comments made by President Trump after the event. President Trump’s rhetoric has emboldened these groups to mobilize in public spaces, and they have no shame or fear of ostracism. 
I was proud to stand with many Memphians on Saturday at a rally for Charlottesville. You can watch my remarks here. Over the years I have also written repeatedly to Governor Haslam and the Tennessee Historical Commission urging them to support the efforts by the City of Memphis to remove the statue of Nathan Bedford Forrest in Health Sciences Park – formerly known as Nathan Bedford Forrest Park – as well as the Jefferson Davis statue from Memphis Park.   
Celebrating National Health Center Week
￼
This week was National Health Center Week. On Monday, I attended the Christ Community Health Center Lunch and Learn and on Tuesday, I attended the Memphis Health Center Legislative Luncheon. Health Centers are important to many Memphians by providing health care services to people who otherwise might not have close access to a healthcare facility. Memphis has health deserts, as well as food deserts. The Affordable Care Act has provided increased federal funding for community health centers, and the expansion of Medicaid has led to growth in the number of health centers across the country and has improved their capacity to provide health care services. Many health centers would be in jeopardy if President Trump and Congressional Republicans repealed the Affordable Care Act or cut the Medicaid program. Here is a list of Community Health Centers in Memphis and Shelby County:

  Hosting a Young Professionals Roundtable   ￼   On Thursday, I hosted a Young Professionals Roundtable at my office in Memphis. We discussed my work in Congress, including my vote against Trumpcare and my opposition to the President’s budget proposal, as well as how Congress can work better for and become more accessible to millennials. We also talked over some of their legislative proposals and priorities for the Ninth District.   I am always encouraged when I meet with young people who are invested in making Memphis a better community, and look forward to continuing to host these Young Professionals Roundtables.    Meeting with the new CEO of MATA 
￼   On Tuesday, I met with Gary Rosenfeld, the interim CEO of the Memphis Area Transit Authority (MATA), MATA Board Commissioner Tommy Pacello and a team of MATA employees to receive an update on the progress of restoring the historic trolley car service to downtown Memphis.  The restored steel-wheeled vintage trolleys feature new wiring, renewed trucks, wheels and axles, completely overhauled propulsion systems including pantographs, controllers, line breakers, propulsion resistors and traction motors, as well as renewed pneumatic braking systems and newly equipped safety features.   The trolley car service is a great tourist attraction for the City of Memphis, and we hope that service can begin as early as January 2018.
 Remembering Julian Bond   ￼
I miss my good friend and hero Julian Bond today and every day (Passed away 8/15/15). He was a dynamic leader of the Civil Rights Movement and voice for justice from his time as a leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and as Chairman of the NAACP to his final days. I am proud to have called him a friend and my thoughts are with Julian and his family on this anniversary of his passing.
Recent TV Appearances in Memphis
￼
Last Friday night, I was on WKNO’s Behind the Lines where I discussed tax reform, health care and President Trump with Bill Dries of Memphis Daily News and WKNO host Eric Barnes. You can watch that interview here. On Sunday morning, I was on Local 24’s This Week with Brandon Artiles and discussed health care, North Korea, the opioid crisis and marijuana reform. You can watch part one of the interview here and part two here. I also had a Letter to the Editor published in The Commercial Appeal which you can read here.   Bringing Congress to your Corner   On Friday, August 25, 11:00am to 1:00pm, my office will hold “Congress on your Corner” office hours at the Benjamin L. Hooks Library. If you have questions or problems with Social Security, Medicare, FHA, the VA or any other federal agencies, my staff will be on hand to answer questions and provide assistance. We hope you can make it.

Quote of the Week
“It is important to get on record as opposing evil. It is also important to be effective in stopping evil. But if you can’t stop it, at least oppose it. It is even possible that in ways you cannot foresee, your attempts to go on record can be effective…”              -- Robert McAfee Brown, Professor of Theology, Pacific School of Religion  
Weekly Health Tip
Each week, I share a health tip in the hopes of promoting a healthy lifestyle for residents of the Ninth Congressional District. As always, it is best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine or lifestyle.
We are still in the midst of summer, and it’s hot in Memphis. Heat fatigue, heat syncope (sudden dizziness after prolonged exposure to the heat), heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke are forms of hyperthermia, which is caused by a failure of the body’s heat-regulating mechanisms to deal with a hot environment.    If you suspect that someone is suffering from a heat-related illness, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommend that you: 
	•	Call 911 is you suspect heat stroke
	•	Get the person out of the heat and into a shady, air-conditioned or other cool place. Urge them to lie down
	•	Apply a cold, wet cloth to the wrists, neck, armpits and groin. These are places where blood passes close to the surface of the skin, and the cold cloths can help cool the blood
	•	If the person can swallow safely, offer fluids such as water, fruit and vegetable juices, but avoid alcohol and caffeine 
	•	Encourage the individual to shower, bathe or sponge off with cool water if it is safe to do so
 
As always, I remain.  Most sincerely, ￼  Steve Cohen Member of Congress

Dear  , 
As the summer comes to an end, I thought you might enjoy a quick look at some of my work across eastern Connecticut during the August district work period.
￼
Veterans' Town Hall in New London
Last week, I had the honor of hosting a veterans’ town hall meeting in New London on policies regarding the VA health system along with Gerald Culliton, the Director of the Department of Veterans Affairs in West Haven. Director Culliton was on hand to answer questions about receiving healthcare through the VA, and the progress that has been made to improve the VA health system nationwide. My Norwich veterans’ representative, retired Master Chief Manny Meneses, was also at the meeting to discuss the help my office can offer to veterans who need assistance working with the VA or other federal agencies.
￼
Visit to Davis-Standard in Pawcatuck
On Friday afternoon, I headed over to Davis-Standard after their ribbon cutting of a new 15,000-square-foot facility in Pawcatuck. The company is a locally grown plastics manufacturer that has been operating in our region since 1848. After they acquired another engineering company two years ago, they needed more space to accommodate their new assets, and thanks to state grant money, they were able to build the expansion. They employ over 400 workers and their new building allows them to take on another 24. It is just another piece of our community’s manufacturing resurgence.

Congressman Fitzgerald from Norwich addresses his colleagues
If you read The Day newspaper this past Sunday, you may have seen my op-ed calling on President Trump and Republican leadership in Congress to not cut funding for apprenticeships across the country. Apprenticeships are a tried and true method to train workers to fill high-skilled, well-paying jobs. There are 6.2 million job openings in this country, but these jobs cannot be filled with an unskilled workforce. Our region has led the way in workforce training for generations: my predecessor, Congressman William Fitzgerald from Norwich, was the author of the Fitzgerald Act, a 1937 law which established the standards for apprenticeship programs that are still used today. As our nation’s economic recovery continues, now is not the time to weaken job training. I will fight any attempts to cut the programs that create better skills, better wages, and better jobs.
￼
Click here to watch Rep. Courtney's press conference on Medicare Buy-In
On Monday, I started the week by joining my colleague Rep. John Larson at a news conference to discuss our bill, the “Medicare Buy-In and Health Stabilization Act,” which will allow Americans age 50-64 to purchase affordable health plans offered through the Medicare program. Medicare is a popular and cost-effective program that works, and expanding access will save money for Americans approaching retirement without adding to the deficit. In the face of the heated dialogue around healthcare in our country, the time has come for thoughtful and fact-based reform.
￼
Interview with Robert Crawford for the Veterans History Project
I had the opportunity this week to interview a local Vietnam War veteran for the national Veterans History Project run by the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. The Veterans History Project is a critical federal project that is working to record the wartime experience of our nation’s military veterans while these veterans are still alive. The Library hopes that having these recordings will help future generations understand the experiences that individual Americans faced during significant periods in our history, and learn more about the role that America played in historic conflicts.
I was able to sit down with Robert Crawford, a Norwich resident, who graduated from NFA and enlisted in the US Army in 1967 at age 19. He was attached to the 101st Airborne and was a Green Beret (Special Warfare) designation.  He left the Army in 1969, and was awarded the Bronze Star, Vietnam Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, and Good Conduct Medal among others.
￼
Town Hall in Deep River
On Tuesday night, I held a town hall style meeting in Deep River for constituents of the Second Congressional District where we touched on a number of important topics including healthcare, climate change and the Paris Accord, and foreign policy issues such as North Korea and the Middle East. We had around 100 local residents turn up at the Valley Regional High School auditorium. Thanks everyone for joining me and for the thoughtful questions.
￼

Mid-week, I traveled up to Union to meet with landowners and conservation commissioners for Union, Ashford, Eastford, and Woodstock and Yale forestry students working in the area to discuss regional conservation efforts in the Quiet Corner. It was a great opportunity to learn more about how they are working together to improve the stewardship of natural resources with a focus on forestland management, renewable energy, and small-scale agriculture. 
￼
Medal ceremony for Robert Olivieri
Yesterday, I was honored to present Robert Olivieri of East Hampton with medals he earned during his service in the U.S. Marine Corps during the Vietnam War. Olivieri contacted my Norwich District office in 2016 requesting assistance with correcting his personnel record known as a DD-214 to reflect all of his awards and citations. In January of this year, he received his corrected DD-214 and my office requested all of his medals and citations in order to present them to him. He received a number of medals including the Navy and Marine Corps commendation Medal for heroic achievement on April 27th, 1969 in Vietnam, a Combat action Ribbon for service in Vietnam, and a Presidential Unit Citation – Awarded to 3rd Marine Division for service in Vietnam.
￼
Grants forum in Willimantic
Finally, this morning I hosted the first of two large federal grants & community development forums this August. These are events where local municipalities and other community organizations interested in seeking federal grants and awards to support their work can learn more from the U.S. Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD), Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). I am proud of the large number of grants that my office is able to help local organizations and municipalities obtain each year to serve our local residents. 
As always, if you have any questions or concerns about the items I have mentioned in the newsletter, or if you need any assistance in working with a federal agency like Social Security, Medicare, or Veterans Affairs, please do not hesitate to contact my Norwich district office at: 860-886-0139.
Have a great weekend,

Traveling the District
 Speaking to Business Leaders at the Dutchess County Chamber of Commerce Breakfast
￼
On Wednesday I had the privilege of delivering the keynote address before an audience of 220 at the Dutchess Regional Chamber of Commerce’s Monthly Contact Breakfast. My presentation was an update on my work on issues such as infrastructure, healthcare, and tax reform followed by a question-and-answer session. I also spoke about my Property Tax Reduction Act and the $224 million in savings its passage would mean for the 11 counties of the 19th Congressional District.  Property taxpayers in New York’s 57 counties pay more in local Medicaid property taxes than local taxpayers in the other 49 states combined.  I’m going to continue to press this issue in Washington.  Huge Success Hosting our First Veterans Assistance Fair at SUNY Sullivan
￼
I want to thank all of the organizations involved with making our Veterans Assistance Fair in Sullivan County such a great success yesterday. I particularly want to thank Sullivan County Veterans’ Service Officer John Crotty for his tremendous help in organizing the event. We are planning additional Veteran assistance fairs throughout our 11-county district.  Meeting with Volunteers for the Alzheimer’s Association in Sullivan County
￼
On Thursday I had the pleasure of meeting with a group of Sullivan County advocates for Alzheimer’s Disease awareness. The scourge of Alzheimer’s disease devastates countless families throughout our state and nation. It is always important to hear the first-hand stories of how this dreaded disease has impacted families, and I cannot thank these volunteers enough for their selfless service for this meaningful cause.  Spending Time with Some Real Folks at the Delaware County Fair
￼
I had a great time mingling with folks at the Delaware County Fair on Thursday. The Delaware County Fair is a tremendous event which is focused on the fine agricultural traditions in the county. I truly enjoy the opportunity to visit county fairs around the district – and sample the food! I also observed the precision horse show put on by the 4H drill team and their coach Karlene DuMond. Thanks again to Fair President Ed Rossley for his hospitality.

Return from my Educational Trip to Israel
 On Sunday I returned from a seven-day fact-finding trip to Israel. Our bipartisan delegation of House members met with senior Israeli defense and economic officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In addition, we met with experts on military and foreign policy issues, as well as the opposition leader in the Israeli Knesset. We also had an opportunity to meet with Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Dr. Rami Hamdallah.  All discussions were off the record and, as such, I am not at liberty to discuss the substance of points made during our respective meetings. However, these discussions were both cordial and frank as members of Congress, including me, had an opportunity to ask questions on various policy positions and their perspective as to the position of the US government.  The delegation also met with Israeli entrepreneurs involved in their nation’s thriving high-tech industrial sector as well as with young Israelis serving in the military. Military service is mandatory for young men and women with limited exceptions. I was struck by how the opportunities presented by national service have better prepared young people for responsible positions in the private and non-profit sectors. It does raise a question in my mind as to whether similar opportunities could be more broadly offered to young people in the United States.  The trip also afforded me an opportunity to visit strategic areas such as the Golan Heights. The disintegration of the Syrian nation-state has reinforced my belief that it is critical that Israel maintain control of this important region. Given Iranian and Hezbollah influence in significant parts of Syria it is all the more important that forces hostile to Israel never again have control of the Golan Heights’ strategic high ground. Our delegation also discussed the West Bank settlement issue and as a result have a greater understanding of how settlements impact prospects for peace in the region.  We all desire peace in the Middle East. Recent political developments in the region cast doubt on the ability of the Palestinian Authority to enter into any sustainable peace treaty with Israel, especially given the malign influence of Iran and its proxies in the region. It is critical that the United States maintain its long-standing political, military and economic ties to Israel, the only democracy in the region. In Congress, I will continue to support efforts to strengthen our relationship with Israel, especially in areas such as missile defense, technology and agriculture.

Interview with Fred Dicker

WEEK IN REVIEW
￼
This week, I had the opportunity to meet with many friends across Northwest Arkansas. On Monday, I visited Wolfspeeds manufacturing and laboratory facilities. Wolfspeed of Fayetteville was founded in 1997 as Arkansas Power Electronics International to develop products and manufacturing processes for advanced semiconductor electronic devices. I had a great morning meeting with their employees and touring the facility. Later that day, I had the opportunity to speak at the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce Spirit of Enterprise Award Luncheon, where I was honored to receive the Chamber of Commerce Spirit of Enterprise Award for my service on the federal level.
￼
I traveled to Russellville early Tuesday to meet with the Russellville Lions Club. The members of Lions Club are strongly dedicated to service and continually strive to better our community. That afternoon, I toured Taber Extrusions. Taber supplies the Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency with portable landing fields and base structures for military shelters and hangers. They have a press weighing in at 8600 tons, making it one of the largest extrusion presses in the United States. That evening, I spoke at the ConAgra Expansion Announcement hosted by River Valley Alliance, Russellville Chamber, City of Russellville, and the Pope County Judge. The $54 million expansion will create nearly 60 new jobs in the city of Russellville!
￼
On Thursday, I spoke with the Northwest Arkansas Fire Chiefs at their monthly meeting in Rogers. Every time I have the pleasure of sitting down with firefighters, I am reminded of and impressed by their hard work and dedication to the cities they serve. That evening, I attended the Apollo on Emma Opening Night Charity Gala. The Apollo is a significant landmark in downtown Springdale, and the renovations to the theater are remarkable. I am so thankful for the work that has been done to save the space.  All proceeds from the event were donated to the Springdale Public Schools Education Foundation, the Arkansas Baptist Foundation Home for Single Mothers in Springdale, and the Circle of Life Hospice. The Apollo on Emma will now serve as an event center that can accommodate a range of functions including corporate business luncheons, weddings, and receptions.
I had a wonderful week traveling throughout the Natural State. I look forward to meeting with many more of you this coming week!
Remember to keep an eye on my Twitter page and my calendar to find out where my staff and I will be throughout the August work period!

POLICY IN REVIEW: VETERANS AFFAIRS
This Congress, we have done many exciting things to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the care given to veterans and their families.  I am proud to serve on the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations subcommittee where I was able to fight for and achieve critical funding for several important veterans programs. The subcommittee also engaged in many productive hearings, site visits, and conversations with both top VA officials and military personnel to see how the House of Representatives can help in creating a more effective and efficient VA.  Through one of these many conversations, I extended an invitation to VA Secretary David Shulkin to visit Arkansas and tour our own Fayetteville Veteran Affairs Medical Center. Like most that visit the Third District, he was impressed by what our District has to offer, and Secretary Shulkin enjoyed his time discussing with Arkansans how to better serve our veterans. 
Another important milestone for veterans in the 115th Congress that I am very proud of is the extension of the Veterans Choice Program. Created at the peak of the 2014 VA scandal, the Veterans Choice program gave veterans an unprecedented alternative.   For veterans that were either facing long wait times for appointments or had to travel long distances to obtain care, the Choice program has given them the option of receiving health care in their communities. The Choice program was originally scheduled to expire this month, but at the end of July, the House passed Senate Bill 114 which funded an additional $2.1 billion for the Veterans Choice Program, and an additional $1.8 billion for VA programs.  I was proud to support this bill and to see that President Trump signed the Veteran Choice and Quality Employment Act just last week. The newly signed bill allows veterans enrolled in the Choice program to continue to receive care services in their community for another six months while Congress weighs further action on the Choice programs future.  The additional $1.8 billion in the bill provides funding to enhance recruitment, retention, and training of the VA workforce so we are able to build a stronger VA to better serve veteran patrons.  The funding also increases private sector partnerships by establishing fellowships for department and private sector participants for training and educational opportunities.  By partnering up with the best in the private sector, the VA is taking steps to ensure its care remains competitive.  
An additional improvement that has been long overdue, and finally underway is the modification of electronic medical records (EMR) the VA maintains.  This summer, Secretary Shulkin announced the VA will transition to the same EMR system the Department of Defense utilizes.  This has come after years and millions of dollars have been spent to create compatible health record sharing between the DOD and the VA.  Using the same EMR system will give our veterans a more seamless and reliable means of transferring their medical records as they transition off of active duty.  This will allow more holistic treatment as DOD and VA caretakers are able to share information and coordinate care to better serve the people who have served our country.   I applaud Secretary Shulklins initiative to fix a problem that has been plaguing the VA medical system for years, and I look forward to a cost estimate from the VA.
This week, President Trump signed the Forever G.I. Bill, which passed unanimously through both the House and Senate.  The updated G.I. bill has removed the 15 year expiration date after active duty service, giving service members and their families more flexibility and opportunity when pursuing higher education.  The new G.I. Bill also recognizes those who have sacrificed the most.  Purple Heart recipients are now automatically eligible for 100% of G.I. benefits, regardless of their length of service, and surviving family members of servicemembers who have died in the line of duty have been given an increase in education funds.  While nothing will ever replace the loss of a family member, we strive to care for the spouses and children to ensure they are given the tools to succeed. 
As a proud veteran myself, it has been encouraging to witness and play an active role in what Congress has done this year to honor our veterans.  While I have heard from the top personnel of the VA and military, I most enjoy hearing from Third District veterans on what they hope the future holds for the VA.  Fixing the VA will take years to accomplish. We may not be there yet, but we have certainly made progress this Congress. I truly look forward to meeting with my colleagues again in September with all we have learned from our constituents during this recess to tackle lingering VA challenges, like the fate of the Choice program, head-on.

NEWS FROM THE 1st DISTRICT
Dear Friends,

This past week we witnessed some of the most astonishing hate this country has seen in a very long time. The events in Charlottesville, VA last weekend were shocking. White nationalism is dangerous and despicable, and has no place in our country. The president’s response was also shocking. His failure to initially condemn the KKK and white supremacists was gutless. His comments on Tuesday, expressing a moral equivalence between neo-Nazis and those that oppose them, were a disgrace to our nation. If Mr. Trump and certain staffers in the White House think they can tear down everything America stands for, they are wrong. We will not let them extinguish America’s beacon of hope and tolerance.


On Thursday, I held a town hall meeting in Manchester. I enjoyed the opportunity to speak with constituents about VA healthcare and the importance of higher education.
￼
I reiterated my support for a full service VA medical center and will be introducing legislation in the coming weeks to require the VA to provide dental care to all enrolled veterans. Currently, the VA dental care eligibility rules restrict dental care to fewer than half of the veterans who are eligible for the full medical benefits package.
White Nationalist Protests in Charlottesville, VA
Unlike what Mr. Trump said on Saturday, there are not many sides to this story. This was clear evil. The cowards who are waving Nazi flags in Virginia are free thanks to my parents' generation of Nazi fighters. During World War II my dad's ship was hit by Nazis. Two hundred American sailors died, but he fought on. My uncle flew daylight bombing missions over Germany. My mom worked in a shipyard. Today I can speak out against fascism because they and their generation were heroes who saved us from Nazis.


On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said there were “very fine people” protesting alongside the neo-Nazis. No, Mr. President. Very fine people do not march with neo-Nazis.


I never thought we would hear such disgusting and outrageous comments from a President of the United States – comments that were immediately praised by David Duke, the former leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Tuesday’s comments from Mr. Trump are a disgrace to our nation. Over the past week, the President has twice failed to condemn white supremacists’ violence and terror, going so far as to suggest there is moral equivalence between neo-Nazis and those who protest hate.


This week, in response to Mr. Trump’s failed moral leadership, I co-introduced a resolution to censure the president. The censure resolution condemns the President forhis moral failure to clearly and forcefully repudiate white supremacists and those who support them. It condemns him for failing to immediately denounce the white supremacist, Ku Klux Klan, and neo-Nazi groups responsible for actions of domestic terrorism in Charlottesville over the weekend, and for doubling-down on his comments by attempting to create a moral equivalency between white supremacists and those counter-protesting the ‘Unite the Right’ rally.


Manchester VAMC at CMC
This week, the governor signed an executive order to facilitite allowing VA doctors to perform services at private medical facilities in New Hampshire. This will allow the VA to fully implement its agreement to lease operating room space at Catholic Medical Center. The VA’s partnership with CMC is an important interim step toward ensuring that New Hampshire veterans can get the care they need without having to leave the state. It also helps address the VA’s pressing need for space after facilities were damaged by last month’s flood. I thank VA officials and CMC leadership for working together to accomplish this necessary step with the urgency our veterans expect and deserve.


Protecting Puppies with the Humane Society
In July, after the discovery of inhumane conditions at an unregistered Great Dane puppy mill in Wolfeboro, I sent a letter to the governor asking him to revise New Hampshire’s laws to include a reasonable threshold for the number of dogs permitted for breeding before a breeder is subject to inspections. I have dogs myself, and my heart broke looking at those sweet and innocent faces. I’m happy to say that we have been successful! The governor agreed and announced this week that he is backing stricter rules on commercial breeding.


Closing Thoughts 
The tragic terrorist attacks in Spain this week remind us once again that there is evil in the world, and that we have to continue working with other countries and with their forces to uncover these plots before attacks happen, and then to work together so we can track down the perpetrators.

Congressman Al Green's Statement Supporting Rep. Cohen’s (D-TN) Call to Impeach President Trump  
Houston, TX -- On Friday, August 18, 2017, Congressman Al Green (TX) released a statement supporting Representative Steve Cohen (D-TN) on his introduction of Articles of Impeachment against President Donald Trump, after his comments on Charlottesville: 
""I stand with my colleague, Rep. Cohen (D-TN). As events unfold, the facts remain simple and indisputable. In his statements, the President intimated that there were very fine people on the side of the Klan, White Supremacists, and the Neo-Nazis. There are no good Klansmen, there are no good White Supremacists, and there are no good Nazis. This was an act of deadly domestic terrorism. The President’s statements only accentuate the impeachable acts he has already committed. A Nazi sympathizer, Klan defender, and supremacist protector should not be President of the greatest country in the world.""

Trump signs Choice funding bill
Northern Marianas veterans can continue seeking health care services from community providers now that President Trump signed into law the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017. In June, VA officials notified Congress that the Choice program would run out of money on August 15 due to a huge increase in patient visits between March and May 2017. Intense negotiations between the House and Senate Veterans Affairs Committees resulted in a bipartisan deal that provides $2.1 billion to fund Choice for six months while Congress works on a replacement, and $1.8 billion for VA workforce improvements. The extension is good news for Northern Marianas veterans who live in the only U.S. jurisdiction without a full service VA clinic or dedicated VA medical or mental health professionals. A fully equipped VA clinic with full-time VA staff is the goal. Until then, however, the Choice program can help fill the gap in health care services for our veterans. 



Choice providers triple for Marianas vets
The number of community care providers available to Marianas veterans through the Choice program has tripled over the last few weeks, as a result of the congressional office’s outreach efforts and collaboration with TriWest, the company that manages Choice for the VA in our region. I learned from TriWest CEO and President David McIntyre this week that we now have more than 60 providers from both public and private health care facilities in the Marianas who are enrolled in the Choice network. And that number is expected to grow, as more providers are credentialed and added to the Choice system. Veterans who would like to confirm their eligibility and request an appointment with a community provider through Choice should call the toll-free Veterans Choice line at 1-866-606-8198. Veterans may directly request their own appointments through the Veterans Choice line and do not need a Choice card or a referral from the VA to use Choice. All care must be authorized by TriWest before services can be rendered. If a veteran opts to use Choice, TriWest is the primary payer and no copays, cost-shares, or deductibles will be collected from the veteran. For more information about the Veterans Choice program, visit www.triwest.com or https://www.va.gov/opa/choiceact/ or contact the congressional office at kilili@mail.house.gov or (670) 323-2647. 



New GI bill enacted
On Wednesday, President Trump signed the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017. The bipartisan measure is the largest expansion of military education benefits in more than a decade. Among the improvements, the Act removes the time limit for using their GI Bill benefits for new servicemembers. It also resolves three issues brought to me by Northern Marianas veterans. Post-9/11 Reservists and Guardsmen in the Northern Marianas who were mobilized under orders that did not accrue education benefits will now receive credit for that time. Service members with less than 36 months of active duty service will see an increase in their education benefit to 50% of the maximum amount payable. And those affected by school closures as of January 1, 2015 may have their benefits restored. The new GI Bill also extends full benefits to Post-9/11 Purple Heart recipients and expands benefits for dependents of servicemembers who died while serving on active duty. Additionally, those pursuing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics) degrees have access to nine more months of eligibility. 


￼

VA to hold benefits workshop, claims clinic
Earlier this year, I asked the Veterans Benefits Administration to do more to help Marianas veterans to better understand and access the VA benefits they have earned. One of the ways VBA responded to my request was to train and certify the staff of the CNMI Military/Veterans Affairs Office to assist veterans in preparing and following up on their VA benefits claims. VBA also began working with the congressional office and the Commonwealth government to conduct a benefits workshop and claims clinic at the Multipurpose Center on Saipan at the end of this month. The August 31 workshop will provide a comprehensive overview of the benefits that veterans, their survivors, and dependents may be eligible for and how to apply. Immediately after the workshop, VBA representatives will be available for one-on-one benefits counseling. See the flyer above for details. My thanks to VBA’s Regional Director Karen Gooden and her team, as well as CNMI Military/Veterans Affairs Executive Officer Oscar Torres and his team, for their help in delivering this important information to our veterans and their families. 


￼

Saipan Troop Store now open
At last, the new, improved, and eagerly-awaited Saipan Troop Store is open for business. I attended the soft opening on Thursday morning, along with Army and Air Force Exchange Service Pacific Commander Colonel Scott Maskery, Senior Enlisted Advisor Sergeant Major Arnaldo Muniz, Area Manager Rick Fair, Guam Exchange Manager Donald Basil, Saipan Troop Store Manager Josephine Palacios and her staff (pictured above). The $2.8 million expansion project has resulted in a brand new 5,000 square foot store with more shelf space, more merchandise, a snack station, and other amenities. Improving the Saipan Troop Store has been a goal of mine since my first term in Congress, when a study I included in the 2011 National Defense Authorization Act found the project to be feasible. Kudos to the AAFES team for delivering a facility that our 4,000 active and reserve service members, retirees, and military families can enjoy. 



Protecting our drinking water
The public now has until September 27 to submit comments on a proposal by the Trump administration to rescind the Clean Water Rule, the Environmental Protection Agency announced on Wednesday. With 79 other House members, I wrote to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt in June requesting a 90-day extension to the comment period on the proposal. This week, 102 House members, including myself, came together to outright oppose repeal of the rule. The Clean Water Rule protects the drinking water of over 100 million Americans that rely on sources fed by streams that flow in a larger body of water far from the original source. It is clear that we need to protect streams and waterways that flow into large, continuous water sources, and we need to use the best science to protect our drinking water, public health and outdoor recreation economy. Rescinding the Clean Water Rule is bad policy and poses a risk to the health and safety of our people and our natural resources. 



Compact migrant count to begin
The Office of Insular Affairs, Department of Interior announced Wednesday that the Census Bureau is set to conduct the five-year enumeration of migrants from the Freely Associated States residing in the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Hawaii. The FAS migrant count, required every five years, serves as the basis for the allocation of $30 million in federal funds to help offset the economic and social impact of hosting FAS migrants. The Northern Marianas received $2.5 million in Compact impact funding for fiscal year 2017. Last conducted in 2013, Census Bureau enumeration of FAS migrants in the Northern Marianas totaled 2,660, up from 2,100 in 2008. By comparison, there were an estimated 17,170 FAS migrants in Hawaii, 14,700 in Guam, and 25 in American Samoa. Census Bureau officials will soon conduct field surveys in the Marianas to obtain the necessary data. The enumerations will take place in FY 2018 and be completed by December 2018.



Wildlife funds awarded to Marianas
Congratulations to the CNMI Department of Land and Natural Resources, Division of Fish and Wildlife who will receive $125,182 in federal State Wildlife Grants funds. Announced by the U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service on Tuesday, the grant award will target conservation needs identified in the 2015 CNMI Wildlife Action Plan. Funds may be used for research, fish and wildlife surveys, species restoration, habitat management, monitoring, and they may also be used to update or modify a state’s plan. Congress appropriates funds for the State Wildlife Grant Program annually which are apportioned to states and territories by formula accounting for population and total geographical area. Last year, DFW was also awarded a competitive grant of $238,000 to focus on snail conservation issues under the State Wildlife Grant program.



$42K for historic and cultural preservation
The National Park Service has announced the award of $42,488 to the Historic Preservation Office within the CNMI Department of Community and Cultural Affairs. The funds will help HPO carry out its mission to preserve and protect our historic sites and to educate the public about our culture and traditions. Congratulations, HPO!

The Hill Report
The Hill Report  A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions Week of August 14 - 18, 2017
This week I was delighted to meet with North Texans across the 32nd Congressional District to discuss important issues facing our community and nation. From volunteering at the North Texas Food Bank, to meeting with healthcare professionals, to meeting with small businesses across the district, I had a productive and informative week talking with the constituents that I proudly represent. 
 North Texas Food Bank  There is no better way to spend a Tuesday morning than volunteering at the North Texas Food Bank. My Dallas team and I joined more than 200 volunteers in boxing food, building comradery, and doing the necessary work to ensure that our neighbors and fellow Texans have access to the food and nutrients they need. Volunteering and helping others is extremely important for our society's wellbeing. Our Texas economy is one of the greatest because of hard workers who care about others; therefore, enabling the economy to avoid overbearing government programs and regulations. I sincerely appreciate my Texas neighbors who contribute to society through philanthropy and volunteering. 
 ￼

United States Global Leadership Coalition  On Monday, I sat down with leaders with the United States Global Leadership Coalition to discuss America's role as a world leader and the resources we give our State Department to accomplish their mission. In our increasingly interconnected world, I believe it is imperative that America remains actively engaged with our friends and allies abroad. Through smart and effective investments in development and diplomacy, we are better able to keep our citizens safe, strengthen our economy, and save lives, and I appreciate the work of the USGLC to ensure that our nation's leaders have the knowledge and facts required to make smart decisions for America.

Meeting with North Texas Business Leaders  Dallas Association of Credit Unions Monday evening I was pleased to speak at the Dallas Association of Credit Unions meeting.  For the last 8 years, the financial services sector has been under assault from onerous rules and regulations promulgated by bureaucrats in the federal government. With our current administration we have the opportunity to unleash the free market and expand the industry's ability to serve the American people by rolling back some of the regulations, and it was great to spend time with the men and women of the Association of Credit Unions discussing how we in Congress can help them serve their members.
 ￼
 Congressman Sessions meeting with leaders from Credit Unions across the 32nd District 
Texas Security Bank Business Institute  This week, I was delighted to speak to North Texans representing a wide variety of small businesses at the Texas Security Bank Business Institute Luncheon. Specifically, we discussed how congressional actions on rolling back the most burdensome Obama-era regulations and removing red tape will allow small businesses and the free enterprise system to grow and flourish. In working with our colleagues in the Senate, the Congress has been able to pass significant reforms that, since January, have enabled our economy to add almost 863,000 jobs. As Congress returns to Washington after our district work period, I look forward to renewing the fight to reduce the size and burden of the federal government.
 ￼
 Congressman Sessions meeting with small business owners and members of the Texas Security Bank’s Business Institute on Tuesday to discuss H.R. 10, the Financial Choice Act.
North Texas National Tooling and Machining Association  On Wednesday evening I was delighted to join my friends from the North Texas Chapter of the National Tooling and Machining Association once again. For 12 years in a row now, I have had the privilege of addressing this hard-working group of Americans, and sharing my thoughts on Washington and the Congress. Since its establishment in 1943 the  NTMA has been a staunch advocate for the manufacturing industry, and I enjoyed the time we got to spend discussing the issues facing the manufacturing industry and our country as a whole.
 ￼

 Panel Discussions with North Texans  Irving Transportation Investment Summit  As a strong supporter of critical infrastructure legislation that moves our country forward, I was honored to receive the Irving Transportation Conference Lifetime Infrastructure Achievement Award. Ultimately, we must continue to provide for our nation's transportation and economic needs through legislation such as highway bills, the biannual Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), and the Transportation appropriations funding bill. 
 ￼
 Congressman Sessions with Mayors Doug Athas of Garland and Rick Stopfer of Irving, as well as other members of the Irving Transportation Conference for the presentation of the Lifetime Infrastructure Achievement Award
Dallas Regional Chamber Congressional Forum  On Thursday, I participated in the Dallas Regional Chamber 2017 Congressional Forum alongside my colleagues Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX), Congressman Joe Barton (R-TX), and Congressman Marc Veasey (D-TX). We discussed a wide range of issues including the current political climate, state of the economy, and upcoming legislative action items. While we may disagree from time to time, I am proud to serve Texas alongside my colleagues in Washington, D.C. and look forward to continuing our work on behalf of the people of North Texas.
 ￼

Discussing Healthcare with North Texans  AARP  On Monday I had the privilege of meeting with local Dallas members of AARP. We had a positive discussion about healthcare, including the benefits of my healthcare bill, the World's Greatest Healthcare Plan. I sincerely enjoyed hearing their thoughts and look forward to continuing to build concordance on this issue. I am confident that through my continued work with beneficiaries like these members of AARP, working with my colleagues in Congress and the White House, we will make healthcare a reality for all.
 ￼
 Congressman Sessions meeting with representatives of AARP from the 32nd to discuss healthcare and Social Security
Meeting with North Texas Pharmacists  On Tuesday I toured a local pharmacy and enjoyed the opportunity to speak to healthcare professionals who practice in pharmacy. We discussed a number of issues including the frontline steps being taken to combat our nation's opioid epidemic and how Congress can enact policy that best serves those who provide the critical medication and support that pharmacy customers depend on. As a Member of Congress directly involved in working to address the opioid crisis, I am proud to represent North Texas medical professionals that take seriously their commitment to safe patient care.

Spotlight on Education in Moon Township & Peters Township
Pittsburgh Leads the Way in Air & Space Industry
Expanding Treatment for Children & Families in Southwestern PA 
ICYMI: Observer-Reporter Editorial Board First to Weigh In on Murphy's Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act
 








Spotlight on Education in Moon Township & Peters Township
 
￼
Murphy gives a congressional update to Moon Township School Board.
Southwestern Pennsylvanian schools have been nationally recognized for high education standards with a focus on challenging curriculum, many of which emphasize Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), while also encouraging sports and fine arts.
This week Congressman Murphy discussed local education priorities, growing Southwest Pennsylvania’s economy and developments at 911th Air Wing at a School Board Meeting in Moon Township. The meeting, and Congressman Murphy’s remarks, were aired live on MCATV (Moon Community Access Television).   On education, Murphy pointed out that when it comes to meeting the educational needs of students with disabilities, we have fallen far short of an acceptable standard. As a staunch support of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) which provides funding for special education and early intervention services for disabled students, Murphy joined efforts with his colleagues in Congress for a renewed commitment to fund programs that support special education and intervention services. In response, the House Appropriations Committee recommended more than $13 billion in funding for IDEA authorized programs for fiscal year 2018.  This would result in a nearly $200 million grant increase from the previous year.  “It is up to all of us to remember the forgotten children. This is an area where we cannot let them down. For children with physical, intellectual, and emotional disabilities, intervening early on can make an enormous difference in their lives. It is my hope and expectation that as we move forward, children with disabilities get the education they need and deserve for a bright, hopeful future,” said Murphy.  
￼
Joined new teachers, school faculty and community leaders for the Peters Township Chamber of Commerce's annual Welcome Luncheon for Peters Township School District.
Later in the week, Murphy welcomed new teachers, school faculty, and community leaders at the annual Peters Township School District welcome reception hosted each year by the Peters Township Chamber of Commerce. 
“I’m grateful to be included in this unique effort recognizing our local educators and I’m proud of the educators throughout Southwestern Pennsylvania and in the 18th Congressional District who focus on academic excellence and embrace personalizing education to accommodate individual needs of students,” said Murphy, who discussed his work in Congress to improve education by doing away with one-size fits all educational mandates.   To share your thoughts on SWPA local education policies, the local economy or the 911th, please click here.
Pittsburgh Leads the Way in Air & Space Industry
Pittsburgh is known for being on the forefront of innovation and Southwestern Pennsylvania region is a national hub of technology and robotics.  One of the companies leading the way is Astrobotic Technology Inc.  Astrobotic, a spin off from Carnegie Mellon University, has partnered with NASA through the Lunar CATALYST program and along with partnerships with DHL, Airbus, and the United Launch Alliance, the company focuses on delivering commercial payloads to the Moon.  
￼
Located in Pittsburgh's Strip District, Astrobotics is developing & deploying 
inventive space robotics technology.
Located in the city’s Strip District, Congressman Tim Murphy toured Astrobotic Technology to learn more about their work on a lunar lander that will allow Moon exploration like never before.  Robotic rovers are capable of going places humans cannot, such as caves and the moon’s poles.  It has been over 40 years since the U.S. has landed on the moon, and Astrobotic is determined to lead our nation’s return.
This week Congressman Murphy also visited the Pittsburgh Institute of Aeronautics (PIA). Ranked in 2017 as one of Forbes’s Top Two-Year Trade Schools, PIA is working to meet the ever-growing demand for skilled employees in the Aircraft Technician and Commercial Driving fields.  At PIA, an individual can obtain a CDL in four weeks or go through a 21 month program to become an aircraft technician.
A significant portion of PIA’s students are transitioning out of a different occupation, such as

coal mining, to meet a growing demand for skilled workers in the commercial driving and aircraft technician fields. Murphy was told that PIA recently held a job fair to which 46 companies requested to attend, and with 30 graduates in the market for a job, the demand for skilled workers is outpacing available candidates.  Many of PIA’s Aircraft Technician graduates, in both their Aviation Maintenance Technology and Aviation Electronics Technology, take the skills they have learned to different fields.  These skills, learned in Pittsburgh, are transferable and highly desirable to a broad swath of employers in the technology fields across the nation.

Expanding Treatment for Children & Families in Southwestern PA
￼
With Director of Outpatient Services Dave Grabowski, Board Member Len Corton, CEO Doug Muetzel and State Senator Camera Bartolotta.
Along with education, autism, behavioral health and family support services to children and adolescents, the newly restructured Wesley Family Services (WFS) also serves adults who have intellectual and developmental disabilities and those dealing with vocational challenges and substance abuse disorders.
This week Congressman Murphy joined local community leaders for a ribbon cutting ceremony for the opening of a larger facility in Washington County. WFS moved to a larger space in Washington County as a result of increased need in the region for expanded drug and alcohol treatment, as well as autistic and other behavioral health services.
“Regardless of whether an individual or family is dealing with an autism or mental health diagnosis, or a substance use disorder, our staff will be there to help them navigate the unique challenges they will undoubtedly face along their journey,” said Wesley Family Services Chief Executive Officer Doug Muetzel.
Congressman Murphy applauded Mr. Muetzel and the entire Wesley Family Services team for their dedication to the community and serving the mental health care and addiction treatment needs of families in crisis.
“As this crisis has been mounting to epidemic proportions nationwide, we are seeing right here in Southwestern Pennsylvania a dedicated focus on building up the addiction treatment workforce, expansion of access to inpatient care and deliver immediate, evidence-based treatment to those in addiction crisis.”

ICYMI: Observer-Reporter Editorial Board First to Weigh In on Murphy's Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act


We can’t arrest our way out of this opioid crisis
Observer-Reporter
By the Editorial Board
August 14, 2017
￼
Observer-Reporter building in Washington, PA (photo credit: Observer-Reporter).
Our leaders in Washington, D.C. have awoken to the catastrophic opioid crisis that has enveloped our region and nation.  There are now a number of proposals and ideas being suggested in a much-needed effort to combat an incredibly complicated issue that continues to ravage people of all ages, races and genders.  But, as expected when it comes to any major issue at the federal level, there are many different opinions on how to achieve the stated goal of reducing drug use and overdoses.  A bill sponsored by Congressman Tim Murphy that would give doctors more access to a patients’ drug abuse history is getting a lot of attention and praise by his colleagues.  In fact, it was even cited in a 10-page report presented last month by President Trump’s newly-minted Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. More on that commission later.  Murphy’s Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act is now weaving its way through the legislative process and is on a similar track as the U.S. Senate’s version known as “Jessie’s Law.”  In these proposals, knowledge is power for doctors when prescribing pain medication to recovering addicts. Currently, doctors can only review past drug history with the patient’s written consent.  That’s just one small facet to a complicated problem that defies simple solutions.  The president’s new commission studying the opioid epidemic has much broader and far-reaching discussions bubbling up to the surface as the drug problem comes out from the shadows and into the public light.  Quite possibly the most important suggestion made by the commission was urging the president to declare the situation a national emergency. Anyone around this area knows what the rest of the country is finally figuring out.  An average of 142 Americans die every day from drug overdoses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Not only is the loss of life is staggering, but the crime that comes with the opioid crisis is becoming an economic drag.  New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who chairs the commission, wrote in its report released earlier this month that the president’s “declaration would empower your cabinet to take bold steps and would force Congress to focus on funding and empowering the executive branch even further to deal with this loss of life.”  At first, Trump declined to go so far as to formally declare it the national emergency it has become.  The president suggested last Tuesday that he favors a “law-and-order” approach to the problem. His point is that if police officers stop people from becoming addicted to drugs in the first place, the opioid crisis will wind down.  That makes sense, but the problem is complicated by the rush of pain medication to the market and doctors’ willingness to prescribe them. And what happens to the millions of people already hooked on pain meds or heroin?  Fortunately, Trump reversed course Thursday and called it what we all already know it is, which will now open the floodgates for more federal funding.  We are in a crisis right now and need more robust treatment options to wean people off these addictive drugs.  We can’t just arrest our way out of this issue. The first “War on Drugs” didn’t work, and the current situation is too important for us to re-run the failed policies of the 1980s.

More Republicans denounce President Trump’s Charlottesville remarks; Bannon out at White House  As controversy continues over the president’s response to the white supremacy demonstrations in Charlottesville, VA, at least 23 Republican members of Congress have denounced Trump’s comments defending white nationalists. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker told reporters in Chattanooga that President Trump “has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.”
+ Steve Bannon, advisor to the president, has left the administration.
Protestors and counter-protestors meet in Boston over Trump’s Charlottesville comments  Two protests, one in support of the president and one opposed to his comments about Charlottesville, plan to meet on Saturday in Boston. A coalition of libertarian and conservative protestors originally planned the “Boston Free Speech Rally,” which will now be met by a counter-protest organized by the ANSWER coalition and Black Lives Matter. 
￼
Federal court rules Arkansas can prevent Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funding  A federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday that Arkansas can cut off payments from its Medicaid program to Planned Parenthood. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson decided to cut off payments after seeing concerning videos that have since been debunked. The decision overruled two previous court rulings which sided with Planned Parenthood. 
+ Jim spoke to Save My Care in Nashville today, saying: “Each one of you is important in this fight. And one day, hopefully soon, Tennessee will expand Medicaid.”
￼
Barcelona terror attacks kill at least 14  In a pair of tragic terror attacks on Thursday, assailants killed at least 14 people, including an American, by driving a van into a crowd of bystanders. Police are still pursuing suspects.
Japan’s plans to deploy U.S. missile shield  In light of increased tensions with North Korea and the rising threat of its nuclear capabilities, Japan has announced the installation of a new missile defense shield system developed by the U.S. called “Aegis Ashore.” The system would allow Japan to intercept and destroy a missile in flight earlier than it currently can. A similar shield, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, is deployed in South Korea.
U.S. to determine strategy in Afghanistan  The administration senior leaders in defense and foreign policy meet with the president at Camp David today, in an effort to finalize U.S. policy and strategy in Afghanistan moving forward. The U.S. war in Afghanistan is the longest war for the country, spanning three presidencies for 17 years.

Dear neighbors,
This week at St. Luke’s United Methodist Church in Long Branch, I was honored to join leaders from various faiths to denounce the appalling actions by white supremacists in Charlottesville last weekend. We expressed the need for New Jersey communities to come together against hate and racism in Charlottesville, in New Jersey, and throughout our country. 
Subscribe to my e-newsletter Follow me on Facebook Follow me on Twitter
The demonstrations and deadly violence that occurred are antithetical to American values and pose a serious threat to our society. The events took place because racism and xenophobia have once again taken hold of our national discourse.  These views are based upon fear - not love, not empathy, not kindness for our fellow man. That is why I was proud to see business owners, politicians, and community and faith leaders from so many different religions, socio-economic backgrounds, and political philosophies condemn what we all saw. Those spreading hate and fear in Charlottesville and in the days since represent the worst our country has to offer, but their numbers pale in comparison to those who represent the best in America. Together we can and must stand up for diversity, inclusiveness and compassion, true American values. 
￼
Heather Heyer was tragically murdered in the events of last weekend. I was moved by the words of Heather’s mother at the funeral, who said, “They tried to shut my daughter up. Instead, they magnified her… Find what's wrong. Don't ignore it, don't look the other way. You make a point to look at it and say to yourself, 'What can I do to make a difference?' And that's how you're going to make my child's death worthwhile. I'd rather have my child, but by golly, if I gotta give her up, we're going to make it count.""
I believe this is a moment where we can all recommit to fighting bigotry in all forms and making a difference. If we work together, we can build a strong society that acknowledges and utilizes the contributions of every single person in our society – regardless of race, ethnicity, or religious beliefs.
Sincerely,
 Congressman Frank Pallone

Hate Is Not Welcome Here


￼
The President’s press conference on the tragedy in Charlottesville made plain that the original statement he gave on Saturday is what he really believes. The President’s continued talk of blame ‘on many sides’ ignores the abhorrent evil of white supremacism, and continues a disturbing pattern of complacency around acts of hate from this President, his Administration and his campaign for the presidency. 
￼
From the beginning, President Trump has sheltered and encouraged the forces of bigotry and discrimination. Bannon’s firing is welcome news, but it doesn’t disguise where President Trump himself stands on white supremacists and the bigoted beliefs they advance. Personnel changes are worthless so long as President Trump continues to advance policies that disgrace our cherished American values.
The President’s repulsive defense of white supremacists demands that Congress act to defend our American values. Today, Members led by Reps. Jerry Nadler, Bonnie Watson Coleman and Pramila Jayapal have filed the first censure resolution against the President. Every day, the President gives us further evidence of why such a censure is necessary. Indeed, with each passing day, it becomes clearer that the Republican Congress must declare whether it stands for our sacred American values or with the President who embraces white nationalism. Democrats will use every avenue to challenge the repulsiveness of President Trump’s words and actions.
This week we learned that the Golden Gate National Recreation Area is considering granting a permit for a white supremacist rally at Crissy Field. San Francisco takes great pride in being a city of peace that cherishes free speech and the right to public dissent. However, this decision raises grave and ongoing concerns about public safety. I am deeply alarmed by the hateful and dangerous nature of the event, its timing so soon after the horrors in Charlottesville, and the serious questions over whether the National Park Service is at all equipped to ensure public safety during a white supremacist rally. It is because of those concerns that I have called on the National Park Service to reevaluate its decision. 
I have also called for the removal of Confederate Statutes from the Capitol. The halls of Congress are the very heart of our democracy. The statues in the Capitol should embody our highest ideals as Americans, expressing who we are and who we aspire to be as a nation. The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible. If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, then Speaker Ryan must join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately.

My office recently assisted a constituent who underwent a medically complicated pregnancy and gave birth to a child who has multiple medical conditions. Because her child must now undergo treatments and possible surgery that necessitate frequent trips to the hospital, she has been concerned about who would care for her other two children, because her husband works two full-time jobs. Her father-in-law has volunteered to travel to the United States to assist her, but my constituent was concerned that her father-in-law might have difficulties applying for a visitor visa. Consequently, after my constituent’s father-in-law obtained an appointment for a visa interview, my staff conveyed the details of my constituent’s situation to the U.S. Consulate. I was pleased to learn that, after attending his consular interview, my constituent’s father-in-law was granted a visitor visa. My constituent and her husband will now have the support they need.

Dear Friend,   The tragic events that took place in Charlottesville, VA this past weekend have shaken us as a nation and are a stark reminder that, sadly, a few loud voices preaching hate and division can command the national spotlight. I’ve been heartened by the countless individuals who have banded together to say that these white-supremacists, neo-Nazis and domestic terrorists do not represent the America we know and love. The United States benefits from its rich diversity and these acts of hate and violence went against the core values of our nation. There is no place for the racism, anti-Semitism, misogyny, or violence espoused by white-nationalists, and as a nation we need to come together in one loud voice to condemn their hateful rhetoric.  
We have a long way to go to heal the wounds of our dark history of enslavement and racial intolerance but I’ve been encouraged by the scenes of love and unity that have emerged in the wake of this tragedy. Across New Hampshire, the nation, and powerfully on the campus of the University of Virginia, men and women from across the political spectrum and of every race and creed stood together to peacefully defend our nation from the dark and sick ideology that seeks to divide us. We should in one loud voice reject President Trump’s shameful response to the events in Charlottesville, and declare that America deserves better. Today's removal of Steve Bannon as chief strategist is encouraging, but it is not enough. That's why I'm calling on my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to join me and support censure against President Trump for his Charlottesville remarks.

Dear Friend,
It’s been nearly a week since violence erupted in the streets of Charlottesville. I am saddened and frustrated that in our country we have groups promoting hate and inciting riots, and I strongly condemn any group that engages in such activities. In America, we are free to peaceably assemble and protest; but the 1st Amendment does not protect hate speech (much less destruction of life or property). We have generations of military veterans who have fought against oppression and hate around the world – in large part to protect our own freedoms here at home. To allow this to continue in our country is a slap in the face to those who have served. At a time when we have the global terror threats coming from the likes of ISIS and North Korea, Americans must band together. I will continue to pray for the safety of our country and citizens as well as the wisdom to continue protecting the freedoms we hold dear in the face of infighting that threatens our values, security and freedom.
Introducing Thank-A-Vet Thursday, Central Valley Veterans History Project Yesterday I published the first in a series of short video clips from interviews I’ve recently conducted for the Library of Congress’ Veterans History Project. The video, shared on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, features highlights from my interview with Roy Haury, a Korean War veteran from Patterson, and is also the inaugural post in our “Thank-A-Vet Thursday” social media initiative. 
￼
It’s an honor to represent so many who wore the cloth of this nation and bravely went to war to serve their country and defend our freedoms right here in the Central Valley. The Veterans History Project is a great opportunity for these men and women to archive and share their memories, and I’m privileged to have conducted several interviews for this initiative.
The Veterans History Project was created through an act of Congress in 2000 and invites veterans from conflicts ranging from World War I to the Iraq War to share their story through audio or visual interviews, memoirs or photographic documentation for archival with the Library of Congress. 
The video was posted using the hashtag #TVT, the hashtag associated with “Thank-A-Vet Thursday.” #TVT is a social media initiative we’ve created to spotlight and thank veterans for their service. Similar to #TBT, which is commonly associated with the “Throwback Thursday” trend, I invite and encourage social media users to post photos and videos of veterans in their community using #TVT to recognize and raise awareness of the great history of the nation’s armed services and servicemembers.
To learn more about the Veterans History Project and learn how you can participate, visit https://www.loc.gov/vets or https://denham.house.gov/constituent-services/veterans-history-project.htm.
VA Hosts Facebook Live to Connect Vets with Benefits On August 22 from 11 a.m. – Noon PDT, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs will host a Facebook Live event to show veterans and their families how to use Explore.VA.gov to learn about VA benefits. After the live video, veterans can ask questions in the comments about the resources and tools on the Explore.VA.gov website. For more information about the event, and to register for email reminders, visit the VA’s event page. 
District Office Intern Spotlight Join me in wishing Ashley, Ann and Dominic best of luck as they complete their internships in my Modesto office today! Ashley is studying philosophy and politics at Saint Mary’s College of California, and loved helping fellow members of her community as well as staffing field events with the office. Ann is a senior in high school, hoping to study political science. She said, “You can only have one ‘first job’ in your life and I am glad to call this one my first!” Dominic is a double-major in government and economics at Georgetown University. His favorite part of the internship was getting involved in a Congressional office and the family like atmosphere that came along with it. Thank you for all of your hard work!

Dear Friend,

August district work period is in full swing and we are having a blast traveling throughout Minnesota’s Sixth Congressional District and across the state to meet with Minnesotans from all walks of life. So, this week, we are dedicating our newsletter to our week on the road!

We toured the Minneapolis VA and met with Director Patrick Kelly to learn about the critical efforts being done to help our nation’s heroes,
￼
Met with staff and patients at Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare to discuss issues like Medicaid and health care reform,
￼
And visited the Schiefelbein Farm in Kimball to see hardworking Minnesota families in action and even chat with a future Minnesota farmer!
￼
I had the opportunity to meet with little Elliot who my staff helped bring home from China to join his forever family with the Susankas,
￼
Toured Brenny Transportation to gain insight into the trucking industry,
￼
And joined the grand opening of the new St. Cloud COP House where I even squeezed in some time to play a little soccer with the neighborhood kids,
￼
Crisscrossing the district is an important aspect of my job and we are so appreciative of those who take the time to give us tours, and chat about a variety of issues each and every day which is why the August district work period is so important.
To follow my day-to-day travels, be sure to follow me on Twitter and/or Facebook!  Until next time…  Sincerely,

End the Hatred with Words that Unite, Not Divide
Many hateful things were said and done in Charlottesville, Virginia, this past weekend.
You know the facts: following Friday and Saturday rallies by neo-Nazis, KKK members, white supremacists and other racist fringe groups, a 32-year old woman was killed when a man drove his car into a crowd of people who had arrived to confront their bigotry. 19 other people were injured.
These events  and the incomprehensible reaction to them from the White House - have correctly dominated the news this week.
I condemn the Presidents repeated attempts to evenly distribute blame for clashes between white nationalists and the demonstrators who oppose them.
To be clear, the Presidents assertion that there were two legitimate sides in Charlottesville last weekend is flatly wrong. There can be no comparison  no equivalency - between white supremacists, KKK members and other racist fringe groups and those who showed up to challenge their bigotry, racism and anti-semitism.     
Rather than employing words that divide us, Donald Trump must recognize that we are one people: the American people.
The disgusting displays of hatred and bigotry on display in Charlottesville dishonor the millions of men and women of all races, religions and creeds who fought and died to make our country what it is today.

A Rendezvous with Destiny
On August 16, 1942 at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana, the 101st Airborne’s first commander, Major General William C. Lee, observed that “the 101st…has no history, but has a Rendezvous with Destiny.” This week the Screaming Eagles, based at Fort Campbell, celebrated its 75th birthday! 
￼
I recently met with the 101st Airborne's Commanding General, Major General Andrew Poppas, and the Command Sergeant Major, Todd Sims, to get an update on the unit, its operations, and the dedicated soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division Air Assault. From World War II to Iraq, Afghanistan and the Middle East, the leadership displayed by the Screaming Eagles is unparalleled. Their service is legendary and their accomplishments continue to advance the cause of freedom.
Congratulations on 75 years of continuous service to the United States of America!

Getting a DIPLOMA 
It was an honor to be invited to Maury County this week to be part of the DIPLOMA Laptop Event at Santa Fe Unit School.

Supporting Local Farmers
I always enjoy our local farmers’ markets and I try to get to them as much as I can for fresh produce right from the garden. It is a great opportunity for me to meet and hear from so many of you and answer any questions you may have while I sample your wares. It was great to meet with friends and neighbors this week in Leiper’s Fork and Franklin.

School is back in session or will be soon for many of you, and we start this year with a wonderful learning opportunity. This Monday we will experience a solar eclipse, and parts of our district will be right in the path of the total solar eclipse. 
￼
While this is a great learning opportunity for everyone, it is also extremely important to be safe when viewing the eclipse. Many stores are selling special sunglasses for viewing it – make sure you get some if you plan to watch the event!

Carper's Connection
August 18, 2017
Dear Friends,
Last weekend in Charlottesville, we saw a display of hatred and bigotry from a shameful group of small individuals that took aim at our neighbors, friends, families and our country itself. 
The United States of America is built upon the principle that every man and woman should have equal opportunity for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In Charlottesville, bigots took to the streets to violently proclaim that this sacred right belongs only to certain people. They are wrong. They are cowards, and those who maintain neutrality in the face of such clear evil are cowards, too. We all have a moral obligation to stand up to this hatred.
This has been a trying week for our nation. But it gives me great hope to see that countless Delawareans and Americans, from every walk of life and from every corner of our country have stood up, spoken out and condemned in unequivocal terms the violence and the hate that was spewed by radical bigots in the streets of Charlottesville. Their backward beliefs, and the monuments that stand as reminders of deep and lasting pain, should be resigned to our history books and museums, rather than stand to memorialize the bigotry of others. 
In difficult times, I often look to the guiding principles of my life. One of those is the Golden Rule that calls on us to treat others the way we want to be treated. Those words are particularly important now. In the First State, we must continue to live out those values and stand together as one community. As a country, we must speak out with one voice and make clear: hatred, bigotry and violence are not welcome here.  
While our country isn’t perfect, we are resilient, and we never turn away from a challenge – no matter how great. I am confident that good people will keep standing up for what is right and doing right by their neighbors to continue making this country an ever more inclusive, more perfect union. Let us never give up in that pursuit.

News from Congressman Roger Marshall, M.D.
￼
 
Doctor's Note
Friend,
On Monday, as I arrived in the United States after spending last week in Israel on a congressional delegation, I caught up on the details of what happened in Charlottesville, and finally had time to process it. Often times, especially when constantly hearing about the challenges facing parts of the world like where I was, we forget about the work we still have to do in our own communities.
I condemn, in the strongest terms, the act of domestic terror and hateful rhetoric by white supremacists, Neo-Nazis and KKK sympathizers. These dangerous factions have no role in a civilized, American society. Their bigotry is incompatible with, and is the opposite of all this country stands for.
Laina and I are praying for the loved ones of the woman who was killed, and the officers who died monitoring the rally. We also are praying for those injured, and for our country. We must have tough conversations about how to root out this unproductive, small-minded ideology.
As always, if you have any questions, concerns or know of ways my office can be of assistance, don't hesitate to contact us.
Yours,
￼

Dear Friend,  
What we witnessed in Charlottesville, Virginia last weekend has been difficult for many of us. So many of you have written and called to express your outrage and I want you to know that I stand with you. 

Racism, anti-Semitism, and white nationalism must be condemned by everyone, especially the president of the United States. Instead, his rhetoric this week enabled these dangerous ideologies. 

Far from apologizing for his words, the president has remained silent. But it is especially important that every member of Congress make clear that they object to this offensive language from the leader of the free world. That's why I took action by co-sponsoring a resolution that would censure the president and condemn his remarks. 
This resolution denounces President Trump for failing to immediately name and condemn the white supremacist groups responsible for actions of domestic terrorism in Charlottesville. It also holds him accountable for employing people with white nationalists ties in the White House. This includes Steve Bannon, who has a disturbing history of white nationalist ties and a record of repeatedly and aggressively pushing stories that promote anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and racism. It is beyond the pale to have people like Mr. Bannon working anywhere in the White House, let alone steps away from the Oval Office. 
In an editorial that praises this resolution, USA Today writes: ""When it comes to ideologies of hate and racism, the nation's leaders need to speak forcefully with one voice.""  
I couldn't agree more. There is simply no moral equivalency between white supremacists, the KKK, neo-Nazi groups and those who stand for our values of equality and inclusivity. 
 Sincerely, ￼ Louise M. Slaughter

Promoting Affordable Child Care
Last week, Rep. Murphy toured Merthie's Day Care Center in Sanford, where she read to young children and spoke to parents and employees about her recently-introduced child care bill, the PACE Act. The bipartisan bill would make child care and early education more accessible for working and middle-class families in communities across the country. During the visit, Rep. Murphy recalled how her mother worked a full-time job just to make enough to cover basic child care costs, and expressed her commitment to helping families going through similar difficulties.  
￼
Rep. Murphy reads to young children and talks to them about her responsibilities in Congress

Helping Women Veterans
Rep. Murphy joined Republican Congresswoman Susan W. Brooks of Indiana in introducing the Improve Access to Care for Our Female Veterans Act. This bipartisan bill requires that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) be better prepared to provide female veterans critical services like mammograms, maternity care and routine gynecology visits. Women are the fastest growing group of veterans, and the standards this bill puts in place would ensure the VA works more efficiently to give them the care they have earned and deserve. 
￼
Supporting Innovation in Central Florida
Rep. Murphy toured Engineering & Computer Simulations (ECS) in Orlando to get a first-hand look at the innovative work they are doing in the areas of modeling, simulation, and software development. Rep. Murphy also had the opportunity to try out some of the virtual and artificial reality products ECS created for our military and to provide better care for our veterans. Florida is home to a $5 billion modeling, simulation and training (MS&T) industry that employs 30,000 people. Rep. Murphy has been supportive of the industry and was able to secure major wins for Florida's MS&T community in the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, which was passed by the House in June.

Dear Friend,
One of the biggest problems in politics today is that we sometimes jump to conclusions without hearing out the other person.
I was recently asked about political violence in this country.  I responded that there has been political violence on both sides  because this is a fact.
Let me demonstrate this by referencing two recent events we are all familiar with:
The murderous events in Charlottesville were abhorrent, and the white supremacists who incited the violence do not represent who we are as a people. There is no room in our society for those who embrace hate and bigotry against their fellow Americans.
This was an example of political violence and I denounce it.
But just a few weeks before Charlottesville, a left-wing radical in Alexandria fired a gun at members of the Republican Congressional baseball team and critically wounded the House Republican Whip.
This was an example of political violence and I denounce it as well.
Both of these episodes were violent.  Both were outrageous.  Both were un-American. And both must be denounced. In fact, I cant imagine that anyone but severe partisans would not agree with my position in denouncing both actions. 
This is the point I was making when I made my comments a few days ago.
Still, I would add that Charlottesville is deeply troubling to me.  Anti-Semitism and intolerance do not represent the core values and morals of this great nation. It is incumbent upon all of us as Americans to take a stand against extremism and acts of hatred.
The rhetoric of hate and personal insult has taken our political system hostage, making civil discourse nearly impossible and often dangerous. Whether it is the anti-Semitism of Charlottesville or the political intolerance of Alexandria, America is facing a moral crisis.
Disagreements over the direction of our nation and the political principles we follow to set our economic, health care, education, national security, and other policies are important ones. Every act of violence by demonstrators and counterdemonstrators, though, moves us further away from real solutions.
Unless we stand up for the universal ideals of equality and freedom for all, we risk losing what makes this nation a beacon of light for so many around the world.  And in the meantime, lets make sure our political discourse is one where we hear the other person out, dont jump to conclusions and dont assume the worst.  Now is the time for all Americans to lower their voices and raise their sights.
Sincerely,
￼

  Friends,
We've reached the end of a busy work week, and I want to update you on some of the good work being done by Northwest Georgians.  
￼
I kicked off the week as a guest at the Georgia Department of Economic Development, where we met with Paulding County leaders to discuss transportation and infrastructure priorities around the county.

Read my recent interview with The Paulding Neighbor HERE. 

￼
On Monday, I also sat down with the Director of the Center for Disease Control, Brenda Fitzgerald, who is working hard to promote our health and safety.

￼
Come Tuesday, I made a stop at Legendairy Ice Cream & Coffee Shop to meet with local officials and community leaders to discuss economic priorities in Catoosa County.

￼
I also had the pleasure of meeting with the Greater Haralson Chamber of Commerce. Thank you to the local area Boy Scouts who raised our flag before the meeting.

￼
Honda Precision Parts gave me the unique opportunity to tour their plant to see how it creates jobs and fosters investments in Tallapoosa and Haralson County.

￼
One of my favorite events from the week was hearing from community leaders at the Polk County Chamber of Commerce Annual Summer Picnic at Peek Park.

20,000 Jobs
Dear Friends,
The EPA announced this week its intent to revisit a rule finalized by the Obama administration last year that harms small business owners across the country and in our very own communities. The regulation would destroy the glider kit industry, costing our state thousands of jobs and hurting families who depend on this trade to make their living. 
Glider kits are used to refurbish damaged highway tractors and can save fleet owners up to 25% off the sticker price of a brand new vehicle. Ending their production will result in a direct loss of approximately 20,000 jobs nationwide and thousands in Tennessee alone. On a broader scale, the economic impact of this rule could exceed a conservative estimate of $1 billion.
Not only are these refurbished trucks more fuel efficient and economical, a 2016 study by Tennessee Tech University concluded that their emission levels performed equally as well to that of new vehicles when compared with the 2010 EPA standards. Glider kit manufacturers have argued that despite the Obama administration's stated goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, they issued this rule without performing any actual testing to analyze the environmental impact of the refurbished vehicles. Ultimately rolling back the rule will allow these manufacturers to continue thriving and being a part of the communities they love.
Trucking operators rely on glider kits for the construction of reliable and affordable vehicles which in turn promote job growth and stability. In our very own state, Fitzgerald Glider Kits has been a maverick in this fight. My office has worked with them since 2015 in an effort to stop unnecessary government regulation and let them do what they do best. Business owners like Fitzgerald in America know their companies and what they need to thrive – not regulations by bureaucrats in Washington. This step by the EPA is a welcomed win for American jobs.
Learn more about the Obama-era rule and what the EPA is going to do about it HERE.
Sincerely,

August 18, 2017
 
 
Dear Friend,   Like all Rhode Islanders, I was sickened and furious that what happened in Charlottesville this week was taking place in our country. And I was deeply disappointed in the response of our President.   This should have been really simple. Nazis and white supremacists are to blame. Period. But instead the President has once again created an unnecessary controversy that distracts from the important work we have to do on behalf of working families. Defending Nazis doesn't create jobs or raise wages or make America great again.   The only thing President Trump achieved with his comments was to embarrass the American people and offer comfort to the worst elements of our society.   Bannon, Gorka & Miller   Steve Bannon built a media empire by catering to white supremacists, Klansmen, and Nazis. When Donald Trump hired him, it sent a clear and disturbing signal about what type of President he would be. That's why I led nearly 170 of my colleagues last November in asking President Trump to rescind his appointment White House Chief Strategist.   I’m happy that Steve Bannon will no longer work in the White House. But his departure cannot wash away the harm he and the President have done. It can’t reverse the Muslim Ban. It can’t reverse the President’s inappropriate attacks on a Federal judge of Mexican heritage. And it can’t reverse the White House’s reluctance to denounce white supremacists.   President Trump may want the American people to believe that he’s now serious about taking on racism. But he knows that actions speak louder than words. And as long as Sebastian Gorka and Stephen Miller still have jobs in the Trump administration, we should expect more of the same hurtful words and harmful actions.   Trump Obamacare Threat   This week, the Congressional Budget Office released an estimate on the potential impact of President Trump’s threat to cut off cost sharing reduction payments required under the Affordable Care Act. If President Trump makes good on his threats, he will increase healthcare premiums by 25%, add $200 billion to the federal deficit, and eliminate access to health care for working people all across the country.   Over the last few months, the American people have rejected President Trump’s attempts to roll back access to health care in order to cut taxes for the very wealthy. It’s time for him and his fellow Republicans to stop trying to kill the Affordable Care Act and start working with Democrats to make this good law work even better.   Cumberland Town Hall   I had the privilege of hosting about 100 Rhode Islanders at my Town Hall in Cumberland on Wednesday to discuss the new Democratic economic agenda: ‘A Better Deal: Better Jobs, Better Wages, Better Future.’ The Town Hall offered me an important opportunity to hear from my constituents about the issues impacting them, and to discuss how this new agenda will help to make a difference in peoples’ lives. I want to thank everyone who participated. You can full the full video of the Town Hall online here.   Brandon’s Beach   ￼   All of us know the incredible importance of public spaces in our communities. Our parks and playgrounds are cornerstones of our communities and help to make our state a more welcoming and vibrant place to live. That’s why it was my privilege to participate in the opening of Brandon’s Beach, a wonderful new playground, in Providence. This state-of-the-art facility was made possible through the incredible generosity of Brian and Barbara Goldner as a tribute to their son. On behalf of all the residents of Rhode Island who will benefit from this extraordinary gift, I offer my sincere gratitude to the Goldners and everyone who made this playground possible.   Naval Undersea Warfare Center   ￼   Every year, I am amazed at the exciting technologies on display at the Advanced Naval Technology Exercise (ANTX), hosted by the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport. By staying ahead of the technological curve, we are able to maintain our nation’s strength and work to preserve over oceans. And with growing instability around the world, we absolutely cannot afford to neglect these investments in our future safety and prosperity.   There is no question that our nation’s expertise in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics is paying off, and we must continue to grow our commitment to the STEM disciplines. Our willingness to train the next generation in these important skills will play a critical role in our nation’s defense and continued economic well-being.   I also want to extend my sincere gratitude to the men and women, both veterans and active duty, who participated in these exercises. Your service, and incredible sacrifices, protect our freedoms and keep us safe.   As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns, please call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov. You can also click here to follow my work on Twitter.     Warm Regards, ￼  David Cicilline Member of Congress

Dear Friends,
 
This week many farms and homes were hit with extremely heavy rains in Renville and Redwood Counties. Storms like this show the need for a strong safety net to ensure that farmers and local communities can weather storms and have access to the financing they need to recover. I continued to travel across the Seventh district meeting with a number of Minnesotans from the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce and an employee-owned company, to Lignite Energy Council, as well as Reinhart Foodservice. Later today I’ll be in Hutchinson for additional events - more about that in next week’s newsletter. Lastly, with all the pain, divisions, and negativity dominating the news, some readers would be interested to know that Representative Emmer and I jointly met with the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce. Holding joint events with representatives of another political party is nothing new for me, and it is something that I think moves us in the right direction to best address the challenges facing all Americans. 
 
Sincerely,
￼
 Congressman Collin C. Peterson
Minnesota 7th District
 
Minnesota Chamber of Commerce 
￼
 
Today I joined Congressman Emmer for a joint presentation with the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce. We provided an outlook for the coming session in Washington, and took questions on a number of important issues from healthcare and tax reform, to agriculture and the responsible use of our natural resources. Our joint visit today reflects something that I believe in strongly, which is that if we are going to make progress on issues facing our country, we have to do it on a bipartisan basis. Healthcare is a perfect example of how issues can become partisan, which sets back the work needed to get done to stabilize the market and help make healthcare more affordable. I am hopeful that some common ground can be found to make the investments needed to repair our crumbling infrastructure and to reform our tax code bringing rates down. Together these would create jobs and strengthen our economy. 
 
SJE-Rhombus
￼
 
This week I had the opportunity to visit SJE-Rhombus in Detroit Lakes. They have been awarded the “ESOP Company of the Year” by the Minnesota/Dakotas Chapter of the Employee Stock Ownership Program (ESOP) Association. I was given a complete tour of the plant with CEO Dave Thomas, followed by a Q&A with their Corporate Team Leaders and the Employee Owner Activity Committee. Workers at employee owned businesses show a lot of personal pride in their jobs, and this was certainly the case here. 
 
Otter Tail Coalition of Lakes Association Awards Banquet

I was invited to the Otter Tail Coalition of Lakes Association (COLA) Awards Banquet on Thursday night to give a speech. The COLA awards are given every year to those who help keep our outdoors enjoyable. I am appreciative for having been invited to speak and for those who work diligently at keeping our waters safe.
 
Energy Champion Award
￼
 
I had the honor of receiving the Energy Champion Award by the Lignite Energy Council and the Coalition for Secure Energy Future this week. The LEC is based in Bismarck, ND and their membership is made up of over 400 companies including Minnkota Power and Great River Energy, which serves large parts of the district. We also had the opportunity to discuss the future of energy for the seventh district as well as the state. I will continue to support safe and efficient energy practices that meet the district’s needs.

On Monday, I had to opportunity to tour the Red Baron Arena and Expo in Marshall. I was impressed with the thought and planning that went into the construction of this facility to make it multipurpose and focused on the many needs of the community. After following this project for about nine years, through a long funding process, it is good to see such an impressive end result.
 
Reinhart Foodservice
￼
 
This week I was able to meet with the Marshall facility of Reinhart Foodservice, which is one of the largest foodservice distributors in the county, serving independent restaurants, delis, sporting venues, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, military, and chain accounts. Founded in 1972 in La Crosse, Wisconsin, Reinhart now operates 28 U.S. distribution centers with more than 10,000 stock keeping units per division – servicing the entire eastern half of the country.  
 
Governor Dayton 25BY25 Town Hall
￼
 
My staff attended Governor Dayton’s 25BY25 Southwest Minnesota Water Town Hall meeting in Marshall on Thursday. Approximately 200 people were in attendance to have a chance to talk about water quality, to share challenges facing their communities, and provide ideas for protecting and improving Minnesota’s waters.
 
Minnesota Farmers Union
￼
 
The Minnesota Farmers Union sponsored an educational field day for Minnesota’s newest crop, industrial hemp. With legislative approval to grow hemp in Minnesota, farmers are finding that there is a demand for the seeds, oil, and fiber of this plant. Hemp is similar to soybeans in protein and can have a good yield and price point. The field day had growers and experts giving updates on their experiences about the new crop. Andrea Vaubel, the Assistant Commissioner in the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, is in charge of monitoring how hemp will fit into the overall farming landscape.
 
Downtown Community Workshop
￼
 
The Thief River Falls Downtown Development Association, a committee of the Thief River Falls Chamber of Commerce, sought public input in developing a plan for downtown to enhance economic vitality and improve the quality of life for all its citizens. This was the third in a series of three public meetings to bring ideas and suggestions for future community development. There were wide-ranging ideas dealing with issues of transportation, parking, lighting, re-use of buildings, housings, recreation and of course costs. Some these ideas, with the help of the University of Minnesota Extension, community leaders, and businesses, will move toward implementation in the near future.

￼   




Dear Friend,









As I mentioned in my previous update, I recently had the chance to meet with Kentuckians across the state about health care reform and other challenges facing the American people.  
I wanted to let you know about several more events that took place late last week as we continued discussing these issues!
Dr. Rand Paul Visits Kelly Farm and Holds Industrial Hemp Roundtable in Murray
My travels took me to an industrial hemp farm in Murray, where I visited Joseph and Jim Kelly, who are producing two back-to-back hemp crops this year and working with Murray State University on a research project.  They are great examples of the entrepeneurial nature of Kentucky farmers.
￼
(Dr. Paul at the Kelly Farm in Murray)
Several state legislators, local officials, and representatives of the agribusiness community were also on hand.  During our roundtable session, we discussed the many regulatory road blocks Kentucky's hemp farmers still face, and I relayed my commitment to helping them cut the red tape so our state can truly reap the economic benefits of producing hemp products.  Kentucky State Representative Richard Heath also spoke and described the proactive role the Kentucky legislature has taken with industrial hemp.
I was proud to testify before the Kentucky legislature years ago when it passed enabling legislation for Kentucky's hemp pilot program, and I will continue to work on Capitol Hill to get the government out of this industry's way!
Dr. Rand Paul Meets with Kentuckians in Fulton   I then headed to Fulton to meet with Kentuckians and answer their questions on the future of reform.  About 20 members of the community joined me at Fulton City Hall, where I listened to their concerns regarding Obamacare as we discussed a variety of topics.  
I explained that freedom made our country great in the first place, so we need more freedom in health care!  Thanks to Fulton County Judge/Executive Jim Martin for a warm welcome and introduction. 
￼
(Dr. Paul in Fulton)
Dr. Rand Paul Meets with Kentuckians in Paducah   Next, I met with local leaders in Paducah, including McCracken County Commissioner Bill Bartleman, who stated in his introduction that I am ""[t]he same as a senator as"" I ""was as a candidate -- a constitutional conservative,"" also saying, ""He's gone to Washington, and his views today are the same as when he ran … His voice not only echoes from the banks of the Mississippi and the Appalachian Mountains, but what he says echoes all over the country.  He's influential, and we're fortunate to have him in Kentucky.""  
￼
(Dr. Paul in Paducah)
I was honored by these kind words, and I greatly appreciate the chance to be a voice for Kentuckians on Capitol Hill! 
I then began my remarks by discussing the failures of Obamacare and the problem states such as Kentucky face when it comes to funding the Medicaid expansion. 
Everyone said Washington would pay for it, but we don't have any money in Washington!  I reiterated my belief that we still have a chance to fix health care, and I remain optimistic we can find a way to alleviate the problems Obamacare is causing.    Dr. Rand Paul Meets with Kentuckians in Marion
My next meeting in Marion felt more like sitting down to chat with old friends than an official roundtable!
￼
(Dr. Paul in Marion)
A group of Marion's community and small business owners joined me for a discussion on health care reform and more in the Crittenden Airport lobby, where we gathered on couches and armchairs.  After talking about health care, we turned to discussing the onerous regulations on industries such as trucking and how the big government policies that may have been created with good intentions are now suffocating smaller, independent businesses. 
Cutting red tape and bureaucratic overreach has always been a priority of mine, and I told attendees I would be happy to advocate on their behalf to help ensure Kentucky's small businesses aren't regulated to death.   Dr. Rand Paul Meets with Kentuckians in Owensboro   I then traveled to Owensboro for a roundtable with community leaders and medical professionals, who expressed the same views as many other Kentuckians - they're worried about the current state of Obamacare, want to know where reform efforts stand in Congress, and aren't sure how to plan for the unknown future of health care reform. 
I brought the same message I carried to my earlier stops - health care reform isn't over, and I'm not done fighting.  
Members of the Owensboro media spoke with several of the attendees and reported, ""There was a sense of optimism in talking to people walking out of the health care roundtable.  They believe they're in capable hands with Senator Rand Paul.""  I will continue fighting to keep honoring their trust! 
￼
(Dr. Paul in Owensboro)
Dr. Rand Paul Meets with Kentuckians in Lexington   I also held a health care roundtable with over a dozen of Lexington's community leaders and those in the medical and insurance industries, where they stated their concerns about the problems Obamacare could cause in the future if no changes are made. 
￼
(Dr. Paul in Lexington)

They also expressed concern about physician shortages and the prospects of a disastrous single-payer system.  
My idea to expand the availability of group insurance through Association Health Plans was received well by this group of folks whose organizations, members, or employees could stand to benefit from such a change. 
I appreciate them all taking time to meet with me and provide feedback on the state of health care in Kentucky!   Dr. Rand Paul Meets with Kentuckians in Owenton   My next stop in Owenton was attended by several physicians and medical providers with a unique and interesting story to tell.  Direct Primary Care is something that many may not know about, but it is becoming more common as an option for affordable health care.
￼
(Dr. Paul in Owenton)
One of the physicians in attendance explained she provides medical care through Direct Primary Care. Essentially, one pays a small monthly fee for unlimited access to their physician and office - check-ups, physicals, basic tests and procedures, etc.  She noted that many of the tests they run, such as a CBC blood test, cost less than $5.00 at their office but can cost well north of $150 at a hospital.  
These types of providers are able to provide care at wholesale, or true market costs, rather than the bizarre and inflated prices dictated by the insurance industry.  I appreciated them sharing their stories of how free market principles and eliminating government mandates can bring down prices in health care.    Dr. Rand Paul Meets with Kentuckians in Kenton County   I then headed to Independence in Kenton County to meet with senior citizens and local community leaders at the Independence Senior Center.  
In addition to discussing health care reform, we spent much of the time talking about the opioid epidemic.  One of the attendees works at a local addiction recovery center and was able to share her firsthand experiences in dealing with the epidemic, which has hit Northern Kentucky very hard.  
I was glad to hear they are using a variety of methods to supplement recovery efforts, and I expressed my belief that a work component is beneficial to recovery and rehabilitation. 
￼
(Dr. Paul in Independence)

Dear Friend, 
As Arizona students head back to school, we want to highlight some of our work in Congress to support Arizona’s colleges and universities and make higher education more affordable and accessible for Arizonans.
While previous generations could take a part-time job that allowed them to graduate from a four-year institution with minimal or no debt, this generation struggles with skyrocketing college costs and stagnated wages. In Arizona and around the country, college costs continue to rise faster than family incomes, making it more difficult to afford an education and requiring students to take out extensive loans. The resulting student loan debt makes it challenging to spend, save, invest, or start a business.
Advancements in technology and an increasingly competitive global economy make developing the right skills more important than ever, but Arizonans must be able to afford it. The bipartisan budget agreement we passed earlier this year protects funding for Pell Grants and re-institutes year-round eligibility, so students can once again use Pell Grant funding to pay for summer classes. I also joined Congressman Scott Peters of California in introducing H.R. 2718, the Federal Student Loan Refinancing Act of 2017. This bill lowers interest rates on all new federal student loans to 4%. If an individual has multiple federal student loans, the bill would allow also him or her to consolidate and refinance to pay the average of the loan interest rates or 4%, whichever is lower.
In addition to scholarships and student loans, we’re working to expand access to dual enrollment programs, which allow high school students to get college credit for some of their classes through partnerships with community colleges or universities. We cosponsored the Jumpstart on College Act, which makes grants available for high school students to pay for dual or concurrent enrollment programs. This allows students to make the most of their time in the classroom and save money on their education so they can graduate on time and get ahead.
Education was my ticket to the middle class, but for too many Arizona families, a quality education is increasingly out of reach. As someone who was only able to afford college because of Pell Grants and federal student aid, I know we must work together to protect and expand educational opportunities for our students while also ensuring our colleges and universities are good stewards of taxpayer dollars. I will continue fighting to increase investment in both K-12 and higher education to ensure our kids are prepared for the jobs of the future. I am committed to working with members of both parties to find reasonable solutions that tackle rising college costs and expand economic opportunity for Arizona students and families. 
We are honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Arizona families like yours. We always appreciate hearing from you on current topics and issues that are important to you. If there is an issue that concerns you, please let us know by clicking this link or by calling our Phoenix office: 602-956-2285. Be sure to stay connected through our Facebook and Twitter accounts, and let us know how we can be of service.

Sincerely,
     ￼
 
Kyrsten

Dear Friend, 

I have been deeply disturbed and saddened by the events that occurred in Charlottesville this past weekend. The Virginians I know and represent love their families and support their neighbors regardless of the color of their skin, religion, or political affiliation. We were created equal by our Creator and that is affirmed in the Declaration of Independence. I completely reject nazi white supremacists, the KKK, and fascism. Any group or individual that believes in racial superiority runs completely counter to the Gospel and the rule of law in our country and is to be condemned.

These groups and individuals do not share my values or those of the Republican party. I ran on the Republican creed which states, ""That all individuals are entitled to equal rights, justice, and opportunities and should assume their responsibilities as citizens in a free society."" The views of neo-Nazis and white supremacists have no place in our society and local communities.

I am also disappointed in the lack of civility around the country. Our words and tone matter, and we should all be coming together to focus on the things that unite us. We all want to leave this country better off than we found it for our children and grandchildren. We all want opportunities to get ahead, and we all want to feel secure in our communities and our homes. With that said, I will continue to meet with my constituents, local businesses, and organizations to listen to their needs so I can carry that message back to Congress. I remain committed to serving the interests of those who reside in Virginia's Seventh Congressional District, and am truly honored to represent you in Congress.

National Night Out
I enjoyed National Night Out in Chesterfield County where local police officers went out into the community to increase safety awareness and strengthen relationships local residents. The night also served as a sendoff for retiring Police Chief Thierry Dupuis. Thierry has served Chesterfield County for 38 years, and I was honored to be there to celebrate this milestone. It was a great night out, and the relationships that our local police officers have created are a testament to their dedication.
￼


Around the 7th District

￼
 
￼
 
￼
￼

It has been a very busy August as I have traveled around the district to meet with constituents who have shared their thoughts and ideas about how to move our country forward in the right direction. I stopped by the Southside Electric Cooperative where I learned about their operations and presented them with a flag for their 80th Anniversary.  I also went down to Nottoway County to stop in at Fort Pickett to learn more about their Foreign Affairs Security Training Center (FASTC) within the Department of State.

I would also like to thank the Chesterfield Chamber of Commerce for having me at their monthly lunch. It was great to hear about all of the things that Chesterfield businesses are doing around their community, and to provide an update on everything that has been going on in Congress.


￼
I was excited to attend the ribbon-cutting ceremony for Lohmann Specialty Coatings' expansion in Orange County. The new facility will create over 50 jobs in Orange over five years. Great job to everybody involved to help make Orange County the most economically viable location for this expansion!

￼
I also stopped by Amelia County Public Schools as they get ready to begin the school year. I am very excited to say that all three schools in Amelia are fully accredited. Huge congratulations and thanks to the teachers for all their hard work and investment in our youth.

I am always interested in hearing your thoughts. If you have any comments, questions, or concerns, you can contact me directly by clicking here or by calling my office at (202) 225-2815.

Legislative Filibuster Has to Go!
 

Right now, there is but one thing standing in the way of implementing a conservative agenda for our country. It’s not a person, not a group, and not a law. But this one thing is blocking nearly everything that President Trump wants to accomplish: the legislative filibuster. This arcane Senate process, where just one senator can block entire bills from being signed into law, has ground DC to a halt. And it’s time to get rid of it.
For years our party fought tirelessly against the Obama Administration's liberal agenda, making small but important strides where we were able and slowly inching our way towards control of both Congress and the presidency. When President Trump was inaugurated in January, he joined a Republican House and Senate hopeful to finally undo the damage Obama’s terrible policies caused and restore our country. But the filibuster has stopped the Senate time and again.
In the House, we got to work immediately, aiding our Republican President in fulfilling our conservative agenda for the country. We have passed 432 bills this year already and sent them to the Senate. 432! We repealed regulation after regulation, and barely a handful have made it through to the president’s desk. Obamacare? Repealed in the House, failed in the Senate. Dodd-Frank? Gone in the House, Senate hasn’t even taken it up.
Time and again the Senate Democrats use the filibuster rule to block each and every bill, ultimately stopping us from reaching our major legislative goals.  Repealing Obamacare is something we have been preparing to do for seven years, and the Senate can’t even pass the most simplistic of bills to do just that.  They are at a complete standstill when it comes to passing conservative legislation, or any legislation, and the only true option to overcome this halt in our progress is to eliminate the filibuster. Let's get to work passing bills and make America great again! 
Around South Mississippi
Last week I was pleased to attend the Jones County Republican Women's meeting and meet with some good folks like President Nancy Bell, Sheriff Alex Hodge, Mrs. Jane McArthur, and the Mississippi Federation of Republican Women President Dana Stringer. As always, it was great to hear their positive updates and spend time in Jones County! 
￼
Saturday I was priviliged to honor the students of William Carey University for their accomplishments  at the Tradition Campus graduation ceremony. Congratulations to all the WCU graduates - Carey Strong! 
￼

This weekend I also visited the VFW District Meeting and enjoyed speaking with our local veterans from Hattiesburg, Purvis, Poplarville, Columbia and Beaumont. The womens' auxilary joined us too!

￼

￼

￼
 
Finally, I had a great time speaking and taking questions during the Lamar-Forrest Republican Women's monthly meeting this week!

What I learned on my two-day, seven stop drought and Farm Bill tour across western North Dakota
￼
The best part of my job is getting to travel across the state and meet with North Dakotans — to learn about what they do, the challenges they face, and how I can be their voice in the halls of Congress. Last week during my two-day, seven stop drought and Farm Bill tour I did just that. Click here for more details and photos. 
The drought is a stress test for the 2014 Farm Bill — which I worked across the aisle to help write, negotiate, and pass when I first joined the U.S. Senate as a member of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry. We are seeing firsthand how the safety net in place for ranchers works, and how we can strengthen and modify those programs in the 2018 Farm Bill so they provide more certainty and support.
￼
The goal of my two-day, seven stop drought and Farm Bill tour was two-fold: to hear about the short and long term challenges faced by the drought and how I can help, and to hear the priorities of North Dakota producers so I can advocate for them when we’re putting together the 2018 Farm Bill.
This tour, which built on my initial Farm Bill tour which I did in August 2016 across eastern North Dakota, included stops at both Stark and Dunn Counties Farm Service Agency offices to talk what they see as challenges facing ranchers and need for more staff to meet demand. I also visited the NDSU Extension in Manning to learn about its work on soil health, how the drought is impacting soil in the region, and to reinforce the importance of strong investments in agriculture research in the 2018 Farm Bill. I finished day one in Watford City meeting with ranchers from the area to talk about the impacts of the drought and what additional support they need that I should fight for in the next Farm Bill (click here to watch that meeting). Click here to visit my drought resource webpage for information on assistance programs, drought monitoring and more. 
Day two of my tour kicked off at Woodworth Honey & Bee Co. in Halliday where I learned about the operation and how the drought is impacting bee producers. In the 2014 Farm Bill, I fought for provisions to protect honey bee habitats as North Dakota is the number one honey producing state in the country. I also visited Stone Mill in Richardton to talk about agriculture export promotion programs and how they can help producers grow their business. 95% of consumers are outside the U.S., so if we’re not exporting, we’re losing. My final event was in Mandan where I brought together agriculture and banking leaders from across the state, to talk about how the stress of the drought, compounded by already low commodity prices, is creating deep challenges across North Dakota’s farming and ranching economy. 
These visits gave me the insight, background, and inspiration to keep fighting for the commonsense solutions folks in North Dakota need to weather the drought and come back even stronger.

August is a great opportunity for Members of Congress to spend time working in their districts, and this year is no different. As I travel around the North Country meeting with constituents, businesses, and community leaders, I wanted to take a brief opportunity to share a few photos of my visits with you.
Saratoga County Veterans Roundtable
. ￼
Our heroes are so important to the North Country and I'd like to thank  all who participated in our NY-21 Veterans Roundtable in Saratoga County! It was a great discussion on how to ensure our veterans get the care and services they deserve.
VET Help
￼
I was glad to visit VET Help in Saratoga County. They do important work for our heroes, including providing them with housing, clothing, and food, while ensuring that they live lives of dignity and productivity.
Herkimer County Economic Development Roundtable
￼
This month, I also hosted an Economic Development Roundtable in Herkimer County. I enjoyed the diverse perspectives as we discussed USDA Rural Development Programs, healthcare, infrastructure, broadband access, and invasive species. Thank you to all who participated, and let's keep working to make NY-21 a hub for economic development!
Old Forge Library Visit
￼
I had a great time visiting the Old Forge Library, which has been promoting literacy for over 100 years. I was happy to be able to donate some books from the Library of Congress. Thanks for a great tour!
Alexandria Bay Point of Entry
￼
I was excited to tour the Alexandria Bay Port of Entry, which is one of our country's busiest border crossings with Canada. The economies of the North Country and Canada are closely intertwined, and in Congress, I'll keep working to protect the special relationship with our neighbors to the north.
NTEU Chapter 138 Meeting
￼
While I was at the Alexandria Bay Port of Entry, I got a chance to sit down with chapter 138 of the National Treasury Employees Union. I'm grateful they took the time to meet with me!
Jefferson County Broadband Roundtable
￼
I enjoyed hosting a Broadband Roundtable in Watertown where we discussed the various ways we can increase access to this critical 21st century infrastructure. To read more about our roundtable, click here.
Johnson Lumber Facilities Tour
￼
As the daughter of small business owners, it was great to tour the facilities at Johnson Lumber. They've been in business for 40 years and are critical contributors to our North Country economy.
Kruger Hydroelectric Plant Visit
￼
As a supporter of alternative energy sources, I was thrilled to tour the Kruger Hydroelectric Plant. Did you know that every year they produce 63,000 megawatt-hours of clean, renewable energy?
Clinton County Workforce Development Roundtable
￼
One of the most common refrains I hear when I tour businesses and manufacturers across the North Country is the need for more high skilled workers. To compete in a 21st century economy, workers need the skills and experience necessary to secure these high skilled jobs. Thanks to all the community leaders who participated in my Workforce Development Roundtable!
Vapor Rail Systems Visit

Charlottesville
Even last Saturday it was clear that white supremacists were responsible for the violence in Charlottesville. Any civilized society must condemn such vicious bigotry – either we live together in peace, or perish together in hate.
The President tardily issued a prepared statement, but then quickly distanced himself from it and reverted to his initial response.   His stream of consciousness rant on August 15th was abhorrent, and violated all that we stand for as a country.  Instead of showing leadership and standing up against hatred and racism, the President chose to descend into a repugnant defense of neo-Nazism, white supremacy and ultra-nationalism.  That position, it should be noted, was so completely indefensible that all four branches of the military, plus the Coast Guard, felt compelled to issue statements unequivocally denouncing hatred and intolerance.
I have always defended the right to believe and say things I find objectionable.  But such tolerance does not condone violence.  It upholds the American value of free expression. That said, the proper response to hate speech is not silence, it is renewed vigilance and commitment to our fundamental principles. 
While we pray for those killed and injured last Saturday, we should all rededicate ourselves to the difficult task of ending bigotry in all its forms and building a better, more tolerant and compassionate society.
Additionally, yesterday I offered some thoughts on using racism as a political strategy, and on censuring President Trump on Facebook.  I invite you to view them here.
AJC New England
I met with constituents from the American Jewish Committee who shared their concerns with me.  The AJC, established in 1906, has worked for more than a century to oppose anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry, and to support human rights for all people world-wide.  They are understandably troubled, as I am as well, that hate crimes targeting Jewish institutions have risen sharply in recent months.   The AJC believes that the current political climate, marked by xenophobia and virulent nativism, has contributed to this increase.  We met, in fact, the day after the Holocaust Memorial in Boston was vandalized for the second time this summer.  We spoke too about Israel’s right to exist, and about ways to achieve a two state solution in the Middle East.
North Suffolk Mental Health Association
I met with officials from the North Suffolk Mental Health Association (NSMHA), operator of the Meridian House in East Boston. Meridian House is a residential program for individuals who are in recovery from addiction. I toured Meridian House, learning more about the services available to residents on site as well as through the NSMHA network. After spending time at Meridian House, I visited Harborview, an NSMHA residence in Chelsea for individuals with mental illness and co-occurring medical conditions.  NSMHA’s services embrace a continuum of mental and behavioral health care. Mental health services, for example, are offered for children and adults as well as an after-school program designed specifically for children with emotional or behavioral needs.  I am impressed by the dedication of NSMHA’s staff, and deeply appreciate their commitment to the people with whom they work.
Soldiers’ Home in Chelsea
I visited the Chelsea Soldier’s Home, a facility that offers qualified Massachusetts veterans both residential and outpatient health care services. Veterans living in the Soldiers’ Home have access to so much more than high quality medical support delivered by dedicated medical personnel. The facility houses a library, barber shop, pharmacy, dining room, recreational space and other services. However, the Home, while a state of the art facility when first constructed decades ago, is in need of updating.  I met with staff from the Soldiers’ Home, as well as Massachusetts state personnel, for a briefing about the plans to modernize the facility so that it meets the contemporary standards we should expect for our fellow citizens who have served our country so selflessly.
Metro North Regional Employment Board
Thanks to Metro North Regional Employment Board personnel for meeting with me this week. The Metro North REB is one of Massachusetts’ Workforce Development Boards.  This public-private partnership focuses on helping employees through career centers and skills development as well as identifying employer needs to help match candidates with existing opportunities. The organization also works with young people through its Metro North Youth Council, providing educational and networking opportunities.  I enjoyed a wide ranging conversation with Metro North REB staff and Board members about the REB’s initiatives.   
Fresh Pond Apartments
I talked Wednesday night with tenants at Fresh Pond Apartments in Cambridge. It was a great opportunity to hear directly from them about the local and federal issues that they are most concerned with. Not surprisingly, meeting attendees are worried about the future of their “expiring use” residence. Properties classified as “expiring use” are private developments that must remain affordable housing until mortgage and other financial obligations are met. Once that happens, building owners can start renting units out at market rates because the building’s affordability has “expired”. The Fresh Pond Apartments are several years away from this, but residents are right to be concerned and active.  Additionally, residents had questions and concerns about immigration policy and health care.  Unfortunately, as readers of this e-newsletter know, these are important issues that are currently under attack.
Behind the Curtain – More House and Trump Administration Actions You Don’t Want to Miss
Here are this week’s additions. If you need to catch up or share with friends, you can find the full list here.
138.  According to an August 10, 2017 report from the Environmental Integrity Project, the first 6 months of Trump's presidency has seen the Department of Justice file fewer cases against companies for violating the Clean Water Act, and they have also collected far less in civil penalties.  The Trump administration has collected just $12 million in civil penalties, compared to $30 million under the first 6 months of George W. Bush's administration, and $25 million in the Clinton administration’s first six months.  In last week's Behind the Curtain we reported on how Wall Street regulators have similarly prioritized business interests over the protection of the average American.
139. On August 15, 2017 Trump issued an Executive Order overturning an Obama administration Federal Flood Risk Management Standard.  The standard ensured that when federal dollars build infrastructure projects, they factor in increased resilience against flooding from the best available climate science.  When Hurricane Sandy hit New York and New Jersey, it caused tens of billions of dollars in damage to their infrastructure.  Preparing the next generation of infrastructure against storms that are already hitting our coasts not only helps them continue to function after a storm, but also saves us money in the long run.
140.  On August 12, 2017, the Department of Justice was granted a warrant to obtain a wide range of information about individuals who visited a website used to organize protests to President Trump’s inauguration.  In addition to IP addresses for these 1.3 million people, DOJ is also seeking cell phone numbers, credit card information, even photos.  This is not the first request by the Trump Administration for sweeping information about U.S. citizens – recall the demand to provide personal information about voters.

Longs Short Report  The modern day use of chemical weapons
By: Rep. Billy Long
Every day we hear about the global threat of chemical weapons and the devastating impact they have. These weapons of mass destruction are weaponized toxic substances such as chlorine bombs, sarin nerve gas, and mustard gas. Many chemical weapons can cause blistering and blindness, while nerve agents such as sarin and VX attack the nervous system and lead to death from asphyxia. Although the use of chemical weapons has been prohibited for decades, that hasnt stopped countries like Syria or terrorist organizations, such as ISIS, from using them.
During World War I, the use of chemical weapons caused over one million fatalities on the battlefield. The global community saw the horrors these weapons inflicted and worked together to make sure it never happened again by prohibiting their use under the Geneva Protocol.
Decades later, the global community came together again, this time setting its sights on halting the creation of chemical weapons and eliminating a countrys ability to stockpile them. In 1997, the U.S. joined over 150 countries and ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) treaty, which bans the creation and stockpiling of chemical weapons. Since then, the U.S. has eliminated 27,000 tons of chemical weapons.
However, laws and treaties are only as effective as the entities that follow them. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), an inter-government organization, is responsible for monitoring and enforcing the CWC. If problems arise, the OPCW has the ability to bring issues before the UN Security Council and General Assembly for economic sanctions or trade embargoes.
In August of 2015, the OPCW confirmed that ISIS used mustard gas on civilians in Syria. Just this past March ISIS attacked civilians in Iraq with rockets laced with chemical agents. In the Iraqi city of West Mosul alone there were 15 confirmed chemical weapons attacks from April to mid-May. These types of chemical weapons are nearly impossible to defend against without specific protective gear, which is nearly non-existent in Iraq and Syria. According to U.S. intelligence officials, ISIS is working towards creating a chemical weapons cell of specialists to increase its supply of deadly nerve agents like sarin or VX. 
Sadly, ISIS isnt the only entity using chemical weapons. The Syrian government, though it denies it, has repeatedly used chemical weapons against its own people. In 2013, chemical attacks from the Syrian military killed nearly 1,500 civilians. Last April, sarin gas launched from a Syrian military base killed over 80 civilians and injured hundreds more, including many women and children.
Fortunately, our president is not complacent in the face of such evil.  In April, President Trump launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at the Syrian military base responsible for launching the attack. His swift actions stated unequivocally that the use of chemical weapons will not be tolerated. I agree and will continue to work with the president to prevent the spread and use of these weapons.

United States House of Representatives
***PRESS RELEASE***
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
August 18, 2017   
Blumenauer Joins Colleagues to Introduce Resolution of Censure Against Donald Trump
Washington, D.C. – Congressman Earl Blumenauer (OR-03) today joined Reps. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ), Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), and 75 other Members of Congress to introduce a resolution censuring Donald Trump for the comments he made on August 15, 2017 that “both sides” were to blame for the horrific violence that took place in Charlottesville, VA. By reverting back to his earlier stance, Trump again equated the actions of white supremacy groups with those of the counter-protestors. 
“The vast majority of Americans are forcefully speaking out against Trump’s behavior that serves only to embolden these white nationalists,” said Blumenauer. “Congress must act now to send a strong statement against hatred, white supremacy, and Nazism and to those who support and enable them, including the President of the United States.”
The resolution both censures and condemns Trump for his inadequate response to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 12, 2017, including his failure to immediately name and denounce the white supremacist groups responsible for the domestic terrorism, and urges Trump to fire any and all White House advisors who urged him to cater to the alt-Right movement in the United States.

Blaine's Bulletin
  

On Monday, August 21, the continental United States will see a solar eclipse. However, Missouri’s 3rd Congressional District is one of few areas across the country that will witness a total blackout of the sun, leaving only the sun’s atmosphere, called the corona, visable. 
Many Missourians, including me, are very excited to witness this incredible experience. The total eclipse will stretch all the way from Oregon to South Carolina, covering 14 states inbetween. The longest period when the moon completely blocks the sun from any given location along the path will be approximately two minutes and 40 seconds. In Jefferson City, the moon will first start crossing in front of the sun at 11:46, and the total eclipse will begin at 1:13:07.
The last time the United States saw a total eclipse was in 1979, so an entire generation of Americans have not experienced this phenomenon. This is an excellent opportunity for our region to display our natural beauty, quality way of life, wonderful restaurants and, of course, great baseball teams to the thousands of tourists coming from around the country and globe.  From our state capital, to the Lake of the Ozarks, to the St. Louis area, we are proud of our home state and look forward to welcoming so many to Missouri. 
Just as important as the economic value to our local economy, is the safe observation of the eclipse. I urge you to read how to safely view the sun during this event. While some of these tips may be obvious, they must be followed. Please visit eclipse2017.nasa.gov for safety instruction and historical facts.
Lastly, please be sure to share your stories with me via email or Facebook. I would love to hear how the 3rd District celebrates this once in a generation event.
CONTACT US: As always, for those of you with Internet access, I encourage you to visit my official website. For those without access to the Internet, I encourage you to call my offices in Jefferson City (573-635-7232) Washington, Mo.

Lindsey-
This week, I held a press conference to announce I introduced legislation that will help veterans who are suffering from Agent Orange or other herbicide-related conditions.
The Fairness for Korean DMZ Veterans Act expands the time frame of eligibility for disability compensation for veterans who served at or near the Korean DMZ and are suffering from herbicide-related conditions.  Currently, that time frame is between April 1, 1968 and August 3, 1971. This legislation will change the eligibility date to September 1, 1967 for these veterans, allowing them to receive the health care they have earned. The VFW estimates this change could help 1,000-1,500 veterans.
￼
This issue was first brought to my attention by Garfield Harper, a US Army veteran who served in the Korean DMZ in the late 1960s and is now suffering from health complications as a result of his exposure to Agent Orange and other herbicides.  As the son of a Korean War veteran and Representative of more than 50,000 veterans, I believe we have a moral obligation to provide quality care for our veterans, like Mr. Harper. They have sacrificed so much for our freedoms and now it’s up to us to fight for them.  
Bipartisan Town Hall
￼
Later that day, I had the opportunity to join my Democratic colleagues, Congressman Frank Pallone and Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman for a bipartisan town hall hosted by the National Guard. We discussed a wide range of issues including the national debt, infrastructure spending, veteran issues, and health care. No, we did not agree on everything but we were respectful of each other's views and I'm thankful I was able to join them for this substantive discussion. It's always been my belief that if we don't solve tough issues together, we won't solve them at all.

Dear Friends,
Last month I wrote you about the Houses unanimous passage of the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Education Assistance Act, which includes a bill I introduced to bring relief to veteran families. 
I have more good news. After unanimous Senate approval, President Trump signed the bill on Wednesday.
I introduced my legislation in February and it was incorporated in the Colmery Act, H.R. 3218, by the House Veterans Affairs Committee. The Shauna Hill Post 9/11 Education Benefits Transferability Act permits reassignment of education benefits in cases where the designated beneficiary dies. The change will help veteran families in times of greatest need.
I learned of the benefits loophole from the family of 16-year-old Shauna Hill of Eagle, after her death in an automobile accident. Hills father, a retired Navy pilot with 28 years of service, attempted to transfer his education benefits to his surviving daughter under the GI Bill. Unfortunately, the law prohibited such a transfer.
We worked with the Navy in hopes of finding an administrative fix, but that was not possible because of the clear language in the statute. So we sought a legislative remedy to ensure that in the future no veteran would find themselves in a similarly tragic situation.
The House Veterans Affairs Committees report to the House said it was a matter of fairness to extend these benefits to survivors.
Shauna had a strong sense of justice and would be gratified to know her story helped veterans and their families, said Shaunas parents, Capt. Edward and Heidi Hill. She had great affection for veterans, including her grandfathers who served in World II and Korea. Being associated with a law named for Harry Colmery, the architect of the first GI Bill, would have made her very, very proud.
Shauna cheerfully accepted the lifestyle of a Navy brat, attending seven different schools and considered herself her dads partner in the effort to protect and defend America, the Hills continued. At military events she always made an effort to visit with servicemembers. As her parents, we take comfort in knowing her untimely passing has helped bring relief to veteran families.
Shauna was an amazing young woman  a competitive figure skater and a violinist who performed at Carnegie Hall with the Eagle High School Orchestra. She was on her way home from orchestra practice when the accident occurred.
￼
Working with the Hills has been a profound honor. Through unspeakable loss, they told a compelling story that has changed the law of the United States to help grieving families. Shauna Hills legacy includes providing solace to countless veterans in the future.

8/18/17 11:06,Beyond resistance: expanding access to the ballot,"Update | Friday, August 18, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 21st day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: expanding access to the ballot.
The individual right to vote, the cornerstone of our representative democracy, is under threat across America. In 2016, 14 states had new restrictions on voting in place for the first time in a presidential election – disproportionately targeting minority and low-income voters.
I’m working to remove barriers to voting by promoting Oregon’s successful automatic voter registration and vote-by-mail systems at the national level. Senator Ron Wyden and I introduced the Vote By Mail Act to expand automatic voter registration and vote by mail to all. I also joined Rep. David Cicilline to introduce the Automatic Voter Registration Act.     
Automatic voter registration and vote-by-mail are commonsense solutions that are highly effective, reduce opportunities for cheating and mistakes, cost less, and provide more reliable voting results. Oregon voters are given almost four hundred hours to examine the issues and return the ballot either by mail or in person, leading to some of the highest voter turnout in the nation. With the implementation of automatic voter registration in Oregon in 2016, voter turnout among eligible young (age 18-29) voters increased by 7 percent since the 2012 election – evidence that this reform is useful in increasing access to the ballot for these highly mobile new voters.
More and more states are following Oregon’s lead. It’s time to expand these programs nationally. We must protect voting as a fundamental right – and any attempts to undermine it must be stopped.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

￼ 

 
Dear Friend,
Please join me for a community event on voting suppression!
Voting rights are under attack all over our country. Several Voter ID laws have been struck down by courts for discriminating against minorities. In North Carolina the Supreme Court struck down their Voter ID Law for “target[ing] African-Americans with almost surgical precision”. Currently, 34 states have voter ID laws compared to only 4 in 2012. These are worrying trends.
Our voting rights are being further undermined by President Trump’s insistence on spreading inaccurate claims surrounding voter fraud during the previous election. His Commission on Election Integrity is led by conspiracy theorists such as Kris Kobach who is determined to use faulty voter fraud claims to justify voter suppression.
To learn more about voter suppression join me, MN Secretary of State Steve Simon, and Emma Greenman from the Center for Popular Democracy as we discuss more in-depth voter ID laws, the Commission on Election Integrity, and what you can do to fight voter suppression. 
	•	What: Congressman Ellison’s Fighting Voter Suppression Forum

The Huizenga Huddle:  August 18, 2017
Upcoming Town Hall  Next week, I will be holding a town hall from 7:00 - 8:30 PM on Wednesday, August 23rd at Orchard View High School in Muskegon. The doors will open for the event at approximately 6:30 PM.    Similar to previous town halls, signs will not be permitted in the auditorium due to concerns regarding line of sight. Anyone who would like to display a sign is welcome to do so outside the school prior to the event.   Orchard View High School is located at 16 N Quarterline Road in Muskegon. As a reminder, this event is reserved for residents of the Second District. I look forward to having a constructive dialogue on the issues facing our nation and how they impact West Michigan.   Confronting Hate  Recently we have seen disgusting examples of bigotry, racism, and hatred at the national level as well as right here in West Michigan. The events that unfolded in Charlottesville were not only tragic, they were sickening.  We all must clearly refute the hateful ideology spread by groups such as the KKK and White Supremacists. What we witnessed in Charlottesville goes directly against the values we cherish and teach our children in West Michigan. If an ideology promotes hate and targets individuals because of their race, religion, or gender it should be refuted.   Here in West Michigan, specifically in Muskegon, we saw statues vandalized with racist language and even a noose at a local school. As a community, we must condemn these actions and stand up to this intimidation, hatred, and intolerance.  Protecting The Great Lakes  On August 7th, the Army Corps of Engineers released the long awaited Brandon Road Study. This important report provides guidance from the Army Corps of Engineers to Congress and residents of the Great Lakes region on how to best protect the Great Lakes.  While the release of the Brandon Road Study is a positive step, now is when the hard work begins. Republicans and Democrats must work in a bipartisan manner to craft policy solutions that preserve the Great Lakes ecosystem as well as the Great Lakes economy. I encourage West Michigan residents to engage in this process by participating in the public comment period.   How to get involved: On September 14th, the Army Corps of Engineers will host a public forum on the Brandon Roady Study from 3:30 to 6:30 PM at Muskegon Community College's Collegiate Hall located at 221 S. Quarterline Road in Muskegon.  To view the Brandon Road Study, click here.   Around The District  Throughout August, I have been traveling across West Michigan to hear from job creators and constituents.  Here are some examples of how I am working to represent the Second District.  In Zeeland, I toured Woodward Inc, where they manufacture top of the line components for the F-35, our nation's next generation aircraft. In Spring Lake, I gave a legislative update to the Grand Haven, Spring Lake, and Ferrysburg Chamber of Commerce. In Ravenna, I toured Metal Technologies' Foundry to see first-hand the incredible precision and skill that defines ""Made in Michigan."" I also met with Jackson Riegler, a student entrepreneur at Muskegon Catholic Central, who is putting his innovative mind to work to support the Great Lakes.   In Wyoming, I sat down with WKTV Host Ken Norris to provide residents of Wyoming and Kentwood with an update on my efforts to protect the Great Lakes, improve results for West Michigan veterans, and how my work on the Financial Services Committee impacts West Michigan. During the interview, I also addressed the need for the Senate to revisit health care reform with a conservative approach that restores choice and lowers cost. You can watch the wide-ranging discussion here.     The Michigan Minute
	•	A True Statemen: Former Congressman Vern Ehlers passes away at age 83
	•	Jobs: Maker of eco-friendly food cart creating jobs, investing $13M in Walker
	•	West Michigan produces 29 of fastest-growing private companies in US

8/17/17 18:38,Forum: Standing Up For Our Immigrant Community," 
￼ 
 

Dear Friend,
This week, East Bay residents Maria and Eusebio Sanchez were forced to say goodbye to their three daughters, their home, and the community they have lived in for more than twenty years.
Their deportation is a devastating blow to our community. Maria and Eusebio are model neighbors and friends. Maria has dedicated her life to caring for cancer and cardiac patients at Highland Hospital. Eusebio has worked as a truck driver for the last twelve years. Just last year, they fulfilled their dream of purchasing a home in Oakland. In their spare time, they give back to our community. 
But despite their contributions, ICE rejected our calls for compassion and targeted Maria and Eusebio for deportation. I am saddened beyond words by this decision, but my commitment to protecting our immigrant community remains unshaken. 
Next week, I will be holding a community forum to discuss this administration’s enforcement and deportation policies, as well as next steps for immigration reform. I hope you and your family will be able to join me for this important discussion. Immigration experts and translators will also attend to contribute to our conversation.
The forum will take place next Tuesday, August 22nd from 6:00 - 7:30 pm in the International Community School Gymnasium at 2825 International Blvd, Oakland, CA 94601.
As always, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me on twitter, facebook, via email, or in person to let me know your thoughts.
Take care, 
￼

Dear Friend,
As your Congresswoman, I am here to serve you. That includes not only representing your views in Congress, but also providing a number of services for you.
I wanted to share an update on some of the things my district office staff can do for you, including:
	•	Help with a federal agency
	•	Recognize outstanding public achievements with a Congressional Commendation
	•	Assist with a U.S. passport
Here are just a few recent examples of what we have been able to do for Ventura County residents
	•	Miguel R., a county employee and community services coordinator, contacted my office for assistance because his employment would be in jeopardy if he were to lose his work permit that was issued through his DACA status. My office contacted U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for an expedited review of his application, and within two weeks his work permit was renewed.  
	•	Bill S., a 94-year-old veteran who lives in Thousand Oaks, reached out to my office because he had been notified that a major debt was established in his name by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). By his calculation, he thought he should owe much less than the VA claimed. My office contacted the Debt Management Center and the VA Regional Office, and the VAs error was recognized and corrected.  
	•	Andrea R. of Newbury Park reached out to our office because she had been denied disability benefits by the Social Security Administration despite suffering from systemic lupus, fibromyalgia, and other serious conditions. My office contacted the agency to request a thorough review of her case, and pushed for an expedited evaluation as she was very ill and suffering financial hardship. After further review of her appeal and additional documentation, Andrea was finally approved for disability and healthcare benefits.
If you or someone you know needs assistance, please reach out to my office by calling (805) 379-1779.
This month, I have and will continue to meet with constituents and visit local employers throughout Ventura County. I look forward to continuing to see as many of you as possible across the region in the next few weeks, and hearing whats important to you and your family.
For more information on my work in Congress and in the district, like my Facebook page to see updates, and dont forget to sign up to receive my newsletter.
It is my honor to serve you.

￼

In January, I invited U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry to visit Central Washington, and I am pleased that he accepted my invitation. This week, I had the pleasure of welcoming Secretary Perry and visiting the Hanford Site and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. 
McNary Lock and Dam
￼
The first stop on the tour was at the McNary Lock and Dam on the Columbia River. Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR) and I hosted Secretary Perry and spoke with him about the importance of hydropower development. The Secretary agreed that hydropower will continue to play an important role in our nation’s energy strategy. McNary Dam has been generating clean, renewable power for the Pacific Northwest since 1957, which is marketed by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). I, along with Rep. Walden and 48 other colleagues, sent a letter to the House Budget Committee requesting that the transmission assets of Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs), like the BPA, remained public, so we can continue to provide efficient and affordable power to regions like Central Washington.   
￼
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
 ￼
I am glad that Secretary Perry got to visit the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) for a first-hand look at the critical scientific contributions and developments that make it a “crown jewel” of our National Lab system. The scientists and researchers at PNNL are on the front lines of clean energy solutions for America, but they have also greatly contributed to our national defense, especially in areas of nuclear non-proliferation, cyber security, and energy grid security.  I am committed to supporting the Lab's ability to continue this important work that benefits our energy security and our national security. 
￼  ￼  Photos courtesy of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
HAMMER Training Facility
￼
We stopped by the Volpentest Hazardous Materials Management and Emergency Response (HAMMER) Federal Training Center to hear about the important training the facility provides to ensure that the cleanup effort at Hanford is implemented safely. HAMMER provides training for our military, Hanford Site workers, Homeland Security personnel, and emergency responders. The work they do is critical to keep employees safe as they continue to work on the Hanford cleanup project, and I am pleased that we were able to observe the hands-on training.
Hanford
￼
Ensuring funding for the cleanup of Hanford is one of my top priorities in Congress. Secretary Perry, Rep. Walden, and I had the opportunity to tour the Site and address the workers to thank them for the work they do to continue the cleanup effort. I am grateful that Secretary Perry expressed his strong support and that he was able to witness the progress being made and the unique challenges we face first-hand. The federal government has a legal and moral obligation to see this through. 
￼
Thank you for taking the time to read this e-news update so that I can keep you informed of my work on behalf of Central Washington.

August 17, 2017
Dear Lindsey,
          So many of us remember learning about lunar and solar eclipses in grade school and we had friends who wanted to be astronauts or scientists. In just a few days, well get the opportunity to once again sit in a science classroom and learn about the heavens above us.
          On August 21, 2017, our great outdoors will be host to a science lesson of epic proportions. I remember the solar eclipse that came through Montana when I was a junior at Bozeman High. I can still remember how it became so quiet until the dogs started barking.
          Though many Montanans may remember the 1979 total solar eclipse that covered Big Sky country, for the first time in 99 years, a total solar eclipse will travel coast-to-coast across the lower 48. In the direct path of totality, the moon will completely cover the sun, but even for observers outside this path, a partial solar eclipse will be viewed.
          As states in the path of totality begin preparing for the eclipse and the millions of visitors expected to visit their communities, safety remains of the utmost importance. Make sure youre off the roads and in a safe spot when the eclipse happens  and if you plan to look at the eclipse, be sure you have the right protective eye wear.  And if you wont be in a good place to see the eclipse, NASA will live stream the eclipse here. I look forward to hearing about your eclipse experiences!
          As always, I encourage you to contact my office to express your concerns or opinions on policy issues important to you. And if were not already connected on social media, I invite you to follow my daily updates on Facebook.
          Its my number one priority in Congress to represent the values and interests of the people of Montana, and your input is very helpful as I do. I also invite you to visit my website, www.daines.senate.gov, so we can stay in close touch.
Best Wishes,

8/17/17 13:54,Let's End Lunch Shaming Nationwide,"￼
￼
￼
 
Having trouble seeing this e-mail? Click here to read it on my blog.
Dear Lindsey,
Earlier this year, New Mexico became the first state in the nation to ban the practice known as “lunch shaming.” We can all be proud of the coalition of state lawmakers and advocates who championed the Hunger-Free Students’ Bill of Rights, which prohibits schools from publicly singling out or punishing students – even withholding regular school lunch – because a parent or guardian hasn’t paid a school meal bill.
But in nearly half of all U.S. school districts, school officials still are allowed to punish students by forcing them to wear wristbands, assigning them chores, and even making a display of taking away a meal from a child after it has been served. 
￼
It’s time to ban lunch shaming everywhere, and that’s why I’m leading bipartisan legislation in Congress to prohibit this practice nationwide. We can’t expect our kids to succeed in the classroom when they’re hungry and face public embarrassment at the hands of school officials. And this week, as kids head back to school in New Mexico, I’m again speaking out.
Instead of lifting up all students, lunch shaming accomplishes the exact opposite. Singling out students whose parents are unable to pay stigmatizes the most vulnerable kids. Extra school chores take students away from schoolwork and classmates. And, worst of all, the practice can stand in the way of a child’s only healthy meal of the day.
Ultimately, states and school districts must take the lead. But because they have been slow to act, I believe the federal government should step in and do what it can to prevent this practice. My Anti-Lunch Shaming Act would ban schools nationwide from using public shaming tactics against children by:
	•	Explicitly prohibiting schools from forcing kids to wear wristbands or hand stamps, requiring chores, or throwing a child’s meal away because their parent or guardian hasn’t paid a school meal bill; and 
	•	Requiring schools to direct any communications about meal debt to the parent or guardian, and not to the child.
And because every child who needs a school meal should get one – even if they don’t have the money to pay for it – the bill also would take steps to simplify and improve the process for applying for free and reduced-price lunch.
￼
In the United States, 13 million children live in households struggling with food insecurity; and in New Mexico, it’s nearly one in three. We should be doing everything we can to change that terrible statistic. Let’s put an end to lunch shaming once and for all. And let’s devote our energy to building a future where every child can concentrate on learning – without worrying about his or her next meal.
Cheers,
￼

The Great Flood of 2016 | One Year Later
It's hard to believe that a year has gone by since devastating rains brought about the historic flood event affecting so many people across Louisiana.  We are working each and every day to help our many neighbors, friends and family who are still in need, and we are urging state leaders to accelerate the speed with which the nearly $2 billion of federal recovery money we helped secure in congress is getting into the hands of flood victims. 
This week, we welcomed HUD Secretary Ben Carson to the Capital Region to meet with local leaders, flood victims and other organizations to discuss the region's flood recovery efforts, housing challenges (including persistent homelessness) and other issues affecting our area to ensure the Secretary and his team have full visibility to the needs here on the ground. Read more. 
Some flood victims and area residents are losing hope that they'll ever see the completion of the Comite River Diversion Canal. I recently caught up with WBRZ Channel 2 to explain why I am not - watch the video below:

Red Snapper Act of 2017
Gulf Coast anglers are enjoying this year's expanded red snapper season, but a permanent solution is still needed to ensure lasting access to the fishery. We recently introduced bipartisan legislation providing that solution. Our bill is a conservation based approach that will allow states to work with the feds to expand access for recreational fishing.

Flexibility for Flood Victims
Last week, we announced that HUD granted Louisiana waivers to provide more flexibility to help ALL flood victims, not just some. We're still seeking additional waivers from HUD along with policy changes that could free up more money and cut through red tape - this topic has been part of ongoing discussions with Secretary Carson.

8/17/17 12:05,Rounds Report: Legislation to Improve Post-9/11 GI Bill Education Benefits for Veterans Signed Into Law," 
 
￼
 
     
 

Legislation to Improve Post-9/11 GI Bill Education Benefits for Veterans Signed Into Law August 17, 2017
Yesterday, President Trump signed into law the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, which includes three provisions I introduced. Our veterans have made incredible sacrifices for our country, and they should be able to fully use the benefits they've been promised when they enter civilian life. Our bipartisan legislation will make improvements to the Post-9/11 GI Bill, and I'm pleased that it was signed into law. 
The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 makes much-needed updates for reservists, Purple Heart recipients, veterans who face school closures while enrolled and surviving family members. The legislation also provides increased resources and authority for educational assistance to pursue science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs, computer programming and career technical training.
Most significantly, this bill recognizes our country’s need for an agile and adaptable workforce and that American workers need to be lifelong learners. For that purpose, this bill eliminates the arbitrary 15-year period within which a veteran is required to use their GI Bill so they can use their benefits at any time in their professional career.
The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 includes the following provisions that I introduced:
	•	A bill I introduced with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to add all Purple Heart recipients, regardless of length of time spent on active duty, to the list of eligible veterans who can access full Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits was included in the bill. 
	•	The Veterans TEST Accessibility Act, introduced by me and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), to help returning veterans transition into civilian life by making sure they aren’t forced to exhaust a full month of GI Bill benefits in order to be reimbursed for a low-cost certification or test. 
	•	A provision to allow for more flexibility in allocating Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to survivors of deceased service members.
The legislation is named in honor of Harry Walter Colmery, an Army Air Service veteran and former national commander of the American Legion who drafted the original GI Bill in 1944 to improve the transition for World War II veterans back to civilian life.

8/17/17 11:06,Beyond resistance: Keeping dark money out of politics,"Update | Thursday, August 17, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 20th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: campaign finance reform.
“Dark” special interest money is a direct threat to our democracy. The Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in Citizens United v. FEC was a radical step toward unraveling the modest campaign finance controls that were in place, and escalated the campaign spending arms race.
Citizens and their issues are drowned out by hundreds of millions of dollars that have been spent on political campaigns, with no limits, transparency, or accountability. The numbers don’t lie. In the 2008 election cycle, before the Citizens United ruling, outside spending accounted for $338 million. In 2016, six years post-decision, outside spending was at $1.4 billion. That’s a 300 percent increase.
Corporations are not people. We must keep dark money out of politics, and make elections and campaigns about the people’s issues. That is why I am a strong advocate for the following three critical bills:
	•	H.J.Res. 48: Amends the U.S. Constitution to provide that the rights extended by the Constitution are the rights of natural persons only, not corporations.
	•	H.J.Res. 31, the Democracy for All amendment: Amends the U.S. Constitution to reverse highly controversial Supreme Court decisions, like Citizens United v. FEC and McCutcheon v. FEC, which have given corporations and America’s wealthiest donors the right to buy unlimited influence in our elections.
	•	H.R. 1134, the DISCLOSE Act: Requires all corporations, unions, and Super PACs to report to the FEC within 24 hours of making a $10,000 campaign expenditure and requires that corporations paying for public communications and advertisements are publicly disclosed.
We need to make sure that people have faith that their government works for them. Without rolling back Citizens United and enacting broader campaign finance reform, this will be difficult to achieve.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here.

Courage, 
￼

Congressman Smith's E-news: August 16, 2017
   ￼   We had a great conversation last week on agriculture policy and the rural economy at the Steffens' dairy near Humboldt. I was grateful for the invitation to tour their operation and talk with more than 25 Nebraskans representing numerous industries.  
Reflecting on Charlottesville   The hatred and violence in Charlottesville over the weekend was horrifying. We know it does not represent the America we love.   Events fueled by racist hatred have no place in our society. Every human being deserves to be treated with respect, and discrimination is always unacceptable. Our nation was founded on the promise we are all created equal and endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights.   I oppose violence, racism, and white nationalism in the strongest possible terms.   The United States must lead by example and ensure every human being is treated with the respect human life commands. I remain committed to working with my colleagues in the House of Representatives to serve all Americans and help bring our country together.    A stronger Social Security   Social Security is a large portion of many Americans' retirement incomes, and Congress is working on a number of solutions to strengthen the program and increase efficiency for beneficiaries.    At the end of June, I joined Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee Chairman Sam Johnson of Texas in introducing the Providing Choice for Social Security Retirees Act. This bill would provide Social Security Old-Age (OASI) beneficiaries the option to claim a portion of their delayed retirement credit in a one-time, partial lump sum.    A modernized Social Security should allow seniors to make their own retirement decisions rather than pressure them to conform to a one-size-fits-all program. This additional option ensures seniors who choose to remain in the workforce beyond their full retirement age have greater flexibility to determine how they access their benefits. Workers have paid taxes into Social Security with the expectation their benefits will be there in retirement, and they should be able to choose the method of receiving these benefits which best suits their needs.  Another crucial part of strengthening Social Security is preventing fraud and abuse. I am a cosponsor of the Social Security Disability Insurance and Unemployment Benefits Double Dip Elimination Act to prevent beneficiaries from receiving Social Security disability benefits and unemployment benefits at the same time. This is an important step to preserve Social Security disability benefits for those who truly are unable to work.  Unfortunately, fraud committed by those entrusted to administer Social Security benefits is also a concern. One example made the headlines earlier this year when Social Security Administration (SSA) Administrative Law Judge David Daugherty and Kentucky disability lawyer Eric Conn pleaded guilty in a scam involving $550 million in fraudulent SSA disability claims. As a judge with the responsibility to decide disability claims on behalf of the SSA, Mr. Daugherty admitted to accepting more than $600,000 in cash in exchange for awarding benefits in more than 3,000 cases brought forth by Mr. Conn.  Despite his guilty plea, the SSA still did not have the authority to revoke Mr. Daugherty's retirement benefits. Under current law, Mr. Daugherty could only lose these benefits if convicted of criminal offenses related to treason and espionage. To close this loophole, I cosponsored the Holding SSA Employees Accountable Act to prohibit SSA employees convicted of a felony related to their official job duties from receiving their federal retirement benefits.  Addressing Social Security fraud is not just about going after those who have broken the law but also protecting current and future beneficiaries. When benefits are paid to ineligible individuals, it reduces resources for those who truly need access to these benefits and frustrates taxpayers who are expected to foot the bill.  In addition to protecting Social Security funds from fraud, we are also working to ensure the safety of Americans' personal information. Ten years ago, the Office of Management and Budget issued a memo requiring all federal departments and agencies to eliminate the unnecessary use of Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and look into alternative methods of identification. A report issued in July shows some progress has been made, but we still have a long way to go.  This is why I cosponsored legislation last Congress, which was signed into law, to remove SSNs from Medicare cards. On the Ways and Means Committee, we continue to work on ways to cut down on the use of SSNs in government and employer documentation.  We have a lot of important work to do to shore up Social Security and protect beneficiaries. By cutting down on fraud and providing more choices to retirees, we can create a stronger Social Security which better serves the American workforce.   Farm Bill listening tour   At my Farm Bill listening sessions in Scottsbluff, Aurora, Broken Bow, and Beatrice, I have appreciated the opportunity to hear directly from producers on what they feel is or is not working in the current Farm Bill. I have already started communicating their feedback to some of my colleagues in Congress.   Next Wednesday, I will host another Farm Bill listening session in South Sioux City:  August 23: South Sioux City Farm Bill listening session City Hall 1615 1st Avenue, South Sioux City 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. (CDT)  Information about the Farm Bill Listening Tour is available on my website at AdrianSmith.house.gov/FarmBillTour.   If you have any questions, please contact my Grand Island office at (308) 384-3900.  As always, feel free to forward my e-newsletter to family and friends, or let them know they can sign up to receive updates from my office on my website at AdrianSmith.house.gov.   Wishing you clear and spectacular eclipse viewing on Monday! ￼  ADRIAN SMITH Member of Congress

12th Annual Eagle Scout Recognition Ceremony

Each year I host an Eagle Scout Recognition Ceremony at the National Boy Scouts of America headquarters in Irving.

The rank of Eagle Scout is the highest achievement awarded by the Boy Scouts of America and requires earning at least 21 merit badges over many years and completion of the Eagle Scout Service Project. 

This year, we honored 62 young men that achieved the rank of Eagle Scout from around the 24th Congressional District. Over 200 friends and family were on hand to recognize this incredible achievement that they will carry with them for the rest of their lives.

EVENT PHOTOS HERE
￼

￼

During the ceremony, each participant is announced by name and given the opportunity to explain their Eagle Scout Service Project. They're presented with a flag that was flown over the United States Capitol for each of them and a congressional certificate of recognition. 

VIEW THE FULL LIST OF PARTICIPANTS HERE

Special thanks to this year's keynote speaker, Don McChesney, Assistant Chief Scout Executive/ National Director of Field Service for Boy Scouts of America.
￼


As the father of an Eagle Scout, I've seen first-hand the hard work and dedication that it takes to receive this great award. A scout consistently puts others before themselves and I applaud the commitment they've made in service to our North Texas community. 

These young men truly exemplify the Scout Law: A Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent. 
￼

 Join me in congratulating each and every one of these young men for their tremendous accomplishment. We have a lot to be proud of in North Texas.

We have continued to receive good news about federal funding for our local priorities.  I was pleased to see the NATIVE Act, legislation we wrote in 2015, result in funding to the Manoa Heritage Center for Hawaiian language preservation.  The Kohala Center on Hawai‘i Island was also awarded almost $650,000 to help maintain and restore the Kawaihae watershed, and Partners in Development Foundation will receive $250,000 for their support of the We Are Oceania Halau Ola One-Stop Center.
I spent yesterday on Molokai for our town hall meeting.  While there, I visited the Molokai Community Health Center and talked with The Nature Conservancy about their reforestation and environmental protection efforts.
Last week, I appreciated the opportunity to speak to over 100 new U.S. citizens and their families at their naturalization ceremony in Honolulu.  I also joined the graduates of the 2017 Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard Apprentice Program to celebrate this major accomplishment.
As always, please contact my office in D.C. or Hawai‘i if there is anything we can do.  We are here to help.

Mahalo,




 Brian Schatz
United States Senator



Hearing from Molokai
Senator Schatz hosted a town hall meeting yesterday at the Kualapuu Community Center on Molokai to hear from residents and answer questions.  Comments or questions for Senator Schatz are always accepted via our website or by phone.

Revitalizing Native Languages
Senator Schatz announced that the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) will award $90,000 to the Manoa Heritage Center in Honolulu through a new Native American language revitalization initiative. The funding, which will be matched dollar for dollar through a partnership with the First Nations Development Institute, will support programs and initiatives that aim to preserve and revitalize Hawaiian language, history, and culture.  As a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Senator Schatz has led federal efforts to support the conservation of Native American languages. In 2015, he authored the Native American Tourism and Improving Visitor Experience (NATIVE) Act in order to enhance and integrate native tourism, empower native communities, and expand unique cultural tourism opportunities in the United States. A component of this legislation, which was signed into law last year, directed federal dollars towards Native American language preservation.

8/16/17 16:46,Why In-Person Town Halls Are So Important," 
￼
 

August 16, 2017
 
Dear Friends,   There's a lot going on as we approach the end of Summer, but I wanted to check in with you and catch you up on the latest news in our neck of the woods.  OUR 13TH IN-PERSON TOWN HALL OF THE YEAR:
In-person town halls are an important way for us to stay connected, and when I first got elected, I made the promise to hold an in-person town hall for every county in the district. And I'm proud to have kept that promise. As a result, I host more of them than 98% of Congress. From our $20 trillion national debt, to the threat of ISIS, to our mangled tax code, and so many other issues, it's critical that we get the chance to chat face to face. Even if we don't always agree, we can discuss important issues of the day in a respectful way. Thanks to everyone who came out to our Polk County town hall in Dresser!
Click HERE or the image below to see more from our latest town hall!

CONGRATULATIONS TO BARBARA REYELTS!
Barbara Reyelts of Duluth's KBJR served northern Wisconsin and Minnesota for 38 years as a journalist and news director, and now has decided to retire. Thank you, Barbara, for bringing the news to northern Wisconsin for so many years, and congrats on your retirement!

PHOTO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich leads a group of young students on a hike at Pecos National Historical Park, August 10, 2017.
August 16, 2017
Dear Friend,
Our national parks and public lands are outdoor classrooms with endless opportunities to learn and make memories. Last week, I enjoyed leading a group of young students from northern New Mexico on a hike in Pecos National Historical Park. We enjoyed taking in all of the beautiful scenery and learning about important history that took place in the park.
New Mexico Kids Share Why They Love The Outdoors
￼
I introduced bipartisan legislation last month with Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) to encourage kids and their families to get outdoors and experience America's public lands. The Every Kid Outdoors Act would make permanent the Every Kid in a Park started by President Obama to offer fourth graders and their families free entrance to all federally managed public lands, waters, and historic sites, including national parks - more than 2,000 sites in all.
The Every Kid in a Park initiative was an incredibly successful program for our public lands. It inspired $2 million in private donations and volunteer hours, and created hundreds of partnerships with schools, non-profits, and private sector businesses to support outdoor education programming and recreation opportunities for underserved youth. The program was part of the campaign to commemorate the Centennial of the National Park Service, which led to record-setting visitation numbers. 
I discussed the Every Kid Outdoors Act on KUNM's The Children's Hour. You can listen here to learn more about the bill and hear some good ideas for places to hike with children in New Mexico. 
Connecting our kids to the outdoors can inspire a lifelong connection to conservation. Families in New Mexico have long histories of using our public lands for hiking, hunting, fishing and other outdoor traditions, both new and old. If we can teach our children to love our public lands, they will work to protect them for their kids and future generations.
Sincerely,
￼

￼


 
Dear Lindsey,
Over the past few months, communities across the state spoke out and shared examples of how the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program has made a difference in the lives of Wisconsin families. 
In Grant County, CDBG investments helped construct a new fire station, renovate a decommissioned elementary school building into a new public library and improve a village hall to be handicap accessible. 
In Racine, CDGB funding has been critical for local job training efforts, helping 33 Wisconsinites receive training in building trades, 30 young workers receive job skills trainings and teach 25 young Wisconsinites basic job skills in 2016.
In Appleton, CDBG funds have provided services for individuals with mental illness and job training for 170 individuals recovering from substance abuse. 
There are so many more success stories of how CDBG investments help drive economic development and opportunity throughout Wisconsin. That is why I led the fight in the Senate to reverse President Trump’s proposed budget cuts and restore funding for the CDBG program.
I saw firsthand how CDBG can help change lives in our state when I delivered a care package from Meals-on-Wheels in Kenosha, toured a Boys-and-Girls Club in La Crosse and visited a YouthBuild chapter in Milwaukee.
Then, as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I led a group of 42 of my colleagues in calling to maintain full federal funding for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Community Development Block Grant program in the Fiscal Year 2018. 
Because of our advocacy, full funding for the CDBG program was included in the FY2018 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill. This bipartisan legislation passed the Appropriations Committee and is now moving forward to the full Senate for a vote.
I am proud we successfully worked to reverse drastic cuts and restore full funding for the CDBG program. Together, we can continue to invest in our communities and make a difference in the lives of families throughout Wisconsin.
Sincerely,
￼
U.S. Senator for Wisconsin

August 16, 2017
Dear Friends,
Let's talk climate: the bad news and the solutions. Just last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) confirmed that 2016 was the hottest year on record since tracking began 137 years ago. The same report found that greenhouse gas concentrations and sea levels are the highest since record keeping began. 
I make it a point to bring you stellar speakers at town halls. This one is no exception. I hope you will join me for my next “Conversation about America: Climate Change.” It's scheduled for Wednesday, August 30, 2017 from 7 to 8 pm at the San Francisco Zoo. I will be joined by renowned climate change expert and UC Berkeley Professor Dr. Daniel Kammen and Impossible Foods CEO Pat Brown. 
￼
Here in California, we don't question that climate change is real and the result of human activity. In fact, four out of five Californians say it’s a serious threat to our state, and two out of three Californians say they favor state efforts independent of the federal government to address climate change even if it brings increased costs. Here in San Mateo County, we are keenly aware that we are at ground zero for sea level rise, with $24 billion in assets at risk. Unless we can slow climate change, residences, small businesses, the airport and much of San Francisco to Santa Clara counties would be flooded or underwater within decades.
Dr. Kammen teaches at UC Berkeley's Energy and Resources Group, the Goldman School of Public Policy and the department of Nuclear Engineering. He has written 12 books and more than 300 peer-reviewed journal publications. He has testified at over 40 congressional briefings and provided various governments with more than 50 technical reports. He has also contributed to numerous reports of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change. The IPCC shared the Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore in 2007.
Impossible Foods is a Redwood City-based startup that makes plant-based burgers. Pat Brown, the CEO and Stanford biochemistry professor emeritus, founded the company to reduce the environmental impact of the food system. Beef production has the highest water use, land use and greenhouse gas emissions of any livestock system. An Impossible Foods burger reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 7/8 compared to a beef burger.
With this outstanding panel, we will be discussing everything from President Trump’s announcement that the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris Agreement, to measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that California has adopted, to solutions in the private sector focused on keeping our planet livable. 
A Conversation about America: Climate Change  Wednesday, August 30, 2017 7-8 pm San Francisco Zoo Sloat Blvd. at The Great Highway San Francisco, CA 94132 RSVP Here! REGISTER ONE PERSON PER RSVP
Due to the size of the room, seating is limited to 200 people, so please sign up early and please sign up one person per RSVP. You will have to bring your paper or electronic ticket to the event to be admitted. If you are unable to sign up, it means that the event is at capacity. However, you can watch it live on my Facebook page where it will be streamed and you will have opportunities to attend future town halls.

8/16/17 12:51,new update:,"￼ 

Lindsey - It’s been busy these past several weeks. Here’s a new update on how I’m Making Government Work for Sacramento County:


Supporting an Updated GI Bill to Help Our Veterans

As a doctor who has helped care for veterans, I’ve seen their sacrifices firsthand. They deserve nothing less than our full and unwavering support.

That’s why I supported the largest update to the GI Bill in 10 years to ensure our veterans get the benefits and services they deserve.

￼
At the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Mather Veterans Village, which is now providing housing and support services for many local veterans in need.

This bill enhances veterans’ benefits and provides quicker processing to get vets the help they deserve. It removes time limits for veterans to claim benefits, helps vets pursue science, technology, engineering and math degrees, and increases benefits for thousands of Reservists and National Guard members.

Making government work for our vets is core to my job. If you or someone you know is a local veteran who needs help with backlogged benefits or health care, please contact my office for help. We’ve helped recover more than $2 million owed to local veterans and have also helped more than 2,000 individual veterans and service members in our area. We’d be honored to help you, too.

Please call us at (916) 635-0505 or visit bera.house.gov/helpforvets to learn more.



New Infrastructure Upgrades at Mather Airport

I’m pleased to announce a $3.74 million federal grant to make infrastructure upgrades at Mather Airport. Mather is a crucial part of our area’s aviation and cargo infrastructure. These upgrades will help our economy become more efficient.

Please click here to learn more about it.

￼
I was at the Mather airport recently to announce the new infrastructure upgrades.

This will help resurface pavement and upgrade drainage systems, improving safety and efficiency. This is great news for our community and I look forward to seeing the improvements soon.

We need to get back to the bipartisan American tradition of investing in our future. Improving our infrastructure will help modernize our economy, help our businesses, and make our communities safer.

Please click here to learn more about how I’m working to Improve our Infrastructure.



Working with Republicans and Democrats to Keep America Safe

As the Vice Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I know we live in challenging times. Russia, Iran, and North Korea present significant challenges to peace and stability around the world. Both parties need to work together to defend our values at home and abroad, and confront our adversaries when they threaten our nation or our interests.

That’s why I was glad to support a bipartisan bill to impose tough new sanctions on Russia, Iran, and North Korea.

￼
With my colleagues in the Foreign Affairs Committee, led by Republican Chairman Ed Royce from California.

Russia’s attempts in 2016 to sway our elections cannot be tolerated. This bipartisan bill responds to Russia by imposing additional sanctions on the country while preventing President Trump from repealing sanctions against Russia without Congressional approval. 

The bill also will greatly improve our ability to counter and contain Iranian threats and aggression in the region. Finally, this bill continues to put pressure on the North Korean regime and those who do business with them. By targeting their missile program and financial sector, it will help drive North Korea back to the negotiating table so we can resolve this crisis peacefully.

Please click here to learn more about how I’m working to Strengthen America’s Security and Global Leadership.


Making government work for you is core to my job. Please always feel free to contact me to share your views.

8/16/17 12:08,The Hill Op-Ed: North Korea's actions show more resources need to be put into  missile defense,"￼
August 16, 2017 
 

The Hill Op-Ed: North Korea's actions show more resources need to be put into missile defense
By Congressman Doug Lambron 
North Korea's saber rattling and over-the-top rhetoric is not new, but Kim Jong-un's fanatical focus on developing nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of ranging the United States and our allies should redouble our efforts to focus on missile defense. To be clear, North Korea cannot be a state with the capability to employ a nuclear weapon in the first place, but we have to prepare for all contingencies.
First, diplomacy is critical as we continue to work with our allies to rebut rhetoric and get Jon-un's regime to the negotiating table. Second, recent support by China and efforts by the United Nations Security Council to sanction and restrict access to the capital that funds Jong-un's missile program is promising. China holds the most sway with Jong-un as it is the lifeline to North Korea's depressed economy. Third, Congress must appropriately fund missile defense. Should diplomacy fail and Jong-un makes an ill-fated attempt to attack the United States or our allies, we must stand ready to provide an effective defense system.
As a member of the House Armed Services Committee and the Co-Chair of the House Missile Defense Caucus, I fully support and advocate to my colleagues the need for critical investment in missile defense. The House recently passed, with bipartisan support, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (NDAA) and James Mattis Appropriations Act. Both bills provided much needed support for missile defense programs that were consistently underfunded and neglected during the Obama administration.
In the past decade, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) suffered at 23 percent decline in their topline funding from $11 billion to $8.4 billion to the detriment of both fielded systems and ongoing research and development. This trend must stop if we are going to take missile defense seriously. MDA should be funded with a topline of no less than $10 billion.
While Jong-un attempts to ratchet up current tensions, we must remain steadfast and focused on the following areas of missile defense:
Promotion of regional defenses with our allies South Korea and Japan, including the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system; the Aegis ballistic missile defense system; and the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 anti-missile system. 
The Department of Defense (DoD) should continue to install and evolve the interceptors in Alaska on schedule.
Congress should continue to fund and DoD should work towards a Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV) and the Multi-Object Kill Vehicle (MOKV) to address advanced enemy missile designs that may become a reality in the near future.
Further, it should continue its plans to field the updated Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) in Alaska. This program will provide the necessary discrimination for ground based interceptors to find, fix, and track an enemy missile.
Next, DoD must continue to research and develop directed energy solutions. Directed energy offers a cost effective offset to counter an adversary's expensive missile programs and offers the ability to destroy an enemy missile when at its most vulnerable stage in the boost phase.
As authorized in the House's NDAA, our future missile defense must include a space-based layer. There is no better place to track and assess an enemy's missile than in space.   
Given the current pace of North Korea's missile development program, now is not the time to second guess our fail-safe to prevent an enemy missile from threatening our homeland. In the past few months, the MDA has conducted successful tests of both the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems. While I respect the views of critics to the effectiveness of missile defense tests, we cannot slow the development and deployment of these systems to satisfy criticisms. As my colleagues in the Senate prepare to debate the NDAA, I urge them to provide strong support for our collective defense from the missile threat by matching the House's funding for missile defense.

A LEGISLATIVE UPDATE FOR NEW YORK'S 14th DISTRICT 
Dear Friends,
I wanted to take a moment during the summer district work period to give you an update on some of the work I’ve been doing on your behalf in Congress and in our community. Rest assured, that making life better for New York families is and will continue to be my number one priority.
Click through the links below to learn more about the legislation I’ve either authored or co-sponsored, and be sure to visit my website and follow me on social media for regular updates.
Sincerely, ￼

FIGHTING AIRPLANE NOISE
￼
As a member of the bipartisan Quiet Skies Caucus, I was proud to co-sponsor the Airplane Impacts Mitigation (AIM) Act. This bill orders a study to be conducted on the impact of prolonged airplane noise in our communities. We need to know the health effects that airports like La Guardia have on the surrounding areas so we can work with the FAA to find solutions to ease the burden for those affected. 
IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES
￼
Kalief Browder was a young man from the Bronx who was incarcerated for three years, often in solitary confinement, without any formal charges brought against him. After being released, the trauma from the experience made it overwhelmingly hard for him to readjust, and he took his own life in 2015. Unfortunately, Kalief’s story is all too common. In an effort to change this, I worked with mental health advocates and experts to write the Kalief Browder Re-Entry Success Act. It would create a pilot program to assess the mental health of prisoners before they leave prison and provide continuity of mental health and other community services after release.
ADDRESSING THE LOOMING DOCTOR SHORTAGE
￼
We’re facing a looming doctor shortage in the U.S., a problem that will make it difficult for families to get the care and service they need. This is in large part due to an outdated “residency cap” – while more and more people go to medical school, the amount of slots for on-the-job training isn’t growing to match that. That's why I re-introduced The Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act, a bipartisan bill that would expand the current cap on the number of Medicare-supported training slots for doctors.
EXPANDING TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS
￼
Increased connectivity is critical to the future growth of cities like New York and programs like Citi Bike are vital to meeting the needs of those communities that have long been underserved by viable transportation options. The Bike to Work Act is a piece of bipartisan legislation I authored that would allow workers to use their pre-tax commuter benefits for bike share programs, making it more accessible to ride to work.
FIGHTING FOR $15
￼
Simply put: Americans deserve a living wage and stable employment. Ensuring $15 an hour is a crucial first step to building a robust economy where Americans who work full time can support their families and not worry about living in poverty or working multiple jobs just to make ends meet. As an original co-sponsor of the Raise the Wage Act, I will continue to push hard for a vote on this crucial piece of legislation.
PROVIDING GREEN CARDS FOR UNDOCUMENTED 9/11 WORKERS
￼
When the towers fell, it didn’t matter who you were or where you came from – we were all New Yorkers. Those who did the painstaking work of cleaning up and rebuilding ground zero are heroes, but unfortunately, the Trump administration doesn’t see it that way. That’s why I introduced The 9/11 Immigrant Worker Freedom Act, which will protect these workers from the fear of being deported by providing them a path to achieving legal status.
PROTECTING THE RIGHT TO VOTE
￼
I’m proud to co-author the Citizenship Empowerment Act, legislation that requires all newly sworn-in U.S. citizens be uniformly provided voter registration forms at naturalization ceremonies. This will help new citizens, from day one, become engaged in one of the most important facets of American life: voting. We must also renew our commitment to ensure that every voter is able to participate in our democracy to the fullest extent. That's why I was also pleased to join my colleagues in introducing the Voting Rights Advancement Act, legislation to restore full protections to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
GETTING MONEY OUT OF POLITICS
￼

The voices of corporations, special interest groups, and the super-wealthy should not drown out the voices of everyday Americans. That’s why I’m proud to be a long-time co-sponsor of the Democracy for All Amendment, which would reverse destructive Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United.
HELPING WORKING FAMILIES AFFORD CHILD CARE
￼
When child care costs exceed rent, mortgage payments, and college tuition, affording care isn’t just a struggle for New York families, it’s nearly impossible. I recently re-introduced The Children First Act, which will expand access to quality, affordable, and stable child care.

Trump Threat to Obamacare Would Send Premiums and Deficits Higher  The New York Times WASHINGTON — Premiums for the most popular health insurance plans would shoot up 20 percent next year, and federal budget deficits would increase by $194 billion in the coming decade, if President Trump carried out his threat to end certain subsidies paid to insurance companies under the Affordable Care Act, the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday.

8/16/17 11:07,Beyond resistance: Ensuring people are rewarded—not punished—for pursuing higher education,"Update | Wednesday, August 16, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 19th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: making student loan debt more manageable.
Over 44 million Americans are faced with student loan debt. With rising tuition prices, students are struggleing to pursue an education without jeopardizing their future. In Oregon, over 40,000 students take out need-based loans every year, and the average college student’s debt is $14,000. Students graduate, hopeful for their future, but are burdened by an overwhelming amount of student debt they may never be able to pay off.
We need to increase support for higher education and grants for students, but that’s not enough.
While banks and businesses can refinance public and private loans at a lower rate, students cannot refinance student loans. I support the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act to allow students to take advantage of lower interest rates and save money. I also support the Employer Participation in Student Loan Assistance Act to encourage employers to provide educational assistance, including loan repayment, for employees. This way, individuals can both make a living and pay off their debt in a reasonable time.
Educational debt is holding back an entire generation. Congress must do everything within its power to change the system so that young people will be rewarded, not punished, for pursuing a higher education.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here.  

Courage, 
￼

Lindsey --
With so much going on in Congress, the last few months have been packed with change-making legislation, exciting work in our district and continued progress as not only an opposition partytaking a stand against unjust legislationbut also as a proposition party that sets goals and seeks to create the change we want. As we keep moving forward, I want to update you on the ways Im fighting for our community and our 7th District from coast to coast and Washington to Washington.
 
Bipartisan Delegation to India, Nepal, Germany and Belgium
￼

In the first week of May, I had the honor of joining Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and seven of my congressional colleagues on a bipartisan delegation to my birth country, India. We also visited Nepal, Germany and Belgium, working with our global neighbors and NATO partners to address international challenges and strengthen our joint mission of fostering humanity, economic growth and security. On our trip, we met with Indian Prime Minister Modi and discussed the vital importance of a strong relationship between our two countries. We also met with members of the India-U.S. Business Council and sat down with top government officials throughout the week to address our mutual interest in advancing human rights, combating climate change and using security cooperation to combat global terrorism.
A major part of the trip centered around our bipartisan concerns for the human rights of the Tibetan people, particularly in the face of growing Chinese government pressure on countries like Nepal to crack down on the rights of Tibetan refugees. We had the remarkable honor of spending several hours in conversation with His Holiness the Dalai Lama. I was also honored to be invited to deliver remarks at the Public Felicitation Ceremony hosted by His Holiness. Earlier in the week, we traveled to Nepal to meet with President Bidhya Devi Bhandari and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. I am proud of my birth country, India, for welcoming His Holiness, the Tibetan government and an enormous Tibetan population in exile so they may make their home in India while they await their return to their homeland. Both India and Nepal have long hosted Tibetan refugees, and it is my hope that the Tibetan people will soon be able to return to their homeland and freely practice their religion.
Demanding Transparency from the Administration
In my opinion, the presidents complex web of international business policies present a continuing threat to public integrity and the common good. While past presidents acted to eliminate potential conflicts of interest, I believe that the president's policies have not taken steps to address these issues in any meaningful way. I think our government must work to ensure that the president has undivided loyalty to the American people and our Constitution.
When national Tax Day passed in April and the president continued to withhold his tax returns, I took the matter to Congress. On May 16th, I introduced four pieces of legislation as a part of the Trump Transparency Package with my colleague, Rep. Jamie Raskin.
The package includes four bills that would: safeguard our government from foreign influence; call for freedom of the press and media access to the president; require disclosure of the presidents foreign business transactions; and insulate the duties of the presidency from the presidents personal financial interests.
I firmly believe that transparency is vital in any working democracy, and I will continue to fight to make sure that the Office of the President is held to the same ethical standards as every American. 
2017 District Reports
￼
Discussing how Congress can support strong infrastructure on a tour of Community Transit's Swift Blue Line.
On May 17, in accordance with National Infrastructure Week, I released my 2017 Infrastructure Report on projects to strengthen infrastructure and transportation systems throughout our district and across our region. We worked with local officials and various stakeholders to identify 22 different transportation and infrastructure programs that would support and grow our local economy. The current administration has yet to share an infrastructure plan with the American people. I know that robust infrastructure keeps our district thriving and I will fight for every one of these innovative projects to be fully funded at the federal level.
In July, I released another casework report, this time highlighting the work of my constituent services team. The July 2017 Casework Report outlines how our team assisted 260 people since January with everything from Social Security Disability and immigration to U.S. Postal Service delivery. Its been a pleasure to hear the stories of my constituents and help resolve their problems. If you think you need assistance with a federal agency, please dont hesitate to call us at 206-674-0040.
Environmental Justice Bill Package
The effects of climate change disproportionately burden frontline communities, including communities of color, low-income communities, people with limited English proficiency, indigenous peoples and those living with disabilities.
As we move toward a renewable energy economy that ensures safe land, water and air for everyone in our country, we must address the fact that these frontline groups face higher rates of carbon pollution and health disparities. Its time to tackle these issues head-on by supporting community-based solutions and implementing environmental justice principles across government agencies.
Thats why I wrote the Environmental Justice Bill Package with my colleagues, Reps. A. Donald McEachin and Nanette Diaz Barragán. Our group legislation aims to establish offices of environmental justice within the Environmental Protection Agency and the Executive Office of the President; create environmental justice assessments for executive orders; and highlight the critical importance of the environmental justice movement, which has pushed for objectivity, transparency and outreach for decades.
Additionally, in July, I introduced a climate bill to move our nation to 100 percent clean and renewable energy by the year 2050. Working with Reps. Raul Grijalva, Jared Polis and Jared Huffman, I created a bill that pushes for a just transition for workers into a clean energy economy and invests in frontline communities. In our opinion, this bill is the smartest way forward to keep communities unpolluted and to prepare workers with the training they need to thrive in a renewable energy landscape.
Clean air, clean water and resource conservation are vitally important to economically vibrant and socially just communities. I believe that keeping climate justice at the center of policy and progress will greatly benefit our Earth, the people on it and future generations who will inherit what we leave behind.
Suing the President for Allegedly Violating the Constitution
On June 21, I joined more than 200 of my colleagues in Congress to file a lawsuit against Donald Trump regarding his actions around the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution.
Since the day he took office, there have been allegations that the president has repeatedly violated the Constitutions Emoluments Clause by profiting from foreign governments without the consent of Congress. When questions such as these arise, I believe our democracy enters shaky territory. Its up to us to seek accountability in the courts.
Our constitution was written to prevent abuses of power. Currently, I don't believe the president's policy is doing anything to address his business interests in 25 foreign countries. The Constitution requires the president to seek and obtain the consent of Congress before he accepts any foreign emoluments. If the president fails to go to Congress and seek congressional consent as the Constitution requires, members of Congress are denied the opportunity to vote and either approve or deny a presidents acceptance of these emoluments. Im in favor of accountability, and I am working every day to get it.
My Election as the First Vice Chair of the CPC
￼
Meeting with Rep. Pocan and Rep. Grijalva to discuss our new roles as CPC co-chairs.
On June 8, I was proud and humbled to be unanimously elected as the First Vice Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC). I know that this is an opportunity for me to keep fighting for the progressive values that America deserves. I will continue to push for affordable health care, comprehensive immigration reform, a healthy environment, civil liberties and human rights. Together with distinguished CPC Co-Chairs Reps. Raul Grijalva and Mark Pocan, and all our members, we will stand up for working families and a progressive, integrated vision of economic, racial and gender justice for all.
Coming Home for the District Work Period
￼
Addressing Franklin High School and discussing my legislation, like College for All, that helps young people. My message: You are the change-makers, the problem-solvers, YOU choose your path.
For the month of May, my district office introduced mobile office hours throughout the district. From Shoreline to Burien, Ballard to West Seattle, we brought our office to you. My staff held neighborhood meet-ups, and offered constituent services and legislative updates. 
On June 19, I gave the commencement speech to the 2017 graduates of Franklin High School and was thrilled to honor this years graduates of one of the most diverse schools in the nation.
On July 4, I published an op-ed in the New York Times highlighting my immigration story and path to becoming a United States citizen. As I wrote in the piece;
America, a country that had embraced me as a 16-year-old who had come here by myself to study and build a life of better opportunity.
America, a country built on the idea of being a refuge for those in need, 'the tired masses, yearning to breathe free.'
America, a country that has always celebrated itself as a nation of immigrants.
I was encouraged by reading the responses and hearing others unique paths to becoming Americans, and was reminded once again that this country truly flourishes through diversity.
On July 7, I sat down with local business leaders and the Washington Council on International Trade to talk about the future of trade in our district and how our office can play a leadership role in crafting better trade policies that prioritize workers rights, environmental protections and the jurisdictions of local and state authorities over their own laws. Creating such agreements will allow us to take advantage of the benefits of trade, while ensuring workers and our planet continue to thrive!
￼
Discussing climate change with advocates and industry leaders.
I spoke about climate change and preservation with the Outdoor Industry Association, I stood up for innovation with Community Transit and I heard from women veterans, small business owners, students, low-income housing advocates and labor leaders on the issues that matter most to them.
My office sat down with the Environmental Professionals of Color community, NASA, Plymouth Housing, and advocates and community members from across our beautiful district. We are working every single day to make your lives better, and hearing from youmy constituentsis the first step. 
My Town Hall and the Senate Health Care Bill
On July 6, I held a jam-packed town hall in Seattle on health care. I was thrilled to see the seats filled with 300 engaged constituents who are invested in our future. We heard the personal stories of Leigh Pate, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011, and Melissah Watts, the caretaker and mother of Maxher son who has physical and mental disabilities. Leigh and Melissa shared how they benefitted from the Affordable Care Act and how they feel the conservative health plan would devastate their families. We also discussed how we can protect the care we have and move toward progress, and we went through thein my opiniondisastrous proposed health care bill that was up for debate in the Senate.
Throughout the month of July, the Senate went through several iterations of their health planone that would leave 22 million more Americans uninsured according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), one that would remove the Affordable Care Act without a replacement plan and one that was known as the skinny health care bill that would have eliminated ACA-implemented standards requiring insurers to provide basic benefits and would have kicked 15 million people off of care, according to the CBO.
I am happy to report that none of these plans made it through the Senate, and I would like to assure you all that I am prepared to push forward and work to broaden and improve the care that we have. I believe it is imperative that more peoplenot fewerare able to receive life-changing and lifesaving care.
My Score Before the Floor Bill
In the House, the GOP-led health care bill slimly passed without any cost score from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Those who voted for it did not know how much it would cost or how many Americans would lose their health insurance (The answer was 24 million, according to the CBO.)
I was mortified by the actions of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to fast track this bill with no CBO review. Thats why I introduced my Score Before the Floor bill in July with my colleague, Rep. Brian Higgins. Our act would prevent any legislation that affects our budget from being voted on before cost estimates are publicly released by the CBO. I believe the American people deserve to know how proposed legislation will affect them and I believe Congress should not be voting on things without CBO knowledge on who bills will help, who they will hurt and how much they will cost.
Its our responsibility as elected officials to be transparent with our constituents and I am working to wipe away the increasing secrecy and total mystery that some seem to want in Washington D.C.
Resolution of Inquiry
In my opinion, its past time to get to the bottom of what is going on in the White House. To me, the presidents policies have not been befitting of the highest office in our land, so Rep. David Cicilline and I introduced a resolution of inquiry demanding that the Trump administration release any and all information pertaining to Attorney General Jeff Sessions involvement in the firing of FBI Director James Comey. It was our hope that this resolution could get the conservative majority in the House Judiciary Committee to consider the allegations of obstruction of justice involving the Justice Department. To me, this issue goes beyond partisanship and falls squarely into doing what is right by and for the American people.
Our resolution was heard before the Judiciary Committee on July 26, and I strongly believe that my colleagues in the majority pushed for policy that avoided the issue at hand. Large swaths of my resolution were changed to, in my opinion, move the scope of the inquiry away from Attorney General Sessions and shift it instead toward former officials who currently hold no office. I take my duty as a member Congress and of the Judiciary Committee seriously and, though I am disappointed in the outcome of this committee hearing, this has only furthered my resolve to find the truth.
Battle for the Budget
On July 19, I spent the entire day fighting for families and funding in markup for the 2018 Budget. From 10:00 a.m. until 11:00 p.m., I joined my colleagues on the Budget Committee to review the Republican plan, stand up for funding for the programs that help millions and introduce amendments to make our budget better.
I said in committee, and I firmly believe, it would be irresponsible and neglectful to pass the budget as it was proposed. So, during the 13-hour hearing, I introduced two amendments. The first was to support comprehensive immigration reform and the programs that help it. My amendment would address problems related to detention and enforcement and, I believe, push us in the direction of a more sound economic future by prioritizing comprehensive immigration reform.
The second amendment I introduced supports the cities and states that are working to uphold the Paris Climate Agreement. This planet is the only one we have and I feel strongly that its our responsibility to move forward, not backward, in our fight against climate change.
To myand my Democratic colleaguesdismay, House Budget Conservatives voted against my amendments and many others. These would have provided funding and support for Medicaid, Planned Parenthood, SNAP, infrastructure investments and more.
As a Vice Ranking Member of the Budget Committee, I understand that a budget is a reflection of our nations values and I will keep fighting to ensure our budget doesnt leave our country morally bankrupt.
Over the past few months, my staff and I have made great strides, but I know it is just the start. I am incredibly proud to represent one of the most active and engaged districts in the country and I am energized by the tenacity that you all bring to making the world a better place. This nation is a quilt made with fabrics of diverse origins, beliefs and experiencesyou are all making it more beautiful with every stitch.
I ask you to look forward and know that every day, your engagement adds another piece of fabric to the marvelous place we call home. This is just the beginning of what can be achieved.
Have a safe, thoughtful and prosperous summer,
Pramila Jayapal

The President Has Obliterated Any Semblance of Moral Leadership that Americans Expect From Their President
BALTIMORE –U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.) issued the following statement on the President’s latest response to the deadly violence in Charlottesville this weekend.
“It is difficult to describe the most recent display that the country and the world witnessed from the President of the United States today. Rather than using this moment to bring our country together, he used his bully pulpit to act like the worst form of a bully, equating white supremacists, the KKK and neo-Nazis with protesters who were defending America against hate, bigotry, anti-Semitism, homophobia, misogyny and xenophobia. His empathy for white supremacists has obliterated any semblance of moral leadership that Americans expect from their president. 
“Despite President Trump, we the people must continue to turn to each other for strength and progress, healing and compassion. We must continue to be bold and fearless in our own reactions to racist and anti-Semitic demonstrations. White supremacism and racism are repugnant and fundamentally against the values we hold dear as a civilized society. There is a right side and a wrong side to this issue. There are no ‘all sides.’ The hatemongers will not tear our country apart. I am confident that what is good and just in America is stronger and will prevail.”

Dear  ,
As the first half of 2017 has come to a close, I wanted to provide an update on my new committee work in Washington, D.C. As you may know, at the beginning of the year, I was selected to serve on the House Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for funding every federal agency and most programs and projects within the United States government. I was deeply honored to be chosen to serve on this critical committee, and I knew that this role would allow me the opportunity to fight for American families, seniors, young people, immigrants, and, most importantly, Queens. 
During the appropriations process, the first step is for the President to submit a budget request, or a budget blueprint that reflects that administration’s priorities and details how the administration would like to see programs and agencies funded. I was dismayed to see that the President's budget request proposed cuts to domestic funding across the board, including deep cuts to public education programs, medical research funding, economic development partnerships, environmental protections, and services for vulnerable children, seniors, and low-income families. 
Once the President releases his budget request, it is up to Congress, specifically the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, to put together the various spending bills that dictate much of government spending. As a new member of the House Appropriations Committee, I was not in favor of the President’s proposed budget cuts because I refused to settle for a budget that would disinvest in our nation’s future. I worked with my Committee colleagues on both sides of the aisle to recommend funding levels for important programs and agencies that far exceeded the President’s requested levels. Despite our efforts, however, many programs and agencies may still see deep cuts that will undercut their ability to serve the American people. 
Please rest assured that the fight is not over. I will continue to push for crucial programs to receive the funding they need as appropriation legislation progresses through the House and Senate, just as I advocated for robust funding for numerous important programs during the Committee process. I am proud that the appropriations bills we produced, and that now must pass the Senate, included some of the following items that I championed:  
	•	Full funding for the Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service, which ensures that the nation's commercial supply of meat, poultry, and egg products is safe, wholesome, and correctly labeled and packaged.
	•	$5 million for the Children of Incarcerated Parents Program, which enhances and maintains parental and family relationships for incarcerated parents as a reentry or recidivism reduction strategy.
	•	$8.89 million for the Tax Counseling for the Elderly Program, double the funding initially included in the bill, and almost $2.5 million above the President’s budget request. This program offers tax assistance to individuals who are 60 years old and older.
	•	$2 million for the Girls in the Juvenile Justice System Program, which provides grants for responses and strategies tailored to the particular needs of girls in the juvenile justice system.
	•	Full funding for the Public Safety Officer Benefits Program, which provides death benefits to surviving family of federal, state, or local public safety officers who perished in the line of duty.
	•	Bill report language encouraging the Department of Defense to conduct outreach and recruiting programs focused on increasing officer accessions from Minority Serving Institutions. Minority communities remain underrepresented in the general officer ranks across the military, and this much-needed provision would help build a more diverse military.
	•	Bill report language urging the Secretary to appoint a Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism as quickly as possible, mirroring my questioning of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson during last month’s Committee hearing.
I hope you will share your views with me on these, or any other issues, by e-mailing me. You can stay in touch by following me on Facebook and Twitter, or by signing up for my e-newsletter. 
It is an honor to represent you in Congress, and I will continue to fight for our district whether at home or in Washington.
Sincerely, ￼  Grace Meng Member of Congress

Dear Friend,
One of my top priorities in Congress is to improve the lives of the nearly 45,000 veterans right here in Ventura County, and the millions across the nation, to whom we owe a great debt for their service.
That is why Im so proud of the bipartisan successes my colleagues on the House Veterans Affairs Committee and I have been able to achieve recently.
At the end of July, we worked across the aisle to send legislation to the Presidents desk, including:
	•	My bill that will deliver a new 41,000 square foot, expanded VA clinic for Ventura County, as well as 27 other VA health facilities across 17 states in communities where veterans are underserved. This new VA clinic in Oxnard will support the growing population of veterans in our region and improve their access to specialty carefrom audiology to physical therapywithout requiring them to drive all the way to West LA or Sepulveda. This is a major win for Ventura County veterans, and Im so pleased that we were able to get it funded.
	•	A bill that would fund the Choice Program so that veterans dont lose access to needed community healthcare.
	•	A new Forever G.I. Bill expanding education benefits for current and future veterans and their families pursuing a college education.
The House of Representatives also recently passed my bipartisan legislation to expand childcare options for veterans seeking care at the VA, and I will continue to work with my House and Senate colleagues to move this bill forward and get it to the Presidents desk.
These achievements on behalf of Americas veterans demonstrate what can be accomplished when we work together. As we look toward the fall, I hope we can extend this spirit of bipartisanship to other pressing issues facing our country.
 
Sincerely,
￼

Today, nearly twenty five years later, the Texas Birth Defects Registry is a model for the country and more healthy babies are born each year.

White nationalist rally in Charlottesville turns violent  Neo-Nazis, the KKK, and other alt-right and white supremacist groups held a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the home of the University of Virginia, on Saturday. One woman was killed and 19 others were injured when police said an attendee drove his car into a group of counter-protesters. Two police officers monitoring the protests by air, were also killed when their helicopter crashed. Two days later, President Trump formally condemned the groups by name after having been criticized for not doing so.
+ Saturday morning, before the tragic deaths, Jim issued a statement: “The hate being displayed has no place in Virginia, Tennessee, or anywhere else in the U.S. We should all stand against such bigotry.”
+ Yesterday, Jim also issued this statement: “Nazis, white supremacists, the KKK and other domestic terrorists have hidden in our nation’s shadows for a long time. Their evil isn’t new. But now they feel empowered. Racism and hate are taught, and we have to fight prejudice with all we have. American values are on the line.”
+ In response to the events in Charlottesville, Tennesseans traveled to Governor Haslam’s office in Nashville to demand the removal of the bust of Confederate Army General and former KKK Grand Wizard Nathan Bedford Forrest. Governor Haslam responded to these protests by saying that Bedford Forrest should not “be one of the individuals we honor at the Capitol.”
+ Jim issued this statement: “It shouldn’t be this hard to take down the Forrest statue. It should have been removed ages ago. The image causes pain to so many of our citizens, and I have called for its removal for years. There are many other notable Tennesseans who should be honored in the State Capitol instead.”
￼
Congressional Budget Office report on subsidies released The CBO released its report on the effects of removing Obamacare subsidies – also known as Cost Sharing Reductions or CSRs – from the marketplace. The report estimates that removing the subsidies would cause premiums for popular plans to increase by 20% next year and about 5% of people would have access to no insurers in the marketplace. The deficit would also increase by $194 billion. Insurers, experts and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have already asked the Trump administration to keep the CSRs in place. 
￼
North Korea holds off on military action on Guam  According to North Korean state media, Kim Jong-un decided not to go through with plans to launch missiles targeting the U.S. territory of Guam. Instead of attacking, the report says that Kim “will watch a little more the foolish and stupid conduct of the Yankees [sic].”
Iranian president threatens to restart its nuclear program  President Hassan Rouhani warned that Iran could restart its nuclear program in a matter of hours if the U.S. decides to levy additional sanctions. Concerns over Iran’s nuclear program were placated when the U.S. in 2015 agreed to reduce sanctions in exchange for Iran stopping its enrichment of uranium. President Trump has derided the deal and called for additional sanctions.
Administration begins review of Chinese trade practices  President Trump has ordered that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer investigate U.S. trade with China under section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. This clause allows the president to order an investigation and, if it is determined that China is practicing unfair trade, also allows the president to unilaterally levy broad sanctions. The primary focus of the investigation will be the loss of intellectual property from U.S. firms to Chinese ones.

Dear Friends,
 
The hate and violence perpetrated by white supremacists in Charlottesville this past weekend is in part a product of political rhetoric that appealed to it, and its emergence is a step backwards. 
 
President Trump must use the power of his office to confront and defeat the forces of racist, right-wing extremism that threaten domestic tranquility, and order Attorney General Jeff Sessions to immediately commence a Justice Department criminal investigation of the groups and individuals responsible for causing the violence in Charlottesville. 
 
Moreover, President Trump should order the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to reopen the Extremism and Radicalization Branch of the Homeland Environment Threat Analysis Division, and order that agency to issue an updated report detailing what must be done to deter, prevent, pre-empt and respond to the rise of domestic, right-wing extremism in America.

Thank you for subscribing to my weekly e-newsletter, and please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.   LEAP Act
My LEAP Act gives Americans another path to success and high-paying jobs through apprenticeship programs, which allows students to earn while they learn. This legislation, based on our successful model in South Carolina, can help millions achieve the American Dream. Recently, in the Senate Finance Committee, I discussed the importance of apprenticeships and how we can ensure folks have the skills necessary to succeed. Watch here.  Credit Score Competition Act Recently, I introduced my bipartisan Credit Score Competition Act. After growing up in a small, two-bedroom house with my grandparents, I came to understand and appreciate the independence that comes with the notion of owning a home. Homeownership is a huge part of the American Dream, and I want to help folks across the country accomplish that goal. The current credit-scoring model at the center of our housing market overlooks a large swath of people that are paying their monthly bills on time and deserve an opportunity to pursue homeownership.    Our goal in introducing this legislation is to encourage Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider more inclusive methodologies in determining a borrower’s creditworthiness. The legislation has already received support from twenty consumer and industry groups, and I hope it will soon help to make our system more fair to everyone.   Service Academy Nominations My office is accepting applications for Service Academy Nominations through Friday, October 13th at 5PM. High school students interested in attending one of the four service academies are all encouraged to submit applications and other necessary documents. For more information about the Service Academy nomination process, visit my website - https://www.scott.senate.gov/services/military-academy-nominations   Charlottesville This past weekend, our country witnessed hate-fueled violence in Charlottesville, VA. Domestic terrorism must be condemned by every single one of us- otherwise, hate is simply emboldened. We are the American family, and will not be divided by hate. Yesterday, the President’s remarks were clear and specific. However, they would have been more impactful on Saturday. I hope this serves as a lesson for us all that when a community grieves, when Americans look for guidance after such a crushing and devastating attack like the one that unraveled this weekend in Charlottesville, we must take a firm stance against hate and violence.   As Americans we may disagree on many issues, but there is one common bond that should draw us all together: hope for a brighter future, void of racism and hatred. I wrote an op-ed in USA Today on fighting hatred, fear and domestic terror with American ideals.   Sincerely,
￼
Tim

Our home state is special for so many reasons - the natural beauty, resources, growing opportunities, our hardworking and hospitable people, and of course, our annual fairs and festivals. When I was younger, I always looked forward to attending fairs and festivals all over the state because it was not only an opportunity to spend time with my family, but I also learned so much more about our state and its people. We do indeed have much to celebrate in the Mountain State, and the State Fair tradition in beautiful Fairlea is certainly one to be proud of.
For 93 years, the State Fair of West Virginia has been a greatly anticipated event for residents as well as people from across the nation and around the world. We know our beautiful state is unique in many ways. From our blend of cultures comes delicious food as well as unique traditions, crafts, art and entertainment. This, coupled with the natural welcoming nature of our citizens, makes the State Fair one of the most anticipated events of the year.
Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to learn more about this wild and wonderful place we call home as the State Fair showcases our traditions of promoting family values, recreation, agriculture and education. This years theme, Start Your Traditions, embraces the 93rd year of our talented and inspiring citizens and businesses coming together to showcase the traditions that make West Virginia great. It is through their hard work and creativity that the State Fair has been an outstanding success for 93 years, and one of our proudest traditions.
Throughout the years, Gayle and I have always enjoyed our many visits to the State Fair. It is a special way for family and friends to come together and create memories that will last for years, and to pass these wonderful traditions on to the next generation. If you have never attended before, or if you have and would like to attend again, I invite you to plan your visit for next year and see for yourself all that the State Fair in our beautiful Mountain State has to offer.
We look forward to seeing you!
How May We Help You?
I truly appreciate the opportunity to hear from West Virginians. As your U.S. Senator, I am proud to be your voice with government agencies during your time of need. My goal is to provide top-notch customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me, or who may need help.  I have a team of caseworkers in each of my four offices to help you with matters of concern. While I have no direct jurisdiction in the administrative matters of any federal, state, or local agency, I welcome the opportunity to assist you with whatever problem you may be experiencing and ask that full consideration be given to your case.
Recently my office was able to help David Davis, a former coal miner, from Chapmanville, West Virginia. Amber McCartney, caseworker in my Charleston office, successfully worked with the Department of Labor to get his preliminary approval for Black Lung benefits.  If you need help with Black Lung Benefits or know of someone in need of assistance with the VA, Social Security, health insurance, or recognition, please let me know. 
Click here to request assistance from a caseworker, or contact one of my offices listed at the bottom of this page.

Website | Biography | Constituent Services | Press Releases | Photo Album

Dear Friends,
On Monday August 21st, we will have a once in a lifetime opportunity to experience a solar eclipse. This will be the first time in 99 years that a total solar eclipse will traverse the length of the entire nation from coast to coast. Although New York is outside the path of totality, we will still be able to see the Moon cover up to 70 percent of the Sun over a period of about two and a half hours in the afternoon.
 
What is a Solar Eclipse?
A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves directly between the Sun and the Earth. New York will only experience a partial eclipse, where the Moon will pass in front of a portion of the sun. The shadow this casts is called the Penumbra. Elsewhere in the country, along a narrow path about 70 miles wide, viewers will be able to see a total eclipse, where the Sun will be completely obscured by the Moon.
 
When to Watch
The eclipse will begin Monday, August 21st at 1:23 PM and end at 4:00 PM, with the most coverage occurring at 2:45 PM. 
 
How to Watch
Do not look directly at the Sun and NEVER use binoculars, telescopes, sunglasses, or any unprotected equipment. The only way to safely view the eclipse is through special-purpose solar filters, such as a pair of special eclipse glasses. Homemade filters and ordinary sunglasses are not safe for looking at the sun.
Check with local science museums, schools, and astronomy clubs for eclipse glasses, or you can purchase your own. When purchasing eclipse glasses, make sure to only buy ISO 12312-2 compliant ones. You can find more information on how to view the eclipse at https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/safety.
 
Where to Watch
The best places to watch the eclipse are outdoors with a clear view of the sky.
Although you may be able to see the eclipse from outside your home, we are fortunate enough to live in a district with many public parks. Parks that have open fields, including ball field, will be good spots for viewing. The Hudson River Museum is also hosting an eclipse event from noon to 3PM on August 21st. 
Special celestial events like this are a great opportunity to engage young people in the wonders of space exploration and study. Know that in Congress I will continue to do all that I can to support agencies like NASA and fight for robust funding for our scientific community. 
Sincerely, ￼ Eliot L. Engel MEMBER OF CONGRESS

Friend,

I just toured General Electric's (GE) test facility in Peebles, OH. This facility is the 'last stop before flight,' where engines are tested and must go through simulations of real-world hail and ice storms, typhoon conditions, and winds up to 100 mph. Take a look:


 
 
￼
 
 
 
￼
 
 
 
￼
 
 

During my discussion with GE employees, they stressed the importance of comprehensive and permanent tax reform to allow companies like GE, start-ups, and small businesses in Ohio and across the country to continue to provide jobs to our communities and spur American innovation for generations to come. 

To stay updated on what we're doing in the House of Representatives to implement 21st century, pro-growth tax reform that benefits all Americans, click here.

Yours in service,

Congressman Cook: We Must Discuss How to Prevent Future Terrorism Havens in Iraq and Syria

We’re approaching a turning point in the battle against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. With Mosul back in Iraqi control and the fight for Raqqa ramping up, we must determine our role in the region when ISIS no longer controls large cities or swaths of land. ISIS and other radical Islamic groups will continue to remain threats that we must be able to counter and defeat, but what is the best way to accomplish that considering the other political, economic, and military issues in that region?  
While the ISIS caliphate took a major hit when Iraqi forces recaptured Mosul, smaller radical terrorist groups could remain entrenched within the minority Sunni communities. The presence of Shia Iranian militias in Iraq is causing some distrust among moderate Sunni areas, making it easier for extremists to find support among those same Sunnis. There is also a Kurdish minority that has fought hard against ISIS and extremism, but their place in a future Iraqi government is still unclear.  
For Syria, the fight against ISIS continues, but that’s just one battle in a long lasting civil war involving a number of factions and outside powers. The domestic list of players include the Syrian regime, Kurdish groups, ISIS and other extremist groups, as well as vetted and unvetted moderate rebels. The external players include the U.S. and coalition forces, Russia, Iran, Turkey, Hezbollah, and on occasion Israel. When Raqqa falls, the fight with ISIS will be closer to an end, but all the other chess pieces remain.
These are simplified overviews of the dynamic situations in Iraq and Syria, but they highlight the need to discuss the future of the region. Specifically, we should ask: “What can America do to prevent allowing safe havens for terrorists?”
While these discussions take place, it’s critical that we not set an arbitrary military pullout date or limit our options based on political considerations, such as we did under the previous presidential administration. We must show we’re serious about security while not giving our enemies a timeframe to wait us out, and we should find ways to help Iraqis rebuild their infrastructure so they can utilize their natural resources. We should also push to stabilize Syria using diplomatic and economic efforts wherever possible and military power where we must, so that the bloodshed ends and the region is safe for millions to return to their homeland.  
These are incredibly challenging problems that won’t be solved overnight, but our military successes there require that we begin the discussion.  This op-ed was published in American Military News, click here for the original editorial.

Lipinski Kicks Off School Year with Remarks at Program for New Teachers and Administrators 
￼
Congressman Dan Lipinski (IL-3) delivered the following remarks this morning at the West Suburban Chamber of Commerce and Industrys 52nd Annual New Teachers and Administrators Welcome Breakfast in La Grange:
I remember from my days as a teacher how exciting the beginning of a new school year is.  This is especially true when starting at a new school.  All the enthusiasm with having a clean slate and terrific plans for what I was going to be able to teach and inspire my students to learn that year.  Its an exhilarating feeling.  Remember these days and try to hold on to these hopes and dreams for your students throughout the year, especially on those tough days. 
Teaching well is one of the most difficult things to do, but thats because it is also one of the most important vocations.  The ability you have to influence young people is incredible.  It is not just reading, writing, arithmetic, and every other subject students need to learn these days.  During these times in our nation filled with anxiety, especially after we witnessed a horrible display of bigotry and hatred by white supremacists and neo-Nazis leading to violence and murder in Charlottesville, Virginia, we are once again reminded how important it is to teach our children the importance of respecting every person and not falling into hate. 
We need to make clear that these vile beliefs and all other forms of hatred towards individuals or groups should be condemned and are never legitimate.  The home is the primary place for children to learn this, in addition to churches, mosques, synagogues, and other places of worship, but as teachers you have a tremendous influence on young people by what you teach in words and actions.  I know that you will do a great job of this because the fact that you have dedicated yourself to teaching shows how much you care about every child and every person.  I thank you for this. 
We never thank teachers enough or give them everything that they deserve for what they do for us.  Today I want to thank you for what you do for our communities and our nation by being teachers.  I will always work to do all I can to give you the support that you need.  Have a great school year!

Dear Lindsey,
Saturday's domestic terrorist attack in Charlottesville must be a call to leadership - as citizens and as human beings. White supremacists, neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, and all those who espouse hatred and bigotry have no place in our country, and we must stand united against the fear and anger that they stoke.
But it's not enough just to say what we are against. We need to stand up to defend and support what we are for. We are for a strong and compassionate country that supports and respects all people.It's not enough to just say we stand for these values. We have to live these values, day in and day out, even when it's not easy.

8/15/17 13:20,6 Things Worth Reading,"A message from US Senator Todd Young
￼


Military readiness and vigorous diplomacy are both key in North Korea
I joined CNN’s “New Day” to discuss the ongoing situation in North Korea and key elements to mitigating that threat. We need both a credible threat of military force and vigorous diplomacy in North Korea. The credible threat of military force will strengthen our deterrence and empower diplomacy. That’s why I support efforts to increase military readiness in the region, and why I am so proud of Sec. Tillerson and Amb. Haley who led successful efforts at the UN Security Council to impose robust sanctions against North Korea.

Hoosier honored with overdue bronze star

It was an honor to present a long-overdue Bronze Star to Kurt Koch. Presenting such an award to such a deserving person is one of the greatest privileges I have as a U.S. Senator. Thanks to his wife, Joyce, for all of her work to make this happen and pull off the surprise. Click to watch the medal presentation:

A ride-along with our brave police officers 
I took a ride-along with IMPD North District's Officer Labanauskas. I was very impressed with how well the department is connecting with the community and how local churches and organizations like Alliance for Northeast Unification are serving their neighbors. Thanks for all you all do to keep our community safe, and thanks for taking the time to show me around.
￼
Indiana State Fair
It's always a great day at the Indiana State Fair. Thanks to Future Farmers of America for showing us around, U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue for visiting, and to the Hoosier Agriculture community for sharing your thoughts on the Farm Bill in our roundtable session.
￼
Working together to combat opioid abuse 
Last week I visited with Danielle and Kayln, who are recovering from addiction thanks for the folks at Union County Health Department. Currently, the community is pooling resources to address the opioid crisis and help the many people in need, just like these young ladies. This is indeed a national emergency and I support the President’s forthcoming declaration to address this crisis.
￼
Once more thing before you go!

Last Week in Congress
Clearly and Directly Condemning Racism
￼ ￼ Click here to watch Kevin's comments on 41 Action News.
Over the weekend, America watched in horror as events in Charlottesville, Virginia played out on our television screens. On Saturday afternoon, a car plowed into a group of people protesting a white nationalist rally, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. Two Virginia State Troopers, Pilot Lt. H. Jay Cullen and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates, also died when their helicopter crashed on the way to the scene of the violence at the rally. Dozens of other people were treated for injuries throughout the day, including 19 from the car crash. It was a terrible scene, one that harkened back to the Civil Rights clashes of the 1950s and 1960s. 
 
We cannot tolerate this hatred and discrimination in this country. The white supremacist ideology fueling those marching in the streets has no place in this world, and by calling it what it is - evil and terror - we will never allow it to grow or prosper. Instead, we must be living examples of the unity we wish to see. We must ensure that love overpowers hate.
 
￼
Kevin addressing the congregation of First Baptist Church in KCK on Sunday morning.
 
On Sunday morning, I attended church services at the First Baptist Church in KCK and spoke to the congregation about how we as leaders need to be clear and direct in how we condemn the hatred, bigotry, and racism on display in Charlottesville. We prayed together, keeping in mind the passage from the first letter of John the Apostle that says, ""But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness, and does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes. I was thankful to have the opportunity to speak to the congregation and especially thankful to Pastor Cedric Rowan for inviting me.
￼
Neutralizing the Threat Posed by North Korea
￼ ￼ Click here to read coverage of the UN Security Council's unanimous vote to sanction the North Korean regime.
As the dangerous Kim regime in North Korea continues to threaten America and our allies, the world becomes more unified its resolve to isolate and degrade its economic and military capabilities. In the last month alone, Republicans and Democrats in Congress passed a sanctions bill with overwhelming bipartisan support and Ambassador Nikki Haley skillfully secured China and Russias support for a United Nations Security Council sanctions resolution that will cost the regime billions. The more the regime threatens, the more the world led by the United States will respond with unified strength.
￼
Around the District
Meeting with ""The Resistance""
￼ Kevin discussing health care issues with members from local progressive groups.
America is best-served when Republicans and Democrats like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill are working together to develop solutions to our nation's biggest problems. I've always tried to model my approach to legislating under this principle, working towards finding common ground with those who might disagree with me. We are best when we can find points of agreement rather than focus on our differences, because no single Member of Congress represents only those who agree with them or voted for them. We represent everyone in our districts.
 
Recently, I met with local members from MoveOn.org and Indivisible KC - groups who support progressive policy solutions to our nation's problems and who oppose the current Administration's platform. I spent the meeting listening to their concerns and ideas for how to move the country forward, specifically for areas where we could find commonality. We discussed health care and their desire to move to a single payer system in America. While we may have disagreed on how to best achieve it, we agreed that America has a responsibility to provide for affordable, quality health care for all its citizens. I continue to believe the best path forward is to repair and strengthen our private health insurance market, but appreciated their impassioned pitch for a system they believe in deeply. I look forward to continue engaging constituents and groups across the political spectrum as we work to help individuals and families of all stripes achieve the American Dream.
￼
District Office Hours
￼ Kevin discussing legal immigration reform with Sharat Tekulapally.
I also enjoyed meeting with Adam Wilkerson from Lenexa and Sharat Tekulapally from Overland Park at my District Office here in Kansas during my office hours last week. If you need assistance with a federal agency or have ideas on particular legislation youd like me to support or introduce, contact my office at (913) 621-0832 or visit my website at www.yoder.house.gov and we can set up a meeting.
 
￼
Kevin with Adam Wilkerson of Lenexa.
 
Adam is a sophomore Political Science major at KSU, and deeply interested in foreign affairs and the impact governmental actions have on people in unstable nations. Among other important issues, we discussed legislative options to end preventable child and maternal deaths around the world and how to best support countries to reach this goal.
 
￼
Kevin with Sharat Tekulapally of Overland Park.
 
Sharat is here in America on a high-skilled temporary work visa and is applying for permanent residence, but is stuck in the backlog created by the per-nation caps on employment-based green cards. Hes one of the many thousands of people Im trying to help with my Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act. I was glad to hear the real world impact our bill would have on him and his family and I look forward to pushing the bipartisan legislation in the House.
￼
Spencer C Duncan Make It Count 5K
￼ Kevin and Megan Duncan inside a Chinook CH-47 helicopter at the 5K.
It's always a privilege to join Megan and Dale Duncan for the Spencer C Duncan Make It Count 5K to honor our fallen heroes by helping our veterans. The 5K is named after their son Spencer, who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country on August 6, 2011 in Afghanistan when his Army Chinook helicopter was shot down by enemy fire. Each year, Megan and Dale host the 5k in memory of Spencer, and to benefit local veterans' organizations.
￼
Meals on Wheels
￼ Kevin delivering a meal to a local senior in Johnson County.
I had the wonderful privilege of riding along with Stephen and Jean Spohrer and helped to deliver meals to senior citizens in Johnson County through Meals on Wheels recently. Meals on Wheels provides seniors with friendly visits, nutritious meals enabling seniors to continue to live independently. In Johnson County, 135,000 home delivered meals are served annually through this important public private partnership. The Spohrers deliver meals twice a month and they represent hundreds of volunteers that tirelessly serve our seniors in the Third District.
Thank you to Katie Baker, Meals on Wheels Volunteer Coordinator, Johnson County Area Agency on Aging and to the Spohrers for allowing me to participate.
￼
Leawood Chamber of Commerce
￼ Kevin visiting with Ashley McDonald of Shawnee Mission Health, Frank Flores of Lifestyle Publications (top), Kevin Jeffries and Mark LeCluyse (middle), and Mickey ""the Cotton Candy Man"" Levey (bottom).
It was great to catch up with many of the members of the Leawood Chamber of Commerce recently at their Morning Mingling event and discuss many of the issues facing Congress. The event was held at Shawnee Mission Health's newest location in south Overland Park, which is now serving the southern part of Johnson County and beyond. Thank you to all who attended and visited with me and thank you to Shawnee Mission Health and Leawood Chamber President Kevin Jeffries for hosting.
￼

Fact of the Week
The United Nations Security Council's unanimous 15-0 vote to sanction the North Korean regime over its July 2017 missile testing is the 17th time since 1993 the Security Council has passed a sanctions resolution regarding attempted proliferation of nuclear weapons by the North Korean regime. 
Third District Trivia
The Kansas City Chiefs debuted this preseason on Friday, playing well but falling short in a loss to the San Francisco 49ers. Quarterback Alex Smith ranks 4th in franchise history with 76 touchdown passes. Can you round out the rest of the franchise's top five quarterbacks with the most touchdown passes as a Chief? 
Send your answers to haley.brady@mail.house.gov and the first correct response will receive a shout out in next week's newsletter.

Dear Friend,
It is a tremendous privilege to serve you in the United States House of Representatives.  Events in Washington continue to develop rapidly, but I have remained steadfastly focused on delivering results for the people of the 18th Congressional District.  My work has addressed a broad scope of needs: from securing better services for veterans; to attracting more federal funding for flood relief; to advancing critical legislation that makes Houstonians and all Americans safer from cyber attacks. 
The people of the 18th Congressional District can look forward to the following legislative funding allocations for the 18th Congressional District:
 
	1.	$5 MILLION TO TREAT VETERANS SUFFERING FROM POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISIORDER.  The substantial increase in funding to treat veterans with PTSD was made possible by the Jackson Lee Amendment to the Defense Appropriations Act for FY 2018.  The amendment will improve the lives of veterans in Houston and around the nation.
	2.	$3 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT FEASIBILITY STUDIES IN HOUSTON.  The Jackson Lee Amendment to the Energy and Water Appropriations Act of FY 2018 facilitates the $3 million needed to the Army Corps of Engineers’ Houston Regional Watershed Assessment Flood Risk Management Feasibility Study.  The knowledge gained should pave the way to help reduce flood and storm damage in vulnerable Houston communities.
	3.	$1.5 MILLION IN FUNDING TO PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND STRENGTHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY’S OFFICE OF ECONOMIC IMPACT AND DIVERSITY.  The Jackson Lee Amendment to the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act secures funding to ensure that members of underrepresented communities are protected from polluters who dump their toxins and walk away.  The problem in Harris County is particularly pronounced, where there are currently 22 federally and state listed superfund sites.  The amendment also provides funding to expand the pool of people with STEM training to include more women and minorities from disadvantaged backgrounds.
	4.	THE ADVANCEMENT OF JACKSON LEE’S “CYBER VULNERABILTY BILL”, WHICH ENCOURAGES THE DHS TO BECOME MORE TRANSPARENT IN DISCLOSING CYBER VULNERABILITIES TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. The bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to provide Congress with a report on the DHS’s disclosure process of so-called “zero day” cyber vulnerabilities.  The process has attracted increased scrutiny in the wake of the outbreak of the “Wanna Cry” ransomware which attacked medical devices in hospitals around the world.
Houstonians helped deliver the deathblow to efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act that helped save healthcare for millions of Americans.  Hundreds marched in the heat, attended numerous town hall meetings, shared stories and made their voices heard. Our next steps will be to develop a solid reform of the Affordable Care Act including, reducing premiums, reducing deductibles and other forms of cost-sharing, providing more relief for small and mid-sized businesses, facilitating more competition and choice between health plans, making health plans easier to understand and compare, increasing transparency in pricing across the health system, preventing surprise medical bills, providing more relief from high drug prices, building adequate provider networks, increasing access to primary care, reviewing a single payer option, especially in rural, remote and underserved areas. 
￼ 
 ￼
 ￼
 
After the August district work period, Congress goes back into session where I will continue my advocacy to protect the environment, strengthen education, improve transportation and infrastructure, secure better access to affordable health care, protect seniors and provide more opportunities for our children.

8/15/17 11:20,ICYMI: Rep. Chris Collins on why SAGA would restore New Yorkers' 2nd Amendment rights,"￼ 
Dear Friend,
In case you missed it, I penned an op-ed in the Lockport Union-Sun & Journal about why why the Second Amendment Guarantee Act (SAGA) is warranted and desperately needed.

Collins: My bill would restore New Yorkers' 2nd Amendment rights and doesn't supersede states' rights
In response to the Union-Sun & Journal's recent editorial, I do believe in State’s rights, the need for local control and the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution guaranteeing state rights. However, I want your readers to know my steadfast belief that states like New York should not have the ability to take away the Constitutional rights of their citizens. Under no circumstances should these basic rights be denied, and federal action is warranted in a situation where a state is infringing on the rights of any American.
The Constitution is the law of the land, and the Founding Fathers produced a document with a clear vision regarding Second Amendment rights. The Second Amendment can only be interpreted one way, and that is it guarantees that Americans have the right to own a firearm.
My proposed legislation, the Second Amendment Guarantee Act (SAGA), has sparked a needed conversation about the Second Amendment rights granted to Americans in the Constitution. In 2013, Governor Andrew Cuomo’s Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement (SAFE) Act infringed upon the rights of law-abiding New Yorkers by instituting strict rifle and shotgun regulations. As you pointed out, these regulations were put in place purely for political purposes.
SAGA focuses specifically on protecting Second Amendment rights, and in no way is taking away the rights of states. When a state crosses the line and starts to implement regulations that are in stark contrast to the basic rights given to Americans, action needs to be taken. That is exactly why I am proposing my law to rein in the unconstitutional policies that Governor Cuomo forced into law.
Governor Cuomo overstepped with the SAFE Act, and my proposal to repeal much of the law has had a great deal of support. SAGA isn’t hypocritical; it is a sincere effort to bring back the freedoms given to New Yorkers by our Constitution when it comes to owning a firearm. Law abiding citizens should not be punished because of onerous and unconstitutional state regulations.
It is my duty as an elected representative to make sure my constituents are protected, and that includes protecting the basic rights granted to them in the Constitution. The SAFE Act only curbed the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding New Yorkers, instead of providing them with a safer place to live as promised by the Governor.
The SAFE Act has done nothing to help our communities and has only taken away our freedoms. It is time we end this disastrous law for all New Yorkers and revert back to what the Founding Fathers intended for our nation.

8/15/17 11:15,Beyond resistance: Establishing more rational nuclear policies,"Update | Tuesday, August 15, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 18th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: establishing more rational nuclear policies.
I’ve worked throughout my career to reduce the development and threat of nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are dangerous, costly, and don’t help us deal with the strategic challenges we face today. 
For the sake of our safety, global stability and fiscal sanity, and for future generations, we need a more rational approach:
	•	The decision to use a nuclear weapon should never be made by one person alone. Earlier this year, I joined Representative Ted Lieu to introduce H.R. 669, legislation prohibiting any president—including the present one—from conducting a first-use nuclear strike without prior authorization from Congress.
	•	Our defense budget is already bloated, yet we’re going to spend over $1 trillion dollars over the next 30 years on upgrading our entire nuclear arsenal. We need to stop this madness. The United States already has enough of these weapons to destroy the earth multiple times. This nuclear weapons escalation will build a force far beyond what we need, can afford, or should use. I introduced the Smarter Approach to Nuclear Expenditures (SANE) Act to reduce or eliminate redundant nuclear weapons programs, while saving the United States more than $100 billion over the next 10 years. This money would be better spent on helping veterans and supporting our troops, not to mention on roads, bridges, schools, and education.
	•	The United States should also lead efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, not encourage proliferation. We must support key international treaties that hold countries accountable and lead by example. Establishing more rational nuclear policies is the best expression of American leadership for a more peaceful future.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

Study: Nashville leads the nation when it comes to growing its employment ranks  Nashville Business Journal From 2015 to 2016, no other large metro area in the nation swelled its headcount of employed residents more dramatically than Middle Tennessee.
New Outcry as Trump Rebukes Charlottesville Racists 2 Days Later  The New York Times President Trump bowed to pressure that he personally condemn white supremacists who incited violence in Virginia, but neither supporters nor critics were satisfied.
Democrats press GOP to scrutinize rise in white supremacy  POLITICO House Democrats are calling on their GOP colleagues to hold congressional hearings on the rise of white supremacy and domestic terrorism following Saturday’s deadly outburst in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Deadly rally accelerates removal of Confederate statues  The Associated Press The deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, is fueling another re-evaluation of Confederate statues in cities across the nation, accelerating their removal in much the same way that a 2015 mass shooting by a white supremacist renewed pressure to take down the Confederate flag from public property.
Trump is back to tweeting alt-right memes  Vox One day after being pushed to condemn white supremacy and hate groups, President Donald Trump turned back to spreading the alt-right message — including retweeting, then deleting, a cartoon of a person superimposed with the CNN logo being run over by a train.
Trump campaign emails show aide’s repeated efforts to set up Russia meetings  The Washington Post Three days after Donald Trump named his campaign foreign policy team in March 2016, the youngest of the new advisers sent an email to seven campaign officials with the subject line: “Meeting with Russian Leadership - Including Putin.”
Bannon in Limbo as Trump Faces Growing Calls for the Strategist’s Ouster  The New York Times The president’s delay in denouncing neo-Nazis in Charlottesville has put new pressure on Stephen K. Bannon, who ran the Breitbart website.
North Korea Backs Off Threat to Hit Guam  The Wall Street Journal North Korea pulled back its threat to attack a U.S. territory, after days of trading increasingly bellicose rhetoric with President Donald Trump, and hours after China took its toughest steps against Pyongyang to support U.N. sanctions.
From Trump Aide to Single Mom  The Atlantic Last November, A.J. Delgado played a vital role on a winning campaign. Then everything fell apart.

What are your infrastructure priorities?

Click here to take my survey

Whether you’re sitting in your car, bumper-to-bumper on the highway, or sitting at your desk breezing through the information highway that is the Internet, infrastructure is impacting your daily life.  Roads and bridges, buildings and dams, broadband access – all across the 15th District, people are seeing the results of strategic investments in infrastructure, and that is why it remains a top priority for the 115th Congress.   In one way or another, every community in the 15th District relies on infrastructure improvements to grow and advance their business community, but it means something different in each county.  In Southeast Ohio, for instance, broadband internet access is unreliable at best, and in the 21st century, it is no longer a luxury, but a necessity in order to attract businesses and jobs.    As Congress addresses building up our nation's infrastructure, I want to hear from you. What infrastructure projects are your top priority? Click here to take my survey.  If you have any questions about this or any other federal issue, please feel free to contact my Washington, D.C. office at (202) 225-2015, Hilliard office at (614) 771-4968, Lancaster office at (740) 654-2654 or Wilmington office at (937) 283-7049.

Dear Friends, 
We must condemn the white supremacy and the hate which fueled the violence in Charlottesville over the weekend. This domestic terrorism does not define us as Americans. Those affected by these horrendous acts continue to be in my prayers.
Traveling from Houston to Austin
It was another great week traveling across my district, from Houston to Austin. I had the privilege of meeting with many great Texans who are helping to make our communities a better place.
Below you will find a few of the meetings and events that took place. 
Katy Fire Department Receives SAFER Grant   We announced exciting news for the Katy community: the city is a recipient of the SAFER Grant. This grant is awarded by FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to local communities so we can help strengthen the nation's ability to respond to fire-related incidents, and improve our overall levels of preparedness. This is a big win for Katy and the result of Fire Chief Wilson's, city officials', and our first responders' hard work.
Below I am making the announcement with Mayor Brawner and Fire Chief Wilson. 
￼
Harris County Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management   I visited the Harris County Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management and met with County Judge Ed Emmett and Emergency Management Coordinator Mark Sloan (pictured below). They gave me a tour of their impressive operations and provided me with an update of their latest concerns. I offered my assistance where needed in their emergency strategies and preparation for the county. Thank you for the great work you do in keeping our communities safe!
￼
Tomball Regional Medical Center
Thank you to the Center's hospital staff for the productive conversation about how we can improve the current healthcare system in order to better serve the patients you see every day. Your team does great work for our community - thank you.
￼
American Jewish Committee 
It was great to meet with members of the American Jewish Committee.  We had a very informative meeting to discuss current events, religion, and Israel, among other topics.
￼
Forums   I spoke at Prairie View A&M University to provide Texans with a congressional update.  This included the latest from healthcare to North Korea, the bill I recently introduced to secure our borders, and the work Congress has done to improve the care of our veterans, among other issues. 
￼
I had a great conversation with the La Grange Lions Club, providing them with a similar congressional update and engaging in a productive dialogue with their members. 
￼
Congressional updates are informative and needed, but what I love the most is to engage in direct conversation with my constituents. Thank you for the great questions and sharing your concerns with me - this is what helps me back in Washington, D.C. to better represent you. 
Fayette County Sheriff's Office and K-9 Unit   The Fayette County Sheriff's Office and K-9 Unit does great work seizing the drugs cartels attempt to smuggle in to our country through Texas. The officers showed me the different techniques used by smugglers and the challenges they face in their line of work so I can better assist them in my capacity. Last year alone, the Fayette County Office (with help from their dog, Lobos) collected 224.27 pounds of methamphetamine, 143.11 pounds of cocaine, 17.82 pounds of heroin, and 882.6 pounds of marijuana. Their hard work ensures that our communities are safer and more secure.
￼

Legislative Update
The House is currently in August district work period, so there were not any votes.
It continues to be a great honor to represent you in the United States House of Representatives. Please visit my website,www.mccaul.house.gov, for more information on constituent services, legislative updates, and the ongoing work in Congress.

What Happened in Charlottesville on Saturday
I am deeply saddened and revolted by the hate and violence that took place in Charlottesville over the weekend, and I am praying for the family and friends of Heather Heyer who was killed as well as the others injured. The racist and anti-Semitic views embraced by white supremacists have no place in our nation and do not reflect core American values of equality and religious freedom. We are all created in the image of God, and I strongly condemn such detestable views against fellow human beings. 
I thank the many brave law enforcement officers who responded to the scene. In addition to the violence on Saturday, it was difficult to hear the news that Virginia State Police's Lt. H. Jay Cullen and Trooper-Pilot Berke Bates were also killed in a helicopter crash in the Charlottesville area. My prayers are with their families and the law enforcement community as they mourn this loss. We are all praying for our Commonwealth to come together and heal at this difficult time. 
Just Announced ￼ Sixth District Vietnam Veterans Commemoration in Lexington
￼

Where: Lexington National Guard Armory at 95 Hines Lane in Lexington (behind Rockbridge County High School). 
Register Now: Vietnam veterans are asked to register in advance by visiting Goodlatte.House.Gov/VietnamVeterans. If you have questions about this event, please contact my office at 540-885-3861 or 540-857-2672. Please note that participants must be residents of the Sixth Congressional District of Virginia. 
More Info: Constituent service staff will also be on hand to assist veterans with issues they may have with the Department of Veterans Affairs or other federal agencies. This is a free, public event.

Opioid Crisis Declared a National Emergency
The opioid epidemic currently plaguing the United States is destroying lives, families, and communities, and it shows no signs of stopping. We've all heard the grim statistics: 91 Americans die each day from an opioid overdose. That is more than 33,000 a year. These people are our neighbors, friends, and loved ones.   While Congress has taken action to combat the opioid epidemic through the historic Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, it’s clear that we need more tools to combat this ever-growing problem. I commend President Trump for declaring the opioid crisis as a national emergency. This will bring much needed public awareness to the epidemic. Additionally, the House Judiciary Committee will continue to review our nation’s laws to determine if more resources are needed to combat the opioid crisis.

￼
UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY IN CHARLOTTESVILLE 
￼
I was heartbroken and appalled by the unspeakable violence by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend. This type of hatred is terrible and un-American, and it cannot be tolerated under any circumstances. I am thinking of and praying for those who were injured and the families of those who were killed. 
""MEET WITH MARTHA"" EVENT THIS WEEK 
  ￼
The month of August provides members of Congress valuable time away from Washington to have important conversations with our constituents. Alabama's Second Congressional District stretches from Autauga and Elmore Counties to the North, to Barbour and Henry Counties to the East, to Houston, Geneva, and Covington Counties to the South, to Butler and Conecuh Counties in the West. I visit each county regularly while also taking a number of meetings in my district offices in Montgomery, Dothan, and Andalusia. 
I find it is very helpful to connect to those I represent by hosting “Meet with Martha” events from time to time in various corners of the district. These are open house type events where we invite those who are interested to come visit with me one on one. There is an upcoming public meeting I wanted you to be aware of. The first “Meet with Martha” event will take place on Thursday, August 17th at 2:00 p.m. at Chappy’s Deli on Perry Hill Road in Montgomery. If you live in the area, I hope you’ll consider stopping by to say hello. Stay up to date via my social media pages for more specifics about this event and more to come.
AN UPDATE ON THE SITUATION WITH NORTH KOREA
A lot can change from week to week, and I want to share with you an update on the situation with North Korea. Tensions have escalated further since my recent column outlining the challenges this threat poses. While situations of this nature can be very alarming due to near constant cable news coverage, I want to reassure my fellow Alabamians that I don’t believe a conflict with North Korea is inevitable. 
I maintain that the best way to deal with the threat is through strong military deterrence, skilled diplomacy, and economic discipline. In fact, some progress has been made on all of these fronts recently. Militarily, the President has been direct and aggressive in making it clear that our armed forces are ready to defend the United States and its allies, including through our strategic missile defense systems. It is important to remember that the President is surrounded by very capable individuals like Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford, and his new Chief of Staff General John Kelly, among others. These are experienced, battle-tested individuals, many of whom I’ve come to know throughout my tenure in Congress. I trust their judgment and I am confident they are offering wise counsel to the President.
Diplomatic efforts might not always be publicized, but it was Secretary Mattis who signaled this work is ongoing and promising. Secretary Mattis said, ""My portfolio, my mission, my responsibility is to have military options should they be needed. However, right now, [with] Secretary Tillerson, Ambassador Haley, you can see the American effort is diplomatically led, it has diplomatic traction, [and] it is gaining diplomatic results.”
As for discipline, Congress overwhelmingly passed and the President signed into law H.R. 3364 imposing strict economic sanctions on hostile nations, including North Korea. Following suit, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to impose international penalties that would cost the North Korean regime as much as $1 billion in trade, which is a considerable amount for a country its size. Simply put, we have to get tough on other countries like China and Russia and make it clear that continuing to enable North Korea financially is unacceptable.
There’s no question the situation with North Korea is serious, and much is being done to make sure this threat is contained and neutralized.

Jeff Lynn, the Senior Executive Director of Workforce Development of the Alabama Community College System (ACCS), recently joined me in my Montgomery office for a meeting where he announced that ACCS has begun a local partnership with Walmart Logistics in Brundidge. Walmart will give employment priority to students earning a foundational MSSC Certified Logistics Technician (CLT) certification from participating Alabama colleges. This gives Alabama students a fantastic advantage to securing quality jobs at Walmart’s facility.
I’m proud to report that the first class towards this certification will take place in October of this year. Colleges participating in this partnership are Lurleen B. Wallace Community College (Andalusia, Opp, Greenville, and Luverne), Chattahoochee Valley Community College, Wallace State Community College in Dothan, and Enterprise State Community College.
Follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to keep up with my August district travel and upcoming public events. It is an honor to serve you in Congress. Please never hesitate to let me know if there is a way my office can be of assistance.   Sincerely, 
￼  Martha Roby
Member of Congress

News from Representative Ryan Costello
￼ 

Welcome to Ryan's Report, my weekly e-newsletter, and thank you for reading. While this was another busy week around the District – you can check out the sidebar for some of my stops along the way – the attention of the nation has been focused well beyond our Congressional District’s borders. “Breaking News” alerts from all corners of the globe - North Korea to Charlottesville, Virginia to Venezuela to Iran and Syria - have been the focus of many Americans, and I have also been monitoring them closely.
On the home front, over the weekend, we watched in horror as the atrocious events that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia unfolded.  I condemn this hate and violence in the strongest possible terms. To read the full statement I issued on Saturday, click here:
￼
While our country is rightfully outraged, angered and saddened by this violent and hateful incident, I also remain very concerned by the provocative rhetoric and instability of the foreign regimes in North Korea, Venezuela, Iran, and Syria – especially in light of accelerated and aggressive actions against the United States and our allies.
There should be no mistake that economic pressure is a powerful tool, which is why working together with our allies to steadily maintain strict sanctions is necessary to contain any illicit actions.There are many international diplomatic and economic tools that the U.S. can employ to mitigate threats before we have to consider heightened measures. In Congress, I will continue to back legislative efforts bolstering international cooperation and showing these countries they will be held accountable for disruptive and combative actions.
As you know from previous Ryan’s Reports, to counter these types of aggressive regimes, Congress has passed several pieces of legislation to help promote stability, assure America’s allies of our support for them, and strengthen diplomatic and financial pressure and sanctions. Two examples of such efforts –the Korean Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions Act (H.R. 1644) and the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (H.R. 3364) – are now law.
Keep reading for a full update on my week and information about my upcoming town hall in Lebanon County.
August 7 - August 11: At Work Around Our Community
Lebanon Town Hall 
￼
As part of my effort to hold town halls across our Congressional District – so far I’ve held town halls in West Chester (Chester County), Leesport (Berks County),  and Pottstown (Montgomery County).

Reading Regional Airport Grant
￼
On Tuesday, I had the opportunity to visit Reading Regional Airport in Berks County to receive an operations update and to announce a $1.8 million-dollar infrastructure grant as part of the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Airport Improvement Program. This grant program is intended to assist with safety at airports across the country.
By providing funds for a wildlife fence, the grant will help to avoid wildlife hazards here at the Reading Regional Airport.
You can click here to learn more about my visit andclick here to read the U.S. Department of Transportation's press release announcing the grant.



Congressional App Challenge
￼
As a member of the Congressional STEM Caucus and 21st Century Skills Caucus, I'm pleased to announce that for the third year in a row, my office will participate in the 2017 Congressional App Challenge. The Challenge is an opportunity for high school students to learn more about the importance of innovation in coding, science, technology, engineering, and math. I encourage students in our community to explore their interest in computer science and utilize their creativity skills.
Interested students in Pennsylvania’s Sixth Congressional District who would like to participate will need to develop an original app and submit it to the Challenge for judging no later than November 1, 2017. Apps must have been created within the calendar year prior to the closing date.
For more information and to register for the Challenge, please click here.

Still Working for You in Washington
Public Service Loan Forgiveness
Many teachers, first responders, and public health specialists are working hard to make a difference in their local communities while relying on the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. We must fulfill the promise made to these student borrowers over the past decade.
The program, which was created in 2007 to encourage individuals to pursue careers in public service, helps to forgive the remaining balance of federal Direct Loans owed by those in this sector -- including teachers, firefighters, police officers and other full-time public service workers -- after they have faithfully paid on those loans for 10 years – 120 on-time payments – during public service employment.
As the 10-year anniversary of the program approaches, I’m pleased to announce I am a co-founding member, along with Congressman Brendan Boyle (D-PA), of thePublic Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Caucus to advocate on behalf of these public servants.
Energy and Commerce Corner: FDA Reauthorization Update
￼
The U.S. Senate recently passed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Reauthorization Act. This legislation builds on years of work that aims to develop treatments, lower drugs costs, and prioritize patient safety. An essential part of the legislation allows the FDA to collect user fees from pharmaceutical companies in order to advance its important mission. Since the first pharmaceutical drug user fee agreement was passed in 1992, these agreements have taken proven steps to expedite drug development and maintain patient-safety.
This legislation is also critical to our local economy in Pennsylvania, as it will make sure our businesses remain competitive and keep up with emerging public health needs. I previously spoke about the importance of this legislation to Pennsylvania and our country, and also provided information on two bipartisan amendments I included in the bill. 
Now that the Senate has passed this legislation,it has been presented to the President andI will update you when it is considered by the President.
Next week, the August District Work Period continues and I will be hosting another town hall for constituents.
Sincerely,
￼ 
Ryan Costello
Member of Congress

Materials used to pave many of our major roadways in southeastern PA and beyond come from the Allan Myers quarry and asphalt plant in Charlestown Township, Chester County. The asphalt plant churns out approximately 500 tons of paving mix per hour and Allan Myers employs nearly 1,100 Pennsylvania residents.
￼
GK Elite Sportswear in Berks County designed and manufactured the uniforms worn by every gymnast who won a Gold and Silver medal at the Rio Olympics in 2016.
￼
Taking questions during town hall with employees at PJM Interconnection in Lower Providence Township, Montgomery County. Nearly 700 workers manage one of the world's largest energy grids, ensuring reliable power is available for our homes and workplaces.
￼
Workers at Novipax in Muhlenberg Township, Berks County manufacture air-tight trays and absorbent liners used to keep meat products fresh longer in the grocery store.
￼
The week of August 7 was National Ambulatory Surgery Center week and I met with physicians and medical professionals at the Paoli Surgery Center to discuss their efforts to provide excellent care and improve access to treatment.
￼
Nearly 50,000 southeastern PA workers make their living at a job related to travel and tourism. During a round table at Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site, I heard from representatives from Historic Sugartown in Chester County, the Colebrookdale Railroad in Berks and Montgomery counties, Pennsylvania's Americana Region office in Berks County and others about the positive economic boost provided by promoting our local historic and recreational assets as well as sports and entertainment venues.
￼
Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site Manager David Blackburn explains how the iron forged here played a key role in securing our country's independence and fueling our industrial growth.

Kansas Common Sense  August 14, 2017
Hello,
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. 
Charlottesville
The act of terror in Charlottesville on Saturday is a sobering reminder of the hateful element that still exists in America. White supremacy, bigotry and racism have no place in our society. We must all come together and denounce this hatred to the fullest extent. 
Hosting Townhalls Around The State
The next couple of weeks in Kansas will serve as an important opportunity to spend more time with Kansans as I visit all corners of our state. Kansas Listening Tours provide me with the opportunity to get feedback from Kansans that I need in order to do my job representing you in Washington.  I have always had a responsibility to Kansans to make myself available for questions and discussion, regardless of what the day’s “hot button” issue may be.  Last week, I hosted three townhall meetings in Barton, Cheyenne and Rawlins Counties.  Barton County: On Thursday, I hosted a townhall in Barton County at American AgCredit in Great Bend. It was good to hear from Barton County residents about health care and to discuss what’s next for reform. The conversation shifted toward efforts to maintain our way of life in rural Kansas by supporting common sense agriculture and trade policies. Other topics discussed were care for our veterans, the upcoming tax reform debate, NIH medical research and the importance of solving world hunger problems through USAID programs.  Thank you to the more than 70 attendees who spent their Thursday afternoon with me and to Greg Reno, Beth Slack and American AgCredit for hosting. Also, thanks to State Representative Tory Marie Arnberger for attending.
￼   Cheyenne County: I continued my Kansas Listening Tour in St. Francis on Friday, where we discussed Veterans care, advancing medical research to combat diseases, net neutrality, my call to have an open legislative process for healthcare, my latest bill to help Kansans access healthy food, the Farm Bill and trade with Cuba.  Thank you to State Senator Rick Billinger and to all of those from Cheyenne County for attending.
￼   Rawlins County: On Friday, I also hosted a townhall meeting in Rawlins County. We had a great discussion regarding the Veterans Choice Act, using the full legislative process to craft a healthcare bill, my bill to help more Kansans have access to healthy food, the Hearing Protection Act and the need to balance the budget. Thanks to the Rawlins County Health Center for hosting the Listening Tour.
￼
Visiting Marysville Veterans Cafe
I met with veterans in Marysville to discuss VA accountability, the Veterans Choice Program and the importance of both to their community during a Veterans Café meeting. Veterans Café is a regular gathering of local veterans to discuss veterans issues.  Marysville Hospital CEO Curtis Hawkins attended to update the group on implementation of Choice at the hospital and ways to alleviate operational concerns, including slow payments to the hospital. Marysville Hospital does not currently offer Choice, but I look forward to continuing my discussion with hospital executives and Choice officials to work toward this goal.  Thanks to RSVP of Northeast Kansas Executive Director Joni Spellmeier and American Legion Post #163 for hosting the event, and to the 50 people who took time out of their busy Wednesdays to meet with me.
￼
Participating in Startup Day Across America
In recognition of Startup Day Across America, I visited GRID Collaborative Workspaces in Overland Park for a conversation with several area entrepreneurs about the various challenges they face in starting and growing their businesses. Startup Day Across America is a national event encouraging elected officials and entrepreneurs to engage with one another to learn more about and promote entrepreneurship within their communities, creating a good opportunity to sit down with these businesses.  Representatives of several local startups joined the conversation about specific challenges facing Kansas City’s startup community and shared their ideas about how to address them. We touched on several topics, including improving access to capital; growing, attracting and retaining talent; and the need to improve the tax code by making it simpler, more predictable and more encouraging of investment.  Thanks to The Grid for hosting the roundtable, to the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation for coordinating the discussion and to the entrepreneurs that attended: Tara Tamburello of People Works, Vincent Rodriguez of Maps Coffee Roasters, Chad Schofield of BioGen, Mark Calhoun of Perfect Cube, Jim Starcev of Perfect Cube, Josh Wendel of Phisionary, Anthony West of Thirsty Paws, Stuart Ludlow of RFP365 and Sam Adams of Bydand Digital. 
Visiting Village Shalom in Kansas City
I met with representatives from Village Shalom and the Jewish Federation of Kansas City to discuss Medicaid and the impact healthcare policy has on their operations. These organizations partner to provide funding services for elderly individuals who require skilled nursing, reside in the assisted living facilities or utilize the day-stay program. The staff provided me with an insightful view into their operations and how federal healthcare policy impacts their daily lives.  Thanks to Village Shalom CEO Matt Lewis, Jewish Federation of Greater Kansas City President and CEO Dr. Helene Lotman and Jewish Federation of Greater Kansas City Chairman John Isenberg for hosting me.
Joining AMC Theatres Employees for a Townhall Meeting in Leawood
AMC Theatres, which operates more than 300 locations across the country, has been headquartered in the Kansas City area for more than 95 years. I stopped by the Leawood headquarters on Wednesday morning to tour their operations and meet with their staff.  During the visit, AMC hosted a townhall for their 500 employees where we discussed healthcare, pro-growth tax reform, North Korea and international affairs, and working toward returning to civility in Washington. My thanks to AMC CEO Adam Aron and his leadership team for inviting me and to Leawood Mayor Peggy Dunn and Leawood Chamber CEO Kevin Jeffries for attending. 
￼  
Sending Letters to Wells Fargo and National General Holdings Corporation
As Chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security, I am responsible for conducting appropriate Congressional oversight of consumer products and services.  On Wednesday, I joined my Senate Commerce Committee colleagues from both sides of the aisle in sending a letter to the chief executives of National General Holdings Corporation (National General) and Wells Fargo & Company to inquire about their insurance sales practices following troubling reports that the companies “failed to ensure that customers were not charged for coverage if they already had their own policies.”   Additionally, I held a subcommittee hearing earlier this month to evaluate the general issue of insurance fraud in America and its impact on industry and, more importantly, consumers.   The full letter to National General may be viewed here and the full letter to Wells Fargo & Co may be viewed here. 
Meeting With the Kansas Association of Broadcasters
On Monday, I stopped by KCTV5’s offices in Fairway to meet with a group of Kansas Association of Broadcasters executives. We talked about my bipartisan legislation, The Viewer and Listener Protection Act of 2017, which aims to help television and radio stations comply with the FCC’s proposed channel reassignments, more commonly known as “repack.”    I remain concerned that rural America will be disproportionately harmed if Congress does not take action to provide adequate resources and an appropriate timeline for the relocation of TV and radio stations. We also discussed the potential of tax reform and provisions in the tax code that broadcasters find useful.
Attending the Greater KC Chamber Dinner with Kansas City Business Leaders
On Tuesday, I met with Kansas City business leaders and Greater KC Chamber leadership. They updated me on their KC Rising initiative – a 20-year vision to increase the Kansas City region’s economic growth with the ultimate goal of landing in the Top 10 of KC’s peer metros in Quality jobs, GDP, and Median Household income. We also discussed healthcare, corporate tax reform, trade with Mexico, and national security, including the latest with North Korea. 
Remembering My Friend Bob Schmidt
Robba and I are deeply saddened by the news of our friend Bob Schmidt’s passing. Bob was among a few of our hometown’s most significant citizens – no one has made more of a difference in the well-being of our part of the state than Bob. From his service in the Navy to his time at Fort Hays State University to his work growing KAYS Radio into Eagle Communications, his natural leadership and generous spirit were clear to all who knew him.  I’m grateful for our many years of friendship, and my family’s thoughts and prayers are with Bob’s loved ones during this difficult time. We will miss him greatly.

Surveying Storm Damage in Wakeeney
Friday afternoon, I stopped by Wakeeney to see the damage from a severe thunderstorm with baseball sized hail and high winds that passed through Trego County late Thursday. The response teams and many volunteers have been working around the clock to clean up and help those in need. I’m inspired by everyone in the community who has come together to assist and support their neighbors.   Thank you to all who have lent a hand and to Emergency Manager Kathleen Fabrizius, Sheriff Richard Hanks, Police Chief Ashley Garza, Trego County Rural Fire Chief Chad Mann, Mayor Kenny Roy, County Commissioner Wes Hobbs and Wildlife and Parks Game Warden Matt Schmidt for a briefing of the damage and their leadership following the storm.
￼
The Eclipse Across America
On Monday, Aug. 21, all eyes will be up in NE Kansas to view the Total Solar Eclipse – one of the best viewing locations in the country. Communities around NE Kansas have been planning for the “once-in-a-lifetime” event for years: the last time the Kansas City area saw a total solar eclipse this close was in 1806, and the next time won’t be until 2205. The “path of totality” will clip the NE corner of our state at approximately 1:00 p.m. CDT.   After discussing the event with many people in Marysville last week, I know they’re excited and ready for visitors. I encourage everyone planning to view “The Eclipse Across America” to travel safely, plan ahead and visit https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/ for more information about this educational and historic event.
￼
Honored to Serve You in Washington
It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

Around the District

Women in Business Roundtable On August 7 in Santa Clarita I met with local women – owned small businesses from all over the district. I heard from about their concerns, needs and issues to see how my office can better serve them. I shared details about the legislation I have passed and the bills I am working on now to help small businesses. As Chairman of the Small Business Subcommittee on Contracting and Workforce it is important to make sure that small businesses have “seat at the table” and have their voices heard. Thank you to everyone who came out and participated!
￼
Women's Business Roundtable
Congratulations John! Sunday my staff attended the Eagle Scout Ceremony for John Bystrom. John lost his father three years ago and through the support of his church family and the scouts, John has achieved a remarkable feat. The ceremony took place at St. Peter Claver Parish in Simi Valley. John's final project was to build a viewing stand for his sister's riding stable. Congrats to John and his family on this much deserved accomplishment.

Airbolt Industries Inc. Also on August 9 I met with Airbolt Industries, Inc., a family owned business with 13 employees, operating in their new 7,000 sq ft facility here in Santa Clarita Valley. They manufacture aerospace components and are very happy with the support they've received from Santa Clarita since making the move. I was happy to learn about the products they build and opportunities they have provided our community. Small businesses like these are what grow an economy and expand our job force at home.

I am deeply saddened by the news of three marines who lost their lives in the MV-22 Osprey incident off the coast of Australia. My thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones. Their sacrifice will never be forgotten.

The Webster Wire
Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends:
The violence perpetrated by Nazi-sympathizers and White nationalists this weekend do not represent American or Christian ideals.  These attitudes and actions are an abhorrence that cheapen our most precious gift – life. Furthermore, they  violate Scripture and the ideals our country was founded upon that ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.’ 
My heart grieves for the men, women and children who were on the receiving end of yesterday’s hateful actions. I pray for comfort for the families that lost a loved one. I pray also for healing for our country and that each of us would seek to serve others, not ourselves. Unkindness and hatred cannot coexist with a focus on serving others. 
_______________
It was great hearing from and speaking with the constituents who attended my listening sessions in their neighborhoods this week. Thank you for coming and sharing your concerns about healthcare and the budget. I appreciate every one of my constituents. I’d like to see a health care bill that provides the care we need, at a price we can afford, with the doctor we choose. I’m going to use my position the best I can to benefit you.
￼

￼
  I had the privilege of attending the Leesburg Area Chamber of Commerce Teacher Appreciation Breakfast. Teachers and staff were treated to a morning of fun, food, and a few gifts as they prepared to welcome students back to their classrooms. Thank you to all our teachers for your dedicated work – you are making a difference in the lives of your students. 
 
_______________
America’s small businesses are the backbone of our economy accounting for 54 percent of all American sales and 55 percent of American jobs. It was a pleasure to visit a small business in the Villages last week – Flippers Pizzeria - and make and serve pizza to the customers. Thank you to the owners, Sean and Carolyn Pankalla, for allowing me to visit.  I was enjoyed being able to attend the Sumter County Chamber luncheon, hear guest speaker Jim Duncan with SECO Energy speak and meet other local business leaders. 
￼ ￼
_______________
￼
  Touring the Key Training Center, a non-profit serving adults with developmental disabilities, was encouraging as I saw firsthand the incredible work they are doing.  This center is the only one of its kind in Citrus County and surrounding areas.



I also enjoyed visiting The Path’s Farm and seeing firsthand how The Path is providing hope to the homeless population in Citrus and Marion Counties through their Farm Project. Serving as a work program for men and women at The Path, the farm supplies not only The Path’s rescue shelter, but also community feeding programs in Citrus County.
￼
_______________
I was honored to deliver flags flown over the United States Capitol as a token of my appreciation to VFW Post 4864, Tri-City, Inc. FL Post 18, and American Legion Post 347. We owe a debt to our veterans for their service and sacrifices.

Constituent Corner
A constituent from Bushnell contacted my office because she was taking her daughter to Aruba for a graduation gift, but she had not received her daughter’s passport even after sending additional documents to the passport center. My office placed an inquiry with the National Passport Center and were informed that they had located the passport application and expedited the review. The Passport Center later approved the passport and mailed it overnight so that it would arrive in time for the vacation. 
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.
District Update
Last week, I also had the opportunity to deliver school supplies to the Educational Foundation of Lake County and the Citrus County Education Foundation in support of our local students and teachers.

Improving Healthcare
￼
On Monday, I toured the Maternal Fetal Medicine Clinic and the Behavioral Health Emergency Room at the University Medical Center in New Orleans.
Our hospitals in Louisiana are doing great work and I will continue to support them in their efforts.
 
Strengthening Mental Health Services
￼
I also met with medical professionals at the LSU Health Sciences Center who received grants from the National Institute of Mental Health.
It is important that we fund mental health services in America.  Late last year, I passed legislation into law as part of the 21st Century Cures Act which will do that.  You can learn more about the legislation here.
 
Recovering from Floods
￼
On Tuesday, I toured Liuzzas Restaurant and Bar and areas in New Orleans affected by last weekends floods.
I will continue to work in Washington to secure flood relief for families and businesses throughout Louisiana.
 
Protecting Energy Jobs
￼
Finally, I wrote a letter to President Trump urging him to protect Gulf oil refiners from indirect harm caused by potential Venezuelan energy sanctions.
I support a coordinated, multi-lateral approach that deprives the Maduro regime in Venezuela of funding options.  We can accomplish that while protecting Louisiana energy jobs.  You can read our letter here.

August 14, 2017
Dear Friend,
I’m beginning to understand what Johnny Cash was singing about when he said, “I’ve been everywhere, man.” Over the past couple of weeks, I feel like I’ve visited most of the nooks and crannies of our region.
Yesterday, I completed my summer town hall tour. I held one in each of the six counties that I represent (thanks to all who showed up in Chimacum, Tacoma, Port Angeles, Poulsbo, Belfair, and Aberdeen). Plus, I did a Seniors Town Hall on Bainbridge Island and took questions at both the Poulsbo and Port Orchard Chambers of Commerce. 
For those wondering...YES -- Next time, I am indeed thinking of getting Johnny Cash-like tour t-shirts printed.
In all seriousness, I work for you, so it’s important for me to be accountable and accessible to you. It was so great to see so many of you engaged in the process and contributing to our democracy. I got to share a bit about what’s happening in Washington D.C. and some of the upcoming deadlines this Congress needs to deal with (more on that in my next newsletter). 
I also learned a lot from the town hall meetings we did. It was an opportunity to learn more about what’s on your mind. I fielded questions on everything from healthcare to climate change to the federal budget to North Korea.  
If you weren’t able to attend but have a question or suggestion for me, I invite you to email me here:  https://kilmer.house.gov/contact/email-me
￼
￼
￼
￼
 Promoting New Opportunities  
In addition to conducting town hall meetings, I’ve been making a point of visiting a number of the local employers in our region (we call those “Kilmer at Your Company” visits . . . which I think is pretty darn catchy). When we visit local employers, it gives me an opportunity to learn more about their businesses, to thank them for employing people in our region, and to find ways where I can help them stay and grow in our community.
For example, I recently visited Polymer Industries in Tacoma – a local plastics manufacturer – where we discussed issues ranging from tax reform to government contracting. I had a delicious visit with the folks at Mora’s Iced Creamery in Poulsbo where we discussed the importance of having predictable permitting processes when a business is trying to grow. I heard from the leaders out at the Interfor Mill in Port Angeles about federal forest management issues and addressing forest fire risks. And at Brown & Brown in Tacoma we grappled with everything from health care insurance to flood insurance.
I’m committed to seeing us grow economic opportunities in every community. While Seattle is an economic juggernaut right now, many of the communities on the Olympic Peninsula haven’t fully felt the economic recovery. That’s why I’m working hard for jobs in every zip code – so people can find good jobs outside the shadow of the Space Needle.  
As someone who grew up in Port Angeles, I was particularly excited about a couple of visits I had there last week. 
In a nondescript-looking building near the airport, you can find something special – advanced manufacturing happening in our neck of the woods. The Composite Recycling Technology Center in Port Angeles is a hub where they are transforming carbon scrap into products – providing economic opportunities that enable people to earn a paycheck, driving innovation to create new products, and taking scrap out of the waste stream to help our environment.   
While the CRTC is still in its infancy, it is already doing some really cool things. I watched a pickleball paddle being put together, saw work they are doing to build lightweight hockey sticks, and witnessed testing on a lightweight, durable automobile seat. 
Excitingly, many of the folks who showed me these items were students. These young people are home for the summer and getting real world experience in our region. It’s allowing them to realize that cool careers can be found on the peninsula.  
I’ll point out that the visit also highlighted the importance of federal funding. The CRTC was funded, in part, through a grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration. In fact, when the Secretary of Commerce recently testified in front of the House Appropriations Committee, I referenced the importance of that funding -- and mentioned that I disagreed with the president’s proposal to eliminate the Economic Development Administration in his budget.
And speaking of growing quality jobs – I also checked out the future site of Airborne Environmental Control Systems in Port Angeles. Bill Lee recently decided to move his company back home. With help from the Washington State Department Commerce, the Governor's Strategic Reserve Fund, and Impact Washington, they are off to a quick start.
Bill hopes to eventually bring more than 100 jobs to Port Angeles. Impact Washington, which is providing assistance to the company as it gets up and running, is funded – in part – through the U.S. Manufacturing Extension Partnership program of the Department of Commerce. This, too, is slated for elimination in the president’s budget. According to independent analysis, elimination of the MEP would cost our country roughly 41,000 jobs. 
These are federal resources that help communities grow private sector jobs and economic opportunities – and that provide opportunities outside of large metropolitan areas.
Giving folks a home 
On a bright and sunny day, I joined the Tacoma Housing Authority, local leaders, and my colleagues Representative Denny Heck and Senator Patty Murray to celebrate the development of new public housing at Bay Terrace on the Hilltop of Tacoma. After the ribbons were cut and the crowd went home – families and individuals had keys for homes of their own. 
This project is more than just 48 housing units. It represents a fresh start for the working mom who has juggled jobs while looking an affordable home for her kids. 
It represents opportunity for young people who now have positive things to say “yes” to – including one of the coolest basketball courts I’ve ever seen.
It represents a safe home for the senior citizen who wants to live in a place where they can talk to neighbors and relax in a community garden. 
When I walked around these grounds I thought about those stories that will unfold in the coming years. And it gave me hope. 
￼
￼
￼
Supporting Workers 
I also got some hope when I met with the Washington State Building and Construction Trades Council in Tacoma last week.    
I was pleased to say “thank you” to the men and women who are working on projects that are not only putting people to work now – they are laying the foundation for economic growth over the long haul.  
I was pleased to say “thank you” for the apprenticeship opportunities that these leaders are providing and for the work they are doing to evangelize the value of the trades.
I was pleased to say “thank you” for the Helmets to Hardhats program that is helping military members transition into the trades and enabling them to earn a great living.
I was pleased to say “thank you” for the work that was done at Naval Base Kitsap that came in literally hundreds of millions of dollars under-budget.
And I was pleased to say “thank you” for the work these leaders do to advocate for good pay and worker safety.
As Congress considers an infrastructure bill in the months ahead, I want to make sure it makes sense for the men and women who are going to do the work. When taxpayer funds are used to build a road or a bridge or a pier, it’s also an opportunity to build the middle class. It’s an opportunity to build the next generation of workers.
￼
Academy Night
Finally, a note for young people who are interested in service:  If you or someone you know is interested in attending a United States Military Academy, please join me on Thursday, August 17 from 5:30-6:30pm at the Norm Dicks Government Center in Bremerton to learn more about the academies and application processes. I hope to see you there. 
Working for You 
It was an honor to meet with the Cyber Warriors of the 262nd Network Warfare Squadron this weekend at Joint Base Lewis McChord. We spoke about legislation I’m working on to ensure that our communities are prepared for cyber threats. Many of these guard members work at some of the top tech firms in our region, but they serve their nation and our state by defending our networks and critical infrastructure. Stay tuned in the months ahead to learn more about the bill that I’m working on.
￼
It was terrific to join members of the community for the Asia Pacific Cultural Center’s 20th Annual Polynesian Luau in South Tacoma. I’m grateful to the folks at the APCC for all they do to celebrate the diversity of our region.
￼
As the son of two school teachers and the dad of two little girls in public school, I always try to thank educators for doing some of the most important jobs on the planet. I visited the Washington Education Association’s Olympic Council and voiced my support for public education.
￼
Thank you to Partnerships for Action, Voices for Empowerment (aka PAVE) in Tacoma for sitting down with me to share their priorities. We discussed the importance of Medicaid for people with disabilities and some of the challenges facing military families with children with disabilities. I appreciated their advocacy and am committed to ensuring that all people can live with dignity.
￼
OK – that’s it for this time. Thanks again to everyone who attended one of my town halls. As always, I’m honored to represent you.

Sincerely,
￼ 
Derek Kilmer

Dear Friend,
We are living in an ever-changing world, where new technology is transforming how our economy works. That’s why I’m committed to making sure workers have the opportunity to pursue skills training so they can thrive and succeed in today’s high-demand jobs. Last week, I visited Granite State College to discuss my legislation, the Workforce Development Investment Act of 2017, and hear directly from students, college administrators, and business leaders about how we can increase economic opportunity for workers in New Hampshire and across the country. 
￼
Discussing my legislation, the Workforce Development Investment Act of 2017 at Granite State College last week. 
My legislation would create tax incentives to encourage companies to partner with education providers to develop workforce training programs for skills that are in demand within their community or region. These training partnerships would be present in both higher education and K-12 schools throughout the state. Companies know what they're looking for in employees and my proposal will help them access and develop the workforce they need right here at home. It's a win for workers, win for our businesses, and a win for our economy.  Employers and educators in New Hampshire are already collaborating on innovative training partnerships and this legislation will help make those partnerships easier and better. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together and pass this commonsense legislation.  
Technology and our economy will continue to progress and evolve. The choice is ours on whether we’ll step up to the plate and lead our state into the future we want or if we’ll stand on the sideline and let the next generation of jobs and careers pass us by. I’m fighting for the future and I hope you’ll join me. 
Sincerely,

On 4-Stop Tour, Democratic Leaders Try to Reconnect With Workers
By Nick Corasaniti AUG. 14, 2017
Representatives Mark DeSaulnier of California, Mark Pocan of Wisconsin and Donald Norcross of New Jersey finished a four-stop, cross-country tour on Aug. 4 that set out to [...] understand and tap into the economic anxiety felt by many working class voters.  ... 
Along with Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan, who could not make the final leg of the trip, the four Democratic House members are planning to release their report, “The Future of Work, Wages and Labor,” in the coming months.  ...
Mr. Norcross told the crowd in the Teamsters hall that there were more than 200 attorneys in the House of Representatives. “There’s one electrician, one painter, and one iron worker and one carpenter. We need some more help folks. We need some more.

Dear Friends,
The country witnessed an act of domestic terror in Charlottesville, VA, as neo-Nazis and white supremacists chanted ugly, hateful speech and incited violence. We mourn the three lives that were tragically taken, including a brave woman standing up for American values.
In the face of hate and intolerance, we must stand strong and unified for love, justice, and mutual support. We must make it clear to neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and anyone who holds their abhorrent views, that in our America, we reject racism, bigotry, and violence.
We won’t let hate take hold.
We won’t let hate win.

Courage,

Commentary: Local Impact of Immigration
Congressman Gerry Connolly 
White House Advisor Stephen Miller took pains last week to point out that Emma Lazarus’ sonnet, “The New Colossus,” was not affixed to the Statue of Liberty when she was unveiled in 1886. He, of course, was right in fact but wrong in spirit.
The famed “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses” lines were added 20 years later, but have come to represent the American ideal that we are a nation of immigrants, enthusiastically welcoming those from any background who want to come here, work hard, and play by the rules. Here in Fairfax County, we not only embrace that ideal, we recognize it as the lifeblood of our astounding economic success story. 
President Trump and the senators pushing the RAISE Act, a bill to severely restrict legal immigration into the United States, would have you believe a dramatic increase in immigrants leads to economic decline and lower wages, not to mention higher crime rates and a host of other social ills. If anyone from the White House made the 15-mile trip to Fairfax County, they would learn the opposite is true.
In 1970 less than 4 percent of Fairfax’s population was foreign born. Today that number is 30.7 percent, more than double the rate in the country at large. But that dramatic increase in immigration did not lead to the kind of dystopia the President envisions. Instead, since 1970, Fairfax County has become an economic colossus that drives our state’s economy and is envied across the globe. Household income is among the highest in the nation, crime rates remain at historic lows, and our community hums with the kind of economic dynamism that drives innovation and long-term productivity growth.
How did we get here? Undoubtedly we’ve capitalized on our proximity to, and our partnership with, the federal government. But the facts are quite clear that the dramatic increase in foreign-born immigration has accelerated our economic success. Immigrants in Fairfax are primarily working age, more likely to start a business, less likely to commit crimes, and contribute to economic growth in both high-skilled and low-skilled fields, creating technology firms worth billions and caring for the elderly as home care workers. Immigrants have revitalized many of our older neighborhoods, adding $7,383 to the value of each and every home in our county, according to the Partnership for a New American Economy. The results speak for themselves. Foreign-born immigrants have fueled our success.
But Fairfax is not alone. Small towns, rural communities, and large cities across the country have capitalized on the economic vitality and opportunities created when immigrants show up and get to work. Welcoming “the homeless, the tempest-tost” is the moral thing to do, but right here in President Trump’s own backyard we’ve proven that’s it the smart thing to do.  http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2017/aug/09/commentary-local-impact-immigration/

Dear Friend,  Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to review some of the highlights of what happened last week.
Tragedy in Charlottesville  Over the weekend, we saw some of the worst in humanity. We saw white supremacists turn to acts of domestic terrorism murdering a young woman and injuring others. Racism, bigotry and hatred have no place America. This tragedy has shed light on a serious problem that we must work together to solve.  I am pleased that the Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into this matter. I join all Americans in condemning these cowardly acts of racial violence.
American Made Energy Heading Overseas  In positive energy news, the U.S. Energy Information Administration recently reported that American natural gas exports exceeded imports in three of the first five months. More American energy going overseas means jobs and economic growth here at home.  It also means, we can help provide our allies with energy instead of forcing them to rely on rogue nations like Iran and Russia. As I’ve always said, American made energy is good for our economy and national security. 
I’m honored to represent you in Congress. For more information on constituent services, current legislation or to sign up for my E-newsletter, please visit my website, www.olson.house.gov. 
Very respectfully, Pete Olson

August - Busy Month Already
￼
￼


Talofa Lindsey,

August has been a busy month already. 

By tradition, Congress is out of session for this entire month to allow Members to spend time in their districts talking directly to constituents and occasionally fact-finding activities. Already this month, I’ve been blessed to do both. 

I started the month on a fast-paced trip to Europe with other Members of Congress to examine best practices in several countries, including coastal areas, regarding energy and natural resources. Known as a CODEL (Congressional delegation), this trip is part of my duties on the Natural Resources Committee, and was highly informative.

Immediately after the trip, I arrived home in American Samoa for several town halls to talk to as many of you as possible about any issue that is on your minds, and to host a veteran’s choice healthcare workshop. I’ve enjoyed so much talking with many of you over the past few days.

It’s a pleasure to be home!

Soifua, 

￼



 

Keeping Current
￼

Even when Congress is not in Washington, there’s always still news from the nation’s capital city. I want to let you know about two in particular from the past few days. 
￼

Veterans healthcare access: 

First, I was invited to the White House announcement of action to take a good step forward in making healthcare more readily available to the veterans of American Samoa. Veterans here in the islands face travel costs and delays for medical attention, but technology can help. I appreciated this announcement of new features in the VA health system, and we will continue to work on legislative solutions for full telehealth access to doctors. All of us on the Veterans Affairs Committee understand the importance of these issues to our veterans, and care deeply about ensuring that a veteran can get the services they need. Read the President’s remarks and more here.
￼

Building better communications: 

The second one also is about the challenge of extending better communications throughout American Samoa. The American Samoa Telecommunications Authority (ASTCA) needed a waiver from the FCC to preserve proper licensing and continue efforts to make more services available to American Samoans through LTE infrastructure. I directly requested action on this both to former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and then current Chairman Ajit Pai on behalf of all of us in American Samoa, so we can use ever-improving communications that overcome our economic and geographic isolation. Read more here.


Highlights
￼


Thank you for your service: 

Our sincere congratulations and appreciation to Command Sergeant Major Charles M. Tobin! He retired from the United States Army this month after nearly 34 years of service. CSM Tobin is a native of Pago Pago, American Samoa and Lotopa Village, Samoa, and joined the Army in October 1983. Read more about Charles and his service here. 

￼
￼

￼

Nominated: 

Also, on July 20, I was pleased to introduce the President’s nominee for the position of Assistant Secretary of Insular Areas, Doug Domenech, in the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee hearing room. I appreciate Doug’s willingness to serve, and his substantial knowledge of these issues. He will be a great asset to the Administration in an important role for American Samoa. Read more about the nominee here.
￼


Congrats: 

Finally, here’s a fun congratulations going out to our Samoan community in Maryland. Lusia Cole was sworn in as the student member of the Anne Arundel Board of Education – and on this Board the student member has full membership rights. Keep up the good work, Lusia! Learn more about her here.
￼

News to Know 
￼

Cancer Prevention: 

In late July, I was happy to announce substantial grants to American Samoa for cancer prevention – such an important cause. These grants are through the Health and Human Services Department and total over $630,000. Read about these cancer prevention efforts here.

￼

￼

 Increased Medicaid Access:

Let me tell you about an important change to Medicaid eligibility that will really help out here at home. Starting on October 1 of this year, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has changed the eligibility levels of Medicaid qualification in American Samoa from 200 percent of Federal Poverty Level (FPL) to 400 percent. What does this mean? It means that more American Samoans will qualify for health services. Read the facts here. 

￼


DIA Grant: 

On August 1, I was also pleased to announce a grant of $2,000 from the Department of Insular Affairs to the American Samoan government. Read the details here.

￼

Major Aviation Grants:

Also in July, I had the opportunity to announce three grants from the FAA totaling $2 million for aviation in American Samoa. These funds serve three airports on three islands, including runway upkeep and longevity projects for Pago Pago and Ofu, as well as safety and rescue upgrades at Fitiuta. Details here. 


Committee Action


GI Bill: 

In late July, in our work on the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, we passed a series of bills that will go on to the next legislative step, including The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017. This bill makes improvements for veteran and service member education covered under the G.I. Bill. More information is available here.

￼
￼


Healthcare focus:

Also in July, the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indian, Insular, and Alaska Natives held an oversight hearing on the status of LBJ hospital. The purpose of this hearing was to examine possible ways to improve the hospital and ensure access to quality healthcare for American Samoans. I introduced legislation that partners GAO with DOI, VA, and CMS to perform a feasibility study to facilitate any new hospital renovation or construction, or other possible solutions and improvements. Read about it here

8/14/17 15:33,"Too Little, Too Late","￼
August 14, 2017
Dear Friend,
This weekend's events have truly shocked me as much as they have the rest of the nation. Three people lost their lives and scores were wounded during the 'Unite the Right' rally that was organized and attended by a volatile combination of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and others that make up the 'alt-right'.  But it wasn't just the deplorable violence and murder that was so shocking, it was also the sense that President Trump was reticent to condemn white supremacists for who they really are. Sure, he has said that he opposes violence, but for days it was clear that he did not want to reject the twisted and hateful beliefs that unite this disgusting movement.  For most of us they are a sick, racist subculture that we only encounter in history books or the movies. But for President Trump they are a part of his political base that he is sheepish about criticizing and whose connections run directly through White House adviser Steve Bannon, who ran the alt-right publication Breitbart.   The President of the United States should serve as an example for the rest of the country, but it appears that the rest of us have to serve as an example for him.   We should all join those that had the courage to stand up to these racists in Charlottesville, VA and do what President Trump should have done from the very beginning: condemn white supremacists and their hateful rhetoric. 
Sincerely,
￼

Click here if you have trouble viewing this email
￼
Dear Friend:  
￼
Healthcare is a vital and passionate issue for Georgia’s 13th Congressional District. As your Representative, I continue to fight for a thriving healthcare system in this country, which focuses on prevention and better health outcomes for all Americans. That is why each year I host a Health Fair for my constituents to receive free preventive medicine and medical screenings from our region’s leading healthcare professionals. Join me at this year’s 13th Annual Health Fair on Saturday, August 19, from 9 am to 2 pm, at Mundy’s Mill High School in Jonesboro. 
Register now for the 13th Annual Health Fair at Mundy’s Mill High School.  
I urge you to attend and take advantage of a host of free screenings at the Health Fair including: breast cancer screenings, prostate cancer exams, HIV testing, blood pressure checks, blood donation, body mass index, dental, glucose, kidney function tests, cholesterol, orthopedic, spinal, general vision, glaucoma and others.  
Participants include Emory Hospital, Grady Health System, Morehouse School of Medicine, WellStar, AID Atlanta, Sisters By Choice, Resurgens Orthopedics, Radiotherapy Clinics, YourTown Health, American Kidney Fund, and many more. Click here for a full list of participating healthcare providers. The Atlanta VA Medical Center and VA Regional Office will return to provide mental health services, medical appointment scheduling, disability claims updates, and referrals for veterans services.
Throughout my years in public service, I have been an advocate for women’s health. That is why I introduced three resolutions that bring awareness to specific women’s health concerns: uterine fibroids, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and endometriosis. I am proud to partner with PCOS Challenge, Inc., who will be at our 2017 Health Fair, to bring awareness to PCOS. With my introduction of H. Res. 495, it is the first time Congress has ever independently recognized PCOS, and I am honored to lead this historic, bipartisan effort.
I look forward to seeing you on Saturday at our 13th Annual Health Fair. Bring your family! Bring a veteran! Admission is free but please come early to take full advantage of the Health Fair. 
For more information, please visit www.davidscott.house.gov or call 770-432-5405. I also encourage you to follow me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for up-to-date information on the Health Fair and my work on your behalf in Washington.

It’s Time to Restore Our Democracy – and Get Congress Back to Work on the People’s Business
￼  Click on the screen above and I’ll explain why 24-7 campaign fundraising is damaging Congress’s ability to govern, and people’s confidence in our political system. 
The Restore Democracy Revolution
Dear Friend,
By themselves, any of the measures in our Restore Democracy bill would constitute a major boost for our democratic process. Taken together, they are nothing short of revolutionary in scope.
When it comes to our politics and public policy, people’s number one concern is a rigged economic system perpetuated by special interest money and endless campaign fundraising - and they’re not wrong. When you go to Washington you should go to work on the people’s business – not raising money for the next election. To be clear, I don’t raise money on the people’s dime. But the cold hard fact is that many Members of Congress spend more time fundraising than doing the job they were elected to do. So our Restore Democracy legislation calls for an end to campaign fundraising by members of Congress and their challengers while Congress is in session.
Congress’s 24/7 fixation on fundraising at the expense of governing is destroying people’s confidence in our system, discouraging good people from running for public office, and perverting public policy. Reform must happen for our representative democracy to be real and survive.
As former Republican Congressman David Jolly and I told 60 MINUTES last year, recommendations by campaign experts that Members of Congress spend 30 to 40 hours a week at ‘Call Centers’ and Washington fundraisers take a terrible toll on Congress’s ability to solve problems and get things done. No wonder Congress continues to miss legislative deadlines and bring our Nation to the brink of a federal government shutdown year after year. (Scroll down for that story.) You can’t govern from a Call Center. 
Along with our Restore Democracy legislation, we are continuing to build support for our bipartisan Stop Act, which would prohibit members of Congress from making any direct requests for money – period. To be clear, the Stop Act would still permit Members of Congress to attend fundraising events and speak to donors. Citizens would still be allowed to contribute to campaigns of their choosing. However, the practice of “dialing for dollars” and making direct requests for money would be a thing of the past. It’s a simple, common sense policy that already applies to judicial elections in 30 states.
The Restore Democracy Revolution
The foundation lies in putting a stop to special interests spending unlimited amounts of secret money to influence government and elections. Our legislation would also put Congress on record supporting small donor-public campaign financing and limiting the campaign season. Moreover, we are calling for full disclosure of all campaign contributions, establishment of national online voter registration and a halt to all voter suppression.
We also call for a return to Congress’s traditional process of Regular Order. Under Regular Order, we compromise and find bipartisan solutions by fully considering every idea and amendment under an open rule – and affording each one an up or down vote. That’s how Congress fixed things, solved problems and got things done for more than 200 years. It’s time to get back to that tried and true method of serving the American people.   We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email.
Sincerely, ￼

Duluth Roundtable Focuses on Fixing Veterans Choice, Boosting Quality Care for Rural Military Veterans
￼  Military Veterans tell us the Veterans Choice program is a great idea that’s not working as intended - and we need to be bold, creative and open to new ideas in order to finally get it right.
Our efforts to reform the Veterans Choice health care program intensified in late July as Republicans attempted to take $2 billion dollars away from other essential benefits for military Veterans in order to pay for an extension. I joined virtually every major Veterans organization in opposing that measure, which we defeated. By doing so, we brought Republicans back to the table and secured the funds necessary to extend Veterans Choice - but not at the expense of other benefits our Veterans have earned in service to our Nation.
The Veterans Choice program to provide rural military Veterans with top quality local medical care – without having to travel long distances to VA health care facilities – is a great idea. But Veterans Choice is not working as intended. Rules and regulations are confusing. Providers are leaving the system because of trouble getting paid. And it takes too long to schedule appointments. So we need to be bold, creative, and open to new ideas in order to fix Veterans Choice and get it right.   
That was the message Minnesota Congressman Tim Walz and I heard last week from the top VA officials, Veterans Service Officers, health care providers, and military Veterans who attended our Veterans Choice roundtable in Duluth. Congressman Walz is the Ranking Member (minority equivalent of chairman) of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, and this is the third time he’s joined me for in-depth discussions on Veterans Choice with local Veterans and health care experts here in our region. In a nutshell, our meeting in Duluth produced five big areas of agreement:
First – Veterans choice needs to be more flexible. One size doesn’t fit all. Top quality care, customer service and accessibility for military Veterans must be top priority at the VA, regardless of what it takes.
Second – the rule that a military Veteran must live at least 40 miles away from a VA clinic in order to get local private care is arbitrary and needs to be revisited. Doctors should decide the best place for a Veteran to receive treatment, regardless of location.
Third – access to 21st Century high-speed rural broadband is absolutely critical for local doctors to provide Veterans with effective Internet-based diagnostics and treatments. That’s one big reason why we’re working so hard in Congress to build support for my 21st Century Broadband Act to expand high speed broadband to 22 million rural Americans – including about 440,000 rural military Veterans – who can’t easily access the Internet today.
Fourth – we need to be creative with public-private partnerships to provide our Veterans with quality care. For example, experts suggest that local private hospitals might be reconfigured to include a VA wing, staffed by VA personnel, to serve military Veterans.
And fifth – we need stop forces in Congress from eliminating the VA altogether. The VA health system is a tremendously successful source of research, innovation and training for military Veterans and the non-VA community alike. We need to build on those successes and create cost-effective, common sense public-private partnerships – not dismantle the system. 
￼  Last week marked the third time Minnesota Congressman Tim Walz (on the right in this photo), the top ranking Democrat on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, has joined me here in the 8th District to meet with local military Veterans and hear their ideas for improving the Veterans Choice program. We are pictured here with Rick and Joyce Stoehr, who drove down from Tower to attend the roundtable. 
￼  This is Dexter, a five-month old Lab being trained to serve as a comfort dog for military Veterans experiencing combat stress related disorders. Dexter attended our Duluth roundtable with Mike Waldron, his trainer. An Operation Iraqi Freedom Veteran, Mike founded the non-profit 23rd Veteran organization to help other Veterans adjust to civilian life. 

Nolan Presses “No Government-No Pay” Act as Federal Government Shutdown Looms by Month’s End
￼
Government by crisis management is back. When Congress returns to Washington in September, the House will have just 12 legislative days to raise the debt ceiling so our Nation can pay its bills – and to approve a spending agreement to avoid another catastrophic federal government shutdown. Republican leaders set the legislative schedule and they know these deadlines are coming. But time and again, they have failed to meet them.
The American people send their elected representatives to Washington to fix things and solve problems – not shut down the government and collect a salary for doing so. 
That’s why I reintroduced my “No Government-No Pay” Act earlier this year. Under this measure (H.R. 1789), when future Congresses allow the federal government to shut down, members would not be paid until everything is back up and running. Not just a delay in Congressional pay, but no pay at all – ever – for those wasted days.
As I’ve said many times before, it’s time for Congress to start living in the real world, where you either do your job or you don’t get paid. That was the simple truth behind the first “No Government-No Pay” Act I introduced before the October 2013 budget deadlock that shut down the government for 16 days and furloughed more than 800,000 federal employees.
If the federal government closes its doors again, we know what to expect. The 2013 shutdown debacle took $24 billion out of our economy and cost 120,000 good paying jobs. Businesses suffered, products were left sitting on our ports, military Veterans disability claims were stalled, National Parks and Head Start centers were closed and EPA hazardous waste and chemical waste inspections were postponed – just to name a few of the disastrous consequences. I donated my salary to charities in Minnesota’s 8th District during that shutdown and would do so again if Congress fails to do its job and triggers another shutdown crisis.

Copper-Nickel Mining on Minnesota’s Iron Range is Key to Winning the Battle Against Climate Change
￼  I hope you will take time to read and consider this opinion piece I wrote for the Minneapolis Star Tribune last week.
Mining copper and nickel on Minnesota’s Iron Range and addressing global climate change are compatible, complementary, and essential to our way of life. We have the brains, the technology and the need to do both.
If we attempt to do one without the other, we will end up with neither. The survival of humankind and Planet Earth rests on our willingness to use and embrace all of the knowledge and resources at our disposal to reverse climate change – including the vast deposits of strategic minerals in Northeastern Minnesota. We owe future generations no less. And if we fail, they will hold us rightly accountable.
The fact of the matter is, there would be no viable green economy and no effective means to reverse climate change without mining. Read our full op-ed here.

Our Week in Cambridge
￼  ￼  It was a pleasure and a real inspiration to tour Industries Inc. of PHASE (Pine Habilitation and Supported Employment) during our visit to Cambridge last week. PHASE employs folks with developmental challenges to craft beautiful signs and other wood products for sale - just like the one I’m proudly holding in the top picture. 
￼  Along with a briefing from Isanti County Sheriff Chris Caulk, we toured the beautiful new Law Enforcement Center in Cambridge. Commissioner Terry Turnquist and County Attorney Jeffrey Edblad are on my left in this picture. Commissioner Susan Morris is next to Sheriff Caulk.
Our Week in North Branch
￼  North Branch Fire Chief Kevin Grote explained the impressive job of fire prevention and fire fighting being accomplished by the community’s 28-member volunteer fire department. North Branch City Councilor Jim Swenson and City Administrator Renae Fry, pictured here with me, joined our discussion. 

￼  It was a honor to speak to a packed house at the North Branch Chamber of Commerce luncheon and report on important education, defense and medical research legislation we passed during the spring and early summer.
Our Week in Wadena
￼  On Friday, we toured Homecrest Outdoor Furniture, a remarkable 65-year old operation that employs up to 140 people who manufacture top quality ‘Made in America’ products. Despite competition from low-grade Chinese imports, the business is growing by about 15 percent every year.
￼  ￼  Friday also brought us to the Wadena Farmers Market for a briefing on the University of Minnesota’s Power of Produce program to provide children ages 4 to 11 with a $2 dollar token to spend on fresh fruits and vegetables. Power of Produce works in conjunction with the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Naturally, I couldn’t resist these wonderful homemade breads, jams and jellies.
Our Week in Park Rapids
￼  The Heartland Activity and Wellness Connection facility under construction in Park Rapids will provide local mental health services along with a wide range of recreational and business opportunities. Thanks to Better Connection founder and clinical staffer Danielle Lien and other members of the Park Rapids community for providing us with a tour and briefing last week. 
Our Week in Brainerd
￼  We were delighted to catch up with Brainerd Lakes area 4-H members and leaders who visited our DC office during the Presidential Inauguration ceremonies in January.
￼  We met with local business people and community leaders to discuss progress in our effort to secure a federal grant to help develop the National Loon Center. Among other environmental projects, the Center will help preserve and protect Minnesota Loons being threatened by invasive zebra mussels and the effects of the BP oil spill. Money for the grant would come from proceeds of the federal settlement with BP.
￼  Meeting with members of Brainerd Peace Action, we discussed the need to put a stop to endless wars of choice in the Middle East and reinvest in America, our people, and human development.
Our Week in Chisholm
￼  There is a special piece of art being created at the entrance of the City Hall in Chisholm where one of our congressional offices is located. Pictured above is Kim Woods (left) and Shawn McCann (right) prepping the sketching template for a 3D Chalk drawing they’re doing of the Iron Man for Chisholm’s upcoming Doc Moonlight Grahams Days community celebration. Kim and Shawn have been traveling the world painting 3D art on sidewalks and streets.  
Our Week in Grand Rapids
￼  DNR Commissioner Tom Landwehr held an informative session at Timberlake Lodge last week  focusing on mining, forestry, and tourism. Presenters included Tom Clarke of EPR Iron Ore. Mr. Clarke presented an update on Magnetation and the former Essar site he recently purchased. Forty business leaders, elected officials, and community residents - including Nolan Field Staffer Jordan Metsa - attended the meeting.

Coming Up in Minnesota
This week:
	•	With Congress still in recess for the August District Work Period, I’ll be traveling throughout the northern reaches of Minnesota’s 8th District meeting with local business leaders, elected officials and folks from all walks of life. I get some of my best ideas from the people I’m so proud to represent, so if you see me in your community, please take a few minutes to stop and share your thoughts on the many challenges facing our region, state and Nation.

Finally...
Honoring the American Flag with a Dignified Retirement
￼
Hats off to the National Association of Counties (NACO), the National Sheriffs Association and the National Flag Foundation for their new program to help retire worn or tattered American Flags in a dignified manner. These Official U.S. Flag Disposal Boxes are appearing all over the Nation, including St. Louis County right here in Northeastern Minnesota. You can now drop your aging U.S. Flags in boxes located just outside the Veterans Service Office in the Hibbing Annex Building, and on the ground floor of the St. Louis County Courthouse in Duluth. Or, you can bring your Flag to any American Legion Post for proper handling.

8/14/17 14:11,Working For You Update: Promoting Health and Wellness in the Tenth District,"News from Congressman Brad Schneider 
￼

￼ ￼ ￼ ￼
￼
￼
￼
￼

Dear Lindsey,  I’m heartbroken over the bigotry, racism and violence we witnessed in Charlottesville this weekend. The hate spewed by the white supremacists gathered there does not represent our American values. In the face of this senseless violence, we must stand united as a country that embraces its diversity. Those seeking to sow division and fear will ultimately fail because there is far more that unites us as Americans than divides us. As we remember the victims and pray for the injured, I hope you will join me in considering what we can each do to promote tolerance and equality in our own communities.
Please read on for a recap of Saturday’s Health and Wellness Fair, some takeaways from my recent visit to Israel, and invites to many upcoming events in the District.
PROMOTING HEALTH AND WELLNESS IN THE TENTH DISTRICT
￼
On Saturday, we hosted a Health and Wellness Fair at Round Lake High School. Over thirty area health organizations were on hand to offer free health screenings, vaccinations, information, school registration and more for attendees. There was fun to be had too with a free Zumba class and a demonstration by the Lake County Sherriff’s K-9 unit.
I’m very glad this event could help to connect constituents with the many health resources available in our community. Thank you to all the participating organizations, including Lake County Health Department and Community Health Center, NorthShore University HealthSystem Medical Group, Advocate Children’s Hospital, American Society for Dermatologic Surgery Association, Walgreens, Walmart, Round Lake School District and many more. 
A full list of participating organizations is available on our website.
VISITING ISRAEL
Last week I had the opportunity to travel to Israel with more than 50 fellow members of Congress.
￼
Over the course of our stay, we visited Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Tiberius, as well as the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea. We stood on the Israeli-Lebanese border and learned about Hizbollah’s 150,000 increasingly sophisticated rockets that now threaten more than 70 percent of Israel’s population.  We were in the Golan Heights, looking down into Syria where we could hear explosions and fighting between Syrian factions from the nearby towns.  And we also spoke with the doctor in charge of the Israeli field hospital that has provided health care to thousands of wounded and ill Syrians suffering from more than six years of civil war.
More than anything else, we had the chance to talk with people.  We met with Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs. We heard from experts on issues ranging from politics to social issues, economic development and national security.  We spoke with philanthropists and entrepreneurs, politicians and journalists, humanitarians and historians.
￼
The key takeaways from our trip:  Virtually everyone in the region wants peace through a two-state solution—the Jewish state of Israel and a Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace and security. It was also very clear that Israel is our most important ally in a very dangerous region because, like the United States, it is a vibrant democracy, with shared values and common strategic interests. These shared interests include finding a resolution to the Syrian civil war, as well as curtailing Iran’s destabilizing regional activities and ending the long term nuclear threat.
YOU'RE INVITED: FEDERAL BUDGET WORKSHOP
￼
Our federal budget workshop with The Concord Coalition was one of our most popular events this spring. We’re holding another session on Thursday, August 17 at the Glenview Public Library. We will engage in a realistic discussion about the federal budget, examine how several recent policy proposals could impact our nation’s economy, debt and deficit, and work in small groups to formulate fiscal solutions. 
RSVP is required. Register to attend here.
YOU'RE INVITED: SERVICE ACADEMY INFORMATION SESSION
￼
Every year, I have the high honor to nominate outstanding young people from the Tenth District to attend the U.S. military service academies. This month, I'm hosting an informational session for students and families to learn more about the nomination and application processes for the:
	•	U.S. Air Force Academy,
	•	U.S. Coast Guard Academy,
	•	U.S. Merchant Marine Academy,
	•	U.S. Military Academy (West Point), and
	•	U.S. Naval Academy.
Representatives from each of the academies will also be in attendance to speak about their institution and answer questions. 
Learn more and RSVP to attend here!
 YOU'RE INVITED: SENIOR HEALTH CARE FORUM
￼
I'm hosting a discussion about Medicare and other health care resources for Tenth District seniors in conjunction with the Northeastern Illinois Agency on Aging, AARP, and the Alzheimer’s Association, Greater Illinois Chapter.
This event is free, open to the public, and intended for seniors. Due to limited space, registration is required.
Learn more and RSVP to attend here!
NEIGHBORHOOD OFFICE HOURS
￼
Our office hosts frequent Neighborhood Office Hours for constituents to more easily meet with caseworkers and staff to discuss any federal issues that they may have and learn more about services our office can provide. We’re here to help if you have issues with Medicare, Social Security, the Veterans Administration, immigration and more.
While I’m in the district this week, I’m joining two of our Neighborhood Office Hours in Grayslake and Waukegan. I hope you’ll come out and chat in-person.
Grayslake Public Library  100 Library Lane, Grayslake, IL 60030 Tuesday, August 15, 2017 3:00 – 5:00pm
Waukegan Park Place Senior Center  414 S. Lewis Ave, Waukegan, IL 60085 Thursday, August 17, 2017 3:00 – 5:00pm
Check out the full schedule on our website.
WEEKLY WRAP-UP
￼
Posing with the group after speaking at the Waukegan2College orientation event. This wonderful program works to prepare young people who will be the first in their families to attend college. I was joined at the event by Maria, who is interning in our Lincolnshire office this summer and is a graduate of the program. I can’t wait to see all these young people accomplish!
￼
Joining in back-to-school events across Waukegan last Saturday. My thanks go out to everyone who participated to ensure our young people are ready and energized to learn in the new year. Photos from Trinity AME, New Hope Missionary Baptist, Miguel Juarez Middle School, and Most Blessed Trinity.
As always, please continue to stay in touch and share your thoughts, either by calling our DC office at (202) 225-4835 or emailing via our website.
Thanks for reading!

Dear Lindsey,
This weekends events in Charlottesville, Virginia were disturbing and frightening. They showed, without a doubt, that the cancers of White Supremacy and anti-Semitism are alive and growing in the United States.
The toxic beliefs of the KKK and neo-Nazi aligned protestors in Charlottesville, fueled by hate, bigotry, and racism directly echo those of the Nazis that millions of Americans, including my father, fought so gallantly against in World War II. History shows us that we cannot wait to speak out, the time is now. We must stand strong against this kind of hateful ideology and the violent actions we witnessed this weekend. Unchecked, this movement will only grow to be even more dangerous.
In an act of domestic terrorism, Heather Heyer, a young woman standing up for peace and unity, was murdered this weekend by a White Supremacist who also injured twenty others. This is beyond unacceptable and must be unequivocally condemned by all Americans. It is also incumbent upon the federal government to prosecute this individual to the fullest extent of the law and take active steps to combat hate online, on college campuses, and in our communities.
In matters as important as this, silence equals consent; and I will not be silent. We need to call this weekends actions what they are; hate and terror.
In solidarity,
￼
Carolyn B. Maloney

Dear Friend,
Since the day he announced his candidacy for president, Donald Trump has tied his political fortune to false promises to make America safe again through the construction of a border wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The false narrative propagated by President Trump and Republicans that border security is only achieved through further militarization must stop. In response, I have introduced my own legislation that takes a commonsense approach by placing the needs of the Borderlands front and center.
Unlike Trumps plan, the Border Security and Accountability Act is not an enforcement-only approach and it does not waste $2.3 billion of taxpayer money on walls that do nothing to enhance security. It does not instigate fear in immigrants or create anxiety for businesses. And it doesnt dispel environmental protections, undermine civil and human rights, disregard tribal sovereignty, or stifle commerce and trade.
On the contrary, this bill ensures that the federal government is not able to do away with any and all environmental protections under the false pretense of border security. It takes into account the adverse effects of artificial barriers on wildlife and Borderlands ecosystems. It improves commerce and cross-border trade by modernizing and expanding border infrastructure at land ports of entry like those in Nogales and San Luis, Arizona. In essence, the Border Security and Accountability Act  prioritizes the needs of stakeholders who live, work, and travel in the Borderlands and who understand that an enforcement only approach creates more problems than it solves.

Rep. Grijalva - Enewsletter
I want to hear from you:
Recently, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it would override several environmental laws - including the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and Endangered Species Act - in order to expedite border construction projects near San Diego.
Do you approve of the Administration waiving major environmental laws in order to construct a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border? 
Yes 
No
Unsure

￼
The Border Security and Accountability Act prioritizes the needs of Borderlands communities by:
	•	Establishing a humane and accountable border security strategy. Among other provisions, the Act requires use of force, immigration laws, environmental concerns, civil rights, constitutional rights, human rights and cultural training for all Federal law enforcement agents involved in border security.
	•	Improving cross-border trade by providing $500 million for CBP to modernize border infrastructure and transportation at land ports of entry inlcuding in Nogales and San Luis, AZ.
	•	Repealing Homeland Securitys unconstitutional authority to waive ALL laws on the border. The majority of laws waived exist to protect the environment, wildlife, historic and archaeological sites, and Native American sacred sites and religious practices.
	•	Restoring transparency and accountability in border enforcement. Among other provisions, the Act requires a comprehensive assessment of the state of border security before the acquisition or deployment of new border security assets, personnel and technology.
	•	Reducing cross border deaths by requiring CBP to standardize and publish the collection of data on border crossing deaths.
	•	Prioritizing consulatation with border communities. The Act requires consultation in the development and implementation of border enforcement policies, strategies and training and establishes Border Community Liaison Offices in every border patrol sector.

He also sent a letter to Gov. Ducey, urging him to commence the Disaster Declaration process. Days later, the IBWC sent out a crew to divert sewage from the leak.

Dear Lindsey,
When Congress is out of session in Washington, D.C., I have the privilege of being home and meeting with constituents throughout the district. This week I had the opportunity to visit the employees of Vermeer Midwest in Chesterfield. As the daughter of a small business owner, I know firsthand the value companies like Vermeer have in the community. These small businesses provide good paying jobs and their success is vital to the economic growth of the country. We had a healthy discussion about our nation’s infrastructure, burdensome federal regulations, workforce training, and taxes. I will always fight regulatory overreach by the federal government and as Congress begins to work on tax reform in the fall, I am committed to creating a simpler, fairer tax code that allows small businesses to reach their full potential.
 ￼
 ￼
Last week Clinton Police Officer Gary Michael was tragically killed in the line of duty during a routine traffic stop. This heartbreaking story is a reminder that every day members of law enforcement leave their loved ones to serve our community without a guarantee that they will return home. On Wednesday, I stopped by the headquarters of Missouri Highway Patrol Troop C which serves an eleven-county region, including the St. Louis area. These troopers patrol our interstates, support other police departments and as some will say, “the MOHP does it all.” It was a pleasure to meet these hardworking men and women. Special thanks to Lt. Ferrier and Corp. Wheetley for showing me around.
 ￼
 ￼

Boone Center, Inc (BCI) is a not-for-profit organization with a mission to enrich the lives of adults with disabilities and their families by providing a choice of productive and fulfilling employment. You can visit their website here for more information. 
When I toured BCI’s St. Peters facility last week, I met with the dozens of employees working that day. They gave me a warm welcome and I heard stories about the sense of purpose this facility has given to its disabled employees. I’d like to thank Katie Jones, Director of OES Programs and CEO Tony Spielberg for their work to fulfill BCI’s mission.
￼
 ￼
 As the mother of an Army Captain currently serving our nation in the 3rd Infantry Division, I know the sacrifices our soldiers and their families make to defend our country. On Saturday, I was honored to join 200 Marine Reservists and their loved ones during their family day activities at the Marine Reserve Center. At a time when the United States is under constant threat from foreign entities, it is reassuring to know that these brave men and women are willing to do whatever it takes to protect us.
 ￼
 ￼
 Next Monday is the big day! Missourians in a 70-mile path stretching from St. Joseph to Cape Girardeau will experience a total solar eclipse from around 11am to 2:30pm on August 21st. The last time a total solar eclipse occurred in the greater St. Louis area was 1442 and we won’t see our next one until 2505. Be sure to check out www.stlouiseclipse2017.org or the Explore St. Louis website for a list of places to see the eclipse.
Lastly, I’d like to wish all the students heading back to school this week a successful 2017-2018 school year.

Foxx Report Week of August 14, 2017
  
Most years, Members of Congress look forward to August. Contrary to popular belief, we are not in what the media refers to as “vacation.” During this month, we have what is called a district work period. We are out and about in the community, actively listening to what our constituents have to say — so that we may bring their concerns with us back to Washington. 

During this district work period, I have traveled across the 5th District and heard first-hand from you about your concerns. Additionally, I have heard from the 5th District leaders of tomorrow and the 5th District business community leaders of today. 

The Leaders of Tomorrow
If there is anything that my time in Congress has taught me, it is that the wisdom of the world is not in Washington D.C. The wisdom of the world is at home in our districts. This summer, the Hickory Public School’s Book Bus program partnered with the Hickory Housing Authority and offered a civics engagement program. It was a pleasure to meet with Hickory students and tell them a little bit more about my role as a Member of Congress and my love of reading. It is my hope that these students will be inspired to be involved in public service and that the wisdom students gain from these programs will serve them as they grow into the leaders of tomorrow.

Mount Airy is home to some of the finest young people in our community. The National Recreation and Parks Association along with local officials collaborated to celebrate “Hero Day” as a part of the Associations’ wider Park Champion's Initiative at Mount Airy recreation facility. Hero Day gave local Mount Airy children the opportunity to meet with the local heroes including members of the Police Force and Fire Department. I had a wonderful time getting to know the students in attendance.

Champions of the Business Community
North Carolina is consistently rated as one of the most business friendly, and for good reason. In fact, Forbes Magazine rates North Carolina as the second best state in the nation for business. This accolade and others like it are earned by the leaders of the North Carolinian business community. During this work period, I’ve had the opportunity to meet with many industry leaders and local businesses. 

Rockwell Collins is an aviation company that produces solutions for military and commercial aircraft. This large company provides avionics like communications gear and radars for aircraft, and also spearheads design of airplane seating. Currently, Rockwell Collins employs nearly 600 North Carolinians at the Oak Plaza facility located in Winston-Salem, and has over 1450 employees in the Winston-Salem area. I had the opportunity to tour the Oak Plaza facility and learn more about this state of the art employer.

￼

￼

Family-owned businesses are rare to find these days. While traveling the District, I was pleased to visit Ararat Rock Products quarry in Mount Airy, a family-owned quarry that has been operating for the last fifty years. Here are a few photos from my visit. 

￼

￼

Small Business is the backbone of the American economy. In 2013, North Carolinian small businesses employed 1.6 million people or 46% or the workforce. I was proud to visit with these small and local businesses that are making a big difference at home.

Throughout my dialogue with constituents during this work period it’s become clear to me that there still remains a lot of confusion surrounding the healthcare plans of Members of Congress. 

For one, Congressional Republicans were responsible for forcing congressmen and their staff onto Obamacare rolls in the first place. During the original Obamacare debate, a senior Republican senator offered an amendment that would ensure that Members of Congress lived under the very heavy-handed regulations that were being forced onto our health care marketplaces. During our most recent repeal and replace effort, we ensured that states received maximum flexibility in administering their health insurance markets but also passed a separate bill (H.R. 2192) that made sure that Members of Congress did not use this flexibility as a loophole to escape the mandate to stay on Obamacare. 

Furthermore, some are asserting that Members of Congress receive a “special” subsidy to purchase their Obamacare plans. In fact, Members and their staff receive the same contributions that the rest of Federal employees receive, similar to what most private-sector workers enjoy through their employment-based health benefits. My office has put together several resources about this subject in order to clear up any confusion due to the spread of misinformation. To learn more about the fictitious claim that Congress receives special treatment under Obamacare, please click the picture below. I will continue to fight to replace Obamacare with policies that deliver the control and choice individuals and families need to access health care that's right for them.

What’s Coming Up?
Over the next few weeks, I will continue meeting with constituents around the 5th District. I look forward to meeting with and hearing from many of you.

Sincerely,

8/14/17 11:10,Beyond resistance: Making college affordable,"Update | Monday, August 14, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 17th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: making college affordable.
With rapid changes in technology and the relentless pace of automation, now more than ever, Americans want a college degree to compete in the global economy. That said, the skyrocketing cost of tuition puts college out of reach for too many people. Nationally, the average student attending a four-year college leaves with over $30,000 in student debt. This should be unacceptable.
This crisis is why I support the College for All Act, which eliminates tuition and fees at public colleges and universities for families making under $125,000 a year. It also allows Americans to refinance their student loans, and prevents the government from profiting from student loan programs.
I will continue to advocate for strong and consistent federal support for education and initiatives that invest in the next generation. This also means we must reign in for-profit colleges, which often leave students with mountains of debt, worthless degrees, and little to no transferrable skills to get a job.
Every American should have the opportunity to get an education, regardless of socioeconomic status. Access to a quality public education is critical to create a level playing field for all and a stronger America.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

Working For Our District 
While there weren't votes in Washington this week, I was able to spend time across North Jersey. At the Sussex County Fair, I joined the community to celebrate ‘Senior Day,’ in Wantage I spent quality time talking to our firefighters and first responders, and in Waldwick I got behind the counter, rolled up my sleeves, and served up some ice cream to local families. Read on to hear about the work I’m doing to serve you. 
Celebrating our Veterans and Seniors 
￼

The Sussex County Fair is one of my favorite New Jersey traditions. I was happy to be able to celebrate with seniors and veterans and, specifically, to honor local veteran Aldo Sayre, the fair's ""Senior of the Year.""

There is no greater responsibility than that we owe to those who have given us so much. Sussex County seniors and veterans have made invaluable contributions to our NJ communities.

Read more about my visit to the fair HERE. 
Clawing Back Our Tax Dollars 
￼

This week, I was thrilled to be able to celebrate Wantage's first Assistance to Firefighters Grant in 13 years with the department; they've worked hard to claw back federal tax dollars to keep our first responders safe as they protect our communities from everything from lone wolf terrorism to fire emergencies. 

Meanwhile, Head Start at Ringwood’s Center for Family Resources just received more than $5 million to continue their mission of promoting school-readiness for young children from low-income families. This $5,036,340 investment in Head Start is a win for Ringwood’s children and families and a win for New Jersey’s return on investment from the federal government. For every dollar invested in Head Start, we see a $7 to $9 return on our investment.

For too long, our region has received back only pennies on the dollar we send to Washington. That's why I've been laser focused, since day one, on improving the return on investment we see for our federal taxes. I'm proud to help local communities secure these resources for something as critical as our fire fighters' safety and the future of our children. 

￼
Fighting Terror in the Middle East 
This August, I also joined about 50 Democrats and Republicans in Israel to discuss joint security efforts with America’s vital ally, Israel, at no cost to taxpayers. Israel is our most important ally and a beacon of democracy in a troubled region. This trip helped strengthen our bilateral relationship and work fighting terrorism.

While at the Kotel, I prayed for New Jersey, the United States, and Israel, that we may find a way to come together & create a more peaceful world.
￼

Supporting NJ5 Businesses 
At the Waldwick Whistle Shop, Tami and Neil Moses helped me relive my college days scooping ice cream by letting me take a turn behind the counter to help personally serve some constituents. It was great to hear from both customers and business owners about what I can do to help make it a little bit easier to live, work, and run a business here in North Jersey.

Wicker Says Mississippi Will Help Write the Next Chapter of Drone Technology
New DHS Partnership Solidifies States Work With Unmanned Systems 
Mississippis leadership in unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) is reaching new heights, thanks to a recent partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  Our state was chosen in April to host the departments UAS demonstration range facility for testing small unmanned aircraft systems, or drones.  DHS plans to use these systems to help U.S. Border Patrol agents perform their monitoring, detection, and search-and-rescue operations.  Camp Shelby, which is home to a UAS training center for the Army National Guard, is kicking off its role in the DHS partnership with an opening day celebration this month.  Singing River Island and Stennis Space Center will also be test sites, with miles of restricted airspace for DHS to use in a controlled manner that does not encroach on privacy or jeopardize safety.  
MSU Builds on UAS Leadership 
Mississippi State University, which has been on the front lines of UAS technology for years, is leading the partnership with DHS.  Two years ago, the Federal Aviation Administration chose Mississippi State as its national Center of Excellence for Unmanned Aircraft Systems.  The Center of Excellence is tasked with researching the safe use of unmanned aircraft and helping develop policies that would promote a seamless integration of these drones into U.S. airspace.  DHS testing of UAS systems in Mississippi will expand on this important work, targeting possible uses of drones for national security, border control, and disaster response.
Gliders Offer Tools for Research in Gulf of Mexico
The applications do not stop there.  Drones are changing how we deliver goods, grow crops, map terrain, and research wildlife.  Unmanned systems are not limited to the skies but also allow us to explore the ocean in unprecedented ways.  The Naval Oceanographic Office at Stennis Space Center has the largest fleet of gliders and largest concentration of oceanographers in the world.  I have supported efforts to use unmanned maritime systems, or gliders, for collecting data on hypoxia in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  A lack of oxygen creates what is known as a hypoxic zone, or dead zone, that can have a devastating effect on marine ecosystems.  The Gulf of Mexico is currently experiencing its largest dead zone ever, reaffirming the need for monitoring.  Gliders offer a low-risk, cost-effective option for amassing data over a large geographic area, revealing trends and conditions that could help scientists understand the dead zones size and severity.  Given this potential for routine and rigorous data collection, I have also advocated the use of gliders by the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System in its work to protect marine resources, promote public safety, and safeguard maritime commerce.   
USM Partnerships Boost Unmanned Systems
Like Mississippi States work with UAS, the University of Southern Mississippi is earning an excellent reputation for its work with undersea gliders.  Southern Miss has developed the first certification for unmanned maritime systems, allowing students to gain valuable skills in a burgeoning career field.  The certification programs first class of students graduated this year. 
Unmanned systems are at the crossroads of so many diverse fields that strong partnerships are crucial to maximizing their potential.  Mississippians have repeatedly demonstrated an ability to collaborate across local, state, and federal levels.  Likewise, our universities have been eager to engage in research and training with real-world applications.  Because of these collective efforts, the future of unmanned systems  on land and under the sea  has already arrived in our state.

August 13, 2017 
Dear Friend,
There were despicable, violent, and tragic events this weekend in Charlottesville and last week in Minnesota. Hate and bigotry have no place in this country. Driving a car through a crowd was an act of domestic terrorism and there is no place in society for the horrid views by white supremacists or other groups that promote hate and violence.
Last week, Minnesotans were shocked by the bombing of the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington during morning prayers and we are relieved nobody was hurt. No one deserves to live in fear for their safety, especially at a house of worship or because of their faith. This is yet another example of the need for a return to respect, civility, and restraint in our society. The outpouring of support they have received since last Saturday shows that they are not alone and the community is behind Dar Al-Farooq and our Muslim neighbors. My office and I have been in contact with the center as well as monitoring the ongoing investigation, and I am confident the FBI and local authorities will make sure justice is served. Any attack of this nature is an affront to our American and Minnesotan values.
August is winding down so enjoy your family vacations with the start of the school year just around the corner. As always, please let me know whenever I can be of assistance to you or your family. Join the conversation online by visiting my website, Facebook page, Twitter, and Instagram.
 
Sincerely,

Fixing Our Broken Tax Code
If you're following me on my social media pages, you may have noticed that I'm highlighting ""31 Reasons for Tax Reform."" It's been 31 years since we've had fundamental tax reform so throughout the month of August, I'm identifying a new reason every day why fixing our broken tax code is so important, including:
	•	Americans Spending Too Much Money Filing Taxes: Independent estimates show that taxpayers spend a combined $99 billion every year complying with the individual income tax, which is money that could be used for what's important to them;
	•	Americans at Every Income Level Deserve to Keep More of Their Paychecks: By boosting take-home pay, people can take their hard-earned dollars and do what is best for them and their families to grow the economy;
	•	Family-Focused Credits Are Too Complicated: For example, there are currently 12 overlapping tax benefits related to education and families must wade through 100 pages of instructions to figure out if they qualify for help with tuition costs;
	•	Harms American Manufacturing: The status quo encourages American businesses to manufacture less in the United States and instead move plants and good-paying jobs overseas.
Fixing a broken tax code remains one of my top priorities. Be sure to check out my social media pages for more reasons throughout the month!
 
There's an App for That
Behind every latest new app or technological breakthrough there is a team of highly-skilled, creative workers and the one thing they all have in common is an education and background in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math).
 
I'm inviting all students in our area to participate in the Congressional App Challenge -- a competition open to all students who meet eligibility requirements regardless of coding experience. Winners will be given special recognition with their app displayed in the U.S. Capitol and on the House of Representatives website. 
 
The Congressional App Challenge was created because STEM and computer-based skills are essential for economic growth and innovation. By some estimates, the United States may be short by as many as a million programmers by 2020. These are high-paying high-demand jobs. To maintain American competitiveness, it's crucial that the U.S. invests in our youth and helps them acquire these valuable skills. The Congressional App contest encourages students to pursue those skills and recognizes them for their efforts. It runs until November 1.
 
Sanctions Now Law
When bad actors threaten our safety, we have a duty to counter their aggression and target those who financially support their actions and human rights abuses. The House recently took a big bipartisan vote to specifically counter the aggression of Russia, Iran and North Korea.
 
The new law imposes and strengthens sanctions by increasing economic and political pressure on each of these three countries.
 
For Russia: increases sanctions after repeated cyber-attacks and interference in Ukraine. 
 
For Iran: targets those involved with the country's ballistic missile program, its efforts to destabilize the region and repeated threats against Israel. 
 
For North Korea: sanctions target the nation's nuclear weapons program. We should pursue every economic and diplomatic
 
Finally, the package also holds these countries accountable for their repeated human-rights abuses.
 
Veterans CHOICE Act
Too often, our veterans have faced unnecessary difficulties and complications in receiving the health care they deserve for their service. We have made significant improvements to the VA system with the Choice Program that allows our veterans to seek care outside of that system if it is more convenient or sensible for them to do so.
 
The Choice Program was set to expire soon, but the House led the way with $2.1 billion in funding to reauthorize the Choice Program. The initiative also includes training for VA officials and more accountability and performance reviews for political appointees to the department. Ultimately, it's about doing all we can to make sure the Department of Veterans Affairs and its personnel are serving our veterans to the fullest extent.

Holding My Third Law Enforcement Roundtable
￼
Hosting my third law enforcement roundtable.

Last week, I held my third law enforcement roundtable with more than 20 sheriffs, police chiefs, ICE agents and Border Patrol officers. This has proven to be a great tool for increasing communication, collaboration and partnerships across jurisdictions within law enforcement in South Texas. We discussed local law enforcement issues and border security, including the 287(g) program. 

The 287(g) program allows state and local law enforcement agencies to partner with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for immigration enforcement. Through the program, law enforcement personnel are nominated, trained and approved by ICE to help keep our communities safe and secure. Recently, eight of the thirteen counties I represent were among the 18 Texas counties that joined the 287(g) program. The counties in TX27 were Aransas, Calhoun, Jackson, Lavaca, Matagorda, Refugio, Victoria, and Wharton.

Last week, I visited some Texas-27 small businesses including Venom Outdoor and Oscar’s Pest and Termite Control. 

Family-owned and operated, Venom Outdoor in Hallettsville has been providing local outdoorsmen with outdoor products since 2013. It was started by Kevin and Justin, a father-son duo who created the business after looking for a boat motor that would allow them to fish the shallow water of the San Antonio River. They have boats and motors that operate in as little as three feet of water.

I also visited Oscar Torres of Oscar’s Pest and Termite Control in Victoria. Since Oscar started his own business 9 year ago after working in the pest control industry for years, he has had great success. In 2016, his company won the Best Pest Control Company in Victoria award from the readers of the Victoria Advocate.

Both successful businesses show that a good idea coupled with hard work can have great results.

Dear Lindsey,
 
While back at home in the North State for the district work period, Ive enjoyed the opportunity to meet with constituents and attend a number of community events in recent weeks.
 
I was honored to receive thenational Spirit of Enterprise Award and the national Hard Hat Award on behalf of the US Chamber of Commerce, as well as the local Redding, Anderson and City of Shasta Lake Chambers of Commerce here in the North State. These awards honor members of Congress for their commitment to pro-growth, pro-jobs policies during the second session of the 114thCongress. Members who supported the Chambers position on at least 70 percent of those votes qualify to receive the Spirit of Enterprise Award, while members who scored 100% receive the Hard Hat Award. As a small business owner myself, I understand the importance of promoting pro-growth economic policies that help create jobs. Im proud to be recognized as a leader in this area, and I will continue to carry that momentum forward into the 115thCongress and beyond.
 
￼
Rep. LaMalfa Receives Spirit of Enterprise and Hard Hat Awards. 
 
I attended the Sutter Butte Flood Control Agency kick off for a nearly 3 mile levee reconstruction project. I take my hat off to the Army Corps of Engineers and the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) for getting out of the way and giving permits to fix the problems quickly. This expedited process should become the model for federal and state governments to use when working together on important emergency projects, such as this one. People dont care about which agency gets the credit, they care about getting results, and they want to know that the levees are safe. I was happy to help in pushing the federal government to expedite the permits.
 
￼
Rep. LaMalfa speaks at the launch of a levee reconstruction project by the Sutter Butte Flood Control Agency. 
 
I was in Chico to attend the Chico Rotary Luncheon where he had a chance to discuss with the audience issues such as health insurance, the Oroville Dam, rural broadband, and tax reform.I also had the opportunity to meet with organic farmers from Californias first district to discuss organic priorities for the Farm Bill as well as annual appropriations for agriculture programs.

I had the opportunity to join House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway and a few of my House colleagues for a Farm Bill listening session in Modesto, CA. The feedback we received from local farmers will help us to solve the challenges that are facing NorCal and American Agriculture in the next Farm Bill, and I thank them for providing their input.

Last but certainly not least, Id like to thank the nearly 500 people who came out for the Chico town hall meeting on Monday. While we may agree on some issues and disagree on others, I will always listen to what you have to say. We ultimately had a productive conversation that will help me as I represent you in Washington.

NEWS FROM THE 2nd DISTRICT
Dear Friend,

I hope you have enjoyed the beautiful Second District this week. Please read about my week and the services my office offers below: 

Israel Our Ally
This week, I traveled with a congressional delegation to Israel to gain a firsthand understanding of the United States’ relationship with Israel, regional security issues, and joint counter-terrorism efforts. Strengthening our relationship with our only democratic ally in the region will also work to bolster our own national security efforts. Israel stands alone on the frontline in the daily fight against Islamic extremism. We have much to learn from their success if we are to improve America’s efforts.

 The Walker Weekly Report | August 13, 2017
 

￼

I am angered at the evil and thuggery behavior displayed this weekend in Charlottesville. 

The message of white nationalists, supremacists and other groups that project hate is evil and contrary to God’s call to love all mankind and that every life is valuable. I hope the voices of Americans - especially those of faith – will be loud enough to drown out every voice of hate.

My prayers are with all of those impacted and especially the families of Heather Heyer, Lieutenant H. Jay Cullen and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates – three lives tragically lost.

This week, we were hard at work in the Sixth District – serving constituents, helping college students on ""move-in day,"" greeting kids on their first day of school, introducing new fire trucks and listening to the issues that people and businesses in North Carolina care about. We put together a video that you can watch here and below showing you what a normal day looks like for our team as we work to serve the people of our district. 

Please keep reading for the full update. Have a blessed week.

Sincerely,
￼

A Day in the Life: Traveling the District 
￼
I am always proud of our North Carolina staff working hard to serve constituents at our offices in Greensboro, Graham, and Asheboro. Every day we are on August “recess” is a day we can enjoy building relationships with and listening to all of the great people who make North Carolina a better place to live.  Unveiling of new fire trucks, touring growing businesses, holding meetings on economic development, meeting local Sheriffs to talk about human trafficking, opioid abuse and the other issues facing our community, honoring award-winning students and libraries – we always stay busy!  Watch this video to see what a normal day looks like for our team as we work to serve.

Welcoming Students to the First Day of School at Wiley Elementary in Greensboro
￼
Few things bring more joy than the smile of a child. It was such a great way to start my Friday morning by welcoming kids to their first day of school along with other heroes working to make our community a better place to live. To see real heroes, each of these kids needs to look no further than the front of the classroom. So thankful for our teachers and wishing a great new school year to all!

Principal Fields greeted every one of her students by name as they walked into the school. Wiley Elementary has great leadership. 

While I was there I joined WFMY News 2 to discuss how we can help our children succeed and have bright futures. You can watch the interview here. 
￼
Joining Fox8 to Discuss Tensions in North Korea
￼

As tensions rise in North Korea, we should pray for the more than 150,000 Americans in the Korean Peninsula – many of whom are serving our country. Just a few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of meeting Sgt. Maina from Sanford in South Korea.

￼

After multiple security briefings with our top generals and admirals in the region, it is clear we must be ever-vigilant in dealing with these expanding threats – especially as we see continued acts of hostility from Pyongyang.

You can watch the interview here and above.

Helping the NC A&T Class of 2021 Get Moved Onto Campus
￼

Grade schools aren't the only classrooms that are starting to fill up. College students all over North Carolina are heading back to campus for another year.

I thoroughly enjoyed helping North Carolina A&T State University's Class of 2021 get moved into their new dorm rooms yesterday with Chancellor Martin. Welcome to Greensboro and best wishes for the new school year!

Huge News!
￼
Legislation I authored to support coverage for drug treatment and prevent fentanyl from crossing U.S. borders has been included in the interim report of the President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. 
Our nation’s drug epidemic is a complicated issue and our response must be multi-faceted; that means disrupting the flow of drugs while also increasing the accessibility and affordability for prevention, education, treatment, and recovery of this disease.  I’m grateful for the Commission’s preliminary report and look forward to working with them to combat this national crisis.

Register for my Town Hall
As part of my ongoing effort to connect with constituents across Bucks and Montgomery counties in a variety of forums, I’ll be holding a town hall in Bensalem on Tuesday, August 22.
Eighth District residents are invited to register for tickets to the event and submit questions online HERE by midnight, Monday, August 14. Registered names will be randomly drawn by the Bucks County Courier Times and selected individuals will be contacted to RSVP and receive further details. Ticketed names and addresses will be checked at the door. Registration does not guarantee a ticket. 
Additionally, the town hall will be broadcast live at Facebook.com/RepBrianFitzpatrick.

Addressing North Korea
￼
Kim Jung Un’s desperate actions this week mixed with nuclear ambitions continue to create a direct threat to the safety and security of American families and global allies. As this rogue nation pushes forward, the international community must continue to apply immense economic and diplomatic pressure.
To that end, Ambassador Haley’s leadership in securing a unanimous U.N. Security Council vote to increase sanctions on North Korea for their dangerous nuclear and missile programs was crucial. For a country whose exports only totaled $3 billion last year, a $1 billion sanctions and export ban package is huge. Perhaps the most important factor of this move, however, is bringing China to the table against the Kim regime.
Working to Solve Our Healthcare Problems
Congressman Tom Suozzi and I teamed up this week to outline our vision for stabilizing the health insurance markets and providing relief to American families. From ensuring coverage for those with preexisting conditions to rescuing small businesses from the employer mandate, we believe our health care proposal is the start of many good bipartisan conversations.

8/13/17 18:02,Enforcing our Laws and Securing our Borders,"District Update | August 13, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email
￼
Dear Friends,

Since coming to Congress, I have fought for common-sense policies to ensure the safety of those within Arkansas and our nation. This includes both securing our borders and enforcing our immigration laws. In the House, we have had a number of successes, and I appreciate this opportunity to provide you with this update. 

Over the past two years, I have made three trips to our Southern Border in El Paso, Texas, Laredo, Texas, and San Ysidro, California. I observed the terrain and vulnerabilities along the border and met with U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, as well as local law enforcement personnel, U.S. officials, and mayors. We discussed manpower shortages, physical infrastructure requirements like border walls and fencing, and the need for an effective customs system to process goods and get visitors through border points quickly. 

With this in mind, I was proud to support a government funding bill that was signed into law on May 5, 2017. This law makes recruiting customs agents and border patrol officers easier and faster, and we see that this bill is already having a direct effect on the safety of Americans. 

We also recently passed a national security spending bill that included $1.6 billion for border security. This funding will be used for procurement, construction, and improvements along our southern border, and I'm proud of our work to give agents the tools they need because when our borders aren't secure, we aren't safe. 
      ￼
Finally, we recently passed the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, which sends a clear message to illegal aliens with a criminal past that they will no longer be afforded safe havens in the United States. This bill would prevent select federal grant funding for cities that fail to cooperate with federal enforcement of immigration law. Simply put, basic cooperation between the state, local, and federal law enforcement is a fundamental tenant of our civil society. The federal laws on immigration must be enforced, and providing a safe haven for individuals that break our laws cannot be accepted. Throughout the country, cities have affronted our federal immigration laws at taxpayer expense, and Congress is holding them accountable.
I remain committed to fixing our broken immigration system by securing our borders, enforcing our laws, and supporting legal immigration. I will continue to work with our House and Senate leadership and the president on these important issues.
Sincerely,
￼ 
Representative French Hill

The Centers for Youth and Family serves thousands of children and families every year by providing specialized prevention, intervention, and treatment services, which helps promote emotional and social wellness. As you see, they gave me a great welcome, and we discussed their important work and what health care and mental health care policies are critical to their positive outcomes. 

         ￼
What an honor to pitch in and pack nutritious lunches for kids accompanying their parents to medical visits. The Sack Lunch Program is a joint effort between the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance and Arkansas Children’s Hospital, and I am proud of the difference they are making in the lives of our central Arkansas families.

                             ￼
So far in August, we have had two Veterans Advisory Council meetings – in Perryville and in Conway. I always appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my staff and I are working to make sure our veterans get the care and benefits they deserve. At Foot Roots in Little Rock, we had an extensive round table discussion about the challenges facing veterans, including access to mental health services and increasing the number of medical and social work professionals.

CONSTITUENT SERVICES 
ISSUES AND LEGISLATION 
August 13, 2017 
ICYMI - The Furthering Access to Coordinated Treatment for Seniors Act:
Recently, I introduced the Furthering Access to Coordinated Treatment for Seniors (FACTS) Act, along with Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-D), which directs the Department on Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a process by which Medicare Part D plans can request drug claims data to promote appropriate use of medications.
Often when our seniors are discharged from medical care with a prescription, they may forget to fill the claim or dont take the full regiment as prescribed. This can lead to folks ending up back up in the doctors office or hospital, causing them great discomfort and costing taxpayers dollars. 
The FACTS Act will remedy this problem by directing HHS to open up lines of communication within Medicare so that Medicare Part D prescription drug plans can request information from hospitals and doctors offices (Medicare Parts A and B). This information will detail prescription claims data in order to ensure those in Medicare are fully utilizing their medications as prescribed. This bipartisan legislation will help to save taxpayers money, and will improve the health and lives of seniors across the country.
To read more about this legislation, please click here.
 
ICYMI - Legislation to Aid and Improve Medical Decisions for Seniors:
Last week, I introduced the Local Coverage Determination Clarification Act to aid and improve medical decisions for seniors.
Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) play a critical role in ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to needed care. However, the opaque process used by MACs to make coverage decisions can limit or deny patients access to necessary care.
For many procedures, doctors must seek reimbursement permission from one of the 12 local MACs that are responsible for designated areas of the country. However, each MAC is independent, meaning that a procedure covered in one state may not be covered in another.
This arbitrary care needs to stop, for the wellbeing of our seniors. By establishing a clear process so that only health experts are making sound health decisions, we can improve transparency and accountability among MACs and ensure our nations seniors receive quality health care treatment.
To read more about this legislation, please click here.
 
Visiting Fort Scott National Historic Site:
It was so great touring the Fort Scott National Historic Site. This Site depicts the important story of Fort Scott's role in nineteenth-century America. It serves as a physical snapshot of the pioneer days of westward migration of a young republicfrom its initial construction 175 years ago.
 
Last month, my bill to donate the Fort Scott Lunette Blair blockhouse to the National Park Service passed the House with strong bipartisan support. Once signed into law, this legislation will allow Lunette Blair to be rightly incorporated into the Fort Scott National Historic Site.

Touring Walmart Training Academy:
This week, I had the opportunity to tour the Walmart Training Academy in Pittsburg. It was great meeting and speaking to so many Kansans and learning more about the academy. This training academy is designed to better prepare the workforce with the necessary core retail skills and department-specific knowledge. Thank you for the great tour!
￼
 
Visiting White Star Machinery & Supply:
On Wednesday, I stopped by White Star Machinery & Supply of Topeka to discuss issues important to the construction equipment industry. We talked a lot about infrastructure and the need for tax reform. Afterwards, I toured the site and got ride in one of their Bobcats.
￼
 
Stopping by Restore Physical Therapy in Topeka:
A big thank you to the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) for showing me around the Restore Physical Therapy office in Topeka on Thursday. After checking out the facility, we sat down to talk about important legislative priorities, such as the current health care bills and rehabilitation under Medicare. Thank you to APTA for making this visit possible!

Dear Lindsey,
On Saturday, we saw horrific images from Charlottesville, Virginia. Sadly, individuals fueled by hate, racism, and bigotry caused violence that claimed innocent lives and put innocent Americans at risk. There is simply no place for this kind of hatred in our country, and I joined President Trump and other leaders in condemning the violence and protests in the strongest terms possible.
Three individuals, including two law enforcement officials, lost their lives. That is heartbreaking, and my prayers are with their families and all of those impacted by the senseless violence. Those responsible for inciting violence must be held accountable, and I am pleased to hear that Attorney General Jeff Sessions has launched an investigation.
Events like these are intended to further divide us as Americans, and sadly that seems to already be happening. When we allow the events to drive us further apart, then the racists and bigots win. Instead, let us unite as a country in condemning these vile acts and pledge to all do more to promote understanding and conduct ourselves in a civil and respectful way. 
Back on the Road
As the summer winds down and students head back to school, my August work period continued with another action-packed week in the First District.  While the House is out of session, this is a great opportunity to meet one-on-one with those I represent at home.  These past two weeks, I have traveled all across Southwest Alabama talking with business owners, students, and community leaders.  Check out these highlights from my past week in the Southwest Alabama! 
I kicked off the week by visiting Integrated Pain Management of Alabama in Mobile to learn more about the range of services they offer.  I was especially interested in the work they do with our area's veterans and the use of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy.
￼
Next, I was excited to meet with Israeli Consul General Lior Haiat during his visit to Mobile.  During the meeting, we discussed trade, cyber security, economics, & more.  As our democratic ally in the Middle East, the safety and security of Israel is a priority of mine, and I am proud of the strong bond we have forged between the U.S. and Israel.
Since Israel was founded in 1948, the U.S.-Israel relationship has developed and strengthened into the valuable partnership we have today.  You might be interested to know that I am a member of the Republican Israel Caucus, which is dedicated to protecting the rights of the state of Israel.  Through talks like these with the Israeli Consul General, I am committed to ensuring that Israel's security remains a priority for Congress. 
￼
Another stop I made this week was for a roundtable discussion with members of the local law enforcement at Mama Lou's in Robertsdale.  We covered everything from mental health issues to the I-10 Bridge to the ongoing opioid crisis.  Our communities rely on these brave men and women every day, and I was fortunate to share my deep appreciation and my commitment to supporting them in Congress.  Thank you to the law enforcement officers who serve our First Congressional District! 
￼
To wrap up my week in the District, I addressed members of the South Baldwin Chamber of Commerce in Foley.  I provided an update from Washington on everything from health care to tax reform.  I also answered questions from the audience on North Korea, health care, and immigration.  It is an exciting time for economic growth in Baldwin County, and I am thankful to have had the opportunity to address such a receptive crowd. 
What's Happening with North Korea
￼
As tensions continue to mount between the United States and North Korea, I joined FOX10 News to share my perspective on the ongoing situation and increasing threat North Korea poses to our country.  As you may recall, I traveled to South Korea twice this year to visit with our allies and the U.S. military leaders on the ground.  Having been to this region, I have seen firsthand the hostility of the regime under Kim Jong Un and the real threat they pose to the United States and surrounding countries.  
Recently, I voted in favor of a strong sanctions bill to hold North Korea accountable for their aggressive behavior that threatens the United States and increases instability around the globe. I was also pleased to see the United Nations unanimously pass a resolution putting new sanctions on North Korea. A global response is necessary in order to deter North Korea's aggression, and China holds an important key to the issues. 
This is a very serious situation, but military conflict should always be a last resort. That said, if North Korea and Kim Jong Un present a direct attack on the United States or our allies, we must act.  There is no greater responsibility of the federal government than to provide for the safety and security of the American people.  As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, please be assured I will continue to monitor this situation closely.

8/13/17 15:59,BREAKING NEWS: President Trump Signs Fourth Tester Bill of the Year into Law,"￼
 
￼

We’ve been hard at work for the people of Montana. We managed to pass seven bills through the U.S. Senate recently.
And President Donald Trump just signed the first of those seven bills, making it my fourth bill this year to become law! This is how Congress is supposed to work and it’s exactly what Montanans expect from their elected leaders.  These bills will help veterans get the care and benefits they have earned, allow local officials to hire more firefighters in Montana, and help rural families connect with the world.
VA Choice and Quality Employment Act This bill strengthens the VA, while ensuring the Choice Program doesn't cause our veterans any more heartburn. It will also provide funding to expand Missoula’s very own VA Clinic! Today President Trump’s signed this bill into law.  Forever GI Bill This bill creates new opportunities for veterans to pursue higher education and take advantage of their GI Bill benefits. It’s now headed to President Trump’s desk so it can be signed into law.  Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act This bill cuts through red tape and streamlines the VA’s overly-complex bureaucracy in order to address the massive disability appeals backlog that has kept veterans waiting far too long to receive the benefits they have earned. This bill is headed to the President’s desk.  Fire Grants Reauthorization Act This bill reauthorizes two important grant programs that provide rural communities with the resources they need to hire, train, and properly equip local firefighters.  Saving Federal Dollars Through Better Use of Government Purchase and Travel Cards Act This bill will reduce government waste and abuse, while saving taxpayers money by more closely monitoring the use of government charge cards.  Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act This bill will #ConnectMT and provide better phone service to rural Montana by requiring the Federal Communications Commission to establish basic quality standards for the transmission of phone calls.  Honoring Montana’s Fallen WWII Heroes This bill will rename three local VA facilities in honor of three Montana war heroes who risked their lives to defend our liberties in World War II.

Next Week's Town Hall Meetings


 Over the next week I will be hosting three town hall meetings for Tenth District Constituents. These town hall meetings uphold my long-time commitment to hold annual town hall meetings for each county of the Tenth District. During the meetings, I will provide an update on what has been happening in Washington and will also be taking questions directly from constituents. Additionally, members of my staff will be available to meet with constituents who have issues with federal agencies such as the Social Security Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Internal Revenue Service. The full list of this coming week’s town hall meetings is below.
￼





I Would Like to Hear Your Thoughts



In order for me to continue to be an effective representative for you in Washington, I need to know what you think. In advance of the town hall meetings I am hosting this month, I wanted to get your thoughts on some of the important issues facing our country. To accomplish that goal, please take a moment to share your views on the following questions. The two surveys can be accessed by clicking on the images below. I will provide the results of these poll questions in an upcoming weekly email update.

31 Reasons We Need Tax Reform



Our tax code is fundamentally broken and in desperate need of repair. We must reduce tax rates for American families and individuals while also creating a system that allows American businesses to be competitive with their counterparts overseas. President Trump and House Republicans committed to achieving comprehensive tax reform and once we return from the August district work period, those efforts will continue. Throughout August, the House Ways and Means Committee is outlining reasons why we need tax reform. Each day this month, they will release one reason why we must achieve tax reform, as the 31 days of August represent the 31 years it has been since the last major overhaul of America’s tax code. You can see more of these reasons and also stay updated throughout the month by clicking here or on the image below.

What I Have Been Reading


 Fans are going bananas for baseball
MSNBC 

I really enjoyed this profile of Jesse and Emily Cole, the owners of the Gastonia Grizzlies baseball team. If you’ve ever been to a Grizzlies game, you know there is just as much excitement between innings as on the field. It is great to see their business getting national recognition as it continues to grow and succeed 

Marines who died in Osprey crash identified
Fox News 

This tragedy reminds us of the daily sacrifices made by the dedicated men and women who serve in the U.S. military. Please join Giulia and me in praying for the three brave Marines who lost their lives in last week’s Osprey crash and also pray for all those military men and women who keep us safe .

National Night Out unites communities
 
Lincoln Times News 

Very cool to see neighbors and first responders in Lincoln County come together on the first Tuesday of August to host a block party with the aim of standing together against crime. It is an honor to represent these western North Carolina communities and all the wonderful people who call our area home.

31 Reasons: 7-13 
 
 
Last week began the 31 reasons for tax reform, one reason for each day of the month. If we truly want to grow the middle class, if we want to give them a raise, if we want to reduce income inequality, we must make our tax code competitive in the world. That has got to be our number one goal.
	•	Reason #7: American workers can compete with anyone in the world, but our current tax code holds them back. The way our tax code works now, businesses are encouraged to make less products in America and instead ship manufacturing plants and good-paying jobs overseas.
	•	Reason #8: American businesses now spend an estimated $147 billion each year filing business tax returns. The complexities of today's tax code force businesses to spend billions of dollars in order to comply with the law instead of investing these resources into their employees, hiring more workers, or expanding operations.
	•	Reason #9: Today's tax code contains seven individual income tax brackets, each of them discouraging hard work by imposing higher taxes on Americans' income as they climb the economic ladder. Through tax reform, Republicans are proposing to flatten these seven brackets down to three, which will better reward work and allow all Americans to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks.
	•	Reason #10: America has the highest corporate income tax rate in the world. At 35%, it's 10 to 15 points higher than the majority of our international competitors. If a company is looking for a country to host its headquarters, one with a 17% corporate tax rate and one with a 35% tax rate, its pretty clear how the story ends. 
	•	Reason #11: U.S. taxpayers, including individuals, families, and job creators, spend more than 8.9 billion hours each year complying with IRS tax filing requirements. In a dollar amount, all this time costs our economy more than $400 billion annually in lost productivity.
	•	Reason #12: Its hard for businesses and middle-class families to plan for the future, save money, or make long-term investments without certainty. Unfortunately, the tax code denies them that peace of mind with complexity, high tax rates, and numerous penalites on hard work. 
	•	Reason #13: The tax code today discourages busineses from investing in their companies and their workers, which hurts the growth of jobs and paychecks across the country. The Republican plan proposes tax reform that will unleash business investment, create jobs, and grow annual take-home pay for middle class familes, an average of $4,000 per family in South Carolina.

Jobs, Jobs, Jobs
 
 
I was very excited this week to learn of a few big jobs announcements at different companies in the Grand Strand and Pee Dee. Fiber Industries announced this week their plans for a $30 million investment at their textile facility in Darlington. This investment will bring economic growth, diversity, and nearly 150 new jobs to the area.

National grocery delivery service Instacart also announced plans this week to expand operations to include cities and towns in the Grand Strand. This will create 100 new jobs and offer a new service to residents in the area. Great news!

Mobile Office Hours
 
 
My staff in Washington is focused on legislation, writing and analyzing bills and trying to find ways to improve our country through laws at the federal level. But I also have two offices in the district, one in Florence for the Pee Dee region, and one in Myrtle Beach for the Grand Strand. My office has helped people with a variety of federal agency problems, closing more than 6,000 cases since 2013. 

We help people with things like VA claims, Social Security benefits, Medicaid/Medicare, the IRS, obtaining passports, federal student loans, some immigration cases, and more issues dealing with federal government agencies. We can't always get to ""yes"" but we do get there more than our fair share. If you are having a problem with a federal agency, you can visit my staff during mobile office hours. They will be at multiple locations around the Grand Strand and Pee Dee at the end of this month to assist you, no appointment necessary. See the sidebar for times and locations. We are here to help!

GOOD NEWS
During this time every year kids say goodbye to summer and begin to head back school, gathering supplies to begin another year of school. But for Macie McMillan of Myrtle Beach, it's also the time of year she gets to help fellow students. 

It started when she was in Kindergarten and her teacher sent a letter home to students asking them to donate extra school supplies to students who didn't have any. 

She took this request to heart and every year when it's time to go back to school she gathers book bags and other supplies for her fellow classmates in need. She'll start in Sixth Grade this year and to date has helped donate over 700 book bags filled with school supplies to her fellow classmates. Incredible!

Meet Richard | How Can I Help You? | Issues | Media Center | Contact Me
Friends, 
 
If you manage a family or business, you know how important it is to have a long-term plan for your budgets. While this is common sense for you, this basic understanding of the need for a long-term strategy seems to escape too many politicians in Washington. Rather than having a plan and making the tough  and sometimes unpopular  decisions that are necessary, too many in Washington choose to keep kicking the can down the road and it drives me crazy. 
 
This is flat out wrong and irresponsible!
 
This approach to governing has led us to the brink of fiscal disaster. We currently have a national debt of almost $20 trillion  and climbing. Our tax system needs to be completely overhauled, and in just over a month we will reach the debt ceiling  meaning we have borrowed as much money as we can under law. Think about reaching the limit on your personal credit card. 
 
As your Congressman, I stand by my word that I wont support a debt ceiling increase without spending cuts or substantial, cost-saving reforms. I agree we need to pay our bills, but raising the debt limit without fundamentally reforming government and addressing the events that brought us to the risk of default isnt paying our bills  its asking foreign countries to pay them for us. Taking out more loans and ignoring the root of the problem isnt avoiding default  its simply delaying it. Going back to the credit card analogy  its like raising the limit so you can keep on borrowing. 
 
To say our nation faces difficult fiscal challenges is an understatement. If we stay on the current path, net interest on the debt in the next ten years will exceed $768 billion. Thats more than we spend on any other area of the budget. Similarly, mandatory spending will reach 81% of the federal budget by the year 2040 with Medicare and Social Security going broke by 2029 and 2035 respectively. We must act now.
 
Thankfully, there are still some of us in Congress who recognize the importance of addressing these issues and are advocating for action. Ive voted several times for a balanced budget, and I support a Balanced Budget Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In addition, I introduced the Federal Sunset Act (H.R. 31) to root out waste and abuse and hold bureaucrats accountable by setting an expiration date for each federal agency. This is a bold idea that would fundamentally change how our tax dollars are spent.
 
Let me explain. A bipartisan commission would review every federal agency at least once every 12 years  one per year  and present their findings to Congress. The commission would go line-by-line and determine if each program was necessary and recommend whether or not they should be abolished or reformed. Instead of allowing our government programs to run on auto-pilot, my plan would require Congress to carry out the recommendations of the commissionotherwise the agency or program would expire.
 
In addition, Im also working to advance comprehensive tax reform. We havent had serious reforms in the tax code for more than 30 years. I support reform based around the concepts of simplicity, efficiency and equitability. I want you to be able to fill out your own tax return on a post card. We need to lower the corporate tax rate to promote job creation, increase wages, and eliminate harmful loopholes and special interests. 
 
We have a difficult path ahead of us to cut spending and get our nation back on track, but I am committed to getting it done. 
 
You and I have to live on a budget, so should Congress. If your son or daughter ran up your credit card, would you agree to increase the limit without making adjustments to the way they spend? No. This is common sense and I will continue to be your voice of common sense in Congress. 
 
 
Until next week,
￼
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)

Dear Friend,
It’s been another great work week in the Eighth District, and I wanted to share a couple of the highlights with you.
Moody Air Force Base Visit
On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to visit Moody Air Force Base where I was able to see firsthand its unique and strategic mission and the inner-workings of the amazing work our Airmen do on a daily basis.
We started our morning with 23rd Wing Commander Col Jennifer Short for a visit to Moody’s Rescue Campus, Fire and Emergency Services Department, and Security Forces Base Defense Operations Center. Col Short assumed command back in July, and we look forward to working with her to make sure our men and women in uniform have the resources they need to meet our nation’s 21st century threats.

We also had the opportunity to meet up with Col Jeffery Valenza, Commander of the 93d Air Ground Operations Wing. The Wing is made up of over 2,800 Battlefield Airmen at twenty locations throughout the country. Included in the Wing is the critically important Tactical Air Control Party (TACP), who have the responsibility of calling air strikes from the front line. They play an important role in our ground campaigns, and I thank them for the important work they do.

Serving Our Veterans and Their Families
On Tuesday, I had the chance to visit Georgia Veterans Education Career Transition Resource Center (VECTR) in Warner Robins. VECTR provides education and career resources for veterans and their families looking to transition to a Georgia Public college, university or workforce.
It was a great visit, and I thank them for the important work they do for our veterans and their families.

Purple Heart Dinner
One of my greatest honors is representing our nation’s military and warfighters in Washington. Last week, I had the opportunity to attend the Purple Heart Dinner  with American Legion Post 335 in Sylvester. The Military Order of the Purple Heart is a Congressionally-chartered charity composed of military men and women who have received the Purple Heart Medal for wounds suffered in combat.
Thank you to all of the Purple Heart Recipients for your sacrifice for our country.

August 13, 2017   Dear Friends,  With the August district work period well underway, I wanted to take this opportunity to show you what I have been doing around the district. 
On Monday, August 7th, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue made a visit to the 15th district during his RV tour across five Midwestern states. I was lucky to join him for part of his #BackToOurRoots tour. 
￼
Secretary Perdue and Shimkus in the #BackToOurRoots RV
Secretary Perdue, Illinois Agriculture Director Raymond Poe, members of the Illinois Farm Bureau, and I had a discussion of the 2018 Farm Bill and about needs and priorities of Illinois farmers at a stop at the Beaty Farm near Rochester.
￼
Secretary Perdue, Shimkus, and agriculture community members at Evergreen FS in Chenoa
We also toured the Evergreen FS plant in Chenoa.. 
 
￼
Shimkus, Secretary Perdue, and members of the Georgetown Fair Board
To end the day, Secretary Perdue and I attended a livestock show at the Georgetown Fair. County fairs across the state highlight the importance of agriculture and give people a chance to showcase their accomplishments. 
￼
Shimkus, Secretary Perdue and FFA members at the Georgetown Fair
On Friday, August 11th, I attended Community Appreciation Day at the Fayette County YMCA in Vandalia. The YMCA offers many programs that encourage positive youth development and promote a healthy lifestyle for everyone. This was a great opportunity to meet the staff and board members as well as people in the community. 
￼
Shimkus with YMCA employees and board members
I also had the honor of presenting military medals to Leland Wade, who is from Carlyle and a member of the American Legion Post 282, at the VFW in Greenville. 
￼
Shimkus pinning medals on Leland Wade
Mr. Wade served in the United States Army in World War II from 1943 to 1946. He earned medals during his service, but over the years had misplaced them. My office helped him obtain the medals he lost so that he and his family can treasure them for years to come. If you need assistance obtaining military medals you earned, please contact my office. 
As the district work period continues, I will be traveling to many more places and attending events all across the 15th district. I hope to see you in your hometown soon. 
Sincerely, ￼  John Shimkus Member of Congress

NEWS FROM THE 22nd DISTRICT
Renew NY-22: Reforming our Tax Code
Last week, we launched Renew NY-22, a plan to create jobs, grow the economy and increase economic opportunity here in upstate New York. This week, I focused on reforming our tax code. Here's a few ways we're working on that right now: 
Driving down rates while simplifying our tax code
Our current tax code is simply broken. Each year, job creators spend billions of hours and hundreds of billions of dollars in crippling costs just to comply with a labyrinth of rules and regulations that change from year to year. Under the current tax code, success is penalized and growth has been driven overseas as a result of an effective corporate tax rate of 39 percent, on average - the highest in the industrialized world. The current system is unsustainable. 
Congress is developing a comprehensive plan focused on lower tax rates to help the middle class. This includes first simplifying the tax code by reducing paperwork and filing requirements. Ideally, Americans will be able to file their taxes on a form as simple as a postcard. Individual rates will come down and tax brackets will be consolidated so that Americans are not penalized for their success. Special interest loopholes will be closed and policies that reward and encourage savings and investment will be strengthened. Increased capital expensing for businesses will enable job creators to grow and innovate while policies that modernize the tax code will allow companies to bring jobs and profits back to America without penalty. Meaningful tax reform is on the horizon and remains among my top priorities.
Protecting deductions that matter to New Yorkers 
I will advocate for provisions of our tax code that benefit Upstate families and small businesses. For example, the mortgage and charitable tax deductions are vitally important components of our tax code that bring substantial benefits to Usptate families and charitable organizations across the 22nd District. Likewise, the federal deduction for state and local property taxes saves New York taxpayers thousands each year. For this reason, I recently joined my New York congressional colleagues in sending a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury expressing strong concerns over proposals to eliminate this important deduction. State and local tax deductibility has been a feature of our tax system since 1913 and prevents residents in high-taxed states like New York from being doubly taxed.
Preserving municipal bonds for local governments
Tax-exempt municipal bonds have been a key tool for local governments to fund infrastructure and development projects for many decades. Nearly two-thirds of the core infrastructure investments in the U.S. are financed with tax-exempt municipal bonds. A unique combination of local control and local responsibility make municipal bonds an effective and efficient tool for communities. I have called on House leaders to include tax-exempt municipal bonds in any future tax reform proposal. Changes to the tax-exempt status of municipal bonds, such as those that have been discussed in Congress, could considerably increase financing costs for state and local governments.
Alleviating Upstate counties of Albany’s unfair and burdensome Medicaid liability 
I am an original cosponsor and champion of H.R. 1871, the Property Tax Reduction Act. This bill will correct an oversight in federal law that has allowed Albany to pass along the costs of its soaring Medicaid program onto local counties, burdening our local governments with increased tax liabilities and driving up our property taxes. No other state in the country abuses its local governments and taxpayers quite like Albany to fund an expansive Medicaid program. Out of all 50 states, New York burdens its counties with the highest percent of its Medicaid obligations. New York transferred more than $7 billion of its state Medicaid burden to counties in fiscal year 2015.
Funding Cost Sharing Subsidies
On Friday, I called on President Trump to fund Cost Sharing subsidies and on Congress to ensure the subsidies are subject to oversight and annual appropriations in the future.
The ACA has failed to create a robust and comprehensive individual market that drives down costs and increases choices for consumers. While Americans deserve better, until they have it, we should not take actions that would further destabilize an already fragile and failing individual market. President Trump should fund the Cost Sharing subsidies to bring certainty to insurers and to keep prices from skyrocketing even more than they already are under this law. In the future, these payments should be brought under congressional oversight and subject to the annual appropriations process, as they should have been from day one.
Mobile Office Hours
Thank you to everyone who joined us at our mobile office hours this week in Oswego and Chenango Counties. On August 16, our office will be hosting mobile office hours at the Herkimer County Fair from 10:00AM-2:00PM. We hope to see you there!
Tenney Secures $200,000 in Federal Funds Through the Northern Border Regional Commission for Town of Nelson
On Monday, I announced $200,000 in federal funding for drinking water infrastructure improvement for the Town of Nelson in Madison County. The funding is awarded through a grant allocated by the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC).
The grant will fund an improvement in drinking water infrastructure with a 16,500-foot extension to the public water main. In addition, a pump station and storage tank will be constructed to service a water district east of the Village of Cazenovia.
This grant is an important step forward in improving our infrastructure and expanding water access for rural areas in the 22nd District. The grant will provide residents of western Madison County with much needed upgrades and improvements to their drinking water. The NBRC provides our communities with access to critical funding streams that are necessary to support vitally important infrastructure programs. For this reason, I have cosponsored H.R. 3288, the Northern Border Regional Commission Reauthorization Act of 2017. This bipartisan legislation reauthorizes the NBRC through 2023 so that it can continue to support our rural communities in need of assistance.
Tenney Urges Union Representation to the Defense Accounting Solutions Board
This week, I urged the Department of Defense to allow union representatives from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) to serve on the newly established Defense Accounting Solutions Board.
This newly established board is comprised of individuals with a deep technical knowledge of accounting practices to facilitate the efficient and timely remediation of Department-wide issues related to finance and accounting. 
The board is tasked with prioritizing problems identified and communicated by DoD Components or their auditors, researching the issues and related authoritative guidance, and providing a path forward. The board offers a wide range of solutions including: suggestions of revision to current policy, implementation guidance or clarification memoranda.
In a letter to Secretary Norquist, Under Secretary of Defense for Finance, I noted the critical role that DFAS plays in executing an array of DoD finance and accounting tasks, and that this role should warrant their inclusion on the board in some capacity.
By ensuring robust representation of DFAS employees on the Defense Accounting Solutions Board, DoD will be able to gain a far more comprehensive and thorough understanding of the issues facing the Department.  Union representation, in particular, would enable these important finance and accounting partners to provide their valuable input and unique insights, which will enrich the overall quality of the Board’s findings.

Friends,
I want to address what happened yesterday in Virginia. The violence and domestic terrorism that occurred is sickening and unacceptable. The people who espouse political beliefs that we fought against in World War II only further poison our political discourse. It was a sad day watching the news and seeing a large group of White Supremacists and Neo Nazis incite such violence and hatred. 
Here is what I have been up to this past week...
Great Lakes Update
Brandon Road Feasibility Study
On August 7th, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released the Brandon Road Draft Integrated Feasibility Study for public review and comment. The report presents options to address the transfer of aquatic nuisance species, including Asian carp, from the Mississippi River Basin to the Great Lakes Basin. 
The full report can be found here: http://glmris.anl.gov/brandon-rd/. The public comment period will be open for a 45-day comment period which will end September 21, 2017. 
This is a big win for Northeast Ohio and the entire Great Lakes region. The release of the draft report is proof that when you work together in a bipartisan way, good things can be accomplished. 
Greater Cleveland Food Bank
I appreciated the opportunity to address over 300 staff and volunteers Friday morning at the 7th annual Greater Cleveland Food Bank awards and recognition ceremony. The selfless work the staff and volunteers do everyday is beyond commendable and I was glad to participate in the ceremony. 
￼
National Federation of Independent Business 
I had the pleasure of having breakfast with the National Federation of Independent Business in Painesville, where we discussed ways to discuss and grow small businesses in Northeast Ohio. I believe that small business is so critical for economy and having listening sessions like this are vital for me knowing the issues that small businesses face on a daily basis.
￼
Chagrin River Watershed Partners, Inc. 
I enjoyed visiting with the Chagrin River Watershed Partners, Inc. staff to discuss projects they are working on throughout OH-14. It was great to hear the local impact the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has had on our community. 
￼
Growth Partnership for Ashtabula County 
On Wednesday morning, I was fortunate enough to have breakfast with the Growth Partnership for Ashtabula County. I was able to inform them about what is going on in Washington and the issues that are affecting them in Ashtabula. 
￼
Ashtabula Goodwill Industries 
I also visited Ashtabula Goodwill Industries, where they brought me up to speed on Goodwill's current workforce development and job training programs. 
￼
￼
Ashtabula Senior Center
I had the opportunity to have lunch at the Ashtabula Senior Center where I was able to sit down and hear the concerns of seniors in our district. I was also pleased to bring in a U.S. Postal inspector to discuss potential mail scams that target seniors. 
￼
Ashtabula County Commissioner's Office
To wrap up my tour of Ashtabula, I met with the Ashtabula County Commissioner's office for a roundtable discussion on how we can work together to combat the opioid crisis in our district and throughout the country.

Making Washington Work for You
Over the past several months, the U.S. House of Representatives has been working on behalf of the American people.  While the mainstream media continues to ignore our work in the House, I would like to report that we have passed significant legislation to cut over-burdensome, job killing Obama-era regulations, provide necessary care for our veterans, strengthen our military, and enforce our immigration laws and strengthen our borders.
￼
I met with President Trump and families
of individuals murdered by illegal immigrants
at the White House.
Just the other week, I voted for the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, a national security funding bill that includes $1.6 billion – the full amount requested by the White House – for the southern border wall, fully funds a 2.4 percent pay raise for our troops, and provides the highest level of funding ever for the Department of Veterans Affairs.  In June, President Trump invited me to the White House to meet with families of victims murdered by illegal immigrants.  As I listened to their stories, I reflected on the horrible tragedies occurring across this country and at home in Pennsylvania’s 11th district, and was reminded again why I came to Congress in the first place.  I was pleased to support these families the next day, when I voted for, and the House passed, H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law and the H.R. 3003, No Sanctuaries for Criminals Act. 
The American people have made it clear that they want a President and Congress to work together for the betterment of the nation, not a political party or special interest.  That’s why each and every day, I’m fighting to get real work done for the American people.
I can assure you that I will continue to with the Trump administration and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make life better for the people of Pennsylvania.





From Washington...
 
Protecting America and The Men and Women Who Selflessly Serve It
One of the areas where my colleagues and I find common ground is supporting our Armed Forces.  I have been committed to protecting the men and women serving our country and the many military installations in Pennsylvania since coming to Congress in 2011.  While I recognize these jobs are critical to our local economy, they most importantly support the safety of our troops and the security of our country.  I believe the most basic responsibility of the federal government is to protect our nation and its citizens, and, by providing our military with adequate funding, we do just that.
That’s why, on July 14, I voted for, and the House passed, H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, by a bipartisan vote of 344 to 81.  While no bill is perfect, H.R. 2810 authorizes approximately $696 billion for our defense programs, advancing our nation’s security and supporting our troops at home and abroad.  Importantly, this measure increases basic pay for all military personnel by 2.4 percent, prohibits the transfer of any detainees from Guantanamo Bay to the United States, and strengthens military readiness.  It also authorizes 10,000 more personnel for active duty in the Army, 4,000 more for the Navy, and 4,100 more for the Air Force.  
Additionally, on July 27, I voted for, and the House passed, H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, by a bipartisan vote of 235 to 192.  This funding package shows our commitment to keeping America safe and strong in an increasingly dangerous world.  It includes the following:
Department of Defense
	•	Fully funds the authorized 2.4 percent pay raise for our troops – the largest military pay increase in 8 years.
	•	Increases base funding for the Department of Defense by $68.1 billion to continue rebuilding our military.
	•	Prohibits an additional round of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), or the closing of military bases.
Military Construction and Veterans Affairs
	•	Provides $78.3 billion for the VA – the highest level of funding ever and a 5 percent increase over last year’s funding level.
	•	Supports medical care for seven million VA patients, including mental health care services, suicide prevention activities, traumatic brain injury treatment, opioid abuse prevention, and homeless veterans’ services.
	•	Increases funding by 25 percent for the construction of critical military infrastructure.
Energy and Water Development
	•	Provides $6.16 billion in funding for the Army Corps of Engineers, prioritizing flood and storm damage reduction.
	•	Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary of the Army to withdraw from the flawed Waters of the U.S. rule.
Protecting Our Southern Border
	•	Provides $1.6 billion to secure our southern border, meeting the full White House funding request.
I can assure you that I look forward to working with the new administration to make sure that our service men and women, and their families, have the support they need to keep us safe.  I recognize that our military service members, veterans, and their families have provided an invaluable service to sustain our country’s freedom, and they deserve the very best care and compensation we can provide them.  I will continue to advocate for our nation’s veterans and their families and ensure that they receive the attention and care they deserve the minute they come home.
Strengthening The Enforcement Of Our Immigration Laws
On June 28, I was one of four members of the U.S. House of Representatives who met at the White House with President Trump for a roundtable discussion about the need to pass legislation to strengthen enforcement of our immigration laws.  During the meeting, family members of individuals who were murdered by illegal immigrants told their personal stories and urged Congress to pass the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act and Kate’s Law.
￼
Kate Steinle was murdered in 2015 by an
 illegal immigrant who is a seven-time felon
and had previously been deported five times. 
H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law, increases penalties for illegal immigrants who re-enter the United States after being deported.  The bill is named after Kate Steinle, a 32-year-old woman whose accused killer was a seven-time felon who had been deported five times previously.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement had previously requested an immigration detainer on the accused killer, but local officials released him because San Francisco is a sanctuary city, which does not honor such requests.
H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, cracks down on sanctuary cities by clarifying that no entity or individual may prevent a government from enforcing immigration laws or cooperating with immigration officials.  The bill holds that if a local government is sued for enforcing immigration laws, the federal government must step in as a defendant.  It also includes language named after Sarah Root, a 21-year-old who was killed when an illegal alien drove the wrong way on the highway into her car while driving drunk, and Grant Ronnebeck, another 21-year-old who was gunned down by an illegal immigrant who was free on bond while facing deportation.  That provision holds that illegal immigrants must be detained during removal proceedings when they are arrested or charged with causing serious injury or death.
On June 29, the day I voted for, and the House passed, both those bills, I spoke on the House floor about two families I met during my time as Mayor of Hazleton who lost loved ones to the violence of illegal immigrants.  Their stories are ones I will never forget.
Derek Kichline, a 29-year-old father of three young children, was murdered in 2006 while working on his truck by an illegal immigrant who had been released by law enforcement a number of times, including by the sanctuary city of New York.  Similarly, 21-year-old Carly Snyder of Northumberland County was stabbed 37 times by an illegal immigrant from Honduras in 2005. 
Violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants are preventable.  The illegal immigrants who committed these violent crimes should not have been present in this country, and certainly should not have been walking around free.  Too many mayors and local governments think that they are above federal law.  Kate’s Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act send a clear message to the American people that their government is serious about keeping them safe.  Both bills currently await action in the Senate, where I am hopeful they will soon be brought up for a vote.
Repealing and Replacing Obamacare
As we speak, Obamacare is collapsing.  This disaster of a health care law threw people off their preferred plans, eliminated access to their favorite doctors, and, on average, increased Pennsylvanians’ premiums by 32 percent.  
The average American enrolled in the individual exchange market is currently spending nearly $3,000 more on health care than they were prior to Obamacare.  A recent U.S. Department of Health and Human Services study showed that average Obamacare exchange premiums were 105 percent higher in 2017 than average individual market premiums in 2013.  In Pennsylvania, average monthly premiums during that same four-year time span grew from $242 to $533 – a 120 percent increase.
The people of Pennsylvania deserve better.
That is why, back in May, I voted for H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act. While the bill was not the final product, it was the first step toward repealing and replacing Obamacare.  It was a starting point for a better health care plan that will drive down costs, restore choice, continue protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions so that they cannot be denied coverage, and ensure that Americans’ hard-earned tax dollars go only to American citizens.  
While Congress followed through on our promise to provide Americans relief from Obamacare, unfortunately, the Senate was unable to do the same.  And while I cannot be more disappointed in the Senate’s failure to follow through on their promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, I can assure you that I will continue fighting until Pennsylvanians once again have affordable and accessible health care of their own choosing, not the federal government’s. 
As the process to repeal and replace Obamacare continues, Congress is acting on bills that will lower the cost of health care for hard-working Americans and their families, such as H.R. 1101, the Small Business Health Fairness Act, H.R. 2372, the Veterans Equal Treatment Ensures Relief and Access Now (VETERAN) Act, and a bill I introduced, H.R. 1671, the Verify First Act.
Small businesses have been hit especially hard by Obamacare’s flawed mandates, soaring costs, and limited choices. The Small Business Health Fairness Act, which passed the House on March 22 by a bipartisan vote of 236 to 175, empowers small businesses to pool together through association health plans and provide their employees with affordable health benefits.  With this bill, small businesses are on a more level playing field with larger organizations by allowing them greater ability to negotiate for lower health care costs for their employees. 
The VETERAN Act, which passed the House with my support on June 15, ensures veterans have the choice to either stay in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or receive financial support for a private health care plan.  While the VA delivers for some veterans, no veteran should ever be forced to stay in a health care system that does not effectively meet their needs. 
Additionally, on June 13, the House passed my bill, the Verify First Act. The Verify First Act addresses a fundamental problem with Obamacare that has significantly increased costs to taxpayers: The federal government pays the Advanced Premium Tax Credits to people before first verifying that they qualify to receive those benefits.  If individuals cannot verify their legal immigration status, the IRS is forced to chase after the money.  A 2016 Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs report revealed that, under Obamacare, $750 million in taxpayer-funded health care subsidies went to more than 500,000 people who did not qualify for those benefits.
My bill requires the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Health and Human Services to work together to verify first that an individual is a citizen, national, or legal immigrant before giving that individual the advanced health insurance premium tax credit.  With my bill, we can take those millions of taxpayer dollars previously handed out to those who didn’t qualify to receive them, and put them towards programs that will build a better world for the next generation.
Securing a Brighter Future for Our Children and Their Children
￼
I got to join some 4th graders at 
Steelton-Highspire Elementary School for lunch. 
On June 22, I reintroduced H.R. 3006, the School Food Modernization Act to help local schools replace outdated kitchen equipment and improve infrastructure.  A national survey indicates that 88 percent of school districts need at least one piece of new kitchen equipment, and 55 percent require infrastructure changes.  That is unacceptable.
We need a permanent solution to ensure that our schools have the tools they need to serve our kids healthier meals.  Too many of our nation’s schools have deep fryers when they really need walk-in refrigerators and freezers to keep fresh fruits and vegetables longer.  They have microwaves meant to reheat pre-packaged foods when they really need something as simple as a knife and cutting board.  By giving schools better access to modern kitchen equipment and infrastructure, while also strengthening workforce training.  We can improve focus in the classroom, and ultimately, a lifetime of healthier eating habits.
In a related matter, strengthening our workforce is a must if we want to maintain our position as a global leader and truly compete in the world economy.  Our government must invest in the American workforce and strengthen American competitiveness and jobs training.  We did just that when I voted for, and the House unanimously passed, H.R. 2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. 
This bill provides federal support to state and local career and technical education (CTE) programs.  CTE programs offer students the opportunity to gain the knowledge, skills, and experience necessary to compete for jobs in a broad range of fields, such as health care and technology.  Specifically, the legislation will:
￼
I toured the Luzerne Community College 
Career and Technical Education (CTE) Facility.
	•	Provide parents, students, and stakeholders a voice in setting performance goals and evaluating the effectiveness of state and local CTE programs.
	•	Enhance CTE programs through increased focus on employability skills, work-based learning opportunities, and meaningful credentialing so students are prepared to enter the workforce poised for success.
	•	Streamline performance measures to ensure CTE programs deliver results for students and taxpayers.
	•	Ensure CTE prepares all students, including historically disadvantaged and vulnerable students, for success in high-skill, high-wage occupations and careers in nontraditional fields.
	•	Empower state and local leaders to develop plans that improve the quality of CTE programs and take into account unique local and state needs.
Learning trade skills offered by community colleges is a pathway forward for our country right now, and this bill ensures programs like these can continue to help our students meet the demands of job opportunities available to them here in Pennsylvania and across the country.
200 Days Of Change
As we look back on the first seven months of the 115th Congress, there are still a great deal of things the people who elected us need us to get done.  However, I am proud of the work some of my colleagues and I have accomplished on behalf of the American people.  
As Americans, it is imperative that we put aside our differences and pull together toward our shared goal of a stronger United States of America.  One way I am working to strengthen our nation is by participating in the Bipartisan Working Group.  Every Tuesday morning, I spend time working with colleagues of mine from across the aisle in order to find bipartisan solutions to the issues most important to our constituents.  Whether it be the rampant opioid epidemic, providing quality health care for veterans, creating jobs by expanding career and technical education, or strengthening our national security, we are working on behalf of you, the people.  While the mainstream media consistently portrays both parties as obstructionist and polarizing, in these meetings, members open up to opposing viewpoints and actively search for the solution that best serves the people we are privileged to represent.
While these conversations can be challenging and sometimes uncomfortable, they move us closer to our goals of serving the people of our communities.  I can assure you that I will keep working with my colleagues in the Bipartisan Working Group, and the rest of Congress, to improve the lives of those I am privileged to represent. 
 




...To Pennsylvania
 
Connecting With You And Your Neighbors On Main Street
Main Street Tours are one of my favorite ways to meet the hardworking people of the 11th District.  During each tour, I go to different locations throughout the nine counties that make up our district, visiting local firehouses and small businesses to hear firsthand how I can best serve you in Washington.  For my latest Main Street Tour, which marked my 30th, I visited White Haven Borough.
￼
I visited the White Haven Fire Department to speak 
with volunteers about the difficulties they face day to day.
I was happy to have the White Haven Fire Department as the first stop on my July 21 tour.  Each time I do a Main Street tour, I like to start off at a volunteer fire company.  Ninety-four percent of the fire companies in Pennsylvania are volunteers, so I always make sure to thank them for what they’re doing.  Talking to local first responders and hearing about the challenges they face helps me better serve them back in Washington. 
My second stop was G&A Hardware, which has been owned and operated by the Jarick family since 1965.  I even stumbled across a can of spray paint I had to buy because it reminded me of how I started my own business painting lines on roads and in parking lots. 
￼
Chatting with customers
at Wood’s Ice Cream.
I then stopped by several other local businesses, including Tunnessen’s Inc. auto parts store, Maranuk Trucks and Heavy Equipment, and LK Hair Shop.  LK is run by Lisa Sensenbach, who was born and raised in White Haven.  I also got to meet her son, Christopher, who is going to apply to the Naval Academy and hopes to become a welder.  And while White Haven is no D.C. swamp, it was still a hot enough day to make stopping at Wood’s Ice Cream a must.  
I ended the tour with a stop at the White Haven Library, which started as a small collection of books in a former engine repair shop, but has now become a thriving community center.  They’re even thinking of starting an after school program and connecting the library to downtown with a boardwalk.  I can’t wait to see how the library continues to grow.  
Stepping Up To Help Our First Responders
When I talk with volunteers at fire departments across the 11th District, I constantly hear about the funding and personnel challenges they face, which is why I have been a longtime supporter of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency Assistance to Firefighter Grants (AFG) program.  Since 2001, AFG has helped firefighters and other first responders obtain critically needed equipment, protective gear, emergency vehicles, training, and other resources needed to protect the public and emergency personnel from fire and related hazards.
The success of the AFG program has not only helped fire departments nationwide, but also in PA-11.  Just last month, two of our local fire departments were notified that they were awarded a collective $187,468 for this year.  The Shavertown Volunteer Fire Company will receive a $144,610 grant, and the Liberty Hose Company No. 2 in Lykens will receive a $42,858 grant.  These grants will go a long way toward helping our first responders in Shavertown and Lykens attract more and more dedicated public servants to protect their fellow citizens.
If you or someone you know is interested in applying for a grant through the AFG program, or other federal grant programs, my Hazleton office stands ready to assist. You can reach my Hazleton office at (570) 751-0050.
Fighting to Protect Our Nation’s Beloved Animals
￼
I was greeted by kisses from Libre when I
visited the Speranza Animal Rescue in July.
On July 6, I had the honor of meeting the infamous Libre while visiting the Speranza Animal Rescue in Mechanicsburg.  Libre, who was rescued as a puppy after being abused, has become a national icon in the fight to protect animal welfare.  As a dedicated pet owner, I have consistently supported legislation that prohibits the inhumane treatment of our nation's animals.  For example, I have consistently cosponsored the Pet and Women Safety Act, which would expand existing federal domestic violence protections to include protections for the pets of domestic violence victims and would encourage states to enact similar legal protections for these animals.
I look forward to bringing Libre to Washington to help strengthen animal welfare laws at the federal level and can assure you I will continue my efforts to protect all of our nation's animals.

8/13/17 11:09,Beyond resistance: Making housing affordable for EVERYONE,"Update | Sunday, August 13, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 16th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: making housing affordable for everyone.
America has enjoyed a resurgence of urban centers and increased demand for walkable and livable neighborhoods. But communities, including my hometown of Portland, have struggled to keep pace with building and preserving affordable housing as market forces drive up prices and fuel redevelopment. This hits seniors, low-income people, and even middle-income families, especially hard. This requires a swift, decisive, and comprehensive response.
I will continue to strongly support efforts to help struggling homeowners and improve access to affordable housing. We need to give communities the tools to incentivize building low-cost housing and protect or even expand Section 8 housing vouchers. We all must continue supporting programs like the Community Development Block Grant and HOME Investment Partnership Program. These investments are particularly important for the Portland metropolitan area.
Housing, just like highways and schools, is critical infrastructure. It requires maintenance and development. I worked with the Federal Transit Administration to make it easier to build affordable housing along transit routes so that livable communities are accessible to people of all income levels. I’ve also sponsored legislation to improve the Low Income Housing Tax Credit to better leverage private investment and spur affordable housing development.
With the right combination of ingenuity and resources, we can solve this problem. Both citizens and government need to take an active role in developing affordable housing.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

August 13, 2017
Dear Friend,
As we already are more than halfway through the year, I wanted to take a moment to highlight some of my recent work to solve problems and strengthen communities in Florida’s 12th District. So far in 2017, I have authored more than 20 pieces of legislation, answered over 35,000 of your emails and letters, and helped more than 500 constituents with federal agency casework. Outside of Washington, I have held 15 site visits around Tampa Bay, seven office hour dates, six roundtables, three town halls, two telephone town halls, a job fair, and Veterans resource fair. And there is still much more work to be done!
Check out the video below for a quick wrap-up of my work so far this year. I look forward to continuing to work hard and get results for FL-12. 
￼  Click here or on the image above to watch.

Read on for a quick wrap-up of my latest work this week. 
Investigating Medicare and Medicaid Disability Accommodations
Whether it’s large print or text-to-voice technology, blind and visually impaired Americans, like myself, are more readily able to access information than ever before. Receiving critical health care information from Medicare and Medicaid should be no different. By law, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) must provide reasonable accommodations for those with disabilities. However, groups like the American Council of the Blind and the American Foundation for the Blind have indicated that written materials issued by CMS, including important information relating to benefit changes, are often provided in non-accessible print.
That is why I introduced a bipartisan bill, H.R. 3457, to investigate Medicare and Medicaid disability accommodations, and help ensure equal access to blind and visually impaired Americans who depend on the programs. The legislation requires a Government Accountability Office audit of CMS to determine if the agency is providing reasonable accommodations for blind and visually impaired Americans.
H.R. 3457 is about equal access for programs that help millions of Americans. It has been endorsed by the American Council of the Blind, the American Foundation for the Blind, and the Perkins School for the Blind. Click here to read the bill text.
Tackling the Opioid Crisis
Last week, President Trump declared the opioid crisis a national emergency to give the administration more tools to provide funding and conduct investigations. I strongly support this decision. The opioid crisis is an all-hands-on-deck effort, requiring action on every level from the President of the United States to our local communities.
In 2016, an estimated 60,000 Americans died due to drug overdoses, more than all the Americans who died in the Vietnam War. Our home state of Florida has been hit particularly hard, with sharp increases in recent years of the number of deaths due to overdoses. In the 21st Century Cures Act, I helped secure over $27 million in grants to fight this epidemic in Florida. The funding is part of a national strategy to support substance abuse prevention education, treatment and recovery centers, law enforcement resources, physician training, and more.
As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over public health matters like the opioid crisis, I will continue to work closely on this issue. I am committed to the collective effort spanning government, law enforcement, medical professionals, and communities on the ground to prevent addiction and save lives.

THANKS FOR JOINING ME!

￼

Thank you to everyone who joined me at one of my nine town hall meetings this week! I loved hearing from you and I believe we had extremely productive conversations. I'm ready to take this information back to Washington to represent YOU!

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CXXVI

Monday, August 7, 2017:  This past weekend I had the honor of being the keynote speaker at the Georgia Association of Broadcasters annual convention (GABCON) held on Jekyll Island.  At GABCON 2017, a number of stations and broadcasters from the First District of Georgia were recognized including Savannah’s WTOC weatherman John Wetherbee and Waycross’s Knox Carreker, who was recognized as one of the best broadcast engineers. 
￼
Rep. Carter on WTOC's Mid-Morning Live
 This morning I’m on WTOC’s Mid-Morning Live with Cyreia Sandlin and Tim Guidera to discuss my upcoming town hall meetings in the district.  Afterwards, I head to my Savannah office where I meet with Georgia State Representative Jesse Petrea and other members of the home health care community to discuss Department of Veterans Affaris (VA) issues and solutions.  This year, we have already passed the VA Accountability and Whistleblowers Protection Act, as well as a number of other VA bills.  Next, I head to the Home Builders of Savannah Board of Directors meeting where I address the group to bring them up to date on Washington issues, particularly tax reform and flood insurance issues.  My next stop is at WSAV studios in Savannah, where I have a live interview on MSNBC to discuss President Trump’s first 200 days.  A link to my interview can be found here.  My final stop of the day is back at the Savannah office where I meet with staff to discuss the agenda for the remainder of the week.

Tuesday, August 8, 2017:  Today is my first of three days of town hall meetings and I begin in the western portion of the district with a meeting in Jesup in Wayne County at the Coastal Pines Technical College.  As always, the meeting is well attended and the audience is very receptive.  Although scheduled for one hour I go for 1½ hours in order for everyone to have a chance to participate.  Aside from the usual topics of health care and the economy, this area has concerns with coal ash and the environment.  After a great discussion, I head to the Savannah and Brunswick Forestry Club meeting in Jesup where I am the keynote speaker and bring them up to date on what is going on in Washington.
￼
Rep. Carter at the town hall meeting in Jesup
Next, I head to Waycross and Ware County at the Coastal Pines Technical College Waycross campus where we have another great crowd and great discussion.  While the questions and comments here include the big issues like health care and tax reform, they are also interested in infrastructure, particularly roads.  My final stop is in Homerville in Clinch County where I am met by a great group of people who are well informed and politically educated.  Aside from the big issues, economic development and infrastructure are especially important to this rural area.

Wednesday, August 9, 2017:  I’m in the southern portion of the district today during day two of my town hall tour and my first stop is in McIntosh County at the Darien City Hall.  All three of my town hall meetings yesterday went longer than the planned one hour and in Jesup we were joined by the NBC network cameras. Today, we are joined by a reporter from the Washington Post, who is tweeting during our meeting as well.  We have a good crowd in Darien and, as would be expected from a coastal community, environmental questions and comments are on their mind along with health care and economic development.  Afterwards, I head to Kingsland in Camden County for our next town hall meeting at the College of Coastal Georgia Camden campus.  As you would expect, being home to Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base, military and veterans issues are on many people’s minds here as well as the proposed spaceport project.  Afterwards, I head to Brunswick and Glynn County where I tour Norwich Commons, an affordable housing project that opened in 2014 and was built by W. H. Gross Construction.  This very attractive development is an example of a completely private sector solution to the growing demand for affordable housing in our country.  Next, I head to the College of Coastal Georgia where we have our third town hall meeting today and sixth in the last two days.  As I promised last February, we have moved the Savannah and Brunswick meetings to 6:00 p.m. in order for more people to attend and tonight, despite some inclement weather, we have a very good turnout.  As expected, health care, environmental, and immigration issues dominate our discussion during the 1½ hour, at times contentious, meeting.

Thursday, August 10, 2017:  Day three of my town hall meetings puts me in the northern portion of the district as I begin at the First Baptist Church of Rincon in Effingham County where we have a good turnout and I am greeted by a very receptive crowd.  Economic development, immigration and infrastructure are the main topics of our discussion along with health care of course.  Afterwards, I head to Effingham Health System in Springfield where I meet with the new CEO, Fran Baker-Witt, and her executive team including Dr. John Bennett.  During a tour of this impressive facility, I also have a chance to visit with my good friend, Dr. John Sy, who serves on our First District health care advisory board.  Next, I head to Richmond Hill in Bryan County where we have a town hall meeting at the new Bryan County Administrative Complex. 
￼
Rep. Carter at the town hall meeting in Savannah
As always, we have a good turnout with many questions and comments about environmental issues as well as economic development, military and health care issues.  Afterwards, I head to Savannah where I have a tour of Ghost Coast Distillery in the River Street area.  Although I’m a non-drinker, I am truly amazed at this most impressive facility that opened in February and has already won four awards.  Next, I head to Bible Baptist Church in Savannah for my ninth and final town hall meeting in the past three days.  With a larger venue than we had in February, we are able to fully accommodate the crowd of hundreds of people.  As expected, this is the most challenging of all of our meetings with health care, environmental and political issues as well as abortion being the main topics of discussion.  However contentious this town hall meeting may have been, I am truly grateful for those people who spent 1½ hours of their Thursday night sharing their thoughts and concerns with me.

Friday, August 11, 2017:  It’s rare that I have my entire Washington and local staff together, so today we have a staff retreat where we review our strengths and weaknesses, our accomplishments and failures, and our goals for the remainder of this session.  I am blessed to have a talented and dedicated staff committed to doing their best to serve the citizens of the First Congressional District.  After our day long retreat, I head to the Desoto Hilton in Savannah, where I speak to the Georgia Black Caucus being hosted this weekend by my good friend Senator Lester Jackson.  A very busy week ends with a visit to the retirement party of my good friend Gus Bell, who has done so much over the years for the Savannah area and especially for me while I was Mayor of the City of Pooler.  Enjoy your retirement, my friend, and happy 80th birthday!

Dear ,
￼ 
Sen. Cotton with community 
leaders at UCA
I hope our state’s students are enjoying the last few days of summer break before school begins this week. I appreciate the hard work of all our educators, administrators, and district officials who are getting ready to welcome them, and I wish all our students across Arkansas a successful school year. 
Between newsletters, don’t forget to follow me on Twitter or like my Facebook page for daily updates! As always, please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns, or simply want to express your opinion. I’m always happy to hear from you.
Best regards, ￼  Tom Cotton
Arkansans Deserve a RAISE
￼ 
Sen. Cotton talking with Chris May 
on KATV about the RAISE ACT
Earlier this month, I joined Senator David Perdue of Georgia and President Trump in introducing the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act, a bill that would spur economic growth and raise working Americans’ wages by giving priority to the best-skilled immigrants from around the world and reducing overall immigration by half. For decades, our immigration system has been completely divorced from the needs of our economy, and working Americans’ wages have suffered as a result. This legislation will set things right. We will build an immigration system that raises working-class wages, creates jobs, and gives every American a fair shot at creating wealth, whether your family came over on the Mayflower or just took the oath of citizenship. You can click here for a section by section summary, and here for a fact sheet.
Arkansan Michael Platt Confirmed as Assistant Secretary of Commerce
I want to extend my congratulations to my fellow Arkansan, Michael Platt, Jr., on his confirmation as an assistant secretary of Commerce. His reputation precedes him on Capitol Hill, and I'm confident he will work hard to expand opportunity for working families in Arkansas and all of America. 

Arkansas Banks Are Top-Performers
Four Arkansas banks were recently named top-performers by Bank Director Magazine: Bank of the Ozarks, Home BancShares, Simmons, and Bear State Bank. I’m proud to see all four of these Arkansas banks receive such a high recognition. They and the services they provide are the lifeblood of our state’s economy, and they continue to think of new ways to expand opportunity throughout our state. I extend my heartiest congratulations to them on this well-deserved honor.

Fall Interns in DC
￼ 
Sen. Cotton at the Dardanelle 
Rotary Club Luncheon
My office in Washington, D.C., is currently seeking fall interns to help serve the people of Arkansas. Interns will have the opportunity to help with the daily operations of the office and witness the legislative process firsthand. Depending on their university's requirements, students may be able to receive academic credit for their service. Internships are open to both undergraduate and graduate students. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis. Part-time and full-time internships are available. The length of the internship will vary based on the applicant’s schedule and the number of spots that are available. To apply, please submit a resume and cover letter explaining why you want to intern in our office at internships_cotton@cotton.senate.gov.

Around Arkansas
Since August recess began last week, I’ve been traveling across the state and sharing updates about my work in Washington with Arkansans. Thanks to the Dardanelle Rotary Club for hosting me for a luncheon on Tuesday. It was great to see so many friends. I also appreciate leaders from Conway, Faulkner County, and UCA for taking time to talk with me on Wednesday about all that is happening in the community and on campus. You can find photos from all my visits last week here.

Summer District Work Period Update
From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:
Good morning,
During the second week of Congress Summer District Work Period, I engaged with drug awareness advocates to find solutions to the opioid and heroin epidemic.
I also recognize one of my hard-working interns and was honored for my commitment to conservative principles.
Here are some of the highlights of my work serving Pennsylvanias 10th Congressional District:
Combatting Drug Addiction
Opioid and heroin addiction has affected countless numbers of families across the country, including many of our neighbors in Pennsylvania. I met with drug awareness advocates in Williamsport to discuss this crisis that plagues our communities, families, and justice system. 
￼
I had an informative meeting in Williamsport with members of Saving Lives for Zachary, a local group that raises awareness of the dangers of drug addiction.
During this Summer District Work Period, I look forward to meeting with many other individuals, groups and businesses to discuss issues affecting them.
Standing up for Conservative Values
I was recently honored by the American Conservative Union (ACU) for my strong commitment to upholding conservative American principles.
￼
Matt Schlapp, Chairman of the American Conservative Union, presents Congressman Marino with the ACU Award for Conservative Excellence.
I will continue to work toward achieving conservative solutions to problems facing our great nation. It is our responsibility to ensure we live within our means to offer a bright future for generations to come.
Planning a Visit to D.C.? 
Summer is an exciting time to be in Washington D.C. and there is plenty to do and see. I encourage you and your family to stop by my office. Whether you are coming on a short trip or an extended family vacation, my office can help make arrangements for you in our nations capital.
￼
Anyone visiting DC can experience the history and art of the White House. You are encouraged to submit your request as early as possible as a limited number of spaces are available.
We are able to set up tours to the White House, U.S. Capitol, Library of Congress, Kennedy Center, Supreme Court and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. To secure these tours, please fill out an online tour request.  All tickets are provided on a first-come, first-served basis. Due to the large number of visitors, please request tours as early as possible.
Recognizing Our PA-10 Interns
Over the past couple of months, our office hosted Ursinus College student Bryan Patel as an intern in my Washington, D.C office. The Williamsport native will return to the Collegeville campus for his junior year to continue his studies in politics and international relations.
￼
Bryan Patel of Williamsport served as one of my summer interns in my Washington, D.C. office.
Thanks for your dedication and hard work, Bryan!

THE HEARTLAND OF AMERICAN INNOVATION
Southeast Michigan's innovators represent the bold entrepreneurial spirit that has become the hallmark of our great state, but for far too long their vision has been stifled. Oppressive taxes, burdensome regulations, deals that have long favored countries like China instead of domestic manufacturers - these are just a few of the many obstacles Michigan business owners have told me they face. We need to create a favorable economic environment that allows Michigan businesses to continue to pave the way on this side of the border, right here, in Michigan.

National Emergency: The Opioid Epidemic
The rise of the opioid epidemic has plagued our communities. In fact, overdoses are now the leading cause of death for those under 50. Last year, I was instrumental in the passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, and I have continued to work hard to ensure our communities have the tools they need to combat this crisis. However, it's clear we need more, and, this week, President Trump's declaration of this epidemic as a national emergency is another step in the right direction, allowing us to better focus on prevention, treatment, and recovery.

Five of our nation's top 100 safest cities are located right here in Michigan's 11th. Canton, Waterford, Novi, Rochester Hills, and West Bloomfield were all ranked as some of the safest communities in the country. It is so important to remember it is thanks to our communities' local law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line every day, and they deserve nothing less than our full support.

Greetings,
A few days ago, I made several stops in East Texas, where I visited fixtures of the Tyler and Kilgore communities. I had the opportunity to tour and visit with employees at Skeeter Boats Inc., and later in the day, participated in a conversation with students at the Rogers Nursing and Health Sciences Center at Tyler Junior College. I also toured Brookshire’s Grocery Company and held a town hall with employees. Each of these institutions have dedicated their time and talent to East Texas communities, providing jobs and opportunities for hardworking Texans. At each stop, we discussed efforts to reform the tax code and reduce the burden of federal regulations from Washington, so that Texans can create more good-paying jobs for the men and women of this state.

Coffman Recognized by Vietnam Veterans of America
Dear Friend:

As your representative in Congress, I often receive numerous recognitions for the work being done on your behalf both at home and in Washington, DC. Often time, these recognitions are an honor to receive, but I have to say that some impact me more deeply than others. 
Yesterday, I was humbled to have received the 2017 ‘Legislator of the Year’ recognition by the Vietnam Veterans of America for my work in Congress. The conference, which took place in New Orleans, LA, brought together hundreds of Vietnam veterans from all over the country together and enabled me the wonderful opportunity to not only accept this award on behalf of Colorado’s 6th Congressional district, but also afforded me the opportunity to personally hear stories of heroism and valor from Vietnam warriors.
One of the items I mentioned during my speech, was the fact that, while I did not personally serve in Vietnam, this war has had a particularly deep impact in my work as a legislator and as a member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. My heart has always been with Vietnam Veterans for having fought such a difficult war without the full support of the American people.
I invite you to take a few minutes and view the speech by clicking the image below:

CONSTITUENT SERVICES
NEWS
CONTACT
Dear Friend -   Let's face it: there is a lot of news coming out of Washington these days. And much of it is designed to draw a reaction from you or get you to take sides.   But there is another story out there that you're not hearing. That's the story of the important accomplishments made by the House during the first eight months of this year.   From the outset of 2017, we made it a priority to work on the issues that matter most to you and I believe we took meaningful steps to grow our economy, strengthen the health care system, improve education, boost national security, support our veterans, and protect the Chesapeake Bay.   Below are some highlights of our important accomplishments in the first 200 days of 2017.    ECONOMY AND EDUCATION   We must create more opportunities for people to find and keep a good-paying job. The best thing government can do to achieve this: get out of the way and make it cheaper and easier for companies to hire and innovate.   To that end, the House passed legislation, like H.R. 26, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act and H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act, offering relief from regulations that hinder economic growth. We also advanced an important bill to address the financial industry, H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act. The Financial CHOICE Act replaces many of the flawed policies of the Dodd-Frank bill and focuses on revitalizing community banks our small businesses rely on to be successful.    Access to job opportunities starts with a quality education and so we once again put education at the top of our priority list in the House. We passed a bill to expand support for charter schools (H.R. 244) and fund the Every Student Succeeds Act, which gives states and local school districts more control over the education decisions that affect our children.   I was also pleased we passed the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (H.R. 2353), which supports our career and technical education programs in Virginia. The bill promotes the development and implementation of programs aligned with state-specific occupations or industries and will help better match future workers with the skills currently in-demand in Virginia.     HEALTH CARE   I am committed to strengthening our health care system and ensuring all of those who want to purchase health insurance can afford to do so.   That is why I supported passage of the American Health Care Act (H.R. 1628) or AHCA, a bill that rolls back Obamacare, returns decision-making to patients, and addresses rising premiums and deductibles. The AHCA ensures that the most vulnerable of today and the future are protected and that no one with pre-existing conditions loses coverage. I believe this bill is the much-needed first step to restoring a health care system that works for all Americans. You can read more about why I supported the American Health Care Act here.   The House also advanced a bill called the Small Business Health Fairness Act (H.R. 1101) that allows small business employers to band together through association health plans in order to purchase quality health care for their employees at a lower cost.  Finally, the House delivered a $781 million increase in resources for fighting the opioid epidemic, with funds going towards grants, treatment and prevention, and support for law enforcement.   NATIONAL DEFENSE AND SECURITY   We face a wide array of evolving and sophisticated threats from nations like China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea. We need a strong national defense to keep our country safe and ensure the men and women of our Armed Forces have the training, equipment, and resources they need to carry out their mission.   To better provide for the defense of our nation, the House passed a bill (H.R. 3219) funding the Department of Defense (DoD) at a level 13% higher than last year. This boost in funding will help restore military readiness damaged by the harmful sequester cuts and continue the commitment to growing our Navy's Fleet. The bill keeps our military on the cutting edge of defense technology by investing heavily in research and development, ensuring the equipment and weapons used by our troops are the best found anywhere in the world, and keeps us a step ahead of our adversaries. And since we ask them to do difficult jobs in an increasingly dangerous world, the bill funds a 2.4% pay raise for our troops, the largest pay increase in 8 years.    Most critically for Virginia, the DoD portion of H.R. 3219 contains language blocking funds from being used to propose, plan for, or execute a new or additional base alignment and closure round (BRAC) and allows funds to be used on multiyear procurement contracts for up to 13 Virginia-class attack submarines. Virginia-class submarines are built in Newport News, meaning this provision will boost job growth in the Commonwealth.   Finally, since securing our border is a part of maintaining national security, H.R. 3219 includes $1.6 billion for the construction of a wall along the southern border with Mexico. While not a silver bullet for solving our illegal immigration challenges, building new portions and expanding existing areas of the border wall is an important part of the solution.   As Chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces, I made it a top priority to take the first steps towards growing the Navy's Fleet to 355 ships. Since not all ships are forward deployed at all times, 355 is the number the Navy has told us it needs to project force around the globe and deter threats but also stay up-to-date on maintenance and training activities. To read more about why 355 ships is critical for our national security click here.   Finally, the House took action to sanction three of our most serious geopolitical adversaries: North Korea, Iran, and Russia. Each of those countries are threatening U.S. national security and undermining global stability with a range of aggressive acts. The North Koreans are testing ICBMs; the Iranians fund international terror organizations; and the Russians are again intervening in eastern European countries, seeking regional hegemony. The House sent a strong signal that these acts will not go unanswered by passing the Countering Adversarial Nations Through Sanctions Act (H.R. 3364). The aim of this bill is to use political and economic leverage to help hold these rogue nations accountable.    SUPPORTING VETERANS   Our veterans made great sacrifices for our country. I am dedicated to ensuring they can access the health care benefits and educational and job opportunities they have earned and deserve.   The national defense spending package passed by the House (H.R. 3219) included $73 billion specifically for the Department of Veterans Affairs, a 5 percent increase over last year’s levels. With that funding, the VA will be able to better treat and care for our veterans, particularly in the areas of claims processing, suicide prevention, and treating opioid addiction.  In addition, we advanced a bill (S. 114) authorizing $2 billion in funding for the Veterans Choice Program, which allows certain veterans to seek medical care outside of the VA system. That bill also authorized 28 VA medical facility leases, including two facilities in Virginia — one in Fredericksburg and one in Hampton Roads. This authorization will improve access to care and health care outcomes for our Virginian veterans living in two areas with increasing veteran populations.  Also, the House approved H.R. 3218, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Education Assistance Act. This ""GI Bill for the 21st Century"" allows veterans to use the GI Bill throughout their lives instead of within 15 years of service and establishes a pilot program that allows veterans to attend non-traditional technology programs that will help them get jobs right after completion.  Finally, in order to ensure our veterans receive the very best treatment and customer service, the House passed S. 1094, the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017. The bill allows the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to fire, demote, or suspend VA employees who don’t perform their duties up to the level our veterans deserve.   THE CHESAPEAKE BAY  The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure, the life-blood of our region's economy, and the home to countless species of fish and wildlife. I am devoted to protecting and restoring the Bay so that it can be enjoyed for generations to come.   When reports surfaced that the White House budget proposal would eliminate funding for the program, I immediately wrote a letter to President Trump calling for $73 million be devoted to the Chesapeake Bay Program in his 2018 budget.   Unfortunately, that request was ignored and the program was cut out of the 2018 White House budget.   The good news is that after working with House Appropriations Committee members, $60 million in funding for the Bay Program was included in the Interior Department spending bill. Sixty million is a lot more than $0, but I still fear this funding is not enough to sustain the program, which we know is having great success. We have seen the success of the Chesapeake Bay Program through clearer water, more oysters and more blue crabs, demonstrating that the federal and multi-state partnership to restore the Bay is working. I will continue to be a strong advocate for full funding for the Bay Program as the appropriations debate resumes in September.   Two other legislative proposals I am pushing related to the Bay are the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA) and a bill to reauthorize the Chesapeake Gateways and Watertrails program run by the National Park Service. Each of these bills are critical to the Bay's continued role as a safe habitat for wildlife and an economic driver for our region. I will keep you updated on each of these bills as they move through the legislative process.    In the first 200 days of 2017, the House took meaningful steps to grow our economy, strengthen the health care system, improve education, boost national security, support our veterans, and protect the Chesapeake Bay. Those efforts will continue for the next 200 days and beyond.   Please continue to contact me any time an issue that concerns you is before Congress.   It's an honor to serve you and Virginia's First District in the People's House.  Sincerely,  Rob

Dear Friend,  
For those living in Washington’s Eighth District, it is no surprise that Wenatchee is one of the best places to retire in the United States, but it’s great to be nationally recognized! Forbes recently published a comprehensive review of 550 communities throughout all 50 states and looked at a variety of quality of life factors that contribute to quality retirements. Wenatchee scored well and beat out hundreds of other cities to land a spot in the top 25. 
What makes Wenatchee so attractive? Read more HERE.
Monitoring Local Air Quality
The heat and smoke from the Vancouver B.C. fires have continued to make spending time outdoors – especially for vulnerable groups – dangerous. Although conditions have begun to improve, please visit Washington State’s Department of Ecology’s website to monitor the Air Quality Index in your community.
Growth and Opportunity in Africa
Since the United States signed the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) in 2000, it has opened up many economic opportunities for both Americans and the people of sub-Saharan Africa. I am grateful my colleagues in Congress joined me in supporting its 10-year reauthorization in 2015. This week’s AGOA Forum in Togo provided an opportunity to highlight the success of companies like Alaffia, which was founded by entrepreneurs from both Togo and Washington and continues to operate in both locations. Alaffia is making the most of the opportunities created by AGOA to build its line of beauty and health products, creating good jobs and opportunities in both Togo and the United States. I look forward to continuing to strengthen our economic bond with sub-Saharan Africa and supporting more success stories like Alaffia.
Promoting Outdoor Recreation
Recently, Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) and Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA) joined me in introducing the U.S. Optimal Use of Trade to Develop Outerwear and Outdoor Recreation (OUTDOOR) Act. A bill that works to reduce tariffs on recreational performance apparel and strengthen America’s recreational economy. 
When people think of Washington State, they immediately think of the outdoors. Residents in my home state are blessed to have natural treasures such as Mt. Rainier and countless miles of trails in their backyards. I am proud to work on this bipartisan bill to make outdoor recreation apparel more affordable; supporting both outdoor enthusiasts and the growth of Washington's innovative apparel companies.

Celebrating the Power of Wind
Wind power is one of America’s largest sources of renewable energy and creates jobs across Washington State and the country. In light of American Wind Power Week, check out THIS video where I highlight some of the innovative, forward thinking, and job creating renewable energy sources used in Washington State. As our region has proved, environmental stewardship and economic growth are not mutually exclusive.
Expanding Resources for the JBLM Autism Community
On Wednesday, my staff attended a ribbon cutting ceremony at Joint Base Lewis-McCord for the opening for the JBLM Center for Autism Resources, Education and Services (CARES). The CARES center is the first of its kind in the U.S. Department of Defense and will serve as an important resource for service members, their families, and individuals seeking to learn about autism.
Have a wonderful weekend and I will speak with you next time! 

Sincerely,
Dave

ABOUT        CONTACT        SERVICES        MEDIA CENTER        LEGISLATION        ISSUES        RESOURCES     
Dear Friend, 
When I spend time with folks across southeast and south central Missouri, whether it's at my public roundtables, multiple small business stops or frequent listening posts, I consistently hear from families whose healthcare premiums and copayments have doubled, individuals who only have one, or in some cases no health insurance choices, and business owners who are spending more and more of their hard-earned resources trying to comply with costly Obamacare regulations than actually using those resources to provide benefits and coverage for their employees.
 
As I take the month of August to focus on farms, I have heard so many Missouri farmers tell me the number one thing they are concerned about is their health insurance costs and access. One family I spoke with is paying $20,000 a year for their Obamacare health insurance, and that is WITH the help of cost sharing subsidies. Another farmer I spoke with has sacrificed health insurance for himself because he can only afford it for his wife and daughter.
 
During my many trips back to Missouri between votes and committee hearings, my conversations with farmers and small business owners often come back to the same question, ""my costs to provide healthcare for my family and employees is through the roof, how do we get them down?"" At one of my healthcare roundtables in Cape Girardeau, I heard from a packed house where nearly everyone, including doctors, said we needed more price transparency in healthcare. I couldn't agree more. At another one of my healthcare roundtables in Rolla, we had more than 40 folks in the room, nearly all of whom were concerned about the dwindling number of providers in the area. Unfortunately, under Obamacare, 26 of 30 counties in Missouri's 8th Congressional District only have one insurer to choose from. There is no choice, and there is no competition, which means higher prices.
 
Our country is better than this. We cannot allow hardworking Americans to suffer under Obama's failing healthcare law. The House of Representatives has made progress on bills that will allow insurance to be sold across state lines and give people who own small businesses or run farms the opportunity to ban together, buy insurance as a larger group and lower their overall costs. We have passed bills to end the anti-trust exemption for insurance providers to bring back competition. We have worked hard to give Americans relief from the burden of Obamacare, and it's time for the U.S. Senate to do the same. In order to finish what we've started, Senators are going to have to stop letting politics get in the way, do what's right for the American people and take action on legislation that will make a difference.

We have a president who is ready to sign a repeal bill for one of the most intrusive pieces of legislation in my lifetime, and the House of Representatives has voted to repeal and replace Obamacare multiple times. Now the Senate has a choice. Do they want to finish the work to relieve Missourians and folks all across the country of the burden that is Obamacare or continue with the status quo? People have shouldered this burden long enough, and the time to act is now. 
Focus On Farms 
On August 10, 1821, our great state joined the Union. 196 years later, I've gotten to celebrate the birth of our state by stopping all across our region to focus on the number one economic driver in our area, agriculture. 
￼ 
In addition to being Missouri's Birthday, this week was also National Farmers Market Week.  I got to visit Pierce Century Farm in Jefferson County where they grow produce to sell at local farmer's markets. Ben and Rebecca Pierce run the farm and have major plans to expand their operation from growing produce to being a part of the agri-tourism and entertainment industry in Missouri. They are already off to a great start, and will be welcoming guests to their farm for a Fall Festival this October. Check out their page for details! 
￼ 
The Beggs family are 4th generation farmers and have been raising watermelons in Scott County for 121 years. During melon season, they have around 30 employees and ship their watermelons to Florida, Alaska, Iowa, Illinois, Tennessee, and Mississippi. 

In October, they open their family farm for a corn maze, games, petting zoo and a pumpkin patch. They had 34,000 people visit last year and employ a total of 60 people during this part of the year. 

Like many other folks I've talked to this month, they are concerned about the rising costs of health insurance, which is why I'm going to continue to push the Senate to take action to relieve Missourians from the burden of Obamacare. 

￼ 

At Cane Creek Sod Farm in Butler County, they have 400 acres that they have farmed for more than 20 years. They sell their sod to places like Lowe's Home Improvement, The Home Depot and Walmart. 

The biggest issue they face is having recent high school grads who want to deliver sod for them but, because of a federal regulation, aren't allowed to get their commercial driver's license until they are 21. Young folks who are willing and able to work shouldn't be stopped from opportunities like delivering sod by regulations from Washington. That's why I'm continuing my fight against bureaucratic overreach and get the government off the backs and out of the way of hard-working Missourians. 

￼ 

Blair Aviation is a family owned and operated crop dusting service in Stoddard County. They have six employees and average flying 3,000 acres a day over six to seven counties. 

Like me, they are worried about EPA regulations impacting the work they do. We had a great conversation about the progress the Trump Administration, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and I are making as we work to undo Obama-era regulations. 

Our farm stops will continue throughout the month of August! Follow me on Facebook and Twitter for updates from our fifth annual focus on farms.

As always, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to my office for help.

THIS WEEK IN OKLAHOMA
This week my travels took me to several counties in the Second District of Oklahoma. Click here to see all of the pictures from this week.  On Monday, I met with Associated Builders and Contractors of Oklahoma to address concerns that they see on a daily basis. 
Tuesday, I sat down with several Oklahoma professionals to listen to their concerns and discuss different ways that I can help them in Washington. Thank you to the Mid America and Port of Catoosa industry managers for taking the time to meet with me. 
￼
Enjoyed meeting with Industry Managers 
at the Port of Catoosa!
Later on, I spoke to workers at the TMK IPSCO Restart Event. This business is one of the largest North American producers of welded and seamless pipe and premium connections dedicated to serving the oil and gas industry. With the new beginning of this plant in Catoosa, more than 160 new jobs have been created. It was great to celebrate the restart with them!
￼
Thank you to TMK IPSCO for letting me 
celebrate their plant restart with them!
The issues you care about are the most important issues to me - main street jobs and economic security, patient-centered health care, rebuilding our military, and fixing Washington. This week I also met with several Cherokee County leaders to answer the questions they had about the work I am doing on these issues in Washington. Do you know what House Republicans have passed so far in 2017? Take this quiz to find out.

Great to meet with leaders in Cherokee County!
OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR
My goal will always be to serve the people of the Second District to the best of my ability.  That’s why since January:
	•	I have held more than 315 constituent meetings in Oklahoma and D.C. and have addressed over 25 groups of Oklahomans, including tribal leaders and members, state businesses, community groups, and chambers of commerce.
	•	I have dialed over 154,000 households during telephone town hall events and over 400 people have dialed in during the event, so that Oklahomans can utilize a direct line of communication to me while I’m in Washington.
	•	I have held 27 town hall meetings across the Second District to provide opportunities for frank, honest dialogue with Oklahomans.
	•	I have responded to over 13,500 pieces of constituent mail answering your questions and providing my viewpoints on legislation.
	•	I have participated in over 60 Energy and Commerce Committee hearings and markups to hear firsthand from the public about proposed legislation that will have the chance to be considered on the House Floor.

EDUCATING THE NEXT GENERATION
Education is the most valuable tool that we can give to the next generation.  Providing resources for our educators and our students should be a top priority in our community. In this week’s Mullin It Over column, I explained how my role as your link to the federal government is to get government out of the way of Oklahoma’s educational system.  Our government should be giving control to those that truly know what’s best for the students: the parents and teachers who actually spend time with their kids and their kid’s education.      
DC UPDATE
Recently I introduced legislation to combat the ongoing opioid crisis across the country along with Congresswoman Katherine Clark. The Every Prescription Conveyed Securely (EPCS) Act, requires e-prescriptions for controlled substances under Medicare.

Dear Friends,   I am writing you today to share the latest edition of Jackie's Reading Picks, a selection of articles that have piqued my interest over the past week and that I thought would be of interest to you. One of the cornerstones of our great democracy is our free press and an informed citizenry. Now, more than ever, it's critical that we remain engaged and keep ourselves informed of the news and issues that impact each and every one of us. I also want to hear your feedback and what you think we should be reading and focusing on at home in the 14th District, and around our great country. By working together and keeping abreast of what is happening in our government, economy, and communities we can continue to contribute to and strengthen our democracy. 
Happy reading and all the best,     ￼

America Is Not Ready for a War in North Korea
By Eliot A. Cohen, The Atlantic
If you want to know why you should be concerned that the United States could blunder into an ill-conceived war on the Korean peninsula, consider three statements:
￼
“We’ll handle North Korea. We’ll be able to handle North Korea. It will be handled. We handle everything.” (Donald Trump, July 31)
“The president’s been very clear about it. He said he’s not gonna tolerate North Korea being able to threaten the United States. If they have nuclear weapons that can threaten the United States, it’s intolerable from the president’s perspective. So of course, we have to provide all options to do that. And that includes a military option.” (Lieutenant General H. R. McMaster, August 5)
""North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States.  They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen."" (Donald Trump, August 8)
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s plaintive words about the United States not being North Korea’s enemy (August 1), or his reassurance that the military option has not drawn closer (August 9), do not count much, partly because he does not count much in American foreign policy these days, and partly because in this administration above all, only the president counts. They do, however, confuse the message of an already chaotic administration.

Meet Alex, the Russian Casino Hacker Who Makes Millions Targeting Slot Machines
￼
By Brendan Koerner, Wired
Late last autumn, a Russian mathematician and programmer named Alex decided he’d had enough of running his eight-year-old business. Though his St. Petersburg firm was thriving, he’d grown weary of dealing with payroll, hiring, and management headaches. He pined for the days when he could devote himself solely to tinkering with code, his primary passion. The time had come for an exit strategy.
But Alex couldn’t just cash out as if he owned an ordinary startup because his business operates in murky legal terrain. The venture is built on Alex’s talent for reverse engineering the algorithms—known as pseudorandom number generators, or PRNGs—that govern how slot machine games behave. Armed with this knowledge, he can predict when certain games are likeliest to spit out money—insight that he shares with a legion of field agents who do the organization’s grunt work.

Transgender Camp Teaches Kids They’re ‘Normal, Not Alone’
By Jocelyn Gecker, AP
EL CERRITO, Calif. (AP) — In some ways, Rainbow Day Camp is very ordinary. Kids arrive with a packed lunch, make friendship bracelets, play basketball, sing songs and get silly. But it is also unique, from the moment campers arrive each morning.
At check-in each day, campers make a nametag with their pronoun of choice. Some opt for “she” or “he.” Or a combination of “she/he.” Or “they,” or no pronoun at all. Some change their name or pronouns daily, to see what feels right.
The camp in the San Francisco Bay Area city of El Cerrito caters to transgender and “gender fluid” children ages 4 to 12, making it one of the only camps of its kind in the world open to preschoolers, experts say. Enrollment has tripled to about 60 young campers since it opened three summers ago, with kids coming from as far as Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. - even Africa. Plans are underway to open a branch next summer in Colorado, and the camp has been contacted by parents and organizations in Atlanta, Seattle, Louisiana and elsewhere interested in setting up similar programs.

Forever Yesterday: Peering Inside My Mom’s Fading Mind
By Kevin Sampsell, Longreads
Every time I talk to my mom on the phone, just as I’m getting ready to say goodbye, she slips in an abrupt update about her parents — my grandparents. Sometimes they’re in Switzerland. Sometimes they’re in Loma, Montana. Sometimes they’ve gotten “mixed up with bad people.” Sometimes they’ve completely disappeared or died mysteriously. Sometimes it sounds like a government conspiracy — a murder plot. At first, I didn’t know what to say in return. I’d ask how they died or what they were doing in Switzerland. In more recent conversations, I tried to place her back in reality. I’d say, “Mom, your parents have been dead for forty years.” I’d ask her how old they were and she would say 60, 70, or 75. She’s not sure. She says that all the time: I’m not sure. “How old are you?” I ask, and she laughs and says, “Oh, I think I’m about 25.” Once she said she was 18. She’s actually 88 years old.
For about two years now, my mother has been fighting with Alzheimer’s and the dementia that comes from that disease. She’s had years of struggle with diabetes and epilepsy — but her mental condition was always sharp. A lifelong democrat and the mother of six, Patsy loved sewing, making quilts, reading mystery novels, and watching Seattle Mariners baseball while enjoying a Pepsi (never Coke). I am her youngest son.

8/12/17 11:16,Beyond resistance: Banning offshore drilling,"Update | Saturday, August 12, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 15th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: banning offshore drilling.
The United States must act to protect fragile and vulnerable areas from offshore drilling. We need to preserve natural ecosystems across the Arctic, Atlantic, and Pacific oceans, which is why I strongly support permanently protecting these waters from drilling that could irreversibly damage habitat, impact water quality, and affect natural processes in our oceans and on our shores.
My colleagues and I have developed legislation to ban offshore drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans and off the U.S. West Coast. We must protect our oceans.
Rather than drilling in some of the most ecologically sensitive regions in the world, we should support programs that reduce pollution and quickly transition our economy and energy sector to a clean, sustainable future. Our legacy should be one of conservation, careful investment in preservation of precious natural resources, and protection of human health and our fragile climate.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage,

Weekly Review
 
August 5

Amendments to The Make America Secure Act: A little more catch-up…in this case on some of the amendments the House voted on last week to the Make America Secure Act. This Act was a package of four smaller spending bills to fund the Defense Department, Energy Department, Veterans Affairs Department, military construction projects, and the Legislative Branch.

Let me give you a few details on what I viewed as some of the more important amendments.

Several targeted the Congressional Budget Office, either in terms of reducing its funding, functionality, or both. Two of those amendments received votes. The first, offered by Rep. Scott Perry, would have cut funding for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in half. The second, offered by Rep. Morgan Griffith, would have eliminated the CBO’s Budget Analysis Division, which produces projections of federal spending and cost estimates for legislative policy proposals.

I voted against both of these amendments for a number of reasons but by no means does that indicate I am satisfied with the work CBO has been producing. Often times in life it's better to fix something and improve it than it is to completely discard it. Such is the case with the Congressional Budget Office... Click here to read more...

Ozone Standards Implementation Act: The air we breathe. The water we drink. Our surroundings. Each of these things are part and parcel to not only life itself but the quality of our lives.

I say this because if one reads about smog days in Los Angeles or Beijing and the ways in which people are encouraged to stay inside and not go out, it makes you think about how important things are that we take for granted.

In this light, last month, the House voted on H.R. 806, the Ozone Standards Implementation Act, a bill that would keep an ozone air quality standard from going into effect for another eight years. Last Congress, I voted against this bill with a handful of Republicans, and this time, I joined ten of my Republican colleagues in doing the same again.

The same reasoning applied this time around, and accordingly, I would ask you to take a look at my post from last year….

The Coming War for Cyberspace:  In May and June of this year, two separate attacks were launched on computers and networks around the world, both employing hacking tools stolen from the United States National Security Agency. The two attacks, called WannaCry and Petya, took only hours to infect hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries. Hospitals, banks, transportation networks, public utilities, and government systems were shut down, and terabytes of sensitive data were stolen or lost completely.

These attacks were indicative of a new norm, in which geopolitical conflicts will be hashed out in cyberspace instead of on the battlefield. That’s author Alexander Klimberg’s message in his new book, The Darkening Web, which was recently reviewed in the Wall Street Journal.

The very nature of the hacking tools that were stolen from the NSA speaks to the contradictory nature of America’s cyber policy. Called “zero-day exploits,” these tools are based on flaws buried deep in the code of operating systems and major pieces of software that even their developers don’t know about. Once it finds these vulnerabilities, instead of informing developers so they can mend the holes in their code, the NSA tends to store them away in secrecy, so it can use them later on. The only risk in doing this, of course, is the possibility that someone might break in and steal them, which is exactly what happened at the NSA this past April.

In his book, Klimberg discusses the events that led up to these recent attacks in the wider context of cyber warfare history. He also explores some policy changes the United States could make to better prepare itself for this new norm of cyber warfare.

Washington Metrorail Safety Commission: Last month, the House passed H.J. Res 76 by a vote of 399 to 5. This resolution would allow Virginia, Maryland, and DC to establish a tri-state Washington Metrorail Safety Commission. Under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress has the authority to permit states and the District of Columbia to enter into interstate compacts. But what Congress doesn’t have the authority to do is authorize compacts that would allow states to conduct warrantless searches of private property. One section of the agreement did just that, and accordingly, I was one of five Republicans to vote no.

The section in question would have authorized the Metrorail Safety Commission to enter upon any property that is adjacent to the metrorail system for investigations, repairs, and more. This would include any privately-owned lands and premises that happen to be next to the railway. The only restriction on this authority would be that the CEO of the metro transit authority must first give “reasonable notice.” The Founding Fathers didn’t protect us under the Fourth Amendment with a “reasonable notice” standard...they said that absent an ongoing emergency or crime, there needs to be a warrant issued by a judge in order to intrude on folks’ private property.

The DC metro system is in dire need of improvements, particularly those related to rider safety. In fact, in the last three years alone, there have been three total train derailments. But while it seems reasonable that Congress should work to address these issues as soon as possible, we should be wary of any bill that rolls over private property rights in exchange for a remedy.

Freedom of Speech: Under the category of catching up over the last couple of weeks in Washington, I’d ask you to take a look at the video below. I found myself on a panel discussing the importance of freedom of speech and even freedom of the press. What I always find fascinating about the First Amendment is the fact that our Founding Fathers indeed put it first.

Reforming Our Tax Code 
Think about life 31 years ago: most of us communicated solely by landline; the Internet wasn’t widely available, and certainly not for commercial purposes; and Oprah Winfrey was just beginning her talk show career. Life has changed a lot in the last three decades, but our tax code hasn’t kept up. According to the Tax Foundation, our tax code is more than 2.4 million words long, which is almost six times as long as it was in 1955; and nearly twice as long as it was in 1985. Every aspect of the tax code is complex – consider just education as an example. Today there are over 12 different overlapping tax benefits related to education, which means there are 100 pages of instructions to figure out if students qualify for help with tuition costs. The time for an update and commonsense change to our tax code is now, which is why Congress is working on comprehensive tax reform.
There is no question we need to lower taxes for people at all levels of income, from our job creators to hardworking taxpayers to our friends and neighbors who have fallen on hard times. As you may know, at 35 percent, America has the highest corporate income tax in the industrialized world. This actually incentivizes businesses that operate globally to create jobs overseas, and makes it harder for domestic companies to compete with foreign competitors. Excessive regulation and taxes are a deterrent to job creation and higher wages, and it’s time for Congress to act to ensure Americans can keep more of their hard-earned pay and grow the economy. 
Our proposed pro-growth tax reform agenda will lower rates for individuals and businesses on Main Street, prioritize job creation and make American businesses more competitive with their overseas competitors. House Republicans’ plan will also help middle-class families by consolidating tax brackets and lowering tax rates, which should encourage more saving and investment. Businesses who have invested overseas will be encouraged to bring jobs to the United States, and domestic manufacturers will be put on at least a level playing field with their foreign competitors. According to the House Ways and Means Committee, if the United States economy averages a three percent growth in the next ten years, there would be millions of jobs created and income for a family of four would be thousands of dollars higher. In Tennessee alone, House Republicans’ tax reform plan is projected to bring medium-income households in Tennessee roughly $4,000 more in after-tax income gains while adding more than 34,000 jobs across the state. With potential results like that, it’s critical that we work together to get this done.
As I’ve said many times, our tax code is far too complex. So complex, in fact, that taxpayers spend $99 billion each year complying with the individual income tax. House Republicans are going to work to replace our complicated and confusing tax code with a leaner, simplified and more competitive plan than ever before. We are proposing a plan so simple that, if adopted, taxpayers will be able to file their income taxes on a post card, rather than spend much of their time and money trying to follow our complicated tax laws.
House Republicans are committed to making tax season less stressful and complicated for American families who have many other things to worry about. By helping individuals and families file their taxes simply, hardworking taxpayers will be able to keep more of their paycheck each year. With President Trump’s leadership, I am confident that we can accomplish a simplified and streamlined tax code that will put taxpayers first, create jobs, and grow our economy.
As always, feel free to contact my office if I can be of assistance to you or your family.

Working to end the opioid epidemic 



Friend, 
Welcome to your weekly update. As always, you can learn more about these and other legislative issues at my website: upton.house.gov. 
Working to end the opioid epidemic
This week I was able to sit down with Cass County Sheriff Rick Behnke and three local police chiefs to discuss the important work they are doing to curb the opioid epidemic here in Southwest Michigan. 
Opioid addiction has hit our community hard. Last Congress, I worked to get a slew of bills signed into law by President Obama, that amongst other things, helps give better guidance to doctors about prescribing opioids. There is still much work to be done, and public servants like Sheriff Behnke are working hard to fight the illegal sale and trade of these drugs to help fight addiction. 
I will continue to work in bipartisan manner to help support our community as we battle this epidemic. 
You can see photos from this special event here.
Fighting to Keep Asian Carp out of Lake Michigan
On Monday, the Army Corps of Engineers released the long-awaited Brandon Road Study which provides important guidance on how to best protect our Great Lakes from invasive species, like Asian Carp. 
To us here in Southwest Michigan, Lake Michigan is more than just a national treasurer, it’s a driver of our local economy. Threats to its longevity must be snuffed out, including Asian Carp, which has the potential to cause devastating effects to the delicate ecosystem in the lake. 
Republicans and Democrats must continue working together on solutions that protect the Great Lakes economy and environment. This is a solid first step, but more work remains.  
One more thing…
It was a productive week here at home! You can check out some highlights from the week here. As always, stay up to date with me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 
 Have a great weekend and God bless,
-Fred

...TO FIX OUR BROKEN TAX CODE
Every day this month, I知 highlighting one of the many reasons we need tax reform.
Our tax code is broken, and after 31 years, it痴 long overdue for an overhaul.
That痴 why I知 working on tax reform that will help businesses grow and create jobs and help Hoosier families keep more of their hard-earned money.
Check out this week痴 reasons to fix our broken tax code, and be sure to join me on Facebook to find out a new reason for tax reform every day.
￼
Reason #6: We need tax reform so we can make it easier for families to get help paying for their children's education and college tuition.
￼
Reason #7: Northern Indiana leads the nation in manufacturing. We need tax reform to make America more competitive in the global economy and prevent jobs from going overseas.
￼
Reason #8: American businesses spend $147 billion each year filing taxes because the tax code is too complex. Let's change that with tax reform. 
￼
Reason #9: We need tax reform to allow hardworking Americans to keep more of their paychecks by flattening taxes from 7 brackets to just 3.
￼
Reason #10: America has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. With tax reform, we can unleash economic growth and job creation by making the U.S. more competitive in the global economy.
￼
Reason #11: 8.9 billion hours: that's how long American taxpayers spend each year complying with IRS requirements. We need tax reform to make our tax code simpler.
￼
Reason #12: It's time to end the uncertainty our broken tax code creates for families and businesses. We need tax reform for a 21st century economy.
As always, it is a privilege to represent 2nd District Hoosiers in Congress.

Davis discusses agriculture issues important to the 13th District during a House Agriculture Hearing.


A Busy House
Dear friend,
While much of what we do in the U.S. House of Representatives doesn't make newspaper headlines, I've had a busy seven months. 423 House votes, 47 committee hearings, 142 bills cosponsored, 15 bills introduced, 343 meetings, 229 Capitol tours, 309 casework completed, and 93 flags flown over the Capitol.

In the House, we are focused on passing legislation to improve the everyday lives of those we serve. While the Senate hasn't moved as quickly as I would like, I hope Democrats will start working with Senate Republicans to pass these bills - many bipartisan - to grow our economy, grow our workforce, and keep Americans safe. That being said the House has more to do.

This August, in addition to constituent meetings and attending events like the Illinois State Fair and Farm Progress Show, I will be visiting businesses and their employees to talk about reforming our broken tax code. The last time tax reform happened Top Gun was the top grossing movie and the Bears won the Super Bowl. Our plan will let workers keep more of what you earn and level the playing field so our businesses can compete. Learn more here.

Below is a quick recap of some of things my office and the House has done so far in the 115th Congress.

Hope to see you around the 13th District!

Sincerely,
Rodney Davis
￼

We've had 423 votes - many of them bipartisan - in the House since January. Nearly 250, of the bills passed by the House are continue to wait for Senate consideration.

Food for Thought


 
Crawford's Survey

Do you believe that the opioid crisis in the U.S. is a national health crisis?


A. Yes, I believe it is.



B. No, I do not believe it is. 


 
To your best knowledge, what kind of legislation did you hear the House passed in the last six months?


A. The House only passed legislation about health care.



B. The House passed legislation about health care and immigration, but not any legislation to help veterans and their families.



C. The House has passed legislation to increase job and economic security, patient-centered health care, funding to rebuild our military, reform to help veterans and their families, and government regulatory reform.


 
Do you think that crop insurance should be a top priority in the next farm bill?


A. Yes, farmers deserve a safety net.



B. No, crop insurance is not a safety net, rather it is an investment.


 
Do you think that the renegotiation of NAFTA is critical for farmers? 


A. Yes, I think that international trade of agriculture crops is an essential part of the industry and will help farmers.



B. No, I think the renegotiation of NAFTA is not critical for farmers. International trade with other countries will not make a difference for U.S. farmers.


 
When Congress reconvenes in September, do you think their first priority should be to repeal ObamaCare?


A. Yes, I agree with the House version of the AHCA and think health care should be a top priority.



B. Congress should move on and leave ObamaCare alone.



C. Yes, the House and Senate need to work together to create a bill they can all agree on.

I haven't missed a year of the Iowa State Fair since 1974, and one of the first things I do is go see the famous butter cow. On Thursday, I went through the livestock barns, the 4-H building and the William C. Knapp Varied Industries building and spoke with Cynthia Fodor and Steve Karlin with KCCI. Friday, I talked to Iowans at the Iowa Farm Bureau park and with Sabrina Ahmed of WOI and stopped by the John Stoddard Cancer Center booth. 
￼
I’m asking the Trump Administration to add the topic of individuals with disabilities to discussions on promoting apprenticeships. Enhanced support for apprenticeships can put more Americans on a path toward upward mobility. 
The Senate approved a bipartisan bill I introduced to crack down on waste, fraud and abuse in federal agency travel and purchase card spending. This bill builds on my successfully enacted Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 by adding an additional layer of government-wide oversight to prevent misuse and identify potential cost savings.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services fixed an extension of a Medicare program critical to small, often rural hospitals. The agency was imposing delays on the extension that Congress didn’t intend, and I led an effort to get the delays corrected. The fix is great news for the hospitals in Carroll, Grinnell, Newton and Spirit Lake that depend on this critical program to keep their doors open for their patients.  
A new study found that according to sunshine data, about one in 12 doctors received a payment involving an opioid during the 29-month study, totaling $46.2 million. This is exactly the kind of research I hoped to see in co-authoring the sunshine provisions. Disclosure allows for the analysis of trends, like the fact that opioid makers were reaching a lot of doctors as the opioid crisis was getting worse. This is information the public should know.

Dear Friend,    As I began college, I attended a large assembly of new students. I remember the speaker at the time saying, “look to your right, and look to your left. Each of those persons will not be here in four years.” In other words, two of the three people who were starting would not finish. I assume at the time it was supposed to be a motivating factor, and, for me, it was. But, those words also point to a problem about what college is, whether it has been oversold, and what other good options exist outside the college experience. It’s time to ask the question: Is College Worth It?  Let’s look at both sides of the question. As studies document, in the long term, college education creates the conditions for higher levels of attainment (measured by earnings). According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, holders of four-year bachelor degrees earn over $1 million more in their lifetimes than do high school graduates. Moreover, college, when fully engaged, provides a great gift: the opportunity to gain knowledge about higher things and probe deeper meanings—including the wisdom of the ages, the nobility of the arts, and the reservoir of scientific understanding—in order to better oneself and the world. All of this is good. Clearly, college has the potential to enhance the human experience and effectively position a person for advancement.    Now, let’s look at another answer to the question. College is not the be-all and end-all of human existence, as some would have you believe. In fact, it is now a place where many students become frustrated, waste time, waste money, and confront an ideological environment that can be hostile. A place of enormous promise, but, increasingly, a place where its exorbitant and soaring cost might not justify the potential earning benefits of particular degrees. A place where isolation and loneliness can be real. Where pressures mount amid human unraveling.  On the price equation, underwriting the cost of education through student loans has placed enormous debts on recent graduates, some of whom have limited means to pay those debts back. At $1.3 trillion, student loan debt is now the second highest category of consumer debt, surpassing auto loan and credit card debt. The average student from the class of 2016 owes around $37,000 in loans. Over two million borrowers have student loan debt above $100,000. The student loan default rate sits at 11.2 percent. This is why I often caution young students to not exceed a standard car loan in terms of indebtedness.   Today, positive changes in vocational education, along with innovative partnerships with paid apprentice programs, are creating extraordinary options for young people. With a trade focus beginning in high school (combined with community college), in-demand trades like welding, machine operation, and electromechanical tech can earn a person $30,000-$50,000 right out of school. A dedicated person can quickly evolve to be a master craftsman, making $60,000-$80,000 a year. The top craftsmen make over $100,000 a year. All right here in Nebraska.   In its ideal form, education, not just college, should be about wonder. That means, at its core, advanced education should engender an authentic commitment to the whole person, and a daily renewal and alignment of the will, the mind, and the imagination to that which humbly serves all of humanity.
So, to answer the question—""Is College Worth It?” It depends. For some, the revived and noble idea of becoming an American craftsman, or working in other service fields, is a great pathway that comes with the reward of knowing how to make things. For others, a four-year college is an appropriate investment in intellectual and self formation. Over time, I obtained three degrees. As my family often teased me, “Jeffrey would study for a blood test.”    Sincerely, ￼  Congressman Jeff Fortenberry

8/11/17 19:21,A Message from Congressman Doggett,"￼



August 11, 2017    
 
10849 E. Walking Stick Way
San Antonio, Texas 78205
 
Dear Lindsey:
 
After our very successful Town Hall in Austin last month, I am participating in another tomorrow, August 12 at 3 p.m. at Ella Austin Community Center, 1023 N. Pine St. in San Antonio. You are certainly welcome to participate, but if you are unable to brave I-35, I wanted you to know that you can tune into my Facebook Live video of the event here: www.Facebook.com/LloydDoggett 
 
This will be my sixth town hall. I will once again be responding to questions and discussing what has and has not been happening in Washington. While health care will likely be a focus of our Saturday meeting, taxes are another key concern. The Koch Brothers have launched a multi-million dollar campaign to sell a tax package that will save billions for them and their fellow billionaires and leave a few crumbs for most other taxpayers. And with the uncertainties surrounding Trump’s daily tweets and diatribes, especially those that threaten nuclear warfare, we will no doubt have plenty to discuss.
 
As you are aware, I have strongly opposed efforts to take away health insurance access. It is important to assure protection for people with pre-existing conditions; oppose insurers bringing back lifetime and annual caps on care; maintain essential health benefits, and protect Medicaid and Medicare. Through administrative action, Trump is clearly trying to sabotage what he has been unable to repeal. Indeed, we will be paying a Trump surcharge adding to the cost of our insurance premiums because of the market instability he has promoted. 
 
With the determined voices of so many and by one vote in the Senate, efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act have been at least temporarily stopped. But health care access continues to hang by a thread for so many. With both health care and our democracy now having survived more than 200 days of the Trump Administration, it is essential that we remain involved. 
 
Listening to you helps me make your priorities my priorities. I hope to see you Saturday.
 

 

                                                                     Sincerely,
                                                                     Lloyd Doggett

Dear  , 
With the greatest concentration of veterans in the state, Connecticut’s Second Congressional District is uniquely attuned to the needs of some of our nation’s most dedicated citizens. That is why I take great care to ensure that I am adequately representing and strongly advocating for our nation’s veterans in Congress. I wanted to take a moment to share with you some important events and actions that Congress and my office have taken to support our region’s veterans.
￼
Rep. Courtney takes questions at a veterans' town hall event in New London on Friday
This morning I hosted a veterans’ town hall meeting in New London on policies regarding the VA health system along with Gerald Culliton, the Director of the Department of Veterans Affairs in West Haven. Director Culliton was on hand to answer questions about receiving healthcare through the VA, and the progress that has been made to improve the VA health system nationwide. My Norwich veterans’ representative, retired Master Chief Manny Meneses, was also at the meeting to discuss the help my office can offer to veterans who need assistance working with the VA or other federal agencies.
￼

A major development for current service members took place last month when members from both sides of the aisle came together to pass a historic update to the post 9/11 G.I. bill that will benefit generations of service members in the years ahead. The House passed the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, a significant improvement to the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill that will extend educational benefits to all qualified veterans and service members who were in active duty as of January 1, 2013. Qualified veterans will now have their educational benefits available to them for the rest of their life. It also ensures these educational benefits are granted to future veterans, their surviving spouses and dependents, as well as recipients of the Purple Heart.
In 2010, I was a cosponsor of the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill - the most important update to the benefit since the end of World War II - that boosted the amount of tuition assistance and for the first time allowed the benefit to be transferred to service members’ spouses and dependents. Now, this revision will ensure that G.I. Bill benefits will be available throughout the lifetime of all veterans who enlisted after 2013. This bill also closed an egregious loophole: it ensures fairness for Connecticut National Guard members who have deployed overseas that were previously not eligible for G.I. Bill benefits.

Rep. Courtney and Rep. Valdao (D-CA) led a letter to Secretary Shulkin asking for updated information on health coverage for Blue Water Navy veterans exposed to Agent Orange
A major ongoing effort I have been fighting for in Congress is getting care for Blue Water Navy veterans of the Vietnam War who were exposed to Agent Orange. I continued that fight recently by joining one of my Republican colleagues, Rep. David Valadao in sending a letter to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs asking him to provide us with information on the Department’s review of Agent Orange exposure coverage for Blue Water Navy vets.
During the war, nearly 20 million gallons of the Agent Orange herbicide were used to clear vegetation as part of “Operation Ranch Hand” from 1961 to 1971. Blue Water Navy ships operated in the waters surrounding Vietnam, and sailors were unknowingly exposed to water that was contaminated with the chemical. Thus, some 90,000 Navy sailors were likely exposed to this toxic chemical used during the war even if they did not set foot on land. But for the past 15 years, the VA has refused to provide coverage for Blue Water vets. Rep. Valadao and I are hoping that the current review being conducted at VA will change that, and we will continue to pursue the VA to get more information until this is done.

Rep. Courtney speaks at a Memorial Day event in Norwich earlier this year
This past Memorial Day, I had the opportunity to participate in events across the district celebrating our veterans. While this is a normal occurrence, what made this year so special is that my office received a letter from General David Petraeus, the former commander of our forces in Iraq during the 2007 surge, celebrating the sacrifice of a particular service member on the 10-year anniversary of his death. In 2007, I was in Iraq for Memorial Day, to meet with General Petraeus and discuss the ongoing operations throughout the country. Little did I know at the time, an Army helicopter pilot from Norwich, 1LT Keith Heidtman, was shot down and killed no more than a hundred miles from me on what would be one of the worst days for U.S. troops that entire year. At the Norwich Veterans Day Parade, I was proud to present the letter to 1LT Heidtman’s family, and commemorate this special moment with them and their community.
￼

In June, the House voted 368-55 to pass the Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act with my strong support. The bill will provide the VA greater authority to remove bad employees, while ensuring that fair processes remain in place to ensure that effective employees and whistleblowers are not wrongfully terminated. I am glad this compromise legislation received such overwhelming bipartisan support. Repaying our veterans for their service should never be a partisan issue. While Connecticut has not experienced the scandals present in many other states, we should not rest idly by while any veteran suffers.

Working with veterans throughout the second district is one of the greatest pleasures of my job. It is always rewarding to help a veteran reobtain benefits they are owed. While in Washington, I will do my best to ensure your voices are heard, and I will continue to advocate for you in the future.
If you are a veteran or know a veteran who needs assistance with the VA or any other federal agency, please contact Manny Meneses in my Norwich district office at 860-886-0139
Have a great weekend,

CALLING ALL INTERNS!
My office is now accepting applications for interns in my Washington, D.C. office, as well as my district offices in Rogers, Fort Smith, and Harrison, for the following session:
Fall 2017 September  December* *Dates are flexible.
A congressional internship is a rewarding experience, and both Washington, D.C. and district office interns will work closely with my staff and constituents while learning the inner workings of the United States Congress and about issues affecting Arkansans. College students and recent graduates interested in political science, government, public policy, business, and social work are encouraged to apply.
Internship requirements and application materials are available on my website. 
For more information, please call my office at (202) 225-4301.

 
WEEK IN REVIEW
 
￼
To start off this week's From the Front... I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nations capital, including the Brown family from Rogers, the Klinedinst family from Springdale, the Ross family from Rogers, the Walker family from Fayetteville, the Eckert family from Rogers, the Loudermilk family from Eureka Springs, the Hinson family from Little Rock, and the Burton family from Fort Smith. Safe travels back to the Natural State.
 
As the August district work period continues, I had the opportunity to visit with a number of constituents in Northwest Arkansas.
 
￼
In the Third District, I have offices located in Rogers, Fort Smith, and Harrison. But I understand that many constituents aren't able  or dont have the time  to travel to the nearest office. Thats why I send my staff to you! This week, we had two Mobile Offices in Western Grove and Alma. I would like to thank all of the constituents who came out to talk with my staff. We appreciate hearing from you about the issues you and your family are facing and how we can help make a difference. If you live in the Bella Vista area, mark your calendars for August 24. My staff will be hosting a mobile office at Riordan Hall from 2:00-4:00PM CST.
 
Early this week, I toured the TowMate facility in Rogers. TowMate is the worlds first wireless emergency, transport, recovery, and recreational lighting manufacturer. They started with one product and have expanded their inventory to more than eight different wireless tow lights, most of which can be customized for customer specific needs. Additionally, they provide a range of specialized lighting equipment for recovery sites, trucks, and recreation vehicles.
 
￼
Tuesday, I spoke at the Gentry Career and Technical Education Center Ribbon-Cutting Ceremony with Governor Hutchinson. Later that day, I toured the Fayetteville Fire Training Center, which recently opened on June 8, 2017. The new facility is six stories high and more than seven thousand square feet. It features custom structural features, to mimic day-to-day challenges specific to the northwest Arkansas area. I then had the opportunity to have lunch in Gentry, with Chamber members, Governor Hutchinson, and new small business owners in the area. While in Van Buren, I toured Clinger Holster, a thriving small business. That evening, I traveled to Fort Smith to attend the Darby Military Officers Association Meeting. I spoke about legislation affecting healthcare, immigration reform, the erosion of military/veterans benefits, the Blended Retirement System, and other veterans issues. It was a wonderful event and I appreciate the invitation to speak.
 
I ended my week with travels to Little Rock. There I met with Arkansas State Chamber members. I talked with folks about legislation and issues that are affecting the district  and state, and how I am working to fix them in the House. 
 
￼
Saturday morning, I have the privilege to speak at the Purple Heart Truck Run Presentation. The ceremony will honor all Arkansas Purple Heart Veterans, but one in particular. Each year the Military Order of the Purple Heart National and the Wounded Warrior Family Support organizations give away a specially equipped truck to a deserving Purple Heart disabled veteran. Patriot Marshall Kennedy of Fayetteville has been selected to receive this years truck. Thank you, Marine Sergeant  Marshall Kennedy, for your service to our country and for representing the Third District of Arkansas. 
 
I had a wonderful week traveling throughout the Natural State. I look forward to meeting with many more of you this month!
 
Remember to keep an eye on my Twitter page and my calendar to find out where my staff and I will be throughout the August work period!

POLICY UPDATE: Appropriations Process
As we move closer to the end of the fiscal year (FY) for 2017, it is worth a conversation to revisit exactly how the federal budgeting process does work when it functions as designed. For the United States federal budgeting purposes, the budgetary cycle ends on September 30. At that time this year, we will begin spending what has been allotted for the 2018 cycle, and therefore we are currently in the process of finalizing the FY18 federal spending levels. 
 
Now before we go any further into the timeline of the budget process, it is important to distinguish between the two types of spending that happen at the federal level. In Washington, they have spending known as discretionary, which is at the discretion of the House and then the Senate based on the direction and authority of the Committees on Appropriations. This spending must be appropriated to the relevant agencies and programs each year and thus serves to carry out the original mission of Congress power of the purse. Aside from discretionary spending, we also have what is known as mandatory. This spending is not subject to renewal each year and thus once passed into law continues on an ever-gaining path that is extremely hard to curb. Currently, the largest drivers of our mandatory spending and our debt as a whole are Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the net interest on our debt. These and other mandatory programs have grown so exponentially that they now make up over two thirds of federal spending when only 50 years ago they were at one third. Its alarming, when we put it in that perspective, to see that Congress loses more and more control over the federal budget every fiscal year. 
 
Getting back to how the fiscal year works, now that we have distinguished between the spending that Congress controls annually versus that which it does not, it is important to note that the budget timeline actually begins with the House and Senate Committees on the Budget, rather than with the Executive Branch. Every year, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), at the direction of the President releases its ideal federal budget to the public and to Congress. Despite the efforts that go into this, this budget serves merely as a blueprint for what the Executive Branch would prefer, and not an actual enforceable document. Following receipt of the OMB budget, the House and Senate Committees on the Budget then get to work on drafting their top line numbers for what the Committees on Appropriations will take and allot to each Subcommittee and within those jurisdictions, each agency, program, and so on. While the Budget Resolution that sends these numbers to the Committees on Appropriations does address ideal mandatory spending levels in addition to establishing top line discretionary spending numbers, the mandatory spending ideas are just that, ideas. They hold no force, and therein lies the debacle of runaway federal spending. We must find a way to fix this out of control train. 
 
This year, we have made some great progress in the House Committee on Appropriations of which I have been a Member since I came to Congress. This is despite massive delays in the House being able to pass a Budget Resolution after it finally made its way through the House Committee on the Budget. In Congress, we love to speak of something known as regular order, a process whereby bills will move through the committees of jurisdiction on a proper timeline before making it to the floor for votes and on to the Upper Chamber. In the world of appropriations, this goes even further to mean the passage of all twelve of our annual bills through the Committee and then the floor. We must return to this and I will do everything in my power to advance these bills for the good of the institution, the good of the service members they provide critical funding in support of, and for the good of crucial research such as that at the National Institutes of Health that saves so many lives. 
 
At a time when Congress has come to a crossroads, we can decide to divide ourselves further by putting our feet down to hold out for all of what we want or we can ask ourselves: should perfect be the enemy of good? For the first time since I was elected to this sacred institution, we have control over all three aspects that it takes to govern: the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. We must not squander this. We have our work cut out for us come September, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in Washington to push forward the remaining eight appropriations bills to the House floor and on to the Senate so that they can receive the Presidents signature and receive the force of law. With Republican control, this is the only way we will ever achieve Republican prioritization over the federal budget.

WCTI12.com: Butterfield knocks Trump on handling of N. Korea tensions

WINDSOR, Bertie County - People gathered at Bertie High School in Windsor Tuesday night to receive free health screenings and to communicate their concerns to Rep. G.K. Butterfield as part of his community discussion tour around District 1 in North Carolina. Butterfield provided an update on bills in Washington and took questions about pressing issues. The topic of North Korea came up, and Butterfield, a Democrat, was vocal in his displeasure with how President Trump is handling the delicate conflict. ""We need to deescalate the tension between North Korea and the United States,"" Butterfield said. ""(Trump) provoked North Korea in a very inappropriate way.""
The Wilson Times: CSX rail hub to create 1,500 regional jobs
“Good transportation is essential to economic growth. You can take it to the bank,” said Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-Wilson, sponsor of the “Jobs First: Building for Our Future” forum held Friday. “Transportation is so critically important to economic development,” Butterfield said. The Carolina Connector Hub being built along the CSX rail lines will bring an estimated 1,500 jobs throughout the state and will connect eastern North Carolina to the ports. ”That’s a big deal,” Butterfield said. 

WITN: Rep. Butterfield hosts series to build ENC future

""At a time when the current Administration and Congress are focused on cutting funding for critical programs that eastern North Carolina depends on, our strong rail transportation system and the businesses that support it are more critical than ever,"" said Rep. Butterfield. ""The new CSX terminal in Edgecombe County will connect eastern North Carolina to state ports and will serve as a keystone for jobs throughout the state. This is great news for the Rocky Mount area.""

Congress Takes the Lead on North Korea Sanctions    
￼
United States Navy ships patrol the South Asia Pacific.
As a consequence of repeatedly violating international laws and routinely threatening the United States and allies, Congress recently passed the Russia, Iran, and North Korea Sanctions Act which was recently signed into law. This bipartisan bill establishes tough new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea and gives Congress an opportunity to reject presidential efforts to waive or terminate certain sanctions.   Yet despite an international economic lockdown, North Korea has been undeterred in developing and testing nuclear ballistic weapons technology. After the most recent test, coupled with threats targeting the American territory of Guam, Congressman Murphy, who strongly supported the recent sanctions bill, made the following statement:   “In a moment like this, America must remain strong and not cave in to evil, yet we must also recognize the seriousness of this dangerous and delicate situation with North Korea. With North Korea continuing to advance its nuclear capabilities, it is critically important we de-escalate the rhetoric and continue bringing the full weight of the international community to end the menacing activities.”  “Congress has a solemn responsibility to defend the homeland from all threats, foreign and domestic, and to carefully consider and evaluate all available options in response to security threats,” continued Murphy. “Any military action must gain Congressional approval and it is fully within the constitutional powers to advance sanctions when confronting global aggressors.”   To share your thoughts on North Korean nuclear testing and threats to America, click here.
Obamacare's Flawed Navigator Programs
￼
Murphy's Oversight panel exposed the many problems plaguing 
the Obamacare rollout, including the flawed Navigator program.
In 2013, Murphy's Oversight panel exposed the many problems plaguing the Obamacare rollout, including the flawed Navigator program. As outlined in numerous Committee reports, this discretionary grant program lacked standards on door-to-door visits, cold calls and background checks for the tens of thousands of so-called ‘Navigators,’ who were paid to enroll people onto the Obamacare exchange. Beyond the data showing Navigators helped fewer than two people per day, we know now that the program was plagued with corruption, fraud and mishaps.
This week in the Wall Street Journal, Congressman Murphy weighed in on the possible renewed funding of the flawed Obamacare Navigator program.
“It never should been unleashed on the public,” said Congressman Murphy, adding that he does not support continuing to steer millions of taxpayer dollars towards the defective Navigator program.
During the Obamacare rollout, $394 million was used to pay outside organizations to help individuals enroll onto the ACA exchange, however a study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation proved the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of both the Navigator program and the underlying law.  According to the survey, almost 40% of Navigators heard from people worried they had chosen the wrong plan, 35% fielded complaints of sky high deductibles, and an alarming 16% spoke with individuals whose insurance was eliminated altogether.  Additionally, explaining ACA requirements to consumers was most difficult for one in four Assister Programs and 30% of the programs had no prior experience helping consumers.  The rollout was thrown into further chaos due to con artists’ efforts to profit off the confusion surrounding the law and the Navigator program. Most of the scams were aimed at uninsured business owners and individuals faced with tax penalties if they did not purchase minimum level health insurance. Consumers in 20 states were contacted over the phone and/or the internet by fraudulent ‘Navigators’ offering assistance with signing up for Obamacare.    Murphy's Oversight  panel revealed concerns about the readiness of the Navigator program, which were largely ignored by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The program grants are set expire in September 2018. Continued funding depends on the performance of the Navigators.
“In addition to the major issues with the Navigator program, it defies logic to pay people, using taxpayer dollars, to board the sinking ship that is Obamacare,” concluded Murphy.

President Announced Opioid Crisis a National Emergency: Here's what you need to know
￼
91 Americans die each day from drug overdose.
On August 10, 2017, the President instructed his Administration to “use all appropriate emergency and other authorities to respond to the crisis caused by the opioid epidemic.”
Congressman Murphy, a practicing psychologist, weighed in.  “Announcing our nation's drug and addiction crisis as a national emergency confirms what we already know: our nation is in the midst of a public health crisis,” said Dr. Murphy, who has been sounding the alarm on our nation's mental health and addiction crisis for years. 
Murphy's landmark crisis mental health reform bill, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, provided the first major reforms to American's broken mental health system in a half century. After a protracted four year efforts, it was signed into law last December.  “What is most frustrating is that while this crisis has been mounting to epidemic proportions nationwide, we haven’t done what is needed to build up the addiction treatment workforce, expand access to inpatient care and deliver immediate, evidence-based treatment to those in addiction crisis.”
Dr. Murphy lauded the fact that with an emergency declaration, HHS Secretary Dr. Tom Price would be able to immediately grant Medicaid waivers for all 50 states to lift the cumbersome and irrational “IMD” prohibition on the number of inpatient treatment beds.  Murphy sought to lift the Institutes for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion within the Medicaid program in his major mental health reform bill in 2015. However, the language was stripped out of the final version after the CBO inflated the cost of providing inpatient psychiatric care to those in crisis and members of Congress balked at the cost of reforming the antiquated IMD rules which limit care in inpatient treatment centers to an inadequate 16 beds.  “How much is the cost of a life?” asked Murphy. “With 91 Americans dying by overdose each day, by the end of this year, there will be more drug overdose deaths than there are names on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall.”  “We must understand that the immediate need to combat this crisis is to deliver evidence-based care for those with substance use disorders. It doesn’t matter whether it’s $4 billion, $45 billion or $45 trillion that’s going to states – without enough treatment beds or the workforce to deliver care, we won’t make a dent in the armor. It’s as irrational as asking for more money to fight fires when there are no fire departments, no firemen. Disturbingly, since half the counties in America have no psychologists, no psychiatrists, no clinical social workers and no licensed drug counselors, 99% of the 27 million Americans who suffer from addiction do not receive evidence-based treatment.”  Based on expert testimony from previous investigative hearings, Dr. Murphy developed a working list of policy recommendations on the best options for treatment and prevention, including: medical-assisted treatment in concert with behavioral treatment and therapy, expanding access to inpatient care by fixing the IMD exclusion rules, reducing the over-prescribing of opioids, strengthening prescription drug monitoring programs, expanding successful drug court models and the importance of federal, state and local laws focused on overdose prevention.

OPPS Act Update
This week, Congressman Murphy's Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety (OPPS) Act (H.R. 3545) continued to grab local and national headlines. The bill would equip doctors with vital information to prevent overdose tragedies and protect patients by reforming 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 2, known simply as “Part 2.” 
Fixing Part 2 was among the major reforms offered in Murphy's Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, which was signed into law in December. However, after major push back, and with the consequence of non-passage in the House, the language was forced to be dropped from the bill, though Murphy vowed that this lethal, outdated policy would be reformed.
“Since we first raised a red flag on fixing this outdated policy two years ago, over 150,000 individuals have died from drug overdose. Enough is enough. By ensuring that a patient's full medical history, including addiction treatment, is included in their medical record we will save lives. Most importantly, this medical information will remain fully protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) standards of privacy,” said Murphy.
This week's headlines include:
	•	U.S. Senate Passes Jessie’s Law to Help Prevent Drug Overdoes, HIPAA Journal (8/9/2017) 
	•	U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy calls to revise addiction treatment policy, Beaver County Times (8/8/2017) 
	•	Patient Privacy Included in Recent Opioid Records Senate Bill, HealthIT Security (8/8/2017)

ICYMI: Murphy's Visit to ""Step Up"" Supportive Housing Featured in LA Times

Q&A Mental illness and homelessness are connected. But not how you might think  By Gale Holland August 7, 2017

Even as Los Angeles starts a $1.2-billion homeless housing construction program, residents from Temple City to Venice are fighting to keep homeless projects out of their neighborhoods.  But since 1995, chronically homeless mentally ill people — a widely shunned subgroup — have been living in Santa Monica’s Step Up on Second apartments, a block from the tourist-friendly Third Street Promenade and close enough to the beach to feel the salt air.  “Look around. It’s here,” Rep. Timothy F. Murphy (R-Pa.) said during a recent visit, describing why he sees Step Up’s residential programs as a national model.  Murphy, author of a major 2016 mental health reform bill, was in Santa Monica to tour three of Step Up’s permanent supportive housing buildings, which offer apartments and counseling, case management and substance abuse treatment to 267 formerly homeless people with mental health issues.  During the visit, The Times interviewed Step Up Executive Director Tod Lipka, staff members and residents. Dennis Culhane, University of Pennsylvania professor and homelessness researcher, and Andrew Sperling, legislative advocacy director for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, were interviewed later.  Below are their edited responses to common questions about mental illness and homelessness:  Are most homeless people mentally ill?   A relatively small percentage of all homeless people nationwide — 13% to 15% — are mentally ill, but their symptoms — paranoia and delusions — draw attention and mislead others into thinking their numbers are greater, Culhane said.  However, Los Angeles’ homeless population skews heavily to single adults who have lived in the streets a year or longer — a subgroup with a high incidence of mental health issues. Local authorities estimate that 30% of the county’s homeless people have serious mental illness.  Does chronic homelessness cause mental illness, or is it the other way around?   Lipka said employees at his agency don’t see people developing serious mental illness by virtue of their homelessness. But “I do believe long-term isolation can lead to mental illness,” said Steve Elam, Step Up lead life skills coordinator.  Culhane said severely mentally ill people sometimes get treatment and aid that prevents them from becoming homeless.  How many homeless people are physically or mentally disabled?   Culhane said half the country’s homeless people have a physical or mental disability, or both. But they don’t necessarily qualify for federal disability payments, which in any case are too low — about $800 a month — to cover rent, utilities and other needs, even with food stamps tacked on, he added. Welfare reform in 1996 made it difficult for people whose impairment stems largely from substance abuse disorders to receive federal disability aid, Culhane said.  “Instead of looking at individuals and their biographies and conditions, the question is why is the disability system failing?” Culhane said.  Is mental illness the result of genetics and brain chemistry alone, or does trauma play a role?   “We’re still figuring that one out,” Sperling said. A strong case has been made for a genetic role in schizophrenia, but physiological and biological brain development, environmental stressors and childhood trauma are also thought to influence mental health.  “I grew up in Jordan Downs and Watts, I’ve seen a lot and I’ve been through two riots,” said Step Up resident Marvin Duckworth, 57. “My sense of hope and faith is not that strong.”  How many mentally ill homeless people have issues with alcohol and drug abuse, and does drug addiction cause mental illness?   About half of the homeless people with severe mental illness also have problems with alcohol or drugs, Culhane said. Lipka put the percentage of his agency’s clients even higher — 60% to 70% — but he and the other experts said drug use does not cause severe mental illness. Rather, homeless people with untreated mental illness self-medicate to relieve symptoms, Lipka said.
 “I grew up in Jordan Downs and Watts, I’ve seen a lot and I’ve been through two riots. My sense of hope and faith is not that strong.”  — Marvin Duckworth
What is the role of prescribed medication in treating mentally ill homeless people? Doesn’t it turn them all into zombies?   Medication relieves symptoms, but it “doesn’t create purpose or positive meaning in your life, even if you have stabilized with housing,” Lipka said.  Paula Boutte, Step Up’s Santa Monica program manager, said side effects affect people differently and medications and dosages often have to be adjusted over time. “If you experience drowsiness and can’t get up, it’s not quality of life,” Boutte said.  What about forced medication or other treatment for the most severely mentally ill homeless people?   For the vast majority of homeless people, forcing them to do anything is a mistake, Lipka said.  Sperling said Laura’s Law — which authorizes court-ordered mental health treatment for those with serious illness and a recent history of repeated violence, criminal activity or hospitalizations — addresses some cases.   But for the 2% to 3% of homeless people so symptomatic that “nothing else works, we may need more options,” Lipka said.

Why do people who grow up in foster care or state custody end up homeless? 

Children separated from their parents at an early age often suffer anxiety and depression, Sperling said. Lipka said growing up without stable relationships makes it difficult to learn life skills. After years of living in group homes, “the only thing I knew how to do was to shave and take a shower,” said Step Up resident Theo Robin, 45.

Most young adults need help from family to go out on their own, and homeless youths are no exception. California’s recent law extending the cutoff for aid to foster children from age 18 to 21 has reduced the group’s homeless rates, Culhane said.

Do some homeless people prefer to live that way? 

Lipka said the vast majority of the clients his agency works with — 97% — want housing “if the system we had to get into housing wasn’t so complicated.” Many have been disappointed by past promises that fell through.

“Housing becomes something not in homeless people’s realm of possibility,” Lipka said. “The system has failed them, and then we blame it on them.”

“The system has failed them, and then we blame it on them.”  — Tod Lipka, Step Up On Second
Can mentally ill homeless people move on to jobs and live independently or will they need to be subsidized forever?   For the chronically homeless in their 50s and 60s, stabilization in subsidized housing is the most realistic outcome, Lipka said. “We could see less intensive, less costly permanent supportive housing, but that’s difficult,” he said. “It’s either you’re in it or you’re not.”  Homeless young adults with mental health issues do move on to school, jobs, and in some cases, independent living.  “We have a building for transitional-age youth leaving foster care or state custody; they have shorter tenancy, reunite with family, take computer classes and move out and live on their own,” Lipka said.  Should the public pay for mentally ill homeless people to live near the beach when most people can’t afford to?   Lipka said that Santa Monica, which subsidizes Step Up, recognized that its homeless people are residents and that a vibrant city needs diversity.  Housing and support services cost less than we are spending now on police, courts, jails and hospitals to manage homelessness, Lipka said. “Not to mention the nuisance cost of homelessness to a community,” he said.

8/11/17 17:48,August Update from Congressman Newhouse,"News from Congressman Dan Newhouse
           
￼

August has been off to a busy start! I have enjoyed my time traveling around the 4th District, speaking with constituents, and celebrating accomplishments in Central Washington. 
￼
I traveled to Moses Lake to participate in the ribbon cutting for Grant Transit Authority’s new Multimodal Transit Center. The facility, which will serve as a hub for Grant Transit Authority and expand bus lines, includes many amenities and will allow for more bus routes in the region. Modern transportation networks are vital for our communities’ economic success, and I am pleased that the new Multimodal Transit Center will provide more opportunities for my constituents. 
￼
The Prosser Chamber of Commerce invited me to speak at their August Chamber Luncheon. Small businesses are the backbone of our country’s economy, and it is always great to hear about the efforts being made in local communities. I was able to speak to local business leaders about the progress Congress is making to revitalize Main Street by reforming our nation's tax code, creating more American jobs, relieving the burdens on taxpayers, and spurring economic growth. 
Celebrating Agriculture
￼
It was a great honor to be one of the six Yakima Valley recipients of The Order of the Hop at the International Hop Growers Congress in Yakima. The Order of the Hop is a recognition of hop growers, scientists, and others around the world that have made great contributions to the international hop community and worked towards “the development and prosperity of the ‘noble’ plant.” The Order of the Hop is the highest honor in the hop in community, and I am proud to represent the Yakima Valley, where these important contributions are being made. Congratulations to my fellow recipients.
￼
I visited Ritzville to discuss important water and agricultural issues in Central Washington. I got the chance to gather input on the upcoming Farm Bill with local ag leaders in Adams County, and the majority of the conversation was focused on water projects and problems that face communities in the 4th District. Water is the lifeblood of our agricultural industry, but it is also essential to economic development in rural areas. I heard about the progress of some of the existing projects in Adams County, and I look forward to working with constituents to solve these problems. A special thanks to Representatives Joe Schmick and Mary Dye for coming to share your perspective as Washington State representatives.
￼
While in Ritzville, I was able to stop by and see my friend, Washington State Senator Mark Schoesler, at his wheat farm. Senator Schoesler updated me on the progress of the Washington State Legislature, and we discussed different ways to improve conditions for wheat farmers. 
20 Years of Innovation

I was honored to be able to speak at the 20th Anniversary of the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). EMSL is part of what makes PNNL a powerhouse research institution, and they use research from all around the world to make solve important scientific problems, such as energy storage solutions for the Hanford site. I am pleased that the recent Energy and Water Appropriations bill that passed through the House of Representatives restores funding to the Office of Science’s Biological and Environmental Research program, which funds EMSL and other earth systems science at PNNL. I am proud that this institution will continue to advance scientific achievement in Central Washington and across the nation.
Upcoming Events
Tuesday, August 22: Senior Symposium in Yakima  I will be hosting a Senior Symposium in Yakima, which will consist of three panels of experts to help seniors and their families navigate available systems and benefits, as well as answer questions.

In this week’s edition of the newsletter I also want to point your attention to some of the work we have done in Congress this year to support our veterans. More information on that below.

115th Congress Veterans Bills

In the 115th Congress I have supported and the House has passed several pieces of legislation to directly benefit our veterans and make sure they get the care and services they deserve. Here are some examples:
H.R. 2288, The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act   The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act addresses the VA’s broken appeals process – where there are close to 500,000 appeals pending – to deliver care to veterans who have been waiting far too long, by streamlining the process and allowing veterans to maintain the original claim date. Specifically, the bill: 
	•	Reforms the VA appeals process by giving veterans more options. Specifically, veterans could choose between three options: to waive a hearing and the ability to submit additional evidence, submit additional evidence and have a hearing, or transfer jurisdiction to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals.
	•	The bill also authorizes the Board to maintain at least two dockets—one specifically for an expedited review for veterans who waive the hearing and chance to submit new evidence.
	•	Allows veterans to maintain the original effective date of their claim, as long as the veteran submits new and relevant evidence at least once a year.
	•	Allows certain veterans who have an appeal pending at the VA prior to the bill’s effective date, to opt-in to the new system.
	•	Requires the VA to provide a comprehensive plan for processing of legacy appeals and implementing the reform proposal to Congress and GAO within 90 days of enactment.
	•	Requires the Secretary to certify that the VA has sufficient resources to carry out the new appeals system and timely address to both new and legacy appeals.
	•	Gives the VA the authority to either phase-in the new system or conduct a pilot program of the new system prior to full implementation.
	•	Requires the VA to submit regular reports to Congress.
For full text of the legislation, click here.
H.R. 3218, Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act  The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act makes much-needed improvements to the post-9/11 GI Bill, including an important expansion of benefits for our veterans pursuing degrees in the STEM field. Upstate New Yorkers understand well the need for more people with this kind of training, and there is no one better to fill this demand than the men and women who have served in our military. Specifically, the bill:
	•	Removes time restriction to use the GI bill for future eligible recipients and those who were discharged on or after January 1, 2013.
	•	Provides an increase in GI Bill funding for Reservists, Guardsmen, dependents, and surviving spouses and dependents.
	•	Provides 100% GI Bill eligibility to Post-9/11 Purple Heart recipients.
	•	Provides GI Bill eligibility to Reservists and Guardsmen who are currently being put on active duty and convalescent medical leave orders that do not currently accrue GI Bill eligibility.
	•	Provides an extra academic years’ worth of Post-9/11benefits for over 3,300 veterans (per year) to help them finish a STEM degree.
	•	Create a pilot program that would pay for veterans to take certain high technology courses (coding boot camps, IT certifications, etc.) and provide living stipends.
	•	Make it easier and cheaper for veterans to use their GI Bill to take national test or licensing and credentialing tests.
	•	Restore eligibility for service members whose school closes in the middle of a semester (e.g., ITT tech and Corinthian).
	•	Authorize funding for IT improvements to ensure that GI Bill claims are processed quickly and accurately.
For full text of the legislation, click here.
H.R. 282, The Military Residency Choice Act  The Military Residency Choice Act is commonsense legislation that enables spouses of active military men and women to use the address of their military spouse – something that is important for reasons of voting and taxation, and will ease the burden of frequent relocation that military families must deal with. Specifically, the bill: 
	•	Under current law, active duty service members are allowed to maintain one state of legal residence for tax and voting purposes, even when service members receive military orders requiring them to relocate. Under this law, spouses are only granted the same benefit if the service member and spouse have established the same tax residence at the time of their marriage.
	•	H.R. 282 amends the Service members Civil Relief Act to permit the spouse of a service member to elect to use the same residence as the service member for purposes of taxation and voting, regardless of the date on which the marriage of the spouse and the service member occurred.
For full text of the legislation, click here.  H.R. 1690, The Department of Veterans Affairs Bonus Transparency Act   The Department of Veterans Affairs Bonus Transparency Act turns a spotlight on senior officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs to identify those who may have acted nefariously in terms of bonus pay. Specifically, the bill:
	•	Department of Veterans Affairs, $177 million in bonuses were doled out in 2015, and $3.3 million went to 300 senior executives at the agency.
	•	Aimed at increasing oversight and maximizing transparency, H.R. 1690 would require that the VA submit a report to Congress at the end of each fiscal year listing bonuses awarded to senior-level staff, including: VA Regional Office (VARO) directors, VA hospital directors, and Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN). 
For full text of the legislation, click here.

H.R. 512, The Working to Integrate Networks Guaranteeing Member Access Now (WINGMAN) Act

The WINGMAN Act will greatly help streamline the claims process between our constituents and the VA. When our country needed these brave men and women, they answered the call and did not look back. We must support them. Specifically, the bill:
	•	Creates a more streamlined process for congressional staff to access files - currently, certified congressional staff must work with a VA representative to gain access to the status of a pending claim, medical records, compensation and pension records, rating decisions, statement of the case, supplementary state of the case, notice of disagreement and Form-9 files.
	•	Remove the middle man and allows congressional staff to access files in a more efficient and expedient manner so that they can provide a higher level of constituent service.

Washington, DC - Congresswoman Barbara Comstock (R-VA), a member of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force in the House, hosted two roundtables this week bringing local, state, and federal stakeholders together to discuss the current state of the heroin and opioid epidemic in Loudoun County and the Shenandoah Valley. The round tables featured Lawrence “Chip” Muir, Acting Chief of Staff and General Counsel for the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP).
Participants at the Loudoun Round Table included:
Loudoun County Sheriff Mike Chapman; Karl Colder, Special Agent In Charge, DEA; Leesburg Police Chief Gregory Brown; Captain Greg Kincaid, Virginia State Police; Phillip Erickson, Loudoun County Mental Health; Joseph Razzano, Loudoun County Mental Health, Substance Abuse and Development Services; Dr. Sameer Mehta, INOVA Mental Health; Nick Yacoub, Leader within the Recovery Community; and Ginny Lovett, Executive Director for the Chris Atwood Foundation. 
Participants at the Winchester Round Table included:
Lauren Cummings, Executive Director of the Northern Shenandoah Valley Substance Abuse Coalition; Steve Cluss, President Valley Health Board of Directors; Nick Restrepo, Vice President of Medical Affairs for Winchester Medical Center; Judge Beth Kellas, Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court; Tim Coyne, Public Defender; Don Butler, Winchester Rotary; Joan Ohl, Senior Director for Casey Family Programs; Lieutenant Amanda Behan, Winchester Police; Supervisor Special Agent Si Schiavone, Virginia State Police; Special Agent Tim Hickey, DEA; Mike Elwell, CEO for Northwestern Community Services Board; Nickie Wheeler, Chief Clinical Program Manager, Northwestern Community Services Board; Brad Hill, Grace Downtown Winchester; Megan Gordon, Program Director for Page Alliance for Community Action; Captain Greg Kincaid, Virginia State Police; Tim Czaja, Director for Berkley Day Reporting Center; Delegate Chris Collins; Delegate Randy Minchew; Delegate David LaRock; representatives from the Winchester Sheriff’s Office and the Frederick County Sheriff’s office.
“Over 1,400 Virginians died from drug overdoses last year again outpacing the number of Virginians killed in auto accidents,” said Congresswoman Barbara Comstock.  “We know stronger and deadlier drugs are hitting our streets with fentanyl and carfentanyl cut into heroin as well as into marijuana. Last year we passed landmark legislation to address this and we continue to identify needs in our communities. Today's  roundtables were intended to see how our resources are being targeted and coordinated to educate, prevent, treat, and best address this epidemic. We discussed with ONDCP the education and prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts in the community and the importance of joining together in this fight and the best practices in addressing the multifaceted challenges with substance abuse disorder and addiction.  Earlier this year I led a bipartisan letter to the Administration urging them to maintain strong ONDCP funding because of the vital resources they provide to many communities across the nation. Also, the FY17 spending bill provided robust funding for the HIDTA Program that includes Prince William, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Frederick Counties.”
“Today demonstrated, and really reinforced, the importance of strong leadership in every role.” said Lawrence “Chip” Muir, Acting Chief of Staff and General Counsel of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. You saw strong leadership on opioids with President Trump's work today, which is focusing national attention and bringing more resources to bear on the epidemic. You saw it with Congresswoman Comstock pulling together two outstanding panels, listening and asking insightful questions, trying to find the gaps that need to be filled and where resources should go. And you saw it with the law enforcement, community leaders, medical leaders, faith leaders, and those in the recovery community all studying the issue and actively pursuing solutions to the public health issues at their doors. When you see everyone using their positions to lead with their strengths, you begin to believe the tide of this battle will soon turn in our favor. Strong leadership matters, and it was on full display today.”
“Loudoun County has seen a 14% decrease in heroin related fatalities in comparison to this same time last year,” said Loudoun County Sheriff Mike Chapman.  “I believe this is a reflection of our comprehensive, integrated and proactive approach that incorporates enforcement, education and prevention. After engaging in our panel discussion today with our federal, state and community partners, it became clear that our efforts must continue to further reduce this scourge impacting our communities and our nation.  I am proud to be working closely with so many committed stakeholders who genuinely want to bring this debilitating issue to an end.”
“The Northern Shenandoah Valley Substance Abuse Coalition appreciates Congresswoman Comstock facilitating an opioid roundtable discussion and giving us the opportunity to share our story with ONDCP Chief of Staff Chip Muir,” saidLauren Cummings, Executive Director for The Northern Shenandoah Valley Substance Abuse Coalition. “As we continue to develop solutions to better treat individuals struggling with the disease of addiction it is imperative that our elected officials on the state and national levels work collaboratively to address this crisis.  The representation at the table Tuesday further demonstrated this is an issue that requires the collective efforts of law enforcement, the medical community, treatment providers, elected officials, and the recovery community to make an impact and save lives.""
“We need to demonstrate that recovery from substance use disorder is not only possible, but that we can have fun in recovery,” said Nick Yacoub, Recovery Coaches Inc.

Good afternoon from Arizona’s Fifth Congressional District – 
FRIDAYS ARE FOR FREEDOM
August 11, 2017 – Ending the War on Dust
Overturning OSHA’s Burdensome Silica Restrictions
￼
What does this regulation do?
In 2016, the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reduced the amount of dust (specifically, crystalline silica) that employees can be exposed to during their 8 hour shift in particular industries.  Silica can be found in basic construction materials, such as concrete, brick, and stone. 
Why is this a problem?
Many employers have found compliance with this rule to be both economically infeasible and technologically unrealistic.  While OSHA’s estimate for implementation is $511 million annually, the industry estimate is closer to $5 billion. Federal bureaucrats who are not accountable to a constituency are once again forcing industries to follow their version of best practices completely outside the purview of Congress.
How can we solve this problem?
President Trump has taken action to repeal or delay many Obama-era regulations that have a negative effect on our economy.  He and Secretary of Labor Anthony Acosta should consider permanently delaying this rule until the technology is widely available at an affordable price. 
Although this rule can be repealed administratively, Congress also has tools at its disposal.  When the House of Representatives considers a bill to fund the Department of Labor, I will offer an amendment to prohibit federal funding from being used to implement and enforce this rule.  
Lastly, Congress should pass H.R.26, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, of which I am a cosponsor.  This bill would increase accountability and transparency in the federal regulatory process by requiring Congress to approve all new major regulations. This bill passed the House of Representatives and currently awaits consideration in the Senate.  I will continue to look for other options in Congress to repeal this burdensome regulation. 
What Are They Saying?
“New regulations deemed necessary should be based on sound scientific principles lest the regulations spur unintended, negative consequences. For example, The National Stone Sand and Gravel Association (NSSGA) and Arizona Rock Products Association (ARPA) support science-based regulations that limit workplace exposures to potentially hazardous substances, including respirable crystalline silica. However, OSHA’s final crystalline silica rule focuses on lowering rather than enforcing the current, protective limit, even though many commercial labs do not provide consistently accurate results when analyzing air samples at OSHA’s new limits.  The Mine Safety and Health Administration is likely to issue a similar standard. These actions, with no benefit to miners, will decrease employment opportunities as operating costs increase.”   - Steve Trussell, Executive Director of Arizona Rock Products Association
“The compliance of this rule will be extremely burdensome on the construction industry for several reasons including investment in new equipment, investment and tracking of training, possible air monitoring but most importantly for the medical surveillance portion of the rule.  The rule requires employers to keep medical records for 30 years, which is not realistic given the lifespan of companies and the transient nature of employees in the construction industry. While we always take our employees’ safety as a priority, this rule does not appear to be warranted given the fact that the CDC has reported a 93% drop in silica related deaths.  Furthermore, this rule is being imposed on the construction industry without OSHA meeting its burden to demonstrate that the rule is technologically and economically feasible.  Our company has already spent countless hours as well as a significant investment in equipment towards being compliant by September 23rd.  Both of these investments will only continue and grow as we move forward which is increasing our project and overhead costs. This rule should be re-opened to allow for more input from the construction industry regarding tasks that generate silica, methods to mitigate the exposure and a more feasible way to comply with the medical portion of the rule.” – Melonie Leslie, G & G Enterprises, Glendale, AZ
“When promulgating regulations, federal bureaucrats frequently under estimate or disregard the cost of implementing the rule.  The size and complexity of this specific rule, coupled with the fact that large pieces have yet to be defined, have made it an implementation nightmare.  The Trump Administration should seek direct input from affected industries and businesses to negotiate a rule that will be feasible to implement while also protecting industry employees.” – Mike Sutter, President of Sutter Masonry, Inc., El Mirage, AZ; Chairman, Masonry Contractors Association of America. 

FIGHTING FOR OUR VETERANS
	•	Earlier in July, I sent a letter to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary David Shulkin to outline three of my primary concerns with the Phoenix and Gilbert VA. This letter followed seven weeks of internal discussions with the VA as my office attempted to work out these serious issues on behalf of my constituents. Though the VA has made a good-faith effort to maintain dialogue with our office and work through these issues, our veterans are still waiting for the efficient and complete care they were promised. The VA’s culture of inefficiency and broken trust has only seen minimal progress, and our veterans continue to pay a terrible and unnecessary price as a result. I will continue to work with the VA to address the three issues, among others, that I outlined in my letter to Secretary Shulkin. However, my patience has run its course as I have seen the prolonged consequences to our veterans from the lack of basic and common sense service. I promised my constituents that I would fight for them in Congress, and I intend to do just that for our veterans until the VA’s culture is fully reformed. See the letter to Secretary Shulkin here. 
	•	If you’re a veteran, please save the date for our upcoming Congressional Veterans Benefits Awareness Fair. 
￼
At this fair, educational presentations will be given by the Veterans Benefits Administration, Veterans Health Administration, and TriWest Healthcare Alliance.

Around Our District
Tennessee Farmers in the Spotlight
Although the Department of Agriculture set aside early-August as National Farmers Market Week, I enjoy stopping by District 7 markets nearly every weekend during harvest, snagging freshly-picked okra, watermelons, green beans, zucchini, sweet corn and blueberries. I buy fruits and vegetables at these stands because they’re ripe, well-priced, and delicious. But I also know those dollars I hand over have a huge community impact. Read my blog about the importance of community farmers markets here.
￼
You Asked, I Answered
During my Rural Swing through Maury, Lawrence, and Lewis counties last Friday, I made many stops in Columbia, Lawrenceburg, and Hohenwald, attending local events and meetings. Each stop was enlightening, engaging, and essential for communicating about District 7’s needs and how I’m working to meet them in Washington.
￼
Starting at 7:00 a.m. in Columbia, I met hundreds of you—including constituents from Giles, Hickman, Perry and Wayne Counties—and took questions at every stop throughout the day. Those questions—more than 50 of them!—are critical reminders that my staff and I need to be focused on what matters to YOU in our district, state and country. Here’s a recap of what we talked about:
	•	Health Care – You asked about Medicaid cuts, protecting rural health-care providers, addressing the opioid crisis, maternal/early childhood grants, and insurance reform.
	•	Farm Bill – Along with a status update, you wanted more focus on cotton and dairy farming.
	•	Rural Broadband – You asked about internet grants, speeds, and activation deadlines.
	•	Funding & Reform – You want control of the $20 trillion debt, and asked about repealing Dodd-Frank, tax reform, increased military funding, and trade bills.
	•	Media Attacks – You’re concerned about both attacks on conservatives and a lack of fair coverage for conservative issues. Will they ever end?
	•	Bipartisanship – You wanted to know whether your Tennessee Congressmen and the full House and Senate could ever work together to get things done. Could we compromise? Could we kick start the committee system?
	•	Investigations – You wondered, will we ever get to the bottom of the Russia investigations, leaks, special counsels? How long can we support Robert Mueller?
	•	And more… - You asked about gun rights, net neutrality, the EPA, education, securing our borders, and middle-TN growth.
I enjoyed the variety and answered your questions with as much detail as possible. Your questions are always welcome—just call our Franklin office and we’ll make every attempt to get an answer to you.
Always Learning
My staff regularly takes advantage of opportunities to learn more about the issues, agencies, and organizations that are important to you. Our Communications Director, Kyle, recently returned from a tour of the Tennessee Valley Authority’s operations, and I asked him to tell you about it:  
During this August recess, I had the opportunity to join other congressional staff for an overview of the Tennessee Valley Authority’s operations in the Chattanooga area. The TVA plays a large role in the lives of so many Seventh District residents, and it is important to Congressman Blackburn, so it was essential to see firsthand why we need to make certain TVA remains productive and able to meet the energy needs of the Tennessee Valley.

#TN7in DC
Even though I was in Tennessee this week, some of you made your way to the nation’s capital and took the time to stop by my DC office. We hope your trip to Washington was enjoyable. Come back anytime—you are always welcome.

Moving On Up
This week, Michael Platt, our former Chief of Staff for the 7th District, was confirmed by the Senate and sworn in as the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs. He is an asset to any office and will no doubt serve Secretary Wilbur Ross with distinction. We are happy for him and wish him well!

Connecting Veterans with Choice
To help veterans learn how the Choice program allows them to go to private providers for their health care needs, we hosted workshops on Rota, Tinian, and Saipan this week. More than 80 veterans and family members attended, as well as over 50 representatives from the hospital, community health centers, and private clinics. I invited David McIntyre, President and CEO of TriWest, the company that administers Choice nationwide for the Department of Veterans Affairs. He brought with him TriWest Pacific Regional Director Karl Kiyokawa. Providers, who are already signed up to work with Choice or want to, got their questions answered by the President of the company. I am also grateful to the VA’s Pacific Islands Health Care System for sending Mr. Francisco “Orlando” Valdez from Honolulu to answer questions from the VA perspective. Choice was created after I and other Members representing rural and remote areas of our county, spoke up for veterans there, who could not get access to services. Just before leaving Washington on July 28, the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, of which I am a member, our Senate counterparts, and the White House hammered out a deal to provide $3.9 billion to keep the Choice program running, so veterans far from VA facilities still get the care they need and earned.



We are protected 
We all have to be concerned by North Korea’s threat to lay a ring of fire around Guam. The country now has the missile technology to reach even farther, to the mainland U.S., and the ability to miniaturize nuclear warheads. As your Member of Congress, I am briefed regularly by the military and I want to assure everyone that our nation has the means and commitment to defend American soil, including the Northern Marianas. U.S. Pacific Command contacted me this week in light of the threats from North Korea to renew this commitment. While it seems unlikely that North Korea would follow through on its threats, the U.S. Department of Defense is taking all necessary precautions and is confident in their ability to defend our islands against any danger. I will continue to monitor the situation and be sure that the U.S. military protects us against any aggressive action. Of course, we should all be concerned about the situation, but we should not be concerned about America’s resolve to defend itself.



￼
Mayor Joey San Nicolas led the Tinian community in a peace ceremony this week, commemorating the anniversaries of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Seventy-two years ago, these bombings brought an end to World War II. Thank you, Mayor San Nicolas, for including the congressional office.



CW bill goes to the President
The Northern Marianas Economic Expansion Act, H.R. 339, as amended by the Senate, passed the House of Representatives by unanimous consent today and will be transmitted to the President for signature. The White House has been briefed and readied for prompt action on the bill. My bill makes 350 more CW, foreign worker permits available for fiscal 2017 – a breakthrough; this is the first time that Congress has approved any increase in CW permits. H.R. 339 responds to the disaster caused by Chinese construction companies using up one-third of this year’s CW permits – forcing out nurses and other high-value workers our economy needs.  Though not intended to be a long-term solution, H.R. 339 does contains elements of a long-term solution: 
	1.	It sets aside permits for specific, high-value occupations – health care workers and power plant operators.  
	2.	More money will go into training the 2,400 local workers who are unemployed. 
	3.	Employers will be forced to use other visa categories, not just the limited CW permit. Legislation I passed in 2014 gives the Marianas unlimited access to H-2B visas for temporary construction workers on projects like the casino. 
The working group that developed and negotiated H.R. 339 – in both the House and Senate, including Republicans and Democrats – will now be working on a long-term plan with two goals:
	1.	Make sure the Marianas has enough labor to keep the economy growing. 
	2.	Make sure the percentage of US workers keeps going up and the percentage of foreign workers goes down. 
It was very unusual to get a bill passed while the House is in recess, as we did today, and only possible because of the long-term relationships we have built in Congress over the last nine years. Thank you to all who helped.

Robert Hunter, Secretary of the Department of Community and Cultural Affairs, visited his congressional office, along with members of his childcare program team Kim McClennahan Means, Maribel S.D. Loste, and Roselle C. Teregeyo. DCCA receives federal funding that helps parents pay for day care, so that they can work, knowing their children are in good hands. Thank you, DCCA, for all you do.



$96k for turtle conservation
Congratulations to our Department of Lands and Natural Resources for being awarded a continuation grant of $95,562 for their work in protecting green and hawksbill sea turtles. This is the second year of a three-year $248,612 grant. Funded under the Species Recovery Grant Program, the grant supports the implementation of recovery actions for species facing a very high risk of extinction. DLNR is using its grant money to develop a hotline and hire a sea turtle conservation officer to increase response to, and enforcement of, stranding and poaching incidents. DLNR is also working on public service announcements and an elementary school education curriculum to help reduce poaching of vulnerable sea turtles. Every generation is responsible for caring for the environmental resources that have been handed down to us and responsible for passing along to those who come after an environment in better condition than we received it. Good work, DLNR!

8/11/17 16:36,E-NEWS: Murphy Fights for Affordable Child Care,"August 11, 2017

￼
Making Child Care More Affordable
Rep. Murphy recently helped introduce a bipartisan bill to make child care more affordable for working and middle-class families. Her bill, the Promoting Affordable Childcare for Everyone (PACE) Act, offers fully-refundable tax credits to help offset the costs of child care – allowing working families to keep more of their hard-earned dollars. Rep. Murphy said that access to affordable child care is an issue that affects nearly every family, which is why she will continue working with both parties to get results.  
￼
Rep. Murphy speaks to young girls in Chuluota, Fla., about her work in Congress to support legislation and programs that will help younger generations succeed
Increasing English Language Funding for Florida Students
Rep. Murphy introduced a bipartisan bill, the Ensuring Linguistic Excellence and Vocational Aptitude by Teaching English (ELEVATE) Act, which is designed to give Florida its fair share of federal funding for English language learning programs. Current law allocates funding to states for these programs based in part on the number of foreign-born people living in the state. This hurts Florida, which has had a large number of Spanish-speakers move to the state from Puerto Rico in recent years. Since Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, they are not fully counted in the funding formula. Rep. Murphy’s bill would fix this flaw and ensure more people who move to Florida have an opportunity to learn English. Rep. Murphy discussed her bill during an English language class at the Adult Literacy League in Orlando, where she spoke about the challenges she experienced while learning English as a child and about the ways her bill will give central Florida students greater opportunities to succeed.

Memorializing an Orlando Icon
Rep. Murphy has been working in Congress to protect LGBTQ rights and recently submitted a statement to the Congressional Record honoring Billy Manes, an Orlando writer, LGBTQ activist and icon who passed away recently. Manes was a well-known journalist and commentator who used his words to move and amused central Florida. In her statement, Rep. Murphy recognized Manes’ commitment to LGBTQ equality and the passion with which he pursued it. To read her full statement, click here.

Recognizing Acts of Courage
The United States Air Force recently honored an extraordinary act of courage by Lake Mary's very own Airman 1st Class Peejay Jack during a ceremony at the Air Force Memorial in Arlington, Va. Airman 1st Class Jack demonstrated incredible bravery and selflessness when he entered a burning vehicle on Interstate-4 in central Florida to free a trapped driver, even as the flames on the car began to spread. Rep. Murphy expressed pride in her constituent's heroism and gratitude towards all the men and women in uniform who serve and protect our community.

Trump's Failed First 200 Days


￼
6 Months, 28 Weeks, 4,800 Hours, 288,000 Minutes and 0 Accomplishments
Two hundred days into the Trump Administration, the President has offered nothing but broken promises and failed leadership.  Instead of improving the lives of hard-working Americans, President Trump has tried to force on the American people an immoral, ineffective and expensive border wall, discriminatory new barriers to the ballot box, a degrading and disgusting policy banning transgender Americans from serving in the military and a hateful, senseless anti-immigrant agenda that instills fear in our communities and weakens our nation. 
Despite having full control of the legislative process, the Republican Congress has not lifted a finger to raise wages, create good-paying jobs, invest in our crumbling infrastructure or avert a catastrophic default on the full faith and credit of the United States, instead wasting months trying to tear away families’ health coverage.
The American people deserve better than what they’re getting from Republicans in Washington.  That’s why Democrats are offering A Better Deal: Better Jobs, Better Wages, Better Future, an ambitious new economic agenda to help the hard-working men and women across America who have been left out and left behind for too long.  Democrats are committed to raising the wages of American workers and creating ten million good-paying jobs, lowering the costs of living for families and building an economy that gives working Americans the tools to succeed in the 21st century. 
While the President celebrates his failed first 200 days with a 17-day vacation at his golf club, we are fighting in very corner of the country to protect the health, pocketbooks and security of American families.
Our Marine Sanctuaries Face New Drilling Threat
On April 28, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13795 to implement a so-called “America-First Offshore Energy Strategy,” which requires the review of all National Marine Sanctuaries and Monuments established within the last ten years to study the potential for energy and mineral exploration. Four California Sanctuaries would be subject to this review and, potentially, to degradation and destruction: Channel Islands Cordell Bank, Greater Farallones and Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuaries. 
By auctioning off our public lands and cherished natural monuments, the President is once again putting the interests of large energy companies before the good of our families, communities and environment.  As you know, California’s marine sanctuaries are vital to our $1.9 trillion coastal economy and are essential in protecting some of our nation’s most treasured natural resources. Marine sanctuaries also shelter major seabird and sea mammal breeding sites, as well as dozens of threatened or endangered fish and mammal species, including great white sharks and blue whales.  They protect our beaches from oil spills like the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, the largest in California’s history, when 100,000 barrels of crude oil spewed into the Santa Barbara Channel, coating Santa Barbara’s coastline, pelicans and gulls.
While the White House tries to gut key environmental protections and push its dirty energy agenda, my commitment to defending our nation’s most sacred natural preserves and wonders remains firm.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will formally reopen the public comment period from July 31st to August 15th on these actions. If you wish, please leave your public comment here.

My constituent, a senior and an immigrant, is terminally ill and currently residing in a hospice care facility. Although some of his family lives in the United States, he wished to be reunited with his daughter, who he had not seen in over five years, and who resides abroad. However, he was concerned that she would not be granted a visitor visa, because she was previously denied a visa several years ago. Based on these extenuating circumstances, my staff communicated my constituent’s situation to the U.S. Consulate where my constituent’s daughter had applied for a visitor visa. Just recently, she attended her consular interview and her visa was granted. My constituent will now be able to see his daughter again.

￼

Dear Fellow Vermonter,

In case you missed them, I want to share with you some stories I posted recently on Facebook. I hope you find these items interesting, and I encourage you to join thousands of other Vermonters to discuss these and other important issues online. 

Sincerely,
￼
Senator Bernie Sanders 

￼ 
 
TELEPHONE TOWN HALL

Bernie held a statewide telephone town hall with more than 15,000 Vermonters last month. Bernie opened the call with a brief update on crucial issues facing Vermont and the United States, including the disastrous Republican plan to take health care away from 22 million Americans. He also touched on President Donald Trump’s budget, which would give huge tax breaks to billionaires, while making massive cuts to education, environmental protection and programs that serve children and seniors. The telephone town hall provided an opportunity for Vermonters to ask Bernie questions about proposed legislation, the budget and other issues they are concerned about. 

￼

SPEAKING WITH SENIORS

Bernie’s office is holding meetings throughout Vermont to hear from seniors on the issues facing Vermont and the United States. At a recent senior meeting in Barton, Ann Drennan of Craftsbury Common said the costs of home care and prescription medicine are “the two biggies” in terms of the top financial strains facing Vermont seniors. Ann said she paid more than $250,000 to care for her husband at home during the last four years of his life. The next senior meetings are Monday, Aug. 14 in St. Albans and Thursday, Aug. 17 in Bennington. Both meetings start at noon, with a free lunch at 11:30 a.m. Please call 1-800-339-9834 to RSVP.

REACHING OUT TO VETERANS

Valerie Pallotta of Colchester has made it her mission to help end the tragedy of veteran suicide. Bernie invited Valerie to share her story with the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee shortly after her son’s suicide, where she spoke about the need to address the crisis that, on average, takes the lives of 20 veterans every day. “These men and women answered the national call to service. We have a responsibility to help them make their transition from active-duty to civilian status as smooth and seamless as possible, "" Bernie said. ""Specifically, we need to reach into our local communities to make sure all available resources – federal, state and local – are there to meet the needs of these military service members and their families.""

More than 70 people from 26 countries became U.S. citizens Tuesday in Rutland. “The story of immigrants is the story of America, a story rooted in family and fueled by hope. It continues today through families all across the United States,” Bernie said. “Congratulations to all those residents of Vermont who are now American citizens and a part of that story. We are glad to have you and look forward to the great contributions you will make to our communities, our state and our country.”

Hearing Directly from People and Innovative Businesses Across New Hampshire  
￼ ￼ 
Monday, I visited the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center in Nashua, where I met with members of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association and reaffirmed my commitment to aviation safety. I also visited Horizon Technology in Salem, an innovative business helping to ensure that our drinking water is safe. 
￼ 
Tuesday, I joined former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy and Portsmouth Mayor Jack Blalock for an event hosted by the League of Conservation Voters at the Portsmouth Brewery to highlight the importance of working together to combat climate change and protect New Hampshire’s natural resources. 
Wednesday, I visited Siege Technologies in Manchester, an advanced research and development company that provides world-class technological and cybersecurity solutions to a diverse customer base. Siege Technologies exemplifies the hard-working, innovative spirit of New Hampshire, and it was a pleasure to learn more about their advanced cyber security technology. 
￼ ￼ 
Thursday, I toured Jaeger USA in Rochester and Tuckerman Brewing in Conway where I highlighted how New Hampshire’s innovative businesses are driving the economy and helping create good jobs for Granite Staters. 
￼ 
I also joined families at Surfing with Smiles in Hampton, noting how important it is that kids who experience disabilities are fully included in their communities. 

Congratulated Graduates of Rockingham County Drug Court Commencement 
￼ 
This week, I attended the Rockingham County Drug Court Recovery Commencement, where I congratulated graduates and spoke about the important role of drug courts as a tool in our efforts to combat the substance misuse epidemic. Read the Seacoast Online’s article, ‘Another beginning’: Rockingham Drug Court celebrates success, for more details on the ceremony.   
Also this week, the New Hampshire Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, related to deceptive marketing practices of opioid products. I was proud to support the New Hampshire DOJ’s investigation into claims regarding Purdue’s fraudulent marketing of opioid products during my time as Governor, and I will closely follow this case as it proceeds. 
Senator Shaheen and I also announced that Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital has received an AmeriCorps grant from the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), the federal agency for volunteering and service programs. The grant is specifically aimed at combating the opioid epidemic. AmeriCorps members will serve as community health workers and help those struggling with substance use disorders and behavioral health needs resolve non-clinical barriers to care such as housing, literacy and transportation. 

Bipartisan Measures I Helped Introduce to Support Veterans Passed the Senate 
￼  Wednesday, I attended the State Veterans Advisory Committee's summer outing. 
Last week, the U.S. Senate approved several bipartisan measures that I helped introduce to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs and to better support veterans as they transition to civilian life. 
I joined Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and others in introducing the bipartisan Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 to help reduce wait times and improve the process for New Hampshire and America’s veterans seeking benefits from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. After the legislation is approved by the House, which already passed a similar version, the legislation will go to the President for his signature. 
In addition, provisions of a bipartisan bill I helped introduce – the Better Workforce for Veterans Act – passed the House and Senate and are heading to the President’s desk for signature. This bipartisan bill is designed to address the crippling workforce shortages at the Department of Veterans Affairs in order to improve the health care delivery for veterans. 
And the bipartisan Harry W. Colmery Veterans Education Assistance Act of 2017 that I helped introduce passed the House and Senate and is awaiting President Trump’s signature. This bill seeks to improve veteran education benefits and enhance the post-9/11 G.I. Bill.

Doctor's Note
Friend,
Hello from the other side of the world!
I am currently in Israel with a Congressional Delegation learning about the unique problems faced in the region, meeting with private and public officials and seeing this beautiful country.
￼
I have no words that can express how this trip to Israel has only increased our faith. It has also opened our eyes to much of what this region faces.
To see where our Savior was born (shown right) at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, and to walk in His footsteps... amazing.
I'll have much more to send after I get back and have a little more time to reflect and compile my thoughts. Until then, I'll keep this brief, and hope to see you at the tour discussed below.
As always, if you have any questions, concerns or know of ways my office can be of assistance, don't hesitate to contact us.
Yours,

Hosting a Town Hall Meeting
￼
On Saturday, I hosted a town hall meeting at the Burton Callicott Auditorium at the Memphis College of Art. I appreciated having this opportunity to listen to the Ninth District’s perspective on a variety of issues facing our community. I would like to thank everyone who took part in the democratic process last weekend by attending the town hall meeting in person as well as those who tuned in on Facebook Live. I would also like to thank Dr. Art Sutherland and Dr. Roger LaBonte for joining me in answering your questions about health care. I know there has been a lot of uncertainty surrounding this issue as Republicans attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. In case you missed it, you can watch the full town hall meeting here.
Honoring Private Edward O. Cleaborn
￼
August 15th is “Private Edward O. Cleaborn Day” in Memphis. I was proud to help secure a HOPE VI federal grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to renovate the Clearborn Apartments in Memphis and ensure the apartments remained named after this Korean War hero. 
Edward Obern Cleaborn entered the Army on February 13, 1950 at the age of 17 because “he couldn’t find a job.” On August 15, 1950, near Kuri, Korea, Private Cleaborn and the 34th All Negro GI Infantry Regiment of the 24th Infantry Division attacked a ridge on which the enemy was occupying. His platoon was pinned down almost immediately by machine-gun fire. Private Cleaborn killed the machine gun crews and other enemy troops who attempted to re-man the guns. Far East Command Headquarters said, “Cleaborn single-handedly wiped out red-gun crews threatening his unit.” Disregarding burns on his hands from continuous firing, Private Cleaborn remained on the ridge to cover his platoon’s withdrawal and permit the evacuation of the wounded. He continued firing from this position, thus denying the enemy access to adjacent higher ground, until he was mortally wounded. 
For his heroism, Private Edward O. Cleaborn was awarded the Purple Heart, the Combat Infantryman’s Badge, the Korean Service Medal, the United Nations Service Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Korean Presidential Unit Citation, Republic of Korea War Service Medal, and posthumously the Distinguished Service Cross.
The annual memorial in Memphis in his honor will be held on Sunday, August 13, 2017 from 2pm-6pm at the Cleaborn Pointe at Heritage Landing (440 S. Lauderdale Street, Memphis, TN 38126).
Meeting with Marvin Kalb
￼
On Wednesday, I had the privilege of having an educational lunch with Marvin Kalb, one of the greatest journalists and a former moderator of NBC’s Meet the Press. Mr. Kalb and I discussed President Trump, North Korea, Richard Nixon, Congress, authoritarianism, the state of the freedom of the press, and our Jewish heritage.
Speaking at the Memphis Retired Teachers Association Meeting
￼
On Thursday, I spoke to the Memphis Retired Teachers Association. I gave them an update on health care, Medicare/Medicaid, Social Security, tax reform and efforts on education in Congress. 
Upcoming Appearances on TV in Memphis
￼
Tonight at 7pm CT, I’ll be on WKNO’s Behind the Lines where I’ll discuss tax reform, health care and President Trump with Bill Dries of Memphis Daily News and WKNO host Eric Barnes. On Sunday at 9am CT, I’ll be on Local 24’s This Week with Brandon Artiles to discuss health care, President Trump, North Korea and other issues affecting Memphis. 
Remembering Glen Campbell 
￼
On Tuesday, country music legend Glen Campbell passed away from Alzheimer’s disease. Glen and his family courageously carried a message about Alzheimer’s and its costs to his fans through his farewell tour. He was a great singer/songwriter and spirit. My thoughts are with him and his family.

Dear Friend,
This week, The Hill featured on its website an open letter that I wrote to President Trump in response to his characterization of New Hampshire as a “drug-infested den” in a call with the president of Mexico. I described the incredible work being done in New Hampshire by law enforcement, first responders, healthcare providers, medical researchers, advocates and people in recovery to combat the state’s opioid crisis. President Trump should learn from those who are on the frontlines of this epidemic instead of disparaging our state. You can read the whole letter below and here. 
Mr. President: Learn from New Hampshire as it battles the opioid epidemic
BY CONGRESSWOMAN ANN MCLANE KUSTER (D-N.H.)- Aug. 9, 2017
Dear Mr. President,
I write in response to your characterization of my beloved state of New Hampshire as a ""drug-infested den"" in your first conversation in January with the president of Mexico.
New Hampshire is a prideful state and we don't take kindly to people disparaging our beautiful home. We are honest, hard-working people, who are rising to the challenge of a fast-paced opioid epidemic sweeping across this country. We invite you to listen and learn from our law enforcement, first responders, healthcare providers, medical researchers, advocates and the brave men and women in recovery who are leading New Hampshire out of this crisis with innovative and effective programs that will help millions of Americans.
The opioid epidemic has left no state untouched. In 2014, more than 2 million Americans suffered from opioid use disorder, and more than 33,000 people died in 2015 of opioid related overdoses. Last year, New Hampshire was second only to West Virginia in opioid deaths per capita and this trend is only worsened by the increasing use of synthetic opioids.
During the 2016 presidential campaign, you met with advocates in New Hampshire and made a commitment to take on the opioid epidemic. Advocates such as Kriss Blevens, a cosmetologist who started a detox center after her stepdaughter Amber died of an overdose. It’s time you honored that commitment and learned from the many innovative solutions that we are pursuing in New Hampshire. 
Our police departments around the state are changing their approach to the opioid epidemic, putting a premium on helping people get into treatment and recovery programs. It’s making a real difference.
In Manchester and Nashua, Safe Stations programs are getting people in crisis the support they need to access treatment and get well. New Hampshire’s drug courts, expanded and strengthened throughout the state by Justice Tina Nadeau, are now in place or in development in all ten counties, offering people in the criminal justice system more access to treatment services. Ross Cunningham, Merrimack County Superintendent of Corrections, is improving treatment services in correctional facilities to reduce recidivism. All of these should serve as models around the country for how to tackle the opioid crisis.
Dr. Lisa Marsch, Director of Dartmouth College’s Center for Technology and Behavioral Health, and her colleagues at Dartmouth Medical Center are engaging in cutting edge research to improve our understanding of the causes of this opioid epidemic.
Communities across the state are coming together to increase our drug treatment capacity. Groups like New Futures, Easter Seals, Harbor Homes, the North Country Health Consortium, the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation, and Hope for New Hampshire Recovery, among others, are making important strides in advocacy and increased treatment and recovery options.
Two years ago, I founded the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force with my former colleague Frank Guinta (R-N.H.) to bring together Republicans and Democrats to advance common sense solutions to turn the tide on the opioid crisis gripping rural America. Today it’s grown to over 90 members of Congress evenly split by party. I’ve been encouraged by the willingness of my colleagues to put aside their partisan differences to make progress on this issue. Our Task Force was instrumental in passing 14 House bills to address the opioid crisis that became part of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA). Together we have held roundtables and briefings to educate members of Congress about the causes of this epidemic and innovative solutions to achieve real results.
Granite Staters have been posting breathtaking photos of the natural beauty of our lakes, mountains and coastline to share their pride in New Hampshire and rebut your disparaging remarks. We are a small, but mighty state - home to the First-in-the-Nation Presidential Primary, the first American in space, and the first all-female congressional delegation. We host championship dog sledding and ski races, Highland Games, and NASCAR. We boast the White Mountains, the world's largest pumpkin festival and the world's longest candy counter. Tourists flock to New Hampshire in every season to experience all our state has to offer.
And we will overcome, leading America out of this epidemic by fighting the stigma of addiction, inventing new pain management techniques and recovery programs, and advocating for new resources and legislation to protect our families and our communities.
Mr. President, listen, learn and visit us in New Hampshire to see real results. And when you come back, you can apologize to all the hard-working folks who call this beautiful state home.

NEWS FROM THE 1st DISTRICT
Dear Friends, 
It was another busy week in beautiful New Hampshire. Wonderful to hear from constituents at Town Halls and meetings across the District.
Hosting Town Halls
￼
I enjoyed answering thoughtful questions from engaged Lakes Region constituents at Tuesday night’s Town Hall in Laconia. As Granny D always said: Democracy is something we do!
￼
I also enjoyed the opportunity to hear from constituents and discuss important issues including health care, national security, and the environment at Wednesday night’s Town Hall in Dover.

Shea-Porter speaks to constituents  Fosters // Judi Currie The lack of unity in Congress, climate change, and health care topped the list of concerns at a forum Wednesday hosted by U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, D-N.H, a the McConnell Center in downtown Dover.
Shea-Porter sees some good, some ‘chilling’ things in DC  Laconia Sun // Rick Green Democratic U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter struck a positive tone in her talk to a few dozen constituents Tuesday evening, although she did express concerns over actions and comments of President Donald Trump, including his recent warning to North Korea.
North Korea and our National Security
Following this week’s reckless comments about North Korea from President Trump, I joined with more than 60 Members of Congress to write an urgent letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson expressing our “profound concern” over these “irresponsible and dangerous” statements. We urged Secretary Tillerson to do everything in his power “to ensure that President Trump and other Administration officials understand the importance of speaking and acting with the utmost caution and restraint on this delicate issue.”
This is a dangerous moment that requires skill, experience, and knowledge to deal with North Korea's threats and aggression. President Trump needs to seek out people with those skills. Now.
Around the District
￼
Thanks to the team at the UNH School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering’s Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping for a fascinating and informative tour. New Hampshire residents are proud of UNH’s global scientific leadership in ocean mapping and their commitment to map all of our world oceans by 2030.
￼
My staff and I visited the Sawyer Mills Dam in Dover yesterday. It's over 100 years old, and isn't working anymore – actually, it's been causing floods. Now, it's set to be removed next year with help from NOAA at the request of the landowner and the City of Dover.
￼
On Monday I visited the Rochester Water Treatment Plant. Thanks to Chief Operator Ian Rohrbacher and staff for showing me the plant and for their work to provide Rochester residents safe water.
￼
Monday night’s screening of the film Tidewater at the Great Bay Discovery Center in Greenland was informative and powerful. As the film shows, climate change is a serious national security threat.
￼
I agree with Ron and Patti from Milton, two strong advocates for people with brain tumors, that we need to keep funding brain tumor research, including for pediatric cancers, which is why I am a cosponsor of the STAR Act.
Closing thoughts
This week, I announced that the Air Force has agreed to pay $1.3 million to the City of Portsmouth to complete next steps in the ongoing Pease clean-up effort. The investment is a good next step toward addressing unacceptable PFC contamination in our drinking water. I expect the Air Force to take financial responsibility for both cleaning up our water and for studying the health impacts of the level of PFC exposure that Pease-area residents have already experienced.
As always, thank you for the honor of representing you in Congress.   Best wishes, ￼  Carol

￼
Friends,  August is a district work month, and the last two weeks were packed full of events, meetings and business tours around Northwest Georgia. Here are a few of the highlights.   
￼
I kicked off the work period last Tuesday with a very informative visit to Redmond Regional Medical Center in Rome. The staff and residents are doing great work for our community.

￼
I visited Dobbs Defense last Wednesday, which is a firearms manufacturer located in Dallas. They even let me test some of their great products!

￼
After speaking at the Floyd County Republican Women's lunch last week, I was honored to meet World War II veteran Gayler Brason and thank him for his service.

￼
I was proud to receive the Spirit of Enterprise award this week after a productive conversation at the Dalton Chamber of Commerce's business roundtable. 

￼
‪Between events, I made an impromptu visit to the Dalton Distillery - Raymond Butler of Dalton Distillery was named Small Business Person of the Year in 2016 by the Dalton Chamber, a well-deserved honor. 

￼
On Wednesday, I enjoyed speaking with the hard-working employees at Roper Corporation in Walker County.

￼
It was awesome to witness Pirelli's advanced manufacturing techniques at work yesterday. I'm grateful for strong international partnerships that positively impact the local community in Lindale and all of Northwest Georgia.
 
￼
I also couldn't resist stopping in for a treat at Rome's Honeymoon Bakery yesterday (when in Rome!).

To keep up with all my events over the district work period, follow me on social media, including FACEBOOK, TWITTER and INSTAGRAM. 

Freedom first,

Graves says tax reform will be top priority for Congress
""We are pursuing it. We are moving forward, and I'm excited about it [tax reform],"" Graves, whose district includes Whitfield and Murray counties, said at the Greater Dalton Chamber of Commerce where he was receiving the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Spirit of Enterprise Award. ""The country, regardless of party, wants to see lower tax rates and families empowered and less power for the IRS."" 

Graves ‘touches base’ in Rome, says House expects to move on tax reform after recess if Senate passes healthcare bill
U.S. Rep. Tom Graves defended President Donald Trump, lauded Vice President Mike Pence and called on the Senate to do its job during his sweep through Rome on Tuesday. The Ranger Republican spent the day reconnecting with his constituents and drawing contrasts between his Northwest Georgia district and Washington, D.C. 

Rep. Tom Graves talks healthcare at Redmond Regional Medical Center
Congressman Tom Graves started his August recess in Rome on Tuesday, saluting internal medicine residents at Redmond Regional Medical Center for choosing a career in medicine in spite of uncertainties that confront the field...He suggested allowing individuals to deduct from taxes the cost of insurance just like businesses do would be a good starting point.

Paulding congressman says Senate, national news media must do better jobs
District 14 U.S. Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ranger, said Georgia’s two senators did their part to bring about Republicans’ long-awaited repeal of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. Unfortunately, the U.S. Senate overall saw it as a political effort rather than an opportunity to improve many Americans’ quality of life, he said...Graves also said the national TV news media is ignoring President Donald Trump’s policy accomplishments in favor of things Trump says and does that can be turned into scandals. “It’s entertainment (but) it sure is not news,” he said of national news coverage.

Thomas selected to serve on committee for service academy appointments
A recent appointment from Polk County was made to U.S. Rep. Tom Graves' (R-14th district) committee for the district on who he'll appoint to the U.S. Armed Services academies as West Point, Annapolis and Colorado Springs. According to information from Graves' office, the board is an independent body of military advisers that reviews applications from 14th district students and determines who from the district receives a nomination to a military academy.

Dear Friend,
After months in which the Congress had been consumed by debate about repealing the Affordable Care Act, members of both parties are now working on improving the ACA and constraining healthcare costs. This is a very positive development and one that all Americans should welcome, because it means that the chance of improving the healthcare system just got a lot better, and millions of Americans won't be losing their coverage.
Getting to this point wasn't easy.  Since January, several versions of a repeal have been brought to a vote in the House and Senate. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, each of those health care bills would have caused tens of millions of Americans to lose their insurance, severely jeopardizing both their health and long-term economic security.
Its been a frustrating process, because if we had started out by having a real conversation about how we can make changes to the Affordable Care Act to improve quality, affordability, and access to care, I truly believe we could have worked out bipartisan solutions a long time ago. There is no question that healthcare under the ACA can be improved, particularly in the individual market, but instead of exploring such reforms, the GOP leadership in the House and Senate undertook an unprecedented and closed process to push through a bill without hearings, amendments, or real substantive debate.
Last month, the most recent Republican attempt to repeal the ACA failed passage in the Senate by a 51-49 vote. If the so-called skinny repeal had passed, it would have stripped insurance from 15 million Americans and caused premiums to skyrocket. In a logic that could only make sense in Washington, most Republican Senators actually feared that their own bill could become law. They acknowledged that the bill would wreak havoc on insurance markets, and said they would only vote yes if they were guaranteed it would never be enacted. Other versions of the bill were even worse and would have kicked over 20 million off their care.
I was relieved that this most recent push for repeal fell short (thanks to the leadership of Republican Senators Collins, Murkowski and McCain, and the entire Democratic Caucus in the Senate), and grateful for the many Americans around the nation who spoke up about what access to affordable healthcare meant to them. The stakes are much too high to simply pass something, anything, without consideration of the consequences. 
After each legislative failure, President Trump doubled down on his threat to let Obamacare implode, but in reality, it was the President who was doing all he could to sabotage the health insurance that millions of Americans count on. He was doing this by creating uncertainty in the markets, threatening to end cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments which forces insurance companies to dramatically raise premiums (20 percent or more immediately), and cutting off marketing to young people so that the risk pools are older and more expensive. 
Ensuring that every American has access to quality, affordable health care should not be a partisan issue. The good news is that there is bipartisan support for continuing the CSR payments, while simultaneously making changes that improve the ACA and stabilize the individual markets. In the House, members from both sides of the aisle are working together to improve and strengthen the markets. This is a good start, but we are not out of the woods yet. The President is continuing to take action to undermine the ACA even as members of both parties now work to improve it, and it is still unclear if the House Leadership will allow such efforts to gain traction through hearings, legislative markup and real debate.  
The Affordable Care Act isn't perfect, but it expanded access to affordable healthcare for millions, and started to lower the rapid clip at which healthcare costs had been escalating.  Healthcare costs are still too great, but there are steps we can take that won't start us back at the beginning Our end goal must be universal healthcare for each and every single American.
You can always share your thoughts through Facebook or Twitter.  As always, I welcome hearing from you on these and any other issues, and hope that you will stay in touch.
Sincerely,
￼
Congressman Adam Schiff

Lake of the Woods
 
Dear Friends,
 
This week I joined the Agriculture Committee in Modesto, California to continue our “Conversations in the Field” listening sessions. I also met with sugar beet and cane growers at the 34th International Sweetener Symposium and joined Congressmen Jimmy Panetta and Jim Costa in Salinas, California for a roundtable with agriculture producers and others interested in the farm bill. With increased participation in crafting legislation like the farm bill, I feel confident that we will represent the interests of our farmers, ranchers, and producers in a lasting and effective way. I look forward to hearing more as we continue this farm bill process, and thank all of those who have reached out already. 
 
Sincerely,

Agriculture Committee Listening Session and Farm Bill Round Table
￼
Modesto, California listening session; Reps. Panetta and Costa in Salinas
 
This week, the Agriculture Committee continued our “Conversations in the Field” to gather input for the next farm bill. Chairman Conaway hosted a listening session in Modesto, California, and I joined Congressmen Jimmy Panetta and Jim Costa in Salinas, California for a roundtable with agriculture producers and others interested in the farm bill. The farm bill remains one of the most critical pieces of legislation that helps to bring support to our farmers and ranchers, and I am thankful for the chance to highlight their thoughts and concerns directly. The Agriculture Committee has a final listening session scheduled for this month on August 30 at the Farm Progress Show in Decatur, Illinois.
 
Folks who want to submit their ideas and suggestions should email them to HouseAgListens@mail.house.gov.
 
Archived video of the listening session is available here - https://youtu.be/lXWYT-C7N9k 
 
International Sweetener Symposium ￼
 
I was pleased to join sugar beet and cane growers at the 34th International Sweetener Symposium. We discussed the outlook and timing for the 2018 farm bill, the outlook for the remainder of the congressional session, and what could happen on appropriations bills and tax reform. Chairman Conaway also made an appearance and reiterated his plan for the House Ag Committee to write and take to the Floor a farm bill in late 2017 or early 2018. I shared my belief that the Committee should move sooner rather than later in getting a bill written and to the House Floor.
 
Here's some additional information about the meeting: https://sugaralliance.org/house-agriculture-committee-start-writing-new-farm-bill/13587
 
Todd County Farmers Union Picnic 
￼
 
There was a big turnout for the 32nd Annual Todd County Farmers Union Picnic held on August 6 in Clarissa, Minnesota. The president of the Todd County Farmers Union, Alan Perish, along with a lot of other volunteers, provided great food, old-time music, and an opportunity for everyone to socialize and visit. My staff enjoyed the chance to meet and greet many of those at the picnic.
 
Veterans Care Round Table
￼
 
My staff attended the round table discussion of Veterans Care in Rural Areas held by Ranking member Walz and Congressman Nolan in Duluth this week. Many areas of improvement where discussed on how to move forward and provide better access to health care for Veterans in rural areas of Minnesota. There will be several more round table discussions and hearings held in Minnesota, as well as other states, as the Committee on Veterans Affairs works to craft a new version of the Choice program.
 
Local Harvest Market
￼
 
On Thursday, my staff visited the Local Harvest Market in Alexandria. It was a great opportunity to connect with local producers, sample local produce, purchase healthy foods, and share in a meal. The Local Harvest Market was formed by a group of west central residents to build a market bridge between local farmers and local consumers. Thursday’s event was hosted in conjunction with the local farmers market and included music in the park and games for the family. The event was a joint effort of the Local Harvest Market, University of Minnesota Extension and Minnesota Food Charter Network and was funded by a Food Systems Issue Area Grant from the University of Minnesota Extension.  
 
This Week in American History
￼
 
The Webster-Ashburton Treaty was signed by the United States and Great Britain on August 9, 1842, ending a decades–long territory dispute and setting the boundary between the US and Canada. Originally established by the Treaty of Paris in 1783, the treaty stated that the boundary should run ""through the Lake of the Woods to the Northernmost point thereof, and from thence on a due west course to the river Mississippi.” However, the geographically faulty map used to negotiate the Treaty of Paris failed to recognize that the source of the Mississippi River, Lake Itasca, was too far south to be to be intersected by a line running west from Lake of the Woods. This error was officially corrected in the Webster-Ashburton Treaty by directing the boundary from the northwest point of the lake to the 49th parallel, then westward. Today, the Northwest Angle in Lake of the Woods County is the northernmost point in the contiguous US and the only territory of the US (with the exception of Alaska) north of the 49th parallel.

The Hill Report  A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions Week of August 7 – 11, 2017
In recent weeks the looming threat of North Korea’s nuclear capabilities has reached an alarming stage. This increased danger is something that we need to take seriously and fully understand the ramifications of Kim Jong-un’s threats. While we must act with prudence, the United States will not bend to the whims of delusional and destructive dictators like Kim. We will stand strong in the face of our adversaries and protect our people both at home and abroad. In fact, last month we passed sanctions to hold this regime accountable for their actions and cripple their economy. Click here to learn more about those sanctions. 
As your representative, I want to hear what you think about this important issue. Please fill out the short survey below so I can learn more about your thoughts.

Do you agree with the sanctions imposed on North Korea?

Yes



No


 
Should the United States exert its influence to pressure China to limit its economic dealings with North Korea?

Yes



No


 
What do you think we should do to prevent a nuclear strike from North Korea?

Longs Short Report  The G.I. forever Bill
 
By: Rep. Billy Long
 
I did talk radio on KWTO AM 560 for three hours every morning, Monday through Friday, for six years. One of my favorite callers was 'Ruth from Shell Knob'. She would often regale us with stories from her time serving her country in World War II (WWII). Every time I talk with a veteran or see someone wearing a veteran hat or piece of clothing, I'm reminded that just because we can never fully repay them for their selfless service doesn't mean we shouldn't try.  Im always reminded of the sacrifices made by both them and their families. My father was a WWII veteran and my father-in-law was a Korean veteran. Veterans have put their lives on the line and have gone above and beyond to protect our freedoms and make sure our country is safe. A simple thank you for their service doesnt even begin to show the appreciation I have for them and their loved ones. 
 
Since 1944, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been providing veterans with educational assistance benefits under the G.I. Bill. The original G.I. Bills purpose was to give financial assistance for WWII veterans coming back from the war. It provided stipends for veterans who went to college or trade schools, low-interest mortgage rates and established unemployment pay. Over the past 73 years, Congress has passed many subsequent GI Bills, all with the same intent  to provide and care for our veterans.
 
Recently, we in Congress passed the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, also known as the G.I. forever Bill, increasing the amount of benefits veterans receive under the post-9/11 G.I. Bill. Currently, veterans who receive G.I. Bill benefits have a 15-year time limit to use their benefits. This new bill would eliminate this time restriction and allow veterans to use these benefits at any point in their life. Other advantages include full benefits to Purple Heart recipients (regardless of their length of service), an increase in funding for veterans majoring in the science, technology, engineering and math fields and allow veterans to use their benefits for distance learning courses in technical and career education schools.
 
We can't stop caring for these men and women when they take their uniforms off. They are valuable assets to our society and bring an entirely different set of skills to the table in the workforce. Investing in their success is critical.
 
The G.I. Bill has proven to be successful. Since 2009, these benefits have helped student veterans earn over 450,000 certificates or degrees. This bill does more than just say thank you, it shows that investing in our veterans works.
 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt said it best (after signing the original G.I. Bill into law) when he said, It gives emphatic notice to the men and women in our armed forces that the American people do not intend to let them down. Ive always said that there are a lot of things we disagree on in Washington, but taking care of our veterans is not one of them.

Carper's Connection
August 11, 2017
Dear Friends,
In the coming weeks, I’m teaming up with Senator Coons and Congresswoman Blunt Rochester to host two job fairs for Delaware’s veterans. As a 23-year veteran of the Navy and Naval Reserves, I know well the sacrifices our veterans and their families have made for this country. Their devotion to securing our liberty is worthy of our gratitude and respect. But it is also worthy of our constant diligence in assisting veterans in their transition back to civilian life.
When I returned home after five years in a hot war in Southeast Asia, I took advantage of the Vietnam Era GI Bill and earned my MBA at the University of Delaware. Today, our veterans return home to the Post-9/11 GI Bill—the most comprehensive GI Bill in history that can cover the full cost of tuition and housing at public colleges and universities, as well as career training programs, across the country. But our obligation doesn’t end when veterans sign up for classes. We must ensure our veterans attend high-quality schools, complete their studies and job training, and then put that hard-earned education to work.
￼
That's why we host job fairs specifically for our veterans in Delaware. Last year, our two veteran job fairs had nearly 100 employers attend looking to hire our vets. This year, Senator Coons, Congresswoman Blunt Rochester, and I are hosting two more job fairs for our veterans. Our first job fair will be on August 22 at Wilmington University's Dover Campus and our second will be September 15 at Middletown Fire Hall. Both are free and no registration is required.
If you are a veteran or know one looking for a career opportunity, be sure to mark your calendar for Tuesday, August 22 and Friday, September 15, spread the word to family and friends. For a full list of attending employers, please visit my website. You can also be sure to find out about future job fairs by following me on Twitter at @SenatorCarper and on Facebook at facebook.com/TomCarper.

8/11/17 14:20,"This Week in News for Senator Rand Paul - August 11, 2017"," 

￼   




Dear Friend,








This week, I have enjoyed having several opportunities to meet with Kentuckians about health care reform and other pressing local, state, and national issues.  Below, you can find an update on my recent activities!
Dr. Rand Paul Talks Health Care, Coal, and Economic Freedom in Pikeville
I kicked off my travels in Kentucky at a roundtable discussion with community leaders in Pikeville on Monday. While the majority of the event focused on health care reform, we also talked about many other topics important to Pike County and Eastern Kentucky.
￼
(Dr. Paul in Pikeville - Aug. 7, 2017)
The new administration has helped ease regulations on the coal industry; however, there is more work to be done, and I was glad to have coal industry leaders weigh in on which reforms they would still like to see. 
I also discussed my reintroduced Economic Freedom Zones bill as we talked about ways to help Eastern Kentucky grow and thrive.  My proposal would drastically lower taxes to incentivize businesses to locate in EFZ-eligible counties. 
Thanks to State Rep. John Blanton for moderating the meeting!
Dr. Rand Paul Champions Health Care Reform in Hazard
Next, I met with local business and health care industry leaders in Hazard to discuss how reform efforts would affect Kentucky.  
￼
(Dr. Paul in Hazard - Aug. 7, 2017)
In these meetings, I like to have everyone introduce themselves before opening it up to a broad discussion so I can learn more about the particular aspects of an issue and work toward a solution as their voice in Congress.  
I spoke about my efforts to expand the availability of group insurance, and our conversation also covered Big Pharma's role in skyrocketing drug prices, as well as specific health concerns faced by Hazard and Perry County.  
Thanks to Mary Meade-McKenzie from Kentucky River Community Care for such a warm welcome!
You can watch WYMT's coverage of the event and see my interview with the network HERE.
Dr. Rand Paul Joins Fellow Medical Professionals for Health Care Discussion in Bell County
I then visited Bell County to meet with fellow physicians, medical professionals, and hospital leadership at Middlesboro ARH Hospital.  Among the many health care-related topics discussed, the opioid crisis was one of the most pressing issues for the local community.  
It's important for me to hear straight from medical providers about how they are addressing these issues at a local level as we work toward finding a solution to an epidemic that sadly affects far too many people across Kentucky and the nation.  
On Capitol Hill, I have helped lead the fight to expand access to treatment for those battling opioid addiction, as well as to remove unnecessary restrictions that tie the medical community's hands, and I was glad to see several provisions I have championed included in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), which became law last year.
For more on our discussion, you can check out the Middlesboro Daily News' front-page story on my visit HERE.
￼
(Dr. Paul at Middlesboro ARH Hospital - Aug. 7, 2017)
Dr. Rand Paul Visits with Community Leaders in Pulaski County
My next stop took me to Somerset, as I continued hearing from local industry leaders and business owners about how the federal government's policies have impacted their work and community and ways we can create lasting reform.
￼
(Dr. Paul in Pulaski County - Aug. 7, 2017)
I spoke on topics including the steps the Trump administration can take right away to increase the number of Americans that can find coverage through Association Health Plans, as well as my opposition to bailing out insurance companies.
Moving forward, we should seek to expand competition and return power and control to the American people instead of bureaucrats and insurance executives.  
The same conservative principles that fueled America's prosperity can work for addressing health care, if we have confidence in them.
Dr. Rand Paul Holds Health Care Roundtable in Campbellsville
I had another opportunity to tackle these issues during a health care roundtable with medical industry professionals in Campbellsville. 
￼
(Dr. Paul in Campbellsville - Aug. 7, 2017)
In addition to laying out my ideas on Association Health Plans, I also discussed matters including the addiction crisis and building bipartisan support for health care reform.
I am encouraged by the positive reception the idea of expanding Association Health Plans is receiving across Kentucky, and I will keep fighting for this common-sense reform that I believe will help reduce costs and give Kentuckians more options for their families.
Thanks again to Orthodyne Physical Therapy for hosting us!
Dr. Rand Paul Co-hosts U.S. Service Academy Information Fair
Every year, my office partners with Congressman Brett Guthrie's office to put on the U.S. Service Academy Information Fair and provide valuable information about the U.S. Military, U.S. Naval, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Merchant Marine Academies, as well as the Academy Nomination process, to interested students and parents.

Dr. Rand Paul: The Rent is Too (Darn) High
On Wednesday, I released my latest Waste Report, an ongoing project cataloguing egregious examples of waste within the U.S. government.
This week's edition examines a recent finding by the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Inspector General that taxpayers footed a bill of over $3 million in 2016 to cover higher rent for Section 8 units in sampled co-ops than the owners charged for non-subsidized units on the same properties.
You can get the full story HERE.
Media Wrap-Up
Along with the WYMT interview mentioned above, I also held a media availability with outlets including The Hazard Herald, the Appalachian News-Express, East Kentucky Broadcasting, WVLC 99.9 FM, and the Central Kentucky News-Journal.

Dear Friend,   Thank you for signing up to receive my email newsletter. These newsletters will cover a variety of topics, including events happening in northeast Indiana, legislation being considered in Congress, and my perspective on current issues. My hope is to keep you updated and informed on how issues in Washington may impact our region. I welcome your feedback. 
Thanks for reading, ￼  Jim Banks Member of Congress Indiana's Third District
RAISE Act is Good Start
President Donald Trump recently spoke at the White House in favor of the RAISE Act, a proposal that would significantly reform our broken immigration system. Designed nearly half a century ago, our current immigration system is outdated and in need of modernization.
I commend President Donald Trump for working with Congress on efforts to reform America’s immigration system. The RAISE Act is a common-sense approach that recognizes individual merit, protects American workers and addresses our nation’s economic needs. The RAISE Act would be a move in the right direction and serves as a great starting point for debate on this important issue.   Read more of my thoughts on the RAISE Act here.

Staying Hard at Work During the Congressional Recess!
Although Congress is out of session for the month of August, my staff and I are still hard at work serving District of Columbia residents.  Be sure to call our office at 202-225-8050—or email us—on your concerns with Congress.  With events and legislative work still going on, below are some updates on what we have been up to!
Visiting D.C. Seniors Where They Live on a Senior Legislative Tour
￼
This summer, instead of hosting my annual Senior Legislative Day, I have been doing Senior Legislative Days where seniors live across the District to hear from them about their concerns and present updates about congressional issues affecting them.  So far this August, I have toured Congress Heights Wellness Center, Capitol Hill Village, and the Bernice Fontenau Senior Wellness Center.  Each visit has featured a presentation by a congressional expert on how the proposed Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act would harm seniors, including those who receive benefits from Medicare and Medicaid.  I also have taken caseworkers with me for on-the-spot casework on individual matters concerning federal agencies.  Going to the neighborhood centers where seniors are is already proving helpful to our office in understanding their priorities.  I look forward to continuing my visits during the upcoming months.
Unveiling a Design and Timeline for New Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge
￼
This week, I joined Mayor Muriel Bowser to introduce the design and timeline of the new Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge.  This project has been a labor of love for me.  For more than a decade, I used my role on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to secure critical federal funding for the bridge’s construction.  The South Capitol Street Bridge is an important gateway to the nation’s capital that will help spur economic growth and development in D.C. neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River and is an important link between Ward 6 and Ward 8.
Calling on the House Parliamentarian to Set the Record Straight on D.C. Budget Autonomy
This week, as we move toward D.C. equality, I called on the House Parliamentarian to correct the new House practice guide, which does not accurately describe the law on D.C.’s authority to spend its local funds.  The practice guide suggests that under current law, the District cannot spend its local funds without congressional approval, even though budget autonomy is currently the law of the land.  Under the referendum approved by D.C. voters in 2013, which was upheld in court in 2016, the District has the authority to spend its local funds without congressional approval, although congressional Republicans have ignored the referendum and continued to appropriate D.C.’s funds.  However, Congress has not overturned or blocked D.C.’s budget autonomy referendum.
I assume this was an oversight, but the practice guide could be read as adopting the longstanding position of the House Republican leadership, rejected in court, that the District has no authority to grant itself budget autonomy.  While we recognize that the practice guide, which is more than a thousand pages, cannot be reprinted to address every error, we expect the Parliamentarian to set the record straight in the Congressional Record now and in future editions of the practice guide. Otherwise, the nonpartisan guide will be cited in misrepresentations of D.C.’s legal authority.

Champlain Valley Educational Services Visit
￼
I stopped by Champlain Valley Education Services this week and witnessed first-hand the important work they're doing to provide career preparation for NY-21 students. As technically advanced skills become more important in our economy, organizations like CVED will be critical to helping students keep pace. 
Earlier this year, I voted for  the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, which will help our North Country students gain skills for in-demand jobs. Read more about this legislation here.
Clinton County Workforce Development Roundtable
￼
One of the most common refrains I hear when I tour businesses and manufacturers across the North Country is the need for more high skilled workers. To compete in a 21st century economy, workers need the skills and experience necessary to secure these high skilled jobs. Thanks to all the community leaders who participated in my Workforce Development Roundtable. Read more about our roundtable here.
Vapor Rail Systems Visit
￼
Plattsburgh is a hub for manufacturing, and this week I visited Vapor Rail Systems, a Wabtec Manufacturing company. They've been creating jobs and opportunity in the North Country since 1998, and it was great to see new and innovative manufacturing methods. Thanks for having me!
Combating Acid Rain in the Adirondacks
￼
The environment is our lifeblood in the North Country, and I am grateful for the critical work the Adirondack Lakes Survey Corporation does. This week, I visited their facility in Ray Brook and discussed strategies for measuring and combating acid rain in the Adirondacks. Their work will help ensure that the Adirondacks remain pristine for future generations. Thank you for the informative briefing! 
Sincerely,

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 8.11.17
Friday, August 11, 2017 –                                 
Energy and Commerce Update
As you know, I serve on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Many major domestic policy issues fall under its jurisdiction, from energy to telecommunications to manufacturing to healthcare and health insurance. This means that the committee always has a lot on its plate. I am pleased to report that it’s been hard at work addressing many of the big challenges facing families across the country and in Virginia’s Ninth Congressional District. Since January, we have held 50 hearings and twelve markups, and they have been fruitful: 31 E&C bills have been reported to the House.
Among E&C’s subcommittees, I serve as Vice Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and am also a member of the Health and Energy Subcommittees. These subcommittees have had a full schedule of hearings, bringing in witnesses to shed light on important issues, and have been diligent in marking up legislation for the consideration of the full committee and eventually the House.
The E&C Committee made news in March with its 27-and-a-half-hour continuous markup of legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, but on the Health Subcommittee, we also have been looking for ways to improve healthcare beyond reforming health insurance. Legislation to reauthorize the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) user fee program, which helps provide new treatments and cures, passed the full committee in June, the House in July, and the Senate in August.
Our committee is focused on updating the Federal Government’s regulations for a 21st-century system of medical care. One bill I have sponsored was covered in a July Subcommittee on Health hearing on legislation to improve Medicare. H.R. 1148, the Furthering Access to Stroke Telemedicine Act, would make more available telemedicine services that can be crucial in treating strokes.
Another bill I have put forward, H.R. 1703, is the Medical Product Communications Act, which recently received a hearing in the Subcommittee on Health. It would expand ways for manufacturers of medical drugs and devices to share scientific information with doctors about their products’ “off-label” uses, meaning ways doctors can treat conditions with drugs and devices aside from their uses previously approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This means that doctors will have off-label information to use when nothing else seems to work for their patient. The FDA has already determined the drug is safe for human consumption and doctors often find this information useful. Testimony indicates doctors frequently look at off-label treatments for pediatric patients where specific trials are not always done and for rare disorders, particularly some of the rare cancers. I believe doctors and your healthcare team ought to be able to provide you with the best scientific information if you are facing a dilemma of no treatment working for you. I hope there will be further action on this bill in the near future.
On the Energy Subcommittee, we have been looking at how to modernize America’s energy infrastructure and ensure that the country can draw on its abundant sources of energy. In June, the House passed two E&C bills I sponsored extending deadlines for the commencement of construction of the Flannagan Dam in Dickenson County and the Gathright Dam in Alleghany County. These bills, along with other similar hydroelectric bills, exemplify the committee’s readiness to consider using all energy sources available to power the country, not just coal and other carbon fuels.
For the laws Congress passes to be effective, it is critical that we conduct routine oversight to make sure that the laws are being implemented as intended and to discover if there are problems. We also need to investigate problems to determine if congressional action might be warranted. The Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations does this for issues under E&C’s jurisdiction. It has held two hearings this year examining the opioid plague facing the country, looking at the threat of the synthetic opioid fentanyl and how states are responding to the crisis. Cybersecurity in healthcare and ways to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in government programs have also been the subject of hearings. 
We’ve covered a lot of ground at E&C this Congress, and we’ve been able to produce legislation that is good for the country as a result.
If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.  You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671.

Dear Friend,
 
Over the past week, we’ve heard news of North Korea’s increasing agitation towards our country, particularly regarding their stated intention to deploy nuclear weapons. North Korea and its leaders have continuously demonstrated a reckless disregard and blatant ill will towards the United States, and these recent developments are yet another act of aggression. We must remain vigilant of North Korea's actions and continue working with our allies in the region to keep its nuclear capabilities from disrupting the safety and security of the international community. I will continue to monitor this situation and assure you that the safety of our nation is my top priority.
 
Ag Committee Hears Central Valley Priorities

This past weekend, I welcomed Agriculture Committee Chairman Michael Conaway of Texas to Modesto Junior College to host a listening session on the upcoming Farm Bill. Chairman Conaway was eager to hear about California’s ag priorities as the committee gathers input before drafting the new legislation. I was joined by California Reps. Doug LaMalfa and David Valadao as well as many stakeholders in our community, including local farmers, ranchers, business owners and student representatives from the Future Farmers of America. Our state’s agricultural abundance includes over 400 commodities, including more than two-thirds of the fruits and nuts consumed by the rest of the nation. Many of these products are grown right here in the Central Valley, and as the agricultural heartland of the country, it’s a priority of mine to ensure that our voices are heard and considered in drafting new language for the future of farming. Chairman Conaway said, “California provides the country with an abundance of products, including fruits, vegetables, dairy, nuts, livestock and nursery products. This wide cross-section of U.S. agriculture makes California a critical stop as we travel across the country hearing from producers about improvements to our nation’s farm policy. Farmers and ranchers are hurting right now, and the farm bill is an essential tool that helps weather the storm. It also underpins the entire rural economy and helps ensure that Americans continue to enjoy the safest, most abundant, and most affordable food supply in the world. I appreciated hearing from California stakeholders and look forward to taking their feedback back to Washington as we craft the next farm bill.”

This Week in Morning Mailbag

This week in Morning Mailbag, I discuss the affordability and accessibility to healthcare in the Central Valley. For too long, we have been plagued by a doctor shortage, leading to overcrowded emergency rooms, unacceptable wait times and limited access to care. California ranks 48th out of 50 in the nation in reimbursing its doctors, which is why I introduced the ACCESS Act. This bill field-tests doctor reimbursement strategies so that medically under-served and high-Medicaid populations, such as the Valley, are able to attract and retain doctors. To learn more about this bill and what else I’m doing to address healthcare, head to my website: https://denham.house.gov/constituent-services/healthcare.htm. Watch the video here:

Project Remember: Honoring Fallen Peace Officers

On October 22, 2017, 30,000 participants from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and over 50 countries will gather in Arlington, Virginia to run the 42nd Marine Corps Marathon. This is one of the largest marathons in the world and last week, I was honored to meet several officers from California’s 10th Congressional District who will be running the marathon in full uniform to honor fallen peace officers as part of an initiative called Project Remember. Detective Sean Dodge (Modesto Police Department), Lieutenant Neil Cervenka (Turlock Police Department), Captain Jim Gordon (Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Office), Deputy Joshua Petitt (Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Office) and Corporal Dan Pasquale (Tracy Police Department) will join the team of 11 peace officers in running the marathon and raising money for charities that directly support the survivors of fallen officers. I applaud this effort to not only raise awareness of the challenges our peace officers face on a national level, but also their commitment to representing and honoring fallen members of our community.

A Simpler, Fairer Tax Code Built For Growth

Reforming our tax code and overhauling the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been long overdue and I’m looking forward to addressing this issue upon Congress’ return to Washington in a few weeks. I assembled a group of local professionals and stakeholders to form a Tax Advisory Committee, tasked with presenting ideas on tax reform. I recently met with the committee and am looking forward to bringing their solutions back to Washington. We need a tax code that’s simple and fair for individuals and families, and that encourages growth for our local economies and small businesses. Watch the video to learn more about our vision:

Last week rang in the 86th Montana State Fair! Thousands attended the rodeos, horse races and concerts in Great Falls.
County fairs and rodeos, outdoor barbeques, and music festivals like Music on Main in Bozeman are happening all over Montana in the summer months. Long drives to lakes, floating down rivers, camping and hiking characterize summers in Big Sky Country.
I just returned from a backpacking trip myself and I'd love to hear about your summer! Where's your favorite summer spot in Montana? What summer community events are happening near you? Please share below:

North Korea
I am deeply troubled by President Trump’s bellicose rhetoric on North Korea:  it does absolutely nothing to calm tensions and I fear it is only making matters worse.  That said, North Korea’s nuclear weapons and the inter-continental ballistic missiles it has developed to deliver them present a grave danger, the greatest danger to world peace today. Nonetheless, this situation does NOT authorize unilateral military action.  If the President concludes an attack is necessary, both the Constitution (Article 1 Section 8) and the law (War Powers Act) clearly require him to come to the Congress for authorization BEFORE taking action. Military action absent such authorization and absent an immediate threat is illegal and unconstitutional. Instead of promising “fire and fury”, the President should be working with other countries to seek a diplomatic solution and to ensure that sanctions against North Korea are enforced. The President should also talk directly with Congress to keep us informed on any activity that may require our input. 
Net Neutrality
A number of readers have requested we offer a simple explanation of Net Neutrality for their own information and so they can share with friends.
Under current rules, internet service providers (e.g. AT&T, Comcast, Verizon FIOS, etc.) must treat all internet content the same. All content must be delivered at the same speed. There are no so-called “fast lanes” that providers can establish so they can charge more money. In simple terms, internet speeds are “neutral”. 
For the purposes of providing an example I will use some familiar company names – this is NOT intended to single them out, but merely to make the issue more understandable to less technologically oriented readers like myself.
Currently, Comcast must provide the same speed to both Amazon and Mike’s Blueberry Jam Company because the internet is “neutral”.
The current debate over net neutrality is about whether companies like Comcast will be allowed to negotiate the speed and price of their service amongst their users. 
If “net neutrality” is repealed then Amazon and Mike’s Blueberry Jam Company would negotiate with Comcast over how fast their content would be delivered including how much it would cost to deliver it. Since Amazon is so much larger than Mike’s Blueberry Jam Company, Amazon will likely be able to negotiate a much better deal – faster speed and lower price. Mike’s Blueberry Jam Company would then be at an even bigger competitive disadvantage than they are to begin with. The internet will no longer be “neutral”. So what’s the problem with this?
Small companies will be at a significant disadvantage. New products will never reach the market, and innovation and new websites will by stymied by huge entry costs. Over time, the internet will consist of only larger corporate entities.
Already, companies can pay for better placement in your internet searches – so when shopping for shoes most of the sites on the first page of the results have paid the search website for their placement. How many of you ever make it to page 25 to find a small retailer? Cost matters – placement matters – speed matters.
The internet service providers (ISPs) are already some of the more profitable companies in the world and they already know quite a bit about you. Remember, just a few months ago the same people arguing in favor of ending net neutrality also voted in favor of allowing ISPs to search and record all your internet information – from your age and credit card numbers to underwear and shoe size.
The internet was created from YOUR tax dollars. Internet innovation is the future. Faceless bureaucrats and greedy corporations shouldn’t be given so much control over it. Spread the word about why it’s so important to preserve net neutrality. 
Behind the Curtain – More House and Trump Administration Actions You Don’t Want to Miss
Here are this week’s additions. If you need to catch up or share with friends, you can find the full list here.
135.     According to an August 1, 2017 Washington Post report, Secretary of State Tillerson has directed State Department leaders to review and update the department’s mission statement as part of an overall internal review. The redrafted mission statement, which is not yet final, omits reference to promoting democracy abroad. The mission statement essentially sets forth the purposes of the United States foreign policy. The only major edit to the current mission statement is the removal of the phrase“. . .just, and democratic. . .” This is not simply a matter of wordsmithing or editing. The State Department is responsible for explaining to foreign governments, those who share our principles and those who do not, the way we see our role in the world. A change in its message could have ugly consequences: it could embolden tyrants and undermine supporters of human rights and the rule of law. 
136.     An August 7, 2017 news report highlights President Trump’s practice of establishing advisory committees to supplement federal agency work in areas ranging from environmental policy and transportation to voting laws. While this practice is permitted under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Trump Administration is not living up to the letter or spirit of that law. There are requirements to make certain information matters of public record, such as membership and meeting details, for example. Most of these commissions are also made up of non-government employees. For example, the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative, charged with employment creation, is being led by Andrew Liveris who is the Chairman of Dow Chemical. The Administration is rarely releasing required information and some of the commissions are already targets of lawsuits because of this lack of transparency. This disregard for the Federal Advisory Committee Act adds another layer to the secrecy pervading this presidency. These commissions are reviewing and proposing federal policy and their work should not be hidden from the public.
137.     According to an August 7, 2017 Wall Street Journal report, financial regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) have issued far fewer fines so far this year than during the same period last year. These entities regulate Wall Street and the financial industry. This decline in penalties issued to companies is in keeping with the Trump Administration’s prioritization of business interests over the average consumer.

August 11, 2017    
 
10849 E. Walking Stick Way
San Antonio, Texas 78205
 
Dear Lindsey:
 
I write to invite you to join me this Saturday, August 12 at 3 p.m. at Ella Austin Community Center, 1023 N. Pine St. for a discussion about health care and a number of other key concerns. I will be joined by concerned San Antonians and my colleague, Congressman Joaquin Castro, to discuss what has and has not been happening in Washington, to seek advice, and to answer questions that our neighbors may have. Please come by on Saturday and let me know what issues matter to you most. To RSVP for this event, please call (210) 704-1080 or email me lloyd.doggett@mail.house.gov, using the subject line “RSVP to August 12 Town Hall.” If you are unable to join, you can tune into my Facebook Live video of the event.
 
As you are aware, I have strongly opposed efforts to take away health insurance access. It is important to assure protection for people with pre-existing conditions; oppose insurers bringing back lifetime and annual caps on care; maintain essential health benefits, and protect Medicaid.  We must not make it even more difficult to obtain affordable coverage. I stand with almost every health care professional group and with families around our Nation in opposition to this terrible effort. Fortunately, with the determined voices of so many and by one vote in the Senate, efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act have been at least temporarily stopped.  
 
While health care will likely be a focus of our Saturday meeting, taxes are another key concern. The Koch Brothers have launched a multi-million dollar campaign to sell a tax package that will save them billions and leave a few crumbs for most other taxpayers. And with the uncertainties surrounding Trump’s daily tweets and diatribes, we will no doubt have plenty of other matters to discuss.
 
Listening to you helps me make your priorities my priorities. I hope to see you Saturday.
 

 

                                                                     Sincerely,
                                                                     Lloyd Doggett

Blaine's Bulletin
  

Not only are students preparing to head back to school but the hot, humid weather has cooled off some so Missourians can get outside and enjoy the last few weeks of summer. For me, the last few days have been great as I have continued my travels around Missouri’s 3rd District. I have made several stops and talked with countless people about all sorts of various topics that are important to them. 
Last week, I discussed in-depth the opioid abuse roundtables we held. I would like to highlight another roundtable I recently had on a topic that is getting more and more national attention each day: human trafficking. Human trafficking impacts every community in our country. In America, the National Human Trafficking hotline recorded more than 7,500 human trafficking cases in the United States in 2016. This is a 35.7 percent increase from 2015. The roundtable was held in Franklin County and individuals from the Jefferson County Health Department, the Jefferson County Sheriff, Dave Marshak, and members from Mercy Hospital in Jefferson County all participated in this important discussion about what we can do to combat this abuse. To date, the House of Representatives has passed 16 bills that will help victims, punish traffickers, prevent trafficking, and aid law enforcement.
After that roundtable, I headed to Festus High School to meet the young men and women who took first place at the International Paris Air Show. I cannot stress enough how much of a pleasure it was to talk with those students about their experience overseas and also to present them with a congratulatory statement that was printed in the Congressional Record discussing their accomplishments. These students have made made Missouri incredibly proud and I wish each of them the best of luck in their very bright futures.
On a similar note, I recently met and presented the Wentzville Civil Air Patrol with their own congratulatory statement that was also printed in the Congressional Record. The Civil Air Patrol is an all volunteer U.S. Air Force auxiliary and these young men and women support Missouri’s communities with emergency response, youth development, and promotion of air, space, and cyber power. These individuals are true community leaders and their commitment to the Civil Air Patrol deserves our appreciation and gratitude.
My visits, meetings, and roundtables around the 3rd District continue each day and I look forward to being in your community. Please make sure to check out my Facebook and Instagram pages for the latest updates and pictures about where I have been.

Dear Friends,
Sports Illustrated magazine called Harmon Killebrew  a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame  Idahos greatest athlete. But Killebrew was far more than a star on the field. He was a truly good and kind man who used his fame to support charitable efforts and make the world a better place.
In July I introduced a bill to name the Post Office in Killebrews hometown of Payette for Killebrew, who hit legendary tape-measure home runs during a 22-year career with the Washington Senators, Minnesota Twins and Kansas City Royals.
Idahoans take great pride in his success, which began in 1954 after Sen. Herman Welker, R-Idaho, tipped off Clark Griffith, owner of the Senators, about the 17-year-old slugger. Griffith sent a scout, who almost didnt get to see Killebrew play. After a night of rain, groundkeepers burned gasoline to make the field playable. Killebrew then did his part by hitting a ball 435 feet into a Payette beet field.
Immediately signed as a $12,000 bonus baby, Killebrew debuted a few weeks later. When he retired in 1975, hed hit 573 home runs, more than all but four major leaguers at the time  Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth, Willie Mays and Frank Robinson. His mammoth home runs included becoming the first of only four batters to hit a ball over the left-field roof at Detroits Tiger Stadium and a 530-foot shot at the Twins Metropolitan Stadium.
￼
(Photos courtesy of Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum)
Griffith likened Killebrew homers to a rocket ship going up in the air. Orioles manager Paul Richards said, Killebrew can knock the ball out of any park, including Yellowstone.
He was the American Leagues Most Valuable Player in 1969, hitting 49 home runs and batting in 140 runs. He played in 13 All-Star Games and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1984.
￼
Killebrew built his strength lifting 10-gallon milk cans on Idaho dairies and leveraged his work ethic into legendary status. For fans across America, Killebrew was beloved for remaining the down-to-earth farm kid who signed a Major League contract before turning 18. Twins teammate Rich Reese called him one of the classiest people Ive ever met in my lifehe treated people with respect, even with the stature he had.
Asked what he liked to do for fun, Killebrew once said, Well, I like to wash dishes, I guess. In the off-season, he worked feeding cows, selling mens clothing and reading gas meters. After retirement from baseball, he sold insurance, ran a car dealership and worked as a broadcaster.
In 1976, Killebrew helped found the Danny Thompson Memorial golf tournament in Sun Valley. Now called the Killebrew-Thompson Memorial, the event benefits cancer research. The Harmon Killebrew Foundation, founded in 1998 with his wife, Nita, has built more than a dozen Miracle League Fields designed for kids with disabilities, including one named for him in Payette. The baseball and football fields at Payette High School are named for Killebrew.
Killebrew died of cancer in 2011 at age 74 after entering into hospice care, a treatment he had advocated for years. At his memorial service, Nita Killebrew read a tribute from a fan: Harmon is an extraordinary, beautiful, loving, compassionate human being  who also happens to be a legendary baseball player.
In the days after his death, his high school team, the Payette Pirates, made an improbable run for a state championship. Entering the district tournament with a losing record, the Pirates won four straight to reach the state title game. The team wore HK patches on their sleeves.
Harmons been with us this entire time, said one player. The Pirates finally lost to a 25-1 Fruitland team, taking home the second-place trophy.
￼
Hes still touching people, said Nita Killebrew, who worked with my office on the bill and lives in Meridian.
Killebrews legacy of generosity lives on. Im excited to be working toward this well-deserved honor for a great Idahoan.
Thank you,

Dear Friend:
I'm fighting hard for Lower Hudson Valley communities by: 
	•	Advocating for Bipartisanship to Improve Health Care
	•	Securing a Local WWII Veteran's Overdue Service Medals
	•	Improving Access to STEM Education
	•	Helping a White Plains Resident Obtain His Pension 
Advocating for Bipartisanship to Improve Health Care After seven years of Republican promises to ""repeal and replace"" the ACA, they haven't managed to do it, even with control of the legislative and executive branches. The majority of people, who realize it's fundamentally good policy, have prevailed upon reasonable legislators... for now. It is my hope that both parties will now come together to improve health care for every American. To learn more about my thoughts on the need for bipartisanship in the health care debate, click here to read my new op-ed. 

Securing a Local WWII Veteran's Overdue Service Medals 
￼ 
Rep. Lowey presents New City resident and World War II Army veteran Alfred Magnatta with five overdue service medals.  
This week, I had the honor of presenting five overdue service medals to New City resident and World War II Army veteran Alfred Magnatta at a ceremony at my New City office. Mr. Magnatta enlisted in the U.S. Army, 8th Air Force and trained as an aerial gunner. He achieved the rank of Staff Sergeant and flew 25 missions in England between 1943 and 1945. I was able to secure Mr. Magnatta's service medals after his son contacted my office for assistance - and I am so glad that he did. It has been 74 years since Mr. Magnatta served in the Second World War, but the magnitude of his service is just as profound today as it was then. Our nation owes brave veterans like Mr. Magnatta an enormous debt of gratitude.
Improving Access to STEM Education I am pleased to announce that Mercy College, based in Dobbs Ferry, has secured $2.3 million in federal funding to provide financial and academic support that will empower and improve outcomes for underserved students. These students will gain the skills critical to achieving academic success and to obtaining the jobs of today and tomorrow. As Ranking Member on the House Appropriations Committee, I will continue fighting for increased education funding to ensure hardworking New Yorkers can access quality education and find high-paying jobs. 
Helping a White Plains Resident Obtain His Pension A White Plains constituent contacted our office because he needed an earnings statement from the Social Security Administration (SSA) in order to obtain his pension. However, he was told by SSA he would need to pay a fee, which he could not afford, in order to obtain the statement. I sent an inquiry to the White Plains SSA office asking for the fee to be waived. After being informed that the fee could not be waived and that SSA would not be able to set up a payment plan, I brought the case to SSA's New York Regional Office and was able to get the man's earnings statement free of charge. 
I take great pride in helping my constituents navigate federal agencies. If you are in need of assistance, please contact my White Plains District Office (914-428-1707), my New City District Office (845-639-3485), or my website for help: https://lowey.house.gov/contact.

8/11/17 11:22,When Packers And Vikings Fans Work Together," 
￼
 

August 11, 2017
 
Dear Friends,
Republicans, Democrats, Packers fans, Vikings fans, Liberals, Conservatives, Badgers and gophers... normally you wouldn't think that those groups always agree. But boy howdy, they all came together to support an incredible project: building the St. Croix River Crossing Bridge.
In 2012, I co-introduced legislation for the St. Croix River Crossing Bridge to be built because so many Wisconsinites told me how it would improve life for their families. (Click HERE to view my speech on the House floor about the need for a new bridge.)
In 1931, when the old Stillwater Lift Bridge was built, the Green Bay Packers only had three world championships... talk about time for an upgrade! The bridge had a horrible structural rating, and Wisconsinites and Minnesotans faced daunting commute times.
That's why, after five years since I first co-introduced the legislation for the new bridge, so many Wisconsinites and Minnesotans celebrated.
The St. Croix Crossing Bridge will be able to handle 70,000 crossings per day- more than four times its predecessor. And it connects the fastest growing county in Wisconsin with the 13th largest metropolitan area in the nation.
Thank you to everyone who helped make this bridge a reality!

BACK TO OUR ROOTS:
I recently Joined Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue on his “Back To Our Roots” RV tour throughout central Wisconsin, and we discussed an array of agricultural issues with Wisconsinites. We received feedback on everything from strengthening our rural broadband access to getting rid of job-killing red tape. Wisconsin's agricultural tradition is so important to our economy, our families, and our way of life, and I will continue to work my heart out to strengthen it.

Dear Friend,
Meeting with constituents really is one of the best parts of my job, which is why I'm so thankful to have spent the last week on the road traveling through the district to hear from Coloradans. I've included a photo from those events below, and will include more in the next update. Additionally, I wanted to mention a few legislative issues that the House addressed before I came back to Colorado. 
Town halls in Sterling and Burlington 
Thanks to everyone who came to chat with me at town halls in Sterling and Burlington. During each of these visits, I was happy to answer questions about issues ranging from immigration to the tax code. In Sterling, I also got the chance to talk about my efforts to provide rural Colorado with access to affordable water through the Water Act.
As a country, we have significant issues to tackle in the coming months. But getting the opportunity to talk with you, my constituents, has given me the spirit to go back to DC this fall and fight for the best policies for Colorado and the nation. As always, it is an honor to have the opportunity to better understand the thoughts and concerns of folks from all over our beautiful district.
￼
I met with constituents during an informal town hall at the Kit Carson County Fair, where we chatted about small-government solutions for critical issues such as healthcare and the federal budget.
 Protecting Consumers
The House passed a bill that ends the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) harmful anti-arbitration rule. H.J. Res. 111 allows consumers to negotiate with businesses rather than fight class-action legal battles, helping to reduce the burdens of protracted and expensive lawsuits. Usually, class-action victims only win 20% of cases and receive an average of just $32 for their efforts. Arbitration ensures that we really are “protecting the little guy” instead of simply enriching the pockets of trial lawyers who collect big winnings from class-action lawsuits.  
Supporting our Veterans
The House also passed two bills that continue to support the education and well-being of this nation’s veterans. The first bill, S. 114, extends the Choice Program, which allows veterans to find care from providers outside the VA system. By continuing to fund this program, we’re giving our veterans the ability to access quality care. 
The Colmery Act will similarly improve the benefits provided to our veterans. For over seven decades, the GI Bill has helped veterans get an education after their service. This bill will extend benefits given to military families, affording more varied educational opportunities. For the first time, future beneficiaries will be able to use these services throughout their lives, even years after their discharge.
We owe everything to those who have put their lives on the line for this country. These bills are just small steps in paying a large debt to those who have served.
Celebrating Entrepreneurship and Startups
For Startup Day Across America, I had the chance to visit Samples World Bistro, a start-up restaurant in Longmont, with my friend and colleague Rep. Jared Polis. While tasting their international cuisine, we learned all about the restaurant's efforts to support and employ the developmentally disabled members of their community, as well as the way federal policies impact their business. I will continue to fight for policies that promote start-ups in Colorado and allow small businesses to flourish around the country.
￼
I visited Samples World Bistro to learn about issues faced by entrepreneurs and small business owners across the country.

Federal-State Coordination Letter
I recently signed a letter with almost two dozen colleagues to President Trump about federal land and resource policies. This letter asks the President to issue an Executive Order and consider other potential policies that would allow federal, state, and local officials to coordinate more closely on these issues. Too often, federal agencies ignore the expertise and input of local government officials when implementing policies that impact our land and natural resources. We should instead require federal authorities to work with local officials and experts to steward our national resources in a way that benefits the common good.
Code Day
In the coming weeks, I’ll be hosting a Code Day for our district! This free event offers students the opportunity to learn how to build an app and compete in the Congressional App Challenge, a competition that encourages students across the country to create their own app. STEM-related technical skills will be critical in our increasingly digital and global world, which is why the App Challenge is so important. At Code Day, students will hear from me and computer science and programming experts. I encourage you to check out the event at 6:00 PM on August 29th at Altona Middle School in Longmont (4600 Clover Basin Dr., Longmont, CO 80503).Please RSVP to Andie Hall (andrea.hall@mail.house.gov) by August 15.

As always, for more frequent updates on legislation and events, please follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. I look forward to hearing from you; please do not hesitate to contact my Greeley, Castle Rock, or Washington office should you need any assistance. If you'd like to send me a message, you can do so on my website.

8/11/17 11:06,Beyond resistance: Protecting our public lands,"Update | Friday, August 11, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 14th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: protecting our public lands.
America’s public lands are national treasures, and we all share responsibility for their conservation. Millions of acres have been set aside to protect cultural resources, wildlife habitat, water quality, outdoor recreation opportunities, and more. These public lands – mountains, rivers, forests, deserts, and cultural sites – belong to all Americans and should be preserved for the use and enjoyment of future generations.
From defending our National Monuments to supporting the Land and Water Conservation Fund to advocating for more Wild and Scenic Rivers and other conservation designations, I am working to protect special and wild places. Our public lands should be kept in public hands, and Congress should expand designations to protect wildlife habitat, water quality, outdoor recreation, and cultural resources. 
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

8/10/17 19:58,"Negotiate, Not Escalate"," 
￼ 
 

Dear Friend, 
President Trump’s escalating war of words with North Korea is alarming.
Provocation and warmongering won’t solve this crisis – it will only back the United States and our allies into a corner.  
Let me be clear: we must de-escalate tensions and pursue diplomacy. Our first priority must be avoiding a military confrontation and bringing the North Korean regime to the negotiating table. 
I went to the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) just a few months ago to meet with our security personnel serving there. The experts there confirmed my longstanding belief that this volatile situation can only be resolved through diplomacy.
In the meantime, Congress needs to reassert our constitutional responsibility to debate matters of war. President Trump does not have the authority to launch a pre-emptive strike on North Korea without congressional authorization -- we must be the first line of defense to prevent this crisis from spiraling out of control. 
Today, I joined Congressman John Conyers and 60 Democratic colleagues in Congress in sending a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urging the Administration to exercise restraint in its rhetoric and dealings with North Korea.
And I’m urging Speaker Ryan to hold a vote on H.R. 669, Restricting the First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act, which would prohibit the President from unilaterally launching a first strike without authorization from Congress.
There is no military solution to this crisis. Instead of saber-rattling, we should be pursuing direct talks with North Korea to prevent an avoidable catastrophe. 
As always, please don’t hesitate to email me, connect on facebook or twitter, or call my office at (510) 763-0370 to let me know your thoughts.
Take care,
￼

HEALTH CARE, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND OPPORTUNITY
Senator Mitch McConnell said it best: “It’s time to move on.” Republicans have tried to ram through any version of Trumpcare they could come up with, all of which would kick millions off their health insurance in an effort to cut taxes for the wealthy.  

While the Affordable Care Act might not be perfect, it has made tremendous progress for millions of Americans and Coloradans. I’ve always been open to improving the ACA, but I will oppose any effort to roll back the progress we’ve made. It is past time Republicans worked with Democrats to find solutions to the ACA instead of trying to dismantle it. 

One area where Democrats and Republicans can work together with the Trump Administration is on infrastructure. Investing in roads, bridges, transit, water projects, broadband and the electrical grid will create good-paying jobs now and help continue economic growth in our communities. I’m ready to work with Republicans and Democrats to pass an infrastructure package and I hope Congress takes this issue up quickly this fall.

8/10/17 17:47,Michigan Brief: Great Lakes Restoration Successes,"￼
Make sure to follow Debbie on ￼ Facebook and ￼Twitter! 
Senator Stabenow Highlights Great Lakes Restoration Success Stories across Michigan
This month, Senator Stabenow is highlighting Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) success stories throughout Michigan and the importance of federal funding to protect our lakes and waterways. Stabenow authored the GLRI in 2010 and is leading the bipartisan effort to stop proposals to eliminate funding for the Initiative next year.
￼
“One in five Michigan jobs are tied to water. It is more important than ever to continue investing in the health of our Great Lakes and waterways,” said Stabenow, who is Co-Chair of the bipartisan Senate Great Lakes Task Force. “These successful projects are excellent examples of how Great Lakes funding is helping more Michigan families and visitors enjoy fishing, boating, kayaking, and canoeing.”
She joined the Alliance of Rouge Communities, the City of Wayne, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the Rouge River to see the completed Wayne Road Dam Removal and Habitat Improvement Project. The project, which was completed in 2013 and received over $1 million in GLRI funding through NOAA, reconnected approximately 121 miles of river and tributaries to the Great Lakes system for the first time in over a century. “Habitat restoration creates a big return on investment,” said Julie Sims, Great Lakes Regional Coordinator, NOAA Restoration Center. “It’s more than just better fishing—restoration projects can improve local property values, aid in flood control, improve access for recreation, and add jobs to the economy.”  Read more about the Wayne Road Dam restoration
￼
Stabenow joined Bill Rose, the President and CEO of the Kalamazoo Nature Center, Jamie McCarthy, the Watershed Coordinator for the Kalamazoo River Watershed Council, and Tim Suprise, the founder and CEO of Arcadia Ales, to highlight the completion of the Kalamazoo Fen Restoration. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative provided $196,000 in federal funding to the Kalamazoo Nature Center to restore wetlands and prevent erosion and runoff into the Kalamazoo River. The GLRI funding has led to increased economic activity in the area, giving more people the opportunity to enjoy paddle boarding, kayaking, canoeing, and boating on the river.
“With GLRI funding, we are able to protect and restore wetlands of the Great Lakes which benefit all of us through maintaining good water quality, reducing impacts from flooding, controlling invasive species, and enhancing habitat for many rare plants and animals,” said Rose. “Work to clean up contaminated sediments from the Kalamazoo River and restore fish and wildlife habitat has been ongoing for more than two decades,” said McCarthy. “The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has been a powerful accelerator for that work.”
 ￼
""A clean and sustainable system for maintaining a healthy fresh water supply is critical not only for economic vitality in the Great Lakes, but for the continued wellness of our communities,” said Suprise, who opened a riverfront brewery, pub, and beer garden on the downtown Kalamazoo riverfront in 2014.  Read more about the Kalamazoo Fen restoration

Click here to open a plain text version of this email 
￼

 
August 10, 2017


North Korea poses one of the greatest threats to international security. That’s why the response from the Trump Administration is so dangerous. Threatening nuclear war, as the President and some in his circle have done, dramatically increases the likelihood of miscalculation, sows fear and confusion among our partners and allies, and damages our credibility. Hot rhetoric from a U.S. President is exactly what the North Korean leader wants – it elevates his stature on the world stage.  
We need to work quickly to ramp up pressure on the North Korean regime through tough economic sanctions that drive North Korea to the nuclear negotiating table. The latest round of UN sanctions on North Korea are an important step forward, but it's critical that we distinguish between what’s written in a UN resolution and what actually gets enforced. Time and time again we've seen the failure of China and some other nations to enforce these UN sanctions on their banks and businesses. That failure has allowed the North Korean economy to grow and escape the pressure needed to bring them to the negotiating table for meaningful talks. 
The Congress recently passed one round of sanctions against North Korea. But we must do more to address the loopholes in our current sanctions regime. That’s why I’ve introduced another round of sanctions with Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. Our bipartisan bill – the BRINK Act – is modeled after the successful Iran sanctions laws that brought Iran to the negotiating table to end its nuclear weapons program. It would ratchet up the enforcement of sanctions, turning off the spigot of money being funneled into North Korea from some in the international community, including Chinese banks. It gives international banks and businesses only two options: stop funding Kim Jong Un’s dangerous behavior or get cut off from the U.S. financial system.
I believe these additional measures, as a part of a broader financial pressure campaign and paired with rigorous diplomacy, are our best chance of peacefully resolving the North Korean nuclear threat. That is why I’m urging Congress to pass additional sanctions – and calling on the President to follow the advice of Teddy Roosevelt: speak softly, and carry a big stick.

Finding Cures for Childhood Cancer
No childhood should be interrupted by a struggle for survival, but cancer tragically puts far too many kids in Maryland and across the country in a battle for their lives. That’s why earlier this year, I introduced a bipartisan bill to support the development of innovative and promising cancer drugs for children. And I’m pleased to announce that this legislation has passed both the House and Senate and is headed to the President’s desk to be signed into law. The Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity (RACE) for Children Act will modernize drug development regulations to help build on the progress being made at institutions like the National Institutes of Health. This is an important step to increase treatment options for kids with cancer. But our job won’t be done until we save every child – and their families – from the misery of this horrific disease.
 

Protecting Funding for Fighting Crime in Baltimore
Cities like Baltimore rely on the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for a wide range of support to combat violent crime, and I’m working hard on the Senate Appropriations Committee to ensure our state gets the funding it needs on this critical issue. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently threatened to withhold funding for Baltimore City police if the city doesn’t enforce the Trump Administration’s immigration enforcement orders that Maryland’s Attorney General, Brian Frosh, says could be unconstitutional. This is a gross abuse of power on the part of Attorney General Sessions, and I’ve joined with Baltimore’s Congressional delegation to strongly oppose it. Making the threat even more outrageous, it appears that Sessions overlooked the important fact that the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services – not the Baltimore City Police Department – technically enforces immigration orders. Therefore, Sessions is demanding that Baltimore Police Chief Kevin Davis and the Baltimore City Police take actions that are outside of their control.
Rather than threatening Baltimore and other cities, the Justice Department should be doing what it can to support efforts to reduce violent crime. As we await a response from the DOJ, we remain committed to helping Baltimore City secure needed resources in its effort to fight violent crime and strengthen community policing.

8/10/17 17:17,An update from Congressman Chris Collins,"￼ 
Dear Friend,
Here is a quick update on what I have been working on during a busy few weeks in Washington D.C. and Western New York.

￼ 

Collins Introduces Second Amendment Guarantee Act (SAGA)
I was proud to stand with the law abiding gun owners of Western New York and unveil my legislation known as the Second Amendment Guarantee Act (SAGA). By preventing states from implementing any regulation on rifles or shotguns that are more restrictive than what is required by federal law, SAGA will overturn key parts of Governor Cuomo’s so-called SAFE Act at the federal level. When Governor Cuomo signed the NY SAFE Act, he turned his back on the sportsmen and sportswomen of Western New York and unjustly took away our Second Amendment rights. Under my legislation, our Second Amendment rights will no longer be up for interpretation.

Collins Cosponsors Border Security for America Act
I was proud to cosponsor the Border Security for America Act, legislation that enhances  law enforcement at our borders and provides resources to improve security at U.S. ports of entry. The Border Security for America Act authorizes $5 billion over four years to carry out staffing increases and infrastructure improvements. In addition, I was able to work with House Homeland Security Committee Chairman McCaul to ensure U.S. and Canadian citizens are exempted from DHS’ biometric exit-entry initiative. Our northern border is one of Western New York’s strongest economic assets and this measure will ensure products can be transported across safely and efficiently without causing disruptions to American and Canadian citizens.

Collins and Pascrell’s Firefighter Cancer Registry Bill Passes Full Committee
On July 28th, the bill I authored with Congressman Pascrell, the Firefighter Cancer Registry Act, passed the full House Energy and Commerce Committee. This piece of legislation addresses an enormous gap in research conducted on the heath impacts of a career of firefighting. An increase in research can lead to methods that save the lives of the courageous men and women that keep our communities safe, and I look forward to getting this bill passed on the House floor.

￼ 

Stood with Western New York's Sportsmen & Sportswomen to Unveil SAGA
￼ 
As your Representative in Washington I swore an oath to protect our constitutional freedoms, which is why I was proud to unveil SAGA and move us one step closer to ending Governor Cuomo’s egregious anti-Second Amendment law. I traveled to the Rochester Brooks Gun Club and the Hamburg Rod & Gun Club to unveil my legislation, known as the Second Amendment Guarantee Act (SAGA), which will make key parts of Governor Cuomo’s SAFE Act illegal. Click here to view pictures from the two events.

To learn more about why I introduced SAGA and how it will repeal Cuomo's SAFE Act at the federal level, check out my Buffalo News Op-Ed from 8/2/17.
Met with Customs & Border Patrol Officers at the Peace Bridge to Discuss the Border Security for America Act
￼ 
Western New Yorkers and our economy rely heavily on the timely movement between Canada and the United States via the Peace Bridge. While keeping our communities safe is my number one priority, its also important that products can be transported across safely and efficiently without causing disruptions to American and Canadian citizens. I met with Customs & Border Patrol officers to discuss my cosponsored legislation, known as the Border Security for America Act, which will address my concerns, improve security at U.S. ports of entry, and enhance our efforts to target illegal immigration.
￼ 
I was able to work with the House Homeland Security Committee to ensure language was included to exempt U.S. and Canadian citizens from DHS’ biometric exit-entry initiative. In addition, this bill authorizes a border wall, adds 5,000 more Border Patrol Agents and CBP officers, targets visa overstays, and provides additional funding for law enforcement to combat drug trafficking. Our southern and northern borders have different security issues and thanks to House Homeland Security Committee Chairman McCaul, they were all taken into consideration when drafting this critically important legislation.
Joined President Trump for his New York Visit on Illegal Immigration
￼ 
We've been working hard in Congress to support President Trump's ""Make America Safe Again"" agenda. After the House voted to fund President Trump's border wall, he traveled to New York to continue his crackdown on illegal immigration and brutal transnational gangs like MS-13. The safety and security of the American people is of the utmost priority for this Administration and it was an honor to join President Trump on this important trip.

I toured one of NY-27's great farms, CY Farms, and met with members of the New York Farm Bureau to discuss how the federal government can do more to address the specific needs of New York's farmers and agri-business leaders. As Western New York residents, we're fortunate to have a strong agriculture industry in proximity to many of our nation's largest markets. The NY Farm Bureau recognizes that a viable agricultural industry is not only beneficial to New York's farm and food industry, but to our region's economy, local communities, and consumers as well. I appreciate their valuable insight and I look forward to continue supporting NY-27's largest industry in Washington.

Met the Conley Family & their Wonderful Dog, Cody
￼ 
Meet Cody. Cody is a 10-year-old golden retriever from Lake View. Cody has cancer and has only a few months left to live. Fortunately, his family is making the best of it, fulfilling a bucket list for the family including eating a pound of bacon, standing on the 50-yard line at New Era Field, taking a family trip to Niagara Falls and more. I want to thank the Conley family for introducing me to Cody and sharing their story. Families love their pets and clearly the Conley family loves Cody. 
Toured the Genesee County Airport with Local Officials
￼ 
I toured the Genesee County Airport with local officials and met with airport administrators to discuss how they intend to utilize their recent Department of Transportation (DOT) award. More than $17 million in federal funding has been invested in the Genesee County Airport over the last seventeen years, and I saw firsthand the integral role that funding has played in improving operations, renovating airport infrastructure, and enhancing air-traffic control systems.
￼ 
After my tour, I stopped by the Airport's Aviation Adventure Camp to meet the next generation of aviators. The Aviation Adventure Camp is a great opportunity for young men and women to get hands-on pilot experience from local aviation experts. It's great to see people interested in the aviation industry and the Genesee County Airport thriving. The investments made over the last seventeen years have certainly paid off, and now the Airport is sending a message to businesses and industries throughout the nation—Genesee County is open for business.
NY-27 FEMA Grant Workshop with Local First Responders
Each year, FEMA's Assistance to Firefighter Grant (AFG) program helps our local first responders access the tools and resources they need to keep their members and fellow neighbors safe. Given the competitiveness of the AFG program, my office hosted two informational workshops with FEMA fire-program specialists so all NY-27 applicants will be able to navigate the application process with ease.
￼ 
Thanks to FEMA, NY-27 first responders were briefed on the new and existing policies, guidelines, and requirements for this year’s AFG program. I want to thank the members of the Clarence Center Volunteer Fire Company and the East Avon Fire Department for hosting this year's workshops. I look forward to working with our local first responders to ensure they have the equipment, training, and resources they need to keep themselves and our communities safe.
Stopped by the Walmart Training Academy in Batavia
Earlier this week I visited the Walmart Training Academy in Batavia, where supervisors and department managers develop core retail skills and department-specific knowledge. This $2.7 billion initiative provides Walmart associates with greater training and an opportunity to improve their career growth, education, and wages.
￼ 
￼ 
By the end of 2017, more than 250,000 associates are expected to graduate from nearly 200 Walmart academy programs throughout the nation. I had a great time meeting the trainees here in NY-27 and wish them all the best of luck in their future careers.  You can also learn more information about the academies by visiting here.
Met with NYS School Board Association Members
￼ 
I always enjoy catching up with members of the NYS School Board Association. We met in my Lancaster District Office to discuss their work  and policy initiatives at the federal level that would help improve the quality of education in New York State. 

Capitol Hill Visitors
￼ 
I had a chance to meet Western New Yorkers from ""Christians United for Israel""--the largest pro-Israel grassroots organization in the nation. I'm glad they stopped in to say hello before their annual Washington Summit. 

￼ 
￼ 
Boy Scout Troops 6069 (Batavia) and 591 (Orchard Park) stopped by my office in Washington, D.C. before their Capitol tour. 

￼ 
I met with representatives from NY Ducks Unlimited to discuss the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GRLI) and how the programs will impact wildlife, their habitats, and the hunting and fishing economy.

News from Representative Gary Palmer
￼
Dear Friend,  The August work period is upon us and I am happy to be back home meeting with constituents all across the Sixth District. I am hosting two town halls next week in Calera and Hueytown, and I would like to invite you to join in on the conversation at one of them. To find out more details click here.
Town halls should be a great forum for polite, respectful discussion on the issues facing Congress that affect all of us.  I hope you’re able to attend, but if you cannot, the entirety of both town halls will be streamed live on my Facebook page.
Last week I enjoyed touring Hoover Toyota. While there I had the opportunity to speak with some of their 150 employees and learn more about the economic impact the automotive industry has in our district.   I also spoke with the National Restaurant Association at their roundtable and with the Shelby County City Clerks at their luncheon. 
Every year I have the honor and privilege of nominating outstanding students from the Sixth District of Alabama for an appointment to our nation’s service academies. I am pleased to announce the 14 students from Alabama’s Sixth District who received a nomination and accepted an offer from a U.S. Service Academy. Please join me in congratulating these outstanding individuals and their families as they embark to learn at the highest levels and serve America in extraordinary ways. See the full list of students who received appointments here.
In July the House Budget Committee passed a budget that is far from perfect, but it begins to address the nation’s financial crisis. I voted in favor of advancing the budget for a few reasons. According to GAO, the government made more than $140 billion in improper payments in 2016 alone. With this budget, we will save over $700 billion through common sense efforts to reduce improper payments. The budget provides the Department of Defense robust funding to be used for troop training, equipment, and improved readiness in the wake of unprecedented national security threats. The Department of Homeland Security will also be fully funded allowing us to protect our borders and keep America safe from outside threats. While there are more steps and additions necessary to improve this budget and our country’s fiscal health, we have taken the first step to building a better America and a better economy for future generations.
I would also like to thank the six wonderful interns who served our great district this summer in my Washington, DC office. Many of you were able to interact with these fine, young people either over the phone or on a Capitol tour. If you or someone you know is interested in applying for a congressional internship, more information can be found here.
Once again, I look forward to seeing you over the month of August and hope to see you at one of the town halls next week!   Thanks for reading, Gary Palmer

Dear Friends,
The House of Representatives is not meeting in Washington until after Labor Day, which allows members to return home to work in our districts. I am glad to be home for the month of August, working for and talking to the people I have the honor of representing. With that in mind, I wanted to take the time to share what I have been doing to improve the lives of all my constituents as we were wrapping up our summer session in Washington.
Proposing Solutions to Improve our Nation’s Health Care System
As the debate over our nation’s health care system continues, it is clear that the only way to fix the problems we all face is for Democrats and Republicans to work together. As a member of the Problem Solvers Caucus – a bipartisan group of House members focused on finding a path forward for responsible governance – I have been part of our group’s effort to promote bipartisan solutions for our country’s health care system. This week we announced our proposal to help improve the health care system in America. The proposal focuses on stabilizing the individual health care market and states the importance of improving patient choice and responsibility, creating incentives for providers to lower costs, and giving states more flexibility in implementing health care policy. Our suggestions center on areas of common ground where members of Congress from both sides of the aisle have shown they are willing to work to help give individuals, families, and businesses access to high-quality, affordable health care. It is my hope that the Problem Solvers’ proposal will serve as the beginning of a serious, bipartisan effort in Congress to fix the problems with our health care system.
Introducing Legislation Supporting Employment Training for SNAP Recipients
Last week, I introduced the Results Through Innovation Act of 2017 (H.R. 3577) into the House of Representatives, which would help bolster federal funding for employment and training (E&T) programs for individuals receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). SNAP E&T programs – such as those at the Fresno Bridge Academy – aim at helping SNAP recipients secure gainful employment through work-related education, job training, and job advancement classes so they can ultimately become self-sufficient. HR 3577 would establish a competitive grant program to provide funds to States to carry out targeted employment and training projects. The bill outlines that programs awarded these funds should increase the short-term and long-term employment as well as income earnings for households receiving SNAP benefits, support a range of rural and urban areas, and provide support services to individuals to help enable them to participate in the program, such as transportation reimbursement and childcare. We have seen these innovative practices work in the past, and my bill would help build on this success, helping millions of Americans lift themselves out of poverty and become self-reliant, all while saving taxpayers money.
Working to End Sexual Assault
Sexual assault is a crime that is often overlooked in our society today and is far too common, especially among our nation’s young people. As a member of the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence, I have been working to shed light on this issue and find ways to both prevent sexual assault and protect victims. The Task Force recently sent a letter to Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, and acting Assistant Secretary for the Office of Civil Rights, Candice Jackson, urging them to keep public the list of colleges and universities under investigations for possible federal law violations over their handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints. This list has been available to the public through the Office of Civil Rights since May 2014, and the transparency it provides both allows parents and students to make informed decisions about where to attend school and helps communities understand the scope of the sexual assault problem facing them in their own schools.
Fighting for Affordable Housing
Access to affordable, quality housing is a cornerstone of the American dream. In pursuit of that dream, public housing provides critical support for low-income seniors, children, individuals with disabilities, and working families. President Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2018 (FY18) would cut funding for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) by an astounding $1.8 billion, or 68%, and is deeply concerning. These cuts would have a disproportionately negative impact on low-income Americans and would expose many to increased health risks associated with aging home infrastructure. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, of which I am a member, sent a letter to HUD Secretary Ben Carson opposing these cuts and advocating for stronger local partnerships with HUD to preserve and improve public housing for years to come. When proper investments are made, local housing agencies – like those in Fresno – have demonstrated great ability in improving the health and lives of their residents.
Thank you for taking the time to read this newsletter update. As always, please do not hesitate to contact me regarding any federal issues of your concern. To stay up-to-date on the work I am doing in Congress, please visit my website at costa.house.gov and sign up for my e-newsletter here.

Dear Friend,         Arizonans want and deserve a federal government that is efficiently working in their best interest. Far too often partisanship gets in the way of progress and getting things done for Arizona. This year, we’ve worked to address what is wrong in Washington and to make positive changes that increase accountability and improve the lives of Arizona families, seniors, and veterans.          Arizonans agree that Washington spends too much time fighting and finger pointing and too little time getting things done. In recent years, Americans watched Congress fail to pass budgets or formulate long-term solutions that address our national debt and grow our economy. Congress needs greater accountability and pressure to do its job. The NOPE Act, legislation we introduced with Arizona Congressman Tom O’Halleran, withholds congressional salaries until a budget is passed. We also introduced the No Raise for Congress Act to eliminate automatic pay raises for members of Congress. Arizonans work hard every day to do their jobs and get ahead — they know they won’t get a paycheck or earn a raise if they don’t get the job done. The same should be true for members of Congress.          Arizonans expect leaders who will put partisanship aside to solve the challenges facing our state and our nation. Our team works hard every single day to get things done for Arizona, and we’ll work with anyone who has a good idea to find solutions and solve problems. We have made progress bringing accountability to the VA, cutting red tape for Arizona small business, and creating opportunity for Arizona families. There is always more work to be done. We will continue working with members of both parties to bring an end to partisan gridlock and ensure elected officials in Washington are working for the benefit of Arizona families, seniors, and veterans.          We are honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Arizona families like yours. We always appreciate hearing from you on current topics and issues that are important to you. If there is an issue that concerns you, please let us know by clicking this link or by calling our Phoenix office: 602-956-2285. Be sure to stay connected through our Facebook and Twitter accounts, and let us know how we can be of service.

Dear Friends,
Last week I had the honor of welcoming my good friend and fellow West Texan, Congressman Mac Thornberry, to Dyess Air Force Base. Mac serves as Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and happens to be the first Texan to do so.  
His committee has jurisdiction over Defense policy, ongoing military operations and national security functions at the Department of Defense as well as other related agencies. 

Together, we met with base leadership and airmen to gain a better understanding of the mission at Dyess and hear their thoughts on readiness, deployment length, and training so we can ensure our servicemen and women have all they need to keep America safe, strong, and free.
It was a big day for West Texas and a victory for Abilene and Dyess. With opportunities to visit bases and military facilities all around the world, the Chairman has tremendous demands on his schedule; we are very proud he chose to spend his time with us.
You can watch a short video clip on the importance of Dyess here.

To learn more about our visit, I encourage you to watch this piece by KTAB and read this story in the Abilene Reporter News.
Your friend and fellow West Texan,

Dear Lindsey,
          Its always great to see Montanans in Washington, D.C. We need to make Washington, D.C. more like Montana  and that starts by having folks like Ervin Schlemmer testify.
          Recently, I had the honor of introducing Ervin Schlemmer from Joliet before the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture. Ervin and his wife, Julie, came to D.C. at our request so that Ervin could testify before the Ag Committee on commodities, credit and crop insurance and the 2018 Farm Bill.
￼
Click HERE to watch.
          Ervin is a third-generation farmer and partners with his son Greg to run his operation. Together, they produce sugarbeets, malt barley, alfalfa hay and corn, as well as operate a 20,000-head cattle feed yard. It was great to hear from Ervin and the other witnesses who have expertise in farming and ranching.
          As we begin consideration of the 2018 Farm Bill, it is critical that we hear from folks like Ervin about how programs and regulations made in D.C. impact real farmers and ranchers in places like Joliet, Montana. It was a privilege to welcome Ervin and Julie to Washington, and I look forward to hearing from more Montanans about the upcoming Farm Bill.
Tell me what you think:
What do you want to see in the 2018 Farm Bill?

Dear Friend,   We cannot permit the North Korean regime to have the ability to threaten our country with a nuclear weapon. The United States must work with China and our South Korean and Japanese allies to make clear to Kim Jong-Un that there will be consequences if he continues down this path. This is not a time for escalating rhetoric that threatens to bring the world to the brink of war. It is critical that the Trump administration work carefully, and in close consultation with Congress, to craft a diplomatic solution that results in North Korea giving up their missile program and nuclear weapons for good.   A Better Deal Town Hall in Cumberland August 16th   I am hosting a Town Hall on Wednesday, August 16th at 6:30pm at the Boys & Girls Clubs of Cumberland-Lincoln, located at 1 James McKee way, Cumberland, to provide an opportunity for residents of the First Congressional District of Rhode Island to gather together and discuss the new Democratic economic agenda to create good-paying jobs, raise wages and secure a better future. The American people want Congress to take bold action on these issues, but for over six months, President Trump and Congressional Republicans have failed to pass a single major piece of legislation that creates jobs, lowers the cost of prescriptions drugs or tackles any of the serious issues facing the American people. More information about this Town Hall is available here.   The Town Hall is free and open to the public. To RSVP, email Annie Pease at Annie.Pease@mail.house.gov or call 401-729-5600. 
￼
$26 Million for RI Hospitals   I am glad that hospitals across Rhode Island will receive approximately $26 million in additional Medicare payments following the renewal of a “wage index” adjustment by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). I am committed to seeking to improve patients’ access to quality health care at hospitals while protecting a major source of jobs in Rhode Island, and this announcement is a big win for Rhode Island. It will allow hospitals to continue providing quality, affordable health care, and keep providers competitive in our state.   Senior Resources Fairs   I am proud to announce that I will be hosting two Senior Resources Fairs in the coming months. The first will be September 19th from 5-7PM at the East Providence Senior Center, and the second will be October 19th from 5-7PM at the Woonsocket Senior Center. I invite you and your family to join me at either, or both.   Seniors, adults with disabilities, and caregivers from the First Congressional District are all invited to learn about important resources available from the Rhode Island Division of Elderly Affairs, the Social Security Administration, Rhode Island Housing, and more than forty other participating organizations. Full details are below.    For more information, please feel free to contact my District Office at 729-5600 or email Rita.Murphy@mail.house.gov.   Senior Resources Fair in East Providence   Tuesday, September 19th  5:00-7:00 PM   East Providence Senior Center 610 Waterman Avenue East Providence, RI 02914   Senior Resources Fair in Woonsocket   Thursday, October 19th  5:00-7:00 PM   Woonsocket Senior Center 84 Social Street Woonsocket, RI 02895   Meals on Wheels
￼
Meals on Wheels serves over 1,200 Rhode Island seniors every day, and more than 2,500 seniors every year. These seniors rely on this assistance to get the nutrition they need and to continue being able to live on their own. I was incredibly proud to be able to participate in a Meals on Wheels food delivery to Beatrice Jardin in Smithfield on Wednesday. Ms. Jardin is an incredible 99 year-old woman, a big supporter of the Boston Red Sox, who was so grateful to Meals on Wheels for its incredible work. When I return to Washington to continue to fight against the President’s budget proposal, which slashes support for Meals on Wheels, I’m going to be thinking about Ms. Jardin and the thousands of RI seniors who get assistance from this great organization.   International Union of Operating Engineers   This week, I had the opportunity to address the International Union of Operating Engineers Annual Conference in Newport. I want to thank Jim White for his outstanding leadership of Local 57, Rhode Island’s own chapter of the Operating Engineers, and for organizing this great event. It is also my sincere privilege to be able to welcome James Callahan, the General President of the International Operating Engineers, to Rhode Island and to thank him for his incredible commitment to this great union and its more than 400,000 members. The men and women of our nation’s unions helped to build this country’s middle class, and all Americans owe them a debt of gratitude for fighting to secure the rights that are fundamental to millions of Americans.   The strength of this Union and of unions across the country gives me real confidence that no matter who is in the White House or how millions of dollars are spent to advance the interests of powerful corporations that the real power in this country will always be in the hands of working people. Together, I know we can build a better future that is defined by better jobs and better wages.   President Trump’s Task Forces’ Secret Meetings and Conflicts of Interest   I am alarmed about the lack of transparency, accountability, and independence of President Trump’s Regulatory Reform Task Forces. The interests of the American public must be paramount when reviewing the worthiness of regulations, and these Task Forces must have an effective and transparent guard against conflicts of interest, especially those in which industry lobbyists seek to overturn environmental and health protections for financial gain.   It appears that the current Task Forces are already failing on this front, and instead are actively hiding their members and their meetings from public view. That’s why I, along with Reps. Elijah E. Cummings, John Conyers, Jr. and Gerry Connolly wrote to Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney and Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs Administrator Neomi Rao expressing grave concerns about the secrecy of the Regulatory Reform Task Forces and requesting information about the nature of their meetings.   As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns, please call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov. You can also click here to follow my work on Twitter.     Warm Regards, ￼  David Cicilline Member of Congress

Dear Friend,  Recently, I had the opportunity to spend an afternoon at Frank Wagner Elementary, handing out lunches to kids as part of their U.S. Department of Agriculture-sponsored Summer Meals Program. More than 485,000 children in Washington rely on free and reduced price lunch during the school year, yet only 46,000 receive help during the summer – that’s fewer than 10 percent of the kids who qualify during the school year.
￼
No child should be forced to skip a meal or go to bed hungry simply because it’s summer. While school breaks for the summer, a child’s need for nutritious food does not. Our children are the future of our country and we should work to provide them with the basic foundations for success no matter the time of year.  Unfortunately, the President’s budget proposes cutting critical food and nutrition programs like Summer Meals. I’ve seen firsthand how important these programs are to children and families in our local communities, and as a member of the House Budget Committee, I’ll continue fighting to ensure our kids receive the nutritious meals they need if they are to grow and thrive.  As always, my office is here to serve you. If you have questions or comments about the topics that matter most to you, I encourage you to contact me through my website. You may also keep up-to-date on what I’m doing by following me on social media. If you need assistance dealing with a federal agency, such as the VA, IRS or Social Security Administration, please do not hesitate to contact my Bothell office at (425) 485-0085.  Sincerely, ￼  Suzan

8/10/17 11:09,Beyond resistance: Putting a price on carbon emissions,"Update | Thursday, August 10, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 13th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: putting a price on carbon emissions.
As a nation, and as a world, we are far too reliant on burning fossil fuels for energy. Consuming this wasteful, expensive energy source degrades our environment and creates harmful greenhouse gas emissions. The scientific evidence and consensus behind the impact of these emissions is clear – climate change is bringing record temperatures, erratic and dangerous weather patterns, social disruption, and more severe ocean acidification, drought, disease, and wildfires.
We have a moral responsibility to reverse this trend and drastically limit the carbon pollution from our energy sector. It’s past time for the federal government to put a price on carbon emissions. A carbon tax is a starting point to reduce emissions and support a more rapid transition to a clean energy future in a straightforward, cost-effective manner.
That’s why I’ve introduced legislation that would impose a fee on America’s biggest polluters. Making sure that fossil fuel companies pay their fair share helps level the playing field by pricing dirty energy accurately – so clean energy can better compete. To ensure that the American people aren’t hurt by this price on carbon, part of the fee would be returned to the public every year as a refundable tax credit. Additional funds would be used to help vulnerable communities who might be impacted by higher heating and electricity bills. Another portion of the revenue would be used to help us avoid the looming Social Security crisis. When paired with investments in public transit, affordable housing, and clean energy jobs, particularly in those communities most impacted by climate change, this bill can kick-start much-needed climate action.
A carbon tax could generate trillions of dollars, replacing expensive and often conflicting energy subsidies. We could reduce the threat of climate change while making the tax system simpler and fairer.
This is a non-partisan, non-ideological, widely-supported and critical step forward. Instead of debating policies of division and denial, it’s time for us to come together and support a carbon tax that can solve multiple problems and meet our obligations to future generations.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

Thursday, August 10, 2017
WEBSITE | FORWARD TO A FRIEND | SHARE ON: 
￼
￼

 
 

Friend,

Did you know Ohio ranks fifth in the nation in human trafficking cases? Last year, 375 Ohio trafficking cases were reported from 1,352 calls to the national hotline, according to Polaris, a non-profit organization tracking trafficking in America and across the world.  

We’re taking action. Here in the House, we’ve passed 15 bills to fight human trafficking and advance a range of reforms to how our country combats child abuse and exploitation. Get the details here. 

Today, our nation faces a myriad of challenges, many of which divide our country strictly along party lines. This issue is different. Washington can agree. We the people can agree. No human being should ever have to experience such heinous exploitation. We must stand and act – and we must do it together.

Yours in service,
￼

Congressman Smith's E-news: August 9, 2017
   It may only be Wednesday, but it's already been a full week traveling the Third District. I've appreciated having so many opportunities to talk with Nebraskans. Thank you to everyone who has participated in my public meetings. Here are a few of this week's highlights:  ￼   Coffee at the Western Nebraska Veterans' Home in Scottsbluff  ￼   Mobile office in Arthur  ￼   Meeting with the Medicine Creek Chamber of Commerce in Curtis  ￼   Coffee at the Gosper County Senior Center in Elwood  ￼   Lunch with the Holdrege Chamber of Commerce  ￼   Nebraska Chamber Federal Legislative Summit  ￼   Meeting with the Falls City Chamber of Commerce   
Let's be bold on tax reform   Three decades after President Reagan signed the largest tax reform in our country's history into law, our tax code is once again desperately in need of a pro-growth overhaul.  The good news is tax reform is at the forefront of our agenda, and a framework is in place. It will still be a heavy lift, as it should be, but we need to get it done.  This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity we have been building toward for years. Since 2011, the Ways and Means Committee has held more than 40 hearings on tax reform. This year's hearings have focused on specific aspects of our plan, from increasing U.S. competitiveness in the global marketplace to growing small businesses.  Among other insights gleaned from these hearings, one theme has remained clear: We cannot afford to wait any longer to reform our tax code. This is why we are committed to enacting tax reform this year. In fact, leaders from the House, the Senate, and the Trump administration issued a statement at the end of July declaring a united front and shared vision for moving forward.  Our plan for tax reform will lower rates, decrease the number of tax brackets, and increase the standard deduction so Americans can keep more of their paychecks.  Due to the complexity of our current tax code, Americans spend 2.6 billion hours each year filing individual income tax returns, with an annual compliance cost of $99 billion. This is an enormous economic drain. Our plan would expand the standard deduction and simplify the filing process to allow about 90 percent of Americans to file their taxes on a form the size of a postcard.    Nebraskans have continually called for the elimination of the death tax, which threatens farmers, ranchers, and small business owners. These producers and entrepreneurs take pride in their hard work, and many want future generations to continue it. The government should encourage their efforts, not stand in their way, and our plan will end this damaging tax once and for all.  Tax reform will benefit Americans across the country, but it is especially important to the livelihood of our rural economy. As the American Farm Bureau Federation observed, ""Many of the provisions of the tax reform blueprint will be beneficial to farmers, including reduced income tax rates, reduced capital gains taxes, immediate expensing for all business inputs except land, and the elimination of the estate tax.""  To reap the greatest economic benefits of revamping our tax code, we need to focus on bold, permanent reforms. The certainty achieved through permanent reforms has the potential to drive double the economic growth as short-term tax cuts - which means more jobs, higher wages, and a healthier economy.  It has been 31 years since the last significant tax reform. Throughout the 31 days of August, the Ways and Means Committee is highlighting 31 reasons why we need tax reform this year. Check out the list at WaysandMeans.house.gov/31Reasons, and please continue to share your thoughts with me as we work to create greater opportunity through a simplified tax code.   Farm Bill listening tour   Thank you to everyone who attended my Farm Bill listening sessions in Broken Bow and Beatrice last week. I appreciated the opportunity to hear more about your priorities for agriculture policy.   On August 23, I will host another Farm Bill listening session in South Sioux City.  August 23: South Sioux City Farm Bill listening session City Hall 1615 1st Avenue, South Sioux City 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. (CDT)  Information about the Farm Bill Listening Tour is available on my website at AdrianSmith.house.gov/FarmBillTour.   For questions about these events, please contact my Grand Island office at (308) 384-3900.   Rural air service   PenAir announced this week it has filed a request with the Department of Transportation to end Essential Air Service routes between Denver and Kearney, North Platte, and Scottsbluff. This is causing understandable concern among Nebraskans.  Commercial air service is necessary to connect rural communities with the national transportation network. I have long supported the Essential Air Service and fought against federal regulations threatening our small airports. My Small Airport Regulation Relief Act provision was included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization signed into law in July 2016 to allow small airports to use enplanement numbers from 2012, before new pilot regulations took effect, to qualify for needed funding.  Despite PenAir's discouraging news, I will keep working with the impacted airports to help ensure continued access to air service, which is a crucial tool for economic development in these communities.    Staff mobile office hours   To bring our services to more Nebraskans, my staff also hosts mobile office hours around the district.   On Tuesday, August 15, a member of my staff will be in Ainsworth. If you need assistance from my office or want to share your thoughts on federal issues, I hope you will stop by.  August 15: Staff mobile office in Ainsworth  Brown County Courthouse 148 West 4th Street, Ainsworth 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. (CDT)  As always, feel free to forward my e-newsletter to family and friends, or let them know they can sign up to receive updates from my office on my website at AdrianSmith.house.gov.   Sincerely,  ￼  ADRIAN SMITH Member of Congress

August 9, 2017


As your representative in Congress, I spend nearly 40 weeks a year in Washington, D.C.  While in our Nation’s Capital, my days are spent meeting with Oklahomans, visiting with Oklahoma families touring the U.S. Capitol, attending Energy and Commerce Committee hearings and markups, and voting on the House Floor on your behalf.  
When I’m not in Washington, I’m traveling through the twenty-six counties I have the honor of representing.  I spend my days touring local businesses, meeting with local and county officials, and talking with constituents just like you to discuss the needs and challenges of our communities and state. 
￼
My goal will always be to serve the people of the Second District to the best of my ability.  That’s why since January:
	•	I have held more than 315 constituent meetings in Oklahoma and D.C. and have addressed over 25 groups of Oklahomans, including tribal leaders and members, state businesses, community groups, and chambers of commerce.
	•	I have dialed over 154,000 households during telephone town hall events and over 400 people have dialed in during the event, so that Oklahomans can utilize a direct line of communication to me while I’m in Washington.
	•	I have held 27 town hall meetings across the Second District to provide opportunities for frank, honest dialogue with Oklahomans.
	•	I have responded to over 13,500 pieces of constituent mail answering your questions and providing my viewpoints on legislation.
	•	I have participated in over 60 Energy and Commerce Committee hearings and markups to hear firsthand from the public about proposed legislation that will have the chance to be considered on the House Floor.    
And all of this is just in the first 7 months of this year. 
In order to best represent you in Congress, I want to remind you that regular feedback and participation is essential.  When you call, email, attend a public meeting, or set up a meeting with me or a member of my team to tell me firsthand about the challenges the federal government poses in your everyday life, I am able to most effectively represent you and your priorities in Congress.
If you would like to set up a meeting with me while I’m back in Oklahoma or when I return to Washington, call my office.  If you would like to express your opinion or voice your concerns, call one of my offices or send me an email.  If you're interested in hearing about our next telephone town hall or public meeting, subscribe to my e-newsletter or visit my website.  We will always let our e-newsletter subscribers know about upcoming public events and telephone town halls as well as posting them on our website, informing the media, and posting on our Facebook and Twitter pages.  As always, let me know how I can better serve you by calling my office or sending me an email.
 
Thank you, ￼

8/9/17 19:36,Summer Update,"￼ 
  

Dear Neighbors,

I hope you're having a wonderful summer, and I look forward to seeing you at community events over the next few weeks. As Congress returns home for the August district work period, I wanted to update you on some of the issues I've been working on, recent events in Washington, and the ways my staff and I are ready to help you.

Thank you to everyone contacting my office to make your voice heard and to everyone who participated in our first telephone town hall last week. Please continue to reach out to my staff and me with your thoughts and concerns through Facebook, Twitter, and my website.
Warm Regards,

My Resolution On The Dangers Of Distracted Driving
 Last month, I introduced bipartisan legislation with Congressman Randy Hultgren of Illinois to promote awareness of the dangers of distracted driving. This resolution aims to shed light on the issue and encourage private and public efforts to eliminate accidents and fatalities caused by distracted driving. I began writing this legislation after conversations with some of our local police chiefs and Congressman Hultgren, and I developed it with the National Safety Council, the Information Technology Industry Council, and a range of companies concerned with the dangers of distracted driving.  

Washington Update
 In July, the Senate failed to advance its “Skinny Repeal” of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by a vote of 49-51. Senators Collins, Murkowski, and McCain crossed party lines to oppose the plan. Other similar repeal bills, including a full repeal of the ACA and the Senate’s replacement plan (the Better Care Reconciliation Act) failed as well. Without a consensus on how to proceed, this effectively stops current efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. 
Whether you call it AHCA, BCRA, Skinny Repeal, or anything else, all these bills failed the most basic principle of medicine: first, do no harm. Each piece of legislation would reduce – by millions – the number of Americans with health coverage. Premiums would have increased, and the quality of plans would have shrunk.  
It is clear that the ACA needs fixes and improvements. I don’t think there’s anyone who says it’s a perfect bill, but it’s unquestionable that the ACA has also improved the lives of millions of Americans by offering them coverage. With caps on lifetime payments, a ban on preexisting condition discrimination, and the elimination of lifetime care limits, the ACA has also allowed more Americans to access better care.
That said, we need to improve the ACA because health care costs are on the rise again, and the individual insurance market is unstable. Congress needs to come together in a bipartisan way to strengthen the Affordable Care Act by increasing coverage options, fully funding risk corridors, and expanding Medicare to uninsured adults aged 50-64. This will help to increase the health of the risk pools, give more people preventive care, and encourage competition in the health insurance market.  In addition to my work on health care, I've also been active on a range of other issues. Recently, I signed on as a cosponsor to the bipartisan Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act and met with members of the organization Girl Up to discuss the impact of this legislation. (Picture below)

8/9/17 19:17,Cleaning Up Washington,"￼
 
￼
10 years ago I helped lead the charge to clean up Washington & 
shed light on the special interests lurking the halls of Congress.

I was proud to work with Republicans and Democrats to pass the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 and get it signed into law by President George W. Bush.  This bill banned gifts from lobbyists to members of Congress, limited the “revolving-door” of lawmakers and their former-staff-turned-lobbyists, and strengthened the public disclosure of lobbying activities.  But ten years later, we still need to push further to drain the swamp, because real change in Washington will only be achieved when folks hold themselves accountable.  As your Senator I have placed the most stringent ethics policy on myself and my staff.  I was the first U.S. Senator to post my daily schedule online, something I still do to this day.  I am also sponsoring the Public Online Information Act to make all public records from the Executive Branch permanently available on the internet in a searchable database at no cost to constituents, and I have introduced multiple bills to clean up our broken campaign finance system.  If folks in Washington aren’t willing to hold themselves accountable, how can we expect them to hold the rest of government accountable?  I came to Washington to put Montanans above special interests, and ten years after the passage of the last sweeping ethics bill, I promise to continue to fight for transparency, push for stronger ethics, and hold both parties accountable.

THIS WEEK IN THE SENATE
This week Sen. Flake is back in Arizona meeting with constituents and local officials in Pinal and Yavapai Counties, as well as Nogales. 
Last week President Trump signed Sen. Flake’s Wounded Officer Recovery Act. The bipartisan, bicameral bill enables wounded Capitol Police officers to access funds raised for Alexandria shooting victims.
The Senate also passed the FDA Reauthorization Act and confirmed sixty-six nominees to a variety of government posts, including Christopher Wray as director of the FBI, David Malpass as Under Secretary of the Treasury, and Mark Andrew Green as Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development. 

HIGHLIGHT REEL
￼
Sen. Flake spoke on the Senate floor on a resolution he introduced honoring Pearl Harbor hero Boatswain’s Mate Second Class Joseph Leon George for rescuing six injured sailors from the sinking USS Arizona. View the full remarks here. 

ROUNDUP REPORT
Taking On Sex-Trafficking Websites: The Arizona Republic reports on Sen. Flake joining legislation to combat online ad-posting sites, like the website Backpage, from facilitating child prostitution and sex crimes. Read more here.
Key Takeaway: “Sex trafficking is a deplorable crime and companies like Backpage that knowingly facilitate it are reprehensible… Congress needs to act to hold these criminal actors liable for their victimization of innocent women and girls.”” – Sen. Jeff Flake via The Arizona Republic
New FBI Director: Sen. Flake voted to confirm Christopher Wray as the new FBI Director, after voting in favor of advancing Wray out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 20th. Read more here. 
Key Takeaway: “The president ought to get his nominees, especially when they are as qualified as Christopher Wray. Throughout the confirmation process, Mr. Wray has demonstrated that his diverse career in law enforcement provides a wealth of experience and knowledge necessary to be FBI director and I am proud to have voted today to confirm him.” – Sen. Jeff Flake
Drought Preparedness & Water Security: Sen. Flake chaired a hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Power and Water to discuss the issue of drought preparedness and water security. During the hearing, Flake questioned Arizona Department of Water Resources Director Tom Buschatzke on protecting Arizona’s water in Lake Mead. Read more here.
Key Takeaway: “Continuing to ensure a reliable long-term water supply is a top priority for Arizona. Hearings like these help build the foundation for future legislation, and we will incorporate today’s testimony into a forthcoming water security bill aimed at reducing regulatory burdens and making better use of existing water infrastructure.” – Sen. Jeff Flake 

 TRIVIA CHALLENGE
The capital of the Navajo Nation is Window Rock, AZ.
Olivia from Flagstaff asks – How many different species of rattlesnakes live in Arizona?

Thune Applauds Senate Passage of his MOBILE NOW Act
 
Sen. John Thune, chairman of Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, applauded the Senate's approval of his MOBILE NOW Act, a bill to boost the development of next-generation gigabit wireless broadband services, including 5G, by ensuring more spectrum is made available for commercial use. Thune's bill will help connect rural areas in South Dakota by reducing the red tape associated with building broadband networks needed for robust Internet access. 
 
Spectrum fuels the 21st centurys wireless economy, and this bill will help make much more of that fuel available to the public, said Thune. The MOBILE NOW Act, which has waited 18 months to advance through the Senate, accelerates us toward a future where extremely fast broadband is much more widely available and internet-enabled devices will play an increasingly prominent role in everything from household items to agricultural production.

Law Enforcement Appreciation 
 

Last Friday,  I joined local police officers and law enforcement at the Gulf Coast Law Enforcement appreciation lunch.  These men and women protect and serve everyday, and the lunch is a great way to give back to our community.  I'm also proud to say we finally have a President who will stand up for law enforcement. Despite what you hear in the media, Jeff Sessions is restoring our entire system in favor of our local law enforcement officials and allowing them to do their job.   Local police officers are one of the reasons I asked to join the Commerce-Justice Appropriations subcommittee and the Homeland Security subcommittee.  We are going to reverse the damage the previous president did and the division his party tried to sow between our citizens and our police.  Our national security starts right here at home in our local communities with our local police force, and I want to make sure they have the tools, training and equipment they need to do their job.
￼

I also had the chance to wish farewell to Seabee Captain Cheryl Hansen at her change of command ceremony. She is a strong person of faith with great love for her family and country, and I wish her all the best in her future endeavors. 

￼

Share the great news! 

Congratulations to Ocean Springs senior Clayton Kirby on representing South MS well last month at Boys Nation in Washington,DC.

CARING FOR AMERICAN HEROES
Dear Friend,
I strongly believe that veterans of the United States military should receive timely access to care, deserve to have their physical and invisible wounds of war treated, and shouldn't have to wait by the telephone for months waiting on disability decisions.
As a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, I am working with the Trump administration to increase the efficiency of the VA, decrease wait times, streamline treatment options, and increase the accountability of all VA employees and executives. I am making these efforts to ensure our veterans are being cared for properly. 
Expanding Access to Care, Treatment, and Benefits
The House took historic action recently by voting to expand GI Bill benefits for life. The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (H.R. 3218) ends the 15-year limit on GI Bill benefits, meaning veterans can use them when it's appropriate and fitting for them, instead of by an arbitrary deadline set by Congress.
In an effort to assist veterans coping with mental health issues, the House passed the No Hero Left Untreated Act (H.R. 1162), which will create a pilot program to explore Magnetic Resonant Therapy as a method of treating veterans. Magnetic Resonant Therapy has been used successfully to treat Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, and TBI.
A More Accountable and Transparent VA
While most VA employees are well-intentioned, capable, and serving their country proudly, a few bad actors at the VA have made it more difficult for veterans to receive the proper care they were promised.
The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 (S. 1094) allows the Secretary to dismiss, demote, or suspend employees for misconduct and poor performance in a more expedited manner, and provides new protections for whistleblowers who shed light on improper actions within the VA.
Streamlining the VA to Provide Faster Benefits
Duplicative medical examinations in the disability claims process create unnecessary costs and delays for our veterans. In May, the House addressed this issue through the Quicker Veterans Benefits Delivery Act of 2017 (H.R. 1725) to eliminate these duplications so our veterans can be served faster and the VA can be more effective.
Currently a backlog of appeals from patients waiting on disability decisions is increasing delays at the VA. The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (H.R. 2288) will allow the VA to address this backlog in a more organized manner, resulting in faster disability decisions for veterans.

8/9/17 14:44,Responding to you:,"￼ 

As your representative, listening to you is my most important job. I’m here to bring your voice to Washington to make government work for Sacramento County.

And every week, my office receives hundreds of letters and phone calls from local residents. Your messages are incredibly important– they help me do a better job of serving you, even if we respectfully disagree. That’s why my office has now replied to 207,157 of your letters, phone calls, emails, and more.

Each letter makes a difference, so today I wanted to share some of my responses:

Please click here to watch me respond to some of your letters. Listening to you is my most important job.

￼

For instance, Thomas and Kath from Elk Grove wrote in to ask about the future of health savings accounts. I've strongly supported health savings accounts in Congress as an innovative way to help people save for their health care needs. In fact, support for health savings accounts is part of my new Prescription to Protect Our Care plan to fix the Affordable Care Act. 

Marilyn from Sacramento expressed her concerns about the President’s election commission. This commission asked for voter information from every state in the nation, and was rejected by both Republicans and Democrats alike. We should be protecting people’s privacy and the right to vote for every American, not undermining it.

I was also glad to hear from Nancy, who lives in Carmichael and served in the Peace Corps. Nancy is concerned about possible budget cuts to the Peace Corps that would undermine our values. As the Vice Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I know the people to people diplomacy that the Peace Corps makes possible is vital to our leadership around the globe.

I take great pride in reading your letters and each one makes a difference. If you’d like to share your thoughts with me, please know that you’re always welcome to contact my office.

Be well,
￼
Ami Bera, M.D.

Hello friends,
I致e been working with local communities and governments to protects the Organ Mountains and its surrounding natural treasures, while ensuring local farmers, ranchers, outdoorsmen, and recreationalists benefit from multiple uses of the land. This month, Secretary Zinke acted upon my request to personally visit the Organ Mountains. During his trip to New Mexico, he was able to meet with businesses, ranchers, border security personnel, and outdoorsmen who are impacted both positively and negatively by the size and complexity of the monument.
I do not want to see our Organs left unprotected, but everyone, from ranchers to hikers, deserve to have access and utilize the land.

KEEPING AMERICA, NEW MEXICO SAFE
From White Sands Missile Range, which tests next-generation weapons systems for the military, to research, development, production, and disposal of nuclear resources, New Mexico plays a vital role in our national security and military defense strategy. Last week, the House voted on four important appropriations bills that modernizes and reforms the way our military operates. This national security package tackles the readiness crisis of our military head on, while honoring the commitment we致e made to our service members and their families.
With strong funding to support these operations, New Mexico will continue grow as a national leader in protecting the United States.
The final security package also included funding for all New Mexico projects that got passed in the NDAA.
Did you know? 
The funding package included a non-debatable provision that provides $1.6 billion to fund the construction of a physical barrier along the southern border. I did not vote for this procedural motion to move forward, because not only will a wall alone be the solution, but the process in the House to get this funding passed was irresponsible. At the end of the day though, I voted to pass the funding package because it does too much for those that protect our freedoms on a daily basis.
You can read more about this in the Albuquerque Journal, here.
DEVELOPING OUR COMMUNITIES
The health and safety of our communities relies on the development of critical infrastructure projects like the new wastewater treatment plant in Sunland Park. This plant opens opportunities to increase economic development, the housing market, and draws in more good-paying jobs to our border communities. I worked with the North American Development Bank and the community to get this project going, and look forward to moving our state ahead while ensuring families and businesses alike have the resources they need to succeed.
DOING MORE FOR SENIORS & SAVERS
For too long, the Federal Reserve has forced our seniors and savers to shoulder the burden of our slow economic recovery since the housing crisis. The Fed must be doing more to protect these communities as we continue to climb out of the recession. Watch my questioning of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Bloomberg below.

Dear Friend,
 
Thank you for reading my congressional e-newsletter, which is designed to be an additional resource for the people of Middle and Southwest Georgia to stay current on issues affecting you and your family.
 
In this edition:
	•	Update on Health Care Reform Legislation 
	•	Cotton Ginning Cost Share Program  
	•	Fiscal Year 2018 Minibus Appropriations Bill  
	•	The National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives 41st Annual Awards Luncheon 



Update on Health Care Reform Legislation
 
￼

In July, legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) failed in a bipartisan vote in the Senate. Instead of dismantling the ACA, I believe Congress needs to instead work together on a bipartisan and bicameral basis to improve the ACA and build on the positive strides it has already made toward providing affordable health care to all Americans.

On July 31, 2017, the Problem Solvers Caucus, of which I am a member, revealed five-point, bipartisan health care proposal. This proposal includes a number of reforms to the ACA. It would:
	•	allot mandatory funding for ""cost sharing reduction"" payments to insurance companies to hold down out-of-pocket costs such as deductibles and co-payments in ACA plans for households earning below 250% of the poverty level; 
	•	develop a stability fund that states can use to reduce premiums and limit insurer losses, especially for people with pre-existing conditions; 
	•	modify the mandate that employers provide coverage to apply only to companies with 500 or more employees, compared with the current 50-employee threshold, and define a full-time workweek as 40 hours, up from 30 hours; 
	•	repeal the 2.3% excise tax on medical devices; and 
	•	repair sections of the Affordable Care Act to make it easier for states to innovate and enter into compacts to allow for the sale of coverage across state lines. 
Full text of the Problem Solver Caucuss proposal can be found by clicking here.
 
Cotton Ginning Cost Share Program
 
On July 18, 2017, I sent a letter, joined by 108 of my colleagues, to the President urging him to take action to stabilize the cotton industry in Middle and Southwest Georgia and across the nation by expanding the Cotton Ginning Cost Share Program to operate on an ongoing basis.

Through the Cotton Ginning Cost Share program, eligible producers received a cost share payment for their gin costs, based on acreage, multiplied by 40 percent of the average ginning cost for each production region. Administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the program has demonstrated itself to be an effective tool in stabilizing cotton prices and providing relief to farmers and the assorted manufacturers and consumers that rely on cotton.
 
I believe the Cotton Ginning Cost Share Program has proven itself to be an effective tool to protect our cotton farms from economic devastations. I urge the President to continue the program to ensure the availability of U.S. cotton for those manufacturers and consumers that rely on this vital agricultural product.
 
You can view the full text of the letter by clicking here.
 
Fiscal Year 2018 Minibus Appropriations Bill
 
At the end of July, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Fiscal Year 2018 Minibus Appropriations bill, which includes funding for the Department of Defense, the Department of Veteran Affairs, the Legislative Branch, and for energy and water development. The legislation, which I supported, was passed by the full U.S. House of Representatives by a vote of 235 to 192. It now goes to the Senate for further consideration.
 
Although not perfect, this legislation included a number of vital provisions for Middle and Southwest Georgia, as well as vital funding for our veterans and armed forces. If ultimately enacted, this bill would provide $10.8 million for a new Air Traffic Control Tower at Fort Benning, GA. It also includes adequate funding for the Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) and funds aquatic plant cleanup and research to help combat invasive weeds, such as the hydrilla that clogs our national waterways.
 
I do have a number of concerns on the process that surrounded this bill, as well as concerns that it does not take a comprehensive view of our nations federal funding needs. This legislation runs the risk of starving out important non-defense programs that directly support our nations economic and social vibrancy and Congress has not passed a budget resolution or set top-line spending numbers. I strongly believe that if we do not invest in the non-defense side of the budget, our nation will be weaker, and our military less able to do its job.
 
We must have sound investments in our workforce, in education, and in health and nutrition. Such investments are not only essential to our military, but to our way of life as Americans.
 
The National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives 41st Annual Awards Luncheon
 
￼
Congressman Sanford D. Bishop, Jr. speaking on building cooperation between law enforcement and their communities, at NOBLE's 41st Annual Awards Luncheon.
 
I was honored to attend and offer remarks at the 41st Annual Awards Luncheon for The National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE) on August 1. This luncheon was part of NOBLEs annual Training Conference and Exhibition.
 
Addressing todays challenges will take a collaborative, compassionate, yet firm and evenhanded, approach. Law enforcement must do more than catching and punishing the criminal, we must find ways to reduce and prevent crime, and to keep our citizens safe before they become victims. We must commit ourselves to community outreach, to keeping our kids in school during the day and on the ball fields and in the clubhouses after.

Poll: STEM Education
 
 
Last month, the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology Subcommittee on Research and Technology held a hearing to look into how America’s education system can be better preparing the 21st century workforce through STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) and computer science education.

Currently, American students rank 19th in science and 30th in math out of the 35 developed countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to Pew Research. This highlights educators’ and employers’ concerns that, in a world of ever changing innovations and technologies, America’s education system is not doing enough to equip students to ensure the United States will continue to compete on a global scale and be a leader in cutting-edge technology.

Question of the Week: Do you believe that STEM should play a larger role in our country’s education system?

[_] Yes
[_] No
[_] I don't know
[_] Other (share your thoughts).

Take the poll here.

News from Representative Ryan Costello
￼ 

Welcome to Ryan’s Report, and thank you for reading. During the August District Work Period, the U.S. House of Representatives is not in session, which means no votes are called and no committee hearings are held. It has been a busy time around the District with constituent meetings, site visits, and town halls,but I first want to provide you with an important healthcare update.
Problem Solvers Caucus: Refocus the Healthcare Debate
This past week I announced my work on healthcare reform as a member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. We are working to refocus the healthcare debate on patient-centered solutions that can achieve bipartisan consensus in Congress.
In addition to having the opportunity to speak with Fox News, and I also joined MSNBC with my colleague, Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-NY), to discuss our work. We are both members of the Problem Solvers Caucus and had a bipartisan discussion on our proposal to address some of the impending challenges to stabilizing the health insurance marketplace.
You may have also seen my op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer, 3 ideas from the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus to immediately help healthcare reform, which discusses the caucus's proposal:
	•	First, end the uncertainty surrounding the federal government’s Cost Sharing Reduction payments (CSRs).
	•	Second, let’s refocus the broader debate on health care to encourage innovation and enhance flexibility at the state level.
	•	Third, many of the provisions of the Affordable Care Acthave negatively impacted job creators — and, in fact, many workers — without an appreciable impact on affordable access to care. We should realign the ACA’s definition of “small business” under the employer mandate with other federal programs — and reestablish the employee expectation of the traditional work week.

July 31 – August 10: Let’s Have a Town Hall
August Town Halls
￼
As part of the District Work Period, I have been holding town halls for constituents of Pennsylvania’s Sixth Congressional District, where constituents are invited to ask me any question on their mind or provide feedback on issues that are important to them.
Berks-Lebanon Counties
On Tuesday, August 1st, I was at the Berks County Agriculture Center in Leesport to host a Berks-Lebanon town hall, which was well-attended by constituents. After I had the opportunity to introduce myself, we spent the afternoon discussing a wide range of topics, including healthcare, the Trump Administration, tax reform, immigration, and environmental issues. I was pleased to meet each of the constituents in attendance, and hear questions and feedback.

On August 7th, I held a town hall in the auditorium of thePottstown Senior High School. While we had well over 400 constituents RSVP, around 230 constituents were in attendance to discuss net neutrality, energy, tax reform, healthcare, the Trump Administration, and student loan debt.

Still Working for you in Washington
SIMPLE Act
Many students face substantial student loan debt that can complicate opportunities and investing in their own future. In fact, for some, student debt is the first type of debt they incur, but it can be debilitating, leaving individuals unable to invest in their future even if they are fortunate enough to secure a well-paying job after graduation. Defaults are most prevalent, however, among borrowers who have less than $5,000 in debt, and delinquency on student debt can lead to long-term financial hardship and difficulty accessing credit to purchase a car or home.
This past week, I introduced bipartisan legislation with Reps. Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR), Patrick Meehan (R-PA), and Seth Moulton (D-MA) to assist students in handling their loan burden -- the Streamlining Income-driven, Manageable Payments on Loans for Education (SIMPLE) Act. 
My legislation would auto-enroll certain borrowers into lower monthly payment plans, allowing students to decrease their risk of missing payments and being placed into higher-cost plans. Further, this bill would use the information borrowers already have on file at the IRS to automate the income recertification process -- reducing the often complicated administrative burden of income recertification.
To learn more about this bipartisan legislation, click here. To learn more about my previous work on this issue, click here and here.
Next week, the August District Work Period continues, and I look forward to meeting with many of you!
Sincerely,

Member of Congress




As a member of the Problem Solvers Caucus, I recently announced several priorities in refocusing the healthcare debate to reach bipartisan consensus. 

1. End the uncertainty surrounding the federal government's Cost Sharing Reduction payments (CSRs) 
2. Refocus the broader debate on health care to encourage innovation and enhance flexibility at the state level. 
3. Update the provisions of the Affordable Care Act's employer mandate and definition of ""full-time"" employment. 

Do you agree?


Yes, this is a good path forward because it is bipartisan and good policy



Yes, because it protects pre-existing conditions and essential health benefits



No, we should repeal now and take time to come up with a replacement



No, we should repeal and replace simultaneously

Dear Lindsey,
          Every corner of Montana is feeling the effects of meth. From children flooding our foster care system to the increasing number of drug investigations and enrollment in treatment programs - the problem of meth in Montana cannot be ignored.
          Recently, I met with the White House's point person on drugs. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) in the White House coordinates the development, implementation and assessment of our nation's drug policy. Acting ONDCP Director Richard Baum and I talked about methamphetamine abuse in Montana, the partnerships between various agencies with jurisdiction over drugs and the challenges facing those in recovery.
￼ I presented a letter to Acting Director Baum, raising questions about ONDCPs plans. Click HERE to download that letter.
          I am committed to working with ONDCP and others to find solutions to the problems associated with drug abuse in Montana. Meth is ruining lives across our great state and the future of the next generation of Montanans is at risk if we do not combat this growing epidemic. 
One third of the record 3,400 children in Montanas foster care system are there because of methamphetamine use by their parents. In 2016, 53 percent of the Montana Department of Justice Division of Criminal Investigation Narcotics Bureau investigations involved meth. If you are one of the many Montanans whose family has been touched by meth, share your story with me below or at www.daines.senate.gov/connect/share-your-meth-story.

Invitation: Georgia's 5th District Military Service Academy Forum
All are invited to meet and speak to representatives on Saturday, August 19, 2017 from 11:00 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at the Georgia Power Auditorium, located at 241 Ralph McGill Boulevard, NE, Atlanta, GA 30308.
Registration is not required.  Click here for directions.  For more information, please contact Ms. Tuere Butler in my Atlanta Office at (404) 659-0116.
￼

Participate in the Congressional App Challenge
Calling all students interested in computer coding!  The 5th District is once again participating in the 2017 Congressional App Challenge.
The deadline for app submissions is November 1, 2017.  For more information, please visit the Congressional App Challenge website or call Mr. Jared McKinley at (404) 659-0116.
Congratulating Metro Atlanta's Newest U.S. Citizens
On July 26, my office in Atlanta helped the High Museum of Art host its first Naturalization ceremony, where new American citizens take their oaths.  These ceremonies are inspirational and positive events that remind us of all that is good about our country.
￼
Love & Taxes: Summer Tax Tips for Newlyweds
Do you know someone who got married this summer?  The IRS provides helpful tips to help couples with the logistics of tax compliance and marital bliss.
July 18th: Nelson Mandela International Day
In July, I reintroduced H.Res.455, a bipartisan resolution recognizing Nelson Mandela International Day.  On this day of service, people around the world spend 67 minutes doing good deeds in honor of former South African President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela’s 67 years of public service.
￼
Improving Relationships between Communities and Police
Like many of you, I watched the alarming video of a DeKalb County police officer striking a homeless woman with his baton several times during an arrest. In addition to responding to the video, I asked DeKalb County for an update.  
In Congress, I author and support legislation like the SAFETY through Nonviolence Act and the Law Enforcement Inclusion Act.  These bills propose proven, proactive policies to strengthen mutual respect, trust, transparency, and accountability between communities and law enforcement.

CAPITOL CONNECTOR
Protecting Voting Rights
In June, I led House Democrats in reintroducing H.R. 12, the Voter Empowerment Act, the most comprehensive voting rights and election administration legislation before the Congress. 
The VEA responds to the 2016 election, where foreign interference, hacking, and shameful efforts to suppress the vote were direct attacks on our democracy that we cannot allow to go unanswered.
The VEA will help ensure equal access to the ballot for every eligible voter, will modernize our voter registration system to help more Americans participate, and will help eliminate deceptive practices that deter voters from casting their ballots.
As you know, many people across our country gave the ultimate sacrifice during the struggle to gain the right to vote, and on August 6, 1965, The Voting Rights Act (VRA) was signed into law. We must work to protect and ensure that this sacred right is available to all Americans. 
For these reasons, I am an original cosponsor of bipartisan legislation to restore what the Supreme Court broke in the Shelby v. Holder decision, and I maintain my hope that Congress can come together once again to act in the best interest of our nation and democracy by restoring the heart and soul of the VRA.
Health Care Developments
As you know, the House passed a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in May.  The Senate received the repeal bill.
In June, several U.S. Senators joined me on the steps of the Capitol.  We hosted a free-flowing conversation with visitors about what repealing the ACA would mean for millions of Americans.
During the last week of July, the Senate rejected three Republican efforts to repeal the ACA.  The ""repeal and replace"" amendment failed by a vote of 43 to 57.  The partial repeal amendment failed by a vote of 45 to 55, and the final “skinny” repeal amendment failed by a vote of 49 to 51.
Please know that I am ready to work in good faith to improve health care for everyone in our country, and I am committed to fighting any attempt to harm the health and well-being of the American people.
Ways and Means Committee
I serve as the Ranking Member of the Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee.  In July, we held a hearing on fighting Medicare fraud to ensure that this important program thrives today and exists for future generations.  
Throughout the year, the Oversight Subcommittee held hearings and roundtable discussions about improving the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) operations. Next year, we hope to develop bipartisan legislation to improve taxpayer services.
The Ways and Means Committee and the U.S. House of Representatives also passed H.R. 3178, the Medicare Part B Improvement Act.  This legislation included H.R. 3166, my bipartisan bill to improve the accreditation of dialysis clinics with the goal of improved kidney care and services.
Standing Up for Transgender Service Members
Like many people across our country, I strongly oppose the recent announcement possibly banning transgender individuals from military service.  We should not turn away anyone willing to serve and defend our country. 
Fighting for DREAMers
The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program allows nearly 800,000 DREAMers to come out of the shadows and benefit our communities.  Last week, I sent a letter to Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke urging her to uphold this important program.  
I am also an original co-sponsor of H.R. 3591, the American Hope Act; this new bill that would give legal status and provide a path to citizenship for DREAMers and others who arrived in the United States as children.  I will continue to do all I can to ensure that the Federal government honors its commitments and enacts policies that reflect American values.
Budget & Spending Updates
Defaulting on our commitments and failing to fund the Federal government are never options. 
As you know, Congress must fund the Federal government by the end of the fiscal year – September 30th.  In July, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3219, which included the fiscal year 2018 Defense, Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, Energy and Water, and the Legislative Branch appropriations bills.  
These were the first fiscal year 2018 appropriations bills considered by the House of Representatives, and many additional funding bills need immediate congressional action. Please know that I continue to advocate for strong funding for the key Federal programs and initiatives upon which residents in the 5th Congressional District rely.
The House and Senate are expected to pass a budget resolution by April 15th.  To date, neither body has considered a budget resolution for fiscal year 2018.
In addition to funding all Federal agencies by the end of September, Congress will likely need to pass legislation to raise the debt ceiling in the near future. This is an important step to making sure that the United States pays its bills on time. The faith and credibility of the U.S. must remain intact.

8/9/17 11:08,Beyond resistance: Accelerating to a clean energy future,"Update | Wednesday, August 9, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 12th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: accelerating a clean energy future.
Climate change is the biggest environmental challenge of our time, and the United States is a major contributor to this problem. We have an obligation to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and lead in clean energy development. That’s why I’m fighting to advance renewable energy and energy efficiency in Congress.
I’m proud to represent Oregon, long recognized for cutting-edge development and support of renewable energy industries, energy conservation, green building, sustainable transportation, and smart growth. My state, along with others, is committed to acting on climate and upholding the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.
Congress should heed these examples and continue America on the path toward a clean energy future. Whether through tax provisions that level the playing field for renewables, increasing energy efficiency, or pricing carbon, our ultimate goal should be a 100% renewable energy economy. I support legislation that lays the groundwork for this transition, as well as legislation that invests in energy efficiency upgrades for our schools and public buildings. I strongly support taxes on carbon emissions to ensure that polluters pay their fair share and that renewable energy industries have a chance to thrive on a level playing field.
The renewable energy sector is growing faster than ever, but we have no time to waste. We must invest in these technologies and complementary initiatives to move our economy toward 100% clean, renewable power. Let’s lead the world in conservation and clean energy production.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

8/9/17 11:02,"Carlos Curbelo's Week In Washington: A Head Start for Monroe County, Bipartisanship in Health Care, Opposing Maduro","
   
￼


Here’s what’s happening in the office of U.S. Representative Carlos Curbelo (FL-26):  
A HEAD START FOR MONROE COUNTY: Carlos welcomed a $1.3 million U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grant for Monroe County School District’s ‘Head Start’ program. The grant will be used to better prepare students of low-income families for their transition to public school. Head Start is a federally-administered program that provides counties with the resources to support student development and learning goals.  
BIPARTISANSHIP IN HEALTH CARE: As Vice Chairman of the Problem Solvers Caucus, Carlos praised the Caucus’ efforts to move the healthcare debate forward with their proposal to stabilize health insurance markets. Carlos spoke on “Morning Magazine with Bill Becker” about the importance of bipartisan cooperation in health care and how the Problem Solvers Caucus is providing a healthy platform for effective discussion. 
￼
COAST GUARD BIRTHDAY: Last Wednesday, Carlos was invited aboard the CGC William Trump to meet with servicemembers stationed at U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Sector Key West. Carlos met with LT Jeffrey Makejka, CAPT Jeffrey Janszen, and CDR Lexia Littlejohn to discuss the impact of revised migrant tracking policies on USCG resources. 
￼
OPPOSING MADURO: After the results of the Venezuelan election, Nicolas Maduro went on to rewrite the country’s constitution, allowing for a complete overhaul of the National Assembly to make room for Maduro’s self-appointed Constituent Assembly. Carlos denounced the Maduro regime’s consistent violations against the Venezuelan people and applauded the U.S. Department of Treasury’s freeze on Maduro’s financial assets. 
￼
KICKING OFF IN THE KEYS: Carlos kicked off August in the Florida Keys by visiting local businesses and organizations that have made a positive impact in their communities. Additionally, he had the opportunity to answer questions from constituents, address concerns from Key West activists, and learn more about the great research being done at Florida Keys Community College with the help of federal funding.  
￼
Carlos joined Monroe County Sheriff’s Office to celebrate National Night Out, an annual event that aims to enhance the relationship between communities and their law enforcement officials. 
￼
Keys Federal Credit Union was named ‘2017 Credit Union of the Year’ by the League of Southeastern Credit Unions. Carlos visited with KFCU to congratulate the staff on their accomplishment.
￼
To commemorate the grand opening of Hemingway Rum Company, Carlos presented a flag to Key West Director of Operations Carlton “Carl” Grooms.
￼  
Carlos stopped by Florida Keys Community College to learn about the Renewable Energy program, which was made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation. 
￼
Members of Zonta International hosted Carlos to discuss the organization’s future plans to bring equality to women around the world.
￼
Carlos discussed the importance of strengthening the U.S. – Israel relationship with members of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).
￼
At the Associated General Contractors of America's ""First Friday Luncheon,"" Carlos shared the details of his role on Ways and Means Committee and its plan to deliver comprehensive tax reform for all Americans.  
QUALITY HEALTH CARE FOR SOUTH FLORIDA: Last week, Carlos celebrated a federal five-year extension for the Medicaid managed-care program. The agreement between the Administration and the State of Florida secured $1.5 million in funding for Florida’s Low Income Pool and allows for the State to continue to provide quality care options for Medicaid recipients.  
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: In Carlos’ biweekly column for the South Dade News Leader, he wrote about the recently passed sanctions against Iran, North Korea, Russia, and the Administration's actions against Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro and how these sanctions demonstrate a firm intolerance towards dangerous and oppressive foreign regimes. ""With these sanctions and actions, the United States is telling the world we are watching; we will not let abuses of power go unchecked; and we will not hesitate to hold rogue regimes accountable for their actions,” Carlos wrote.

8/9/17 5:04,Your prescriptions aren't a luxury item,"￼
For many Missourians, prescriptions are lifesavers—and no one should have to choose between filling critical prescriptions or buying their weekly groceries.
￼ WATCH NOW: Leading a Senate Aging Committee hearing on the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs with Senator Collins
We have to work to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, which is why I teamed up with my longtime friend—Republican Senator Susan Collins from Maine—to pass legislation that would increase competition for generic drugs to help lower overall costs.
I'm thrilled to tell you that our bipartisan bill has passed the U.S. House and Senate, and now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law.
This is a big win for Missourians—and especially for seniors, who are disproportionately affected by skyrocketing prescription costs. Once signed by the President, our bill will:
	•	Create a priority review timeline for qualified generic applications
	•	Expedite the review and development of certain generics
	•	Improve transparency and reporting requirements
	•	Establish timelines for facility inspections
This bill is a direct result of the investigation I led with Senator Collins in the Senate Aging Committee, which has been the only bipartisan investigation into the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to the egregious price spikes consumers have seen in recent years.
Learn more about my work to protect consumers and seniors at http://www.mccaskill.senate.gov/
All the best,

Enough With the Trump Photo Ops
 
 
￼
 
Last month, I respectfully declined an invitation by President Trump to take part in the White House announcement regarding the construction of a Foxconn manufacturing facility. While I am relieved to learn my state could potentially see an influx of jobs because of this project, my constituents have no interest in me entertaining the presidents desire to be used as a backdrop in his photo op. Instead, I used this time to answer questions from constituents and local organizations as part of the Congressional Black Caucus Twitter Town Hall on TrumpCare.

8/8/17 19:03,Balance the Budget,"News from Martha Roby
Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window          Click here to open a plain text version of this email
￼
Friends,
With the end of the fiscal year approaching on September 30, Congress will soon begin finalizing appropriations legislation to fund government operations. I’m proud of the work the House Appropriations Committee has done to approve legislation to properly fund critical programs, while cutting wasteful spending and bending the federal budget curve down for a change.
However, seeing our conservative measures survive negotiations with the Senate has proven to be quite a challenge in recent years. It can be a frustrating process to say the least, partly because those who favor more government spending have every incentive to delay, drag their feet, and hold out on responsible agreements. I believe it is time to change that, and one remedy I favor is amending the U.S. Constitution to require our government to balance its budget.
￼
That’s why I’ve introduced H.J. Res. 114, legislation to amend the Constitution that, if passed and ratified, would require Congress and the President to enact a balanced budget every year. 
Some say a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution like mine is unrealistic. I understand the skepticism. After all, the Constitution has only been successfully amended 17 times beyond the original ten in the Bill of Rights. It is a difficult process, just as it should be. However, I say what’s truly unrealistic is the notion that we could maintain this great country as we know it by continuing to spend more than we take in. Instead of a political incentive for politicians to spend irresponsibly, we need a constitutional requirement against it.
American families balance their budgets, just like businesses balance theirs. Most state and local governments have to balance their budgets as well. It is past time for Congress and the President to be constitutionally required to balance our budget.
CONGRATULATIONS, STEPHEN BOYD!
I am proud to report that my former Chief of Staff, Stephen Boyd has been confirmed by the U.S. Senate as Assistant Attorney General of the United States! 
￼
Stephen served as my top adviser in the House for six years before joining Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice and accepting a nomination from President Trump to serve as Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs. He is exactly the kind of person our country needs to serve in such a position of great influence. In Stephen, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has an experienced, rock-solid adviser and Congress has a principled, trustworthy conduit to the Department of Justice.  
I join Stephen’s wife, Brecke and his parents, Ron and Floranne in celebrating this special achievement.
FOREVER GI BILL PASSES HOUSE  
￼
Great news for military veterans! The House unanimously voted to extend the post-9/11 GI Bill and eliminate the 15-year limit on the use of education benefits for new recruits. I was proud to support the Forever GI Bill because I believe the men and women who serve our country should be able to access their education benefits at a time that works for them, without an expiration date.
A PRO-LIFE CHAMPION AT HHS 
One of the reasons I was eager to see my friend and colleague Dr. Tom Price appointed Secretary of Health and Human Services is his deep commitment to defending the unborn. 
￼
I recently sent a letter to Secretary Price updating him on some important progress the House Appropriations Committee has made to ensure taxpayer dollars aren't used to fund the abortion industry. I believe that by working together, Congress and the Trump Administration can achieve more to advance protections for life than we have seen in the past decade.

Taking a Stand through Tougher Sanctions
The United States sent a strong message last week. The security of our country, and our allies around the globe, is of critical importance. That is why Congress took a stand against several countries that continuously threaten this security with aggressive actions. By signing into law tougher sanctions on North Korea, Russia, and Iran, the United States has sent a clear response that their bad behavior will not stand.   Why sanction these countries? Open the newspaper almost any given day and you’ll see why. Under the leadership of Vladimir Putin, Russia has actively undermined our national security for many years. I have serious concerns about Russia’s aggressive actions against Ukraine and our NATO allies in Eastern Europe as well as in Syria. Putin’s government has also attempted to interfere in United States presidential elections and undermine core democratic principles. Not only has the brutal Kim regime in North Korea committed a laundry list of human rights offenses, it is actively working to build a nuclear weapons arsenal capable of attacking their neighbors and potentially the United States. Since February, North Korea has tested 18 missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles potentially capable of reaching the United States. Plus, Iran continues to inject instability in the Middle East and fund terrorist activity.   North Korea, Russia, and Iran must be held accountable for their actions against the United States and the global community. On July 25, the House of Representatives passed the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act by a vote of 419-3. Just a few days later, the Senate passed the bill by a vote of 98-2, sending this strongly bipartisan measure to the President’s desk. Despite initial speculation as to whether President Trump would support the bill, I am pleased that he signed it into law.  Tougher sanctions give the United States greater political and economic leverage against these countries. By enacting this law, we are continuing our efforts to help keep America safe from global threats. Oppressive, hostile regimes must be held accountable and put on notice that the United States will not tolerate actions that undermine the security of the American people and our allies.

A Long Overdue Honor for a Local Hero
￼
Last week, I had the opportunity to visit with Talmage Claytor and his family in Buena Vista. Mr. Claytor served in Word War II, and he recently received France's Legion of Honor medal for his actions -- a long overdue recognition. I'm thankful for the time I got to spend with this local hero.

Dear Friend,
Six months into Trump's presidency, the fate of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program remains unclear, causing great uncertainty and anxiety among the program's more than 787,000 recipients, their families, and our communities. DREAMers are our brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, and friends and colleagues who have lived here for almost all of their lives, and are just as American as you and I. DACA has enabled them to go to school, find work, pay into Medicare and Social Security, and open businesses, all which contribute to the cultural and economic vibrancy of our country.
In my opinion, it is incumbent upon the current administration and all lawmakers that we provide adequate protections for DREAMers against deportation. That's why I led 156 of my colleagues in sending a letter to the President requesting that he not only continue DACA, but that he come out against current threats of a lawsuit being lobbed against the program. In addition, I helped introduce the American Hope Act, which would provide a legislative solution to alleviate the fear of deportation that DREAMers face on a daily basis. You can read more about my letter and the American Hope Act below.

American Hope Act 
I recently co-sponsored legislation that would help protect DACA recipients and other immigrants who arrive to the U.S. as children. The American Hope Act of 2017 would protect DREAMers from deportation, allow them to apply for permanent residency and provide a pathway to U.S. citizenship.
￼
Rep. Grijalva joins his colleagues to re-introduce the American Hope Act
 More specifically, the American Hope Act would:
	•	Allow DACA beneficiaries and other DREAMers to apply for Conditional Permanent Resident (CPR) status.
	•	Allow those granted CPR status to obtain Legal Permantent Resident (LPR) status (i.e., a green card) after 3 years if they stay out of trouble. Time spent with DACA would count toward the required 3 years of CPR status.
	•	Provide a 5-year path to U.S. citizenship. Time spent in CPR status would count toward the general 5-year period needed for permanent residents to become eligible for U.S. citizenship.
	•	Allow minors to apply for CPR status through a legal guardian or counsel.
	•	Improve college affordability for undocumented youth and other immigrants by repealing rules that limit their access to in-state tuition and college loans.
	•	Treat all DREAMers brought to the United States as young children the same, regardless of educational level, military service, or work history.
My letter to the President: Protect DREAMers now
On June 29th, the Texas Attorney General, along with nine other attorney generals, sent President Trump an ultimatum threatening a legal challenge to DACA unless he ends the program by September 5, 2017. In response, I led 156 Members of Congress in sending a letter to the President urging him to take necessary action to protect more than 787,000 recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The letter asks the Trump Administration to oppose any efforts to challenge DACA in Court, and asks the Courts to dismiss a current lawsuit being brought forth by the group of Attorney Generals. You can read the full letter here.
It is my honor to represent your voice in Congress. If I can be of any assistance to you or if you have any questions about the above information, please contact one of my offices (see contact information below). We're here to help!
Peace,

Press Statement
Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee Statement Regarding Situation In North Korea 

Jackson Lee: “The President is bound by the Constitutional norms and must consult Congress before taking preemptive military action against North Korea.”

Washington, DC – Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a senior member of the House Committees on Judiciary and Homeland Security and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations issued the following statement about the North Korea’s expanding nuclear capabilities:

“According to published reports, a new American intelligence assessment concludes that North Korea has successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles.  If accurate, this represents an alarming expansion of the authoritarian regime’s nuclear capabilities.


“The growing North Korean threat warrants a thoughtful and firm response.  The world community should stand united in opposing Pyongyang’s provocations and the United States must demonstrate restraint and work to de-escalate tensions.   Further, the White House must articulate a coherent strategy to address the crisis gripping the Korean Peninsula.  Any actions undertaken by the Administration must be predicated on imminent threats and a defined foreign policy.


“As a co-equal branch of government, it is Congress's right and responsibility to be fully consulted regarding any potential plans to use military force in addressing the North Korean threat.  Should the Administration contemplate military action, the Congress should immediately be called back to Washington to assess whether such action is in the national security interest of the United States and our allies, and to withhold or grant authorization for the use of military force based on this assessment.


“The President is bound by the Constitutional norms and must consult Congress before taking preemptive military action against North Korea.  He cannot simply abdicate his responsibilities and those of the Congress to four star Generals, regardless of how well respected they are.”

North Korea promises to only target U.S. Reacting to U.S. pressure and new United Nations economic sanctions, North Korean diplomats threatened to use nuclear arms against the U.S. and that it would not negotiate over its nuclear programs under any circumstances. The new U.N. sanctions, adopted over the past weekend, are the strongest economic restrictions on an already isolated North Korea. They’re estimated to cost the country $1 billion, one-third of the revenue it earns from exports.
+ Washington Post: “North Korea now making missile-ready nuclear weapons, U.S. analysts say.”
￼
DOJ reverses position to support Ohio voter purging  Department of Justice attorneys on Monday filed an amicus brief, reversing the department’s prior position and urging the Supreme Court to allow Ohio to continue its controversial practice of removing voters from the rolls. In Ohio, if a voter does not cast a ballot within two years, the state sends notice asking the individual to confirm registration. If the voter does not respond and does not vote over the next four years, Ohio election officials remove the voter from the rolls. This practice was challenged as inconsistent with the National Voter Registration Act, and the Supreme Court is set to hear the case in the next term.   + Last year, a Reuters analysis found Ohio voters in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods twice as likely to be purged as Ohio voters in Republican-leaning neighborhoods. 
￼
Scientists fear climate science will be censored  A government report estimates that recent average temperatures have been the highest in 1,500 years. The report, compiled by 13 federal agencies, concludes that human-caused climate change is negatively impacting the U.S. This directly contradicts President Trump, his advisors and some of the Cabinet. The report is part of the National Climate Assessment, which is issued every four year. Some fear that the report will be changed or suppressed by the administration.
+ Read the draft report here.
+ The Department of Agriculture has recommended that its employees not use the term “climate change,” instead encouraging the use of “weather extremes.” 
￼
Administration deregulation teams operate secretly, do not disclose membership  The administration has stacked “deregulation teams” – tasked with undoing the previous administration’s rules – with secret political appointees. The teams include former executives and lobbyists for firms that could benefit from deregulation. According to ProPublica and The New York Times, “there are now 85 known current and former team members, including 34 with potential conflicts.” 
+ Shadow policy writing groups, also often staffed with executives, are now the subject of three lawsuits for potentially violating federal requirements that “advisory groups … open their meetings, release their documents and announce their members’ names.”
￼
Chicago sues DOJ over new police grant rules; attorney general criticizes mayor  Responding to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s lawsuit to preserve Chicago’s federal funding even if it did not fully cooperate with immigration authorities, Attorney General Jeff Sessions declared: “To a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction, the political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this country’s lawful immigration system.” Chicago argues that the cooperation that the Justice Department is requesting would undermine relationships between the police and immigrant communities.
￼
Overdose deaths jumped in early 2016  The National Center for Health Statistics reported that overdose deaths rose dramatically in the third quarter of 2016. The recorded rate was 19.9 per 100,000 people. That is significantly higher than the 16.7 per 100,000 recorded for the same period in 2015. Approximately 60% of overdose deaths are caused by opioids.
In Appalachia, people are dying younger A new Health Affairs study found that people living in Appalachia have a lower life expectancy and higher rates of infant mortality than anywhere else in the country. Researchers found that adult life expectancy is more than two years shorter than the rest of the country. Infant mortality rates are 16% higher.
￼
Democrats seek information on Trump businesses House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Democrats have sent letters to all Cabinet secretaries and federal agency heads requesting documents about how their departments are spending any taxpayer dollars on any Trump Organization business. Letters were sent to 23 agency heads in total. The request seeks documents about any payments the departments made to the Trump Organization or any business in which the Trump Organization has an ownership stake.
+ Jim signed the letters, all of which may be viewed here.

Press Release
Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee Reintroduces The ‘SAVE America Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act’

While Trump implodes legal immigration, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee introduces thoughtful policies to help put system back on track and create a pathway to legalization for 11 million undocumented immigrants.

Washington, DC – Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a senior member of the House Committees on Judiciary and Homeland Security and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, released the following statement regarding H.R. 3647, the “SAVE America Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act:

“I have been working on immigration issues since 1994 when I first came to Congress and for many years before that when I served in local government. The immigration challenges facing our nation affects all regions and every sector of the economy. 

“These comprehensive challenges require comprehensive solutions. That is why I have reintroduced the ‘SAVE America Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2017.’ This legislation, which I developed through in-depth consultation with representatives of stakeholder groups, addresses the challenges posed by our broken immigration system in a comprehensive, humane and family friendly way. Among the most important provisions contained in the SAVE America Act are:


	1.	The opportunity for undocumented workers to earn access to legalized status and later to citizenship; 
	2.	The opportunity for young persons brought to the United States as children to earn citizenship by serving in the military and attending college;
	3.	Family reunification by modernizing and streamlining the appeals process and increasing the allotment of family based immigrations visas;
	4.	Expands number of temporary visas for agricultural and tech workers; 
	5.	Provides resources and equipment for Border Patrol personnel to carry out their duties in a safe and effective manner

“Comprehensive immigration reform is the only logical response if we are to address the challenges we face at our borders. The SAVE America Act creates a pathway to legalization for millions of people who are living in the shadows who come to our country. Most of them are hard-working people looking for a better life. Our legal immigration system is persistently plagued by enormous backlogs, preventing valuable skilled and unskilled labor from entering the country. Our immigration courts are largely understaffed and underfunded.

“If we let the immigration reform debate focus primarily on minute elements we lose sight of the many other important things we need to do to fix our broken immigration system. It has been estimated that approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States.  Most of them are hard-working and law-abiding persons who have become productive members of our society.  It serves no purpose to keep them in the shadows of our society without lawful status.  It is not good for them, and it is not in the best interests of the United States.

“Draconian measures like mass-deportations and the construction of a border wall with Mexico are grossly ineffective and run counter to our American ideals.  Equally offensive would be the adoption of a White House-backed plan to establish a merit-based system, which would drastically curtail the number of legal yet low-skilled immigrants allowed into the country each year.

“Last March, my office intervened in the heart-breaking case of Jose Escobar, a hard-working family man with no history of trouble with the law who was deported to El Salvador and separated from his wife and children in Houston.  Mr. Escobar was sent back to a country that he hadn’t seen in over 15 years while in the midst of applying for permanent legal status.  

“The unconscionable removal of Mr. Escobar from his family was part of a wave of similar deportations taking place across the country.  Right now, Pastor Jorge Ramirez, a conservative California minister and Trump supporter with no criminal history, faces the prospect of deportation because of his undocumented status.  And brothers Lizandro and Diego Claros, who were arrested by ICE agents while on their way to college, are fighting their ordered expulsion back to a country they barely remember.

“Mr. Escobar, Mr. Ramirez, and the Claros brothers are victims of the President’s wrong-headed and un-American policy.  Trump’s deportations have fanned the flames of fear and created a domestic climate that is more befitting of an authoritarian state than a Constitutional democracy.

“Stories like these tear at the fabric of what defines us as Americans. Prominent immigration activists have shared with me their passion and pride, and desire to help this nation live up to its ideals.  I look forward to working with them and other stakeholders to make 2017 the year that Congress finally passes comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to earned legalizations of status. My bill, the SAVE America Comprehensive Immigration Act, HR 3647, does that. This is the right thing to do for the country, and now is the time.”

From the Hill to the Mountains
Honoring Jessie Grubb’s Memory with Meaningful Change 
Last week, the U.S. Senate passed my bill – Jessie’s Law – to ensure medical professionals have full knowledge of a patient’s previous opioid addiction if the patient gives consent. This will help prevent tragedies like the devastating death of West Virginia native Jessie Grubb, who battled addiction for seven years – but was sober and making life for herself in Michigan. 
She was training to run in a marathon and had to undergo surgery for a running-related injury. Her dear parents, David and Kate Grubb, went to Michigan for her surgery and told her doctors and hospital personnel that she was a recovering addict. However, after Jessie’s surgery, the discharging doctor, who said he didn’t know she was a recovering addict, sent her home with a prescription for 50 oxycodone pills. 
Her story had a profound impact on me and many others, and I hope the House of Representatives passes this critical bill so the President can have the opportunity to sign it into law. That’s when we will truly be able to honor Jessie’s legacy by preventing another family from enduring such terrible – and avoidable – pain. 
Updates on Veterans Bills
In addition to passing Jessie's Law, the Senate passed the following patriotic and bipartisan bills that I was proud to  sponsor and fight for: 
	•	The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Education Assistance Act – or the “Forever G.I. Bill” – which modernizes and strengthens G.I. Bill education benefits for West Virginia Veterans, Reservists and their families by removing the previous 15-year window for Veterans to be able to use these benefits. 
	•	The Global War on Terrorism War Memorial Act, which authorizes a private foundation that will begin the process of constructing a memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. – to honor our men and women in uniform, our fallen service heroes and their families, and all those who have been impacted by our nation’s longest war; and, 
	•	 A joint resolution declaring August 7th every year as Purple Heart Day, which recognizes the sacrifices of those who have earned the Purple Heart Medal.

On Monday, my staff joined representatives of the West Virginia Conservation Agency, the Monongahela Conservation District, the Natural Resources Conservation Service and West Virginia University, along with Preston County officials, to break ground on a nearly $8 million rehabilitation of the Upper Deckers Creek Site 1 dam in Reedsville. The dam will continue to protect from flooding, and be a sustained source of water for the community – and I applaud everyone making this critical project possible.

Dear fellow South Carolinians,
Thank you for reading my weekly e-newsletter, and please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.
Credit Score Competition Act  Last week, I introduced my bipartisan Credit Score Competition Act. After growing up in a small, two-bedroom house with my grandparents, I came to understand and appreciate the independence that comes with the notion of owning a home. Homeownership is a huge part of the American Dream, and I want to help folks across the country accomplish that goal. The current credit-scoring model at the center of our housing market overlooks a large swath of people that are paying their monthly bills on time and deserve an opportunity to pursue homeownership.  Our goal in introducing this legislation is to encourage Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider more inclusive methodologies in determining a borrower’s creditworthiness. The legislation has already received support from twenty consumer and industry groups, and I hope it will soon help to make our system more fair to everyone.
Better Care for Our Veterans There is no way we can ever fully repay our veterans for their willingness to answer our nation’s call to serve, but we can continue to demonstrate our appreciation and gratitude by helping them attain the highest quality of care our medical professionals can provide. I supported the passage of two major Veterans Affairs reform bills last week; one overhauling the Veterans Affairs (VA) appeals process, and another extending the Veterans Choice Program, an initiative that helps veterans access private care within their communities. Our service members do so much for us and our country, and it should be our duty to do all we can to help take care of them during and after their time in service
Tax Reform As the debate on tax reform begins, our goal should be simplifying our tax code and creating a fair system tailored for the 21st century. We need to make sure that the tax code is designed to work for you – my bosses throughout South Carolina, the citizens who pay the taxes. Lower taxes mean higher incomes, more jobs and a significant boost in our nation’s economy, and that’s something we should be striving towards. And with more than 50 million Americans living in poverty, we can encourage growth with a tax code that is much easier to digest. I look forward to working with my colleagues in both chambers as we move forward on this important package, and helping every person across this country down a successful path. Click here to see my discussion on tax reform with CBS This Morning.
Sincerely,
￼
Tim

 Congressman Cook Introduces Airspace Protection Act of 2017 
It seems that every day a new wildfire is reported somewhere in our state, striking fear in the hearts of rural homeowners. As we enter the 2017 fire season in California, it’s important to consider ways to make our communities safer and minimize the loss of life and property in the event of a catastrophic fire.
Over the past few years, we’ve seen a number of devastating fires across San Bernardino County. Last year’s Blue Cut Fire, in the Cajon Pass, scorched 37,000 acres, and destroyed 105 homes and 213 structures. The year prior, the Lake Fire burned 31,000 acres and took over a month to extinguish.
To make matters worse, this year’s fire season is already outpacing 2016. According to Cal Fire statistics, through the first six months of last year there were 22,709 wildfires, totaling 30,574 acres. However, this year, during the same period 2,905 wildfires were reported over an area of 68,129 acres. It’s no easy task to battle these fires, in light of the triple-digit temperatures, unforgiving terrain, and strained resources. Thankfully, our local, state and federal firefighting agencies are there to defend our communities.
Recently, the presence of remote-controlled drones in the airspace above wildfires have complicated firefighting efforts. Whether these drone operators have malicious intent or not, these devices cause major disruptions to aerial firefighting capabilities. During the North Fire of 2015, all firefighting aircraft were grounded over fears of collisions with drones. The inability to utilize aerial assets resulted in the fire jumping Interstate 15 and destroying over 20 vehicles in the Cajon Pass. Thankfully no lives were lost that day.
Grounding firefighting aircraft due to drone incursions isn’t unique to California. A number of fires in Arizona, Colorado, and Utah were also impacted by drone activity. As the popularity and capability of these unmanned aircraft increases it’s become readily apparent that we must take action to protect lives, homes and our environment, by restricting drone usage.
After listening to the concerns of fire officials and local residents, I have introduced the Airspace Protection Act of 2017 (H.R. 1138) in Congress. This bill would make it a felony offense to operate a drone that interferes with wildfire suppression on federal land. Under the provisions of the measure, anyone convicted of this offense would be subject to five years in federal prison. I’m optimistic that it will gain the support of my colleagues in Congress, so that our firefighters on the front lines have the best chance to protect our communities.
In the meantime, you and your family can take steps to increase your chances of surviving a major wildfire. Creating a defensible space around your home is a crucial component to fire safety. California law requires homeowners who reside in a State Responsibility Area to create a 100 ft. buffer zone around inhabited structures that is free of flammable debris. It’s also important to have emergency supplies, and an action plan prepared, in the event of an evacuation. I encourage you to visit the CalFire website, http://www.readyforwildfire.org to learn more about wildfire safety. In addition, CalFire recently launched a new application for smartphones called “Ready for Wildfire” that provides users with critical wildfire alerts. It can be downloaded free of charge from the Apple and Google Play stores.
The most important step you can take to avoid tragedy during major free is to follow the instructions of all public safety personnel. While the thought of losing your home is horrifying, it isn’t worth losing your life I wish you and your families a safe fire season.  This op-ed was published in Rim of The World News, click here for the original editorial.

Apple Valley Unveils Electric Charging Stations

Electric car owners can bolt over to Apple Valley Town Hall for a charge now that the Town’s two electric vehicle charging stations are available.
The Level 2 units were installed in front of the Development Services Building at no cost to the Town, thanks to a $19,244 grant from the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District. Most commercially available electric vehicles have the ability to charge using AC Level 1 and 2 charging equipment. Although Tesla vehicles do not use the J1772 charge ports used for Level 2 chargers, they do sell an adapter. 
“From Teslas to Fords, and from Nissans to Chevys, we are seeing more and more electric vehicles on our local roadways,” said Director of Public Works Greg Snyder. “This convenient location will allow drivers of electric vehicles to swing by, plug in and either do business at the town, take a swim in the pool, play in the park, have lunch or do some shopping in The Commons retail center across the street.”
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, charging equipment for plug-in electric vehicles is classified by the rate at which the batteries are charged. Charging times vary based on how depleted the battery is, how much energy it holds, the type of battery and other factors. Level 2 charge stations typically provide 10 to 20 miles of range per one hour of charging 
With the handy payment kiosk, users can get a boost for their vehicle at the rate of $1.25 per hour, which is sold in one-hour increments. This payment schedule was set to cover the cost of the electricity and any administrative costs the service might incur.

Lindsey,

Last week, we saw democracy at work when the Senate voted against passing the disastrous Republican health care bill. Thanks to people in Oregon and across the country who made their voices heard, the health care of millions was protected.

Political change doesn't come from the top down, it's bottom up. That's why it's so important for members of Congress to get out into the communities they represent and hear directly from their constituents. 

Since I first ran for Congress, I've pledged to hold a town hall meeting in every county in Oregon, every year. I've already held 54 town halls this year, and I'm excited to announce 8 more in the coming week.

Beginning Saturday, I will be holding town hall meetings in Multnomah, Hood River, Columbia, Washington, Marion, Jefferson, and Clackamas counties. Those details are below.

For your easy reference, as I schedule town halls, they are always posted on my website here: https://www.wyden.senate.gov/oregon/events

Looking forward to seeing you at a town hall in the future.

- Ron

Thank you, Harry, for your service to this country. It was an honor to be a part of this inspiring event. 

Yours in Service,

8/8/17 12:45,You are invited to my Conversation with Cathy Town Hall Event,"￼ 
Dear Friend,
As you may know, I've spent this year around Eastern Washington meeting directly with people in our community. I've held a number of Coffee with Cathy events with groups of 10 to 15 people to talk about the important issues facing our region, and our country. I've held roundtable discussions, unity dinners, and tours of local businesses, all providing different and unique ways to connect with different types of people with different interests and passions. These have been productive formats and the discussions that have resulted have been substantive and informative. As I've always said, hearing from all of you makes me a better representative and a better legislator on your behalf, and these small group meetings have helped facilitate those productive conversations.  
Additionally, every August I hold a large town hall event in Spokane, and this year is no different. I invite you to come out to hear about my work in the People's House, and ask any questions that may be on your mind. Details are as follows: 
WHAT: ""Conversation with Cathy"" Town Hall Event 
WHEN: Thursday, August 10 at 5:00 PM PT
WHERE: Gonzaga University's Globe Room at Cataldo Hall
DETAILS: Register for tickets to join for the event here.
￼ 
We all have the same goal, to make Eastern Washington the best place to live, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas on how we solve the issues facing our community and country. I hope you are able to join for this conversation. 
Warmly, ￼ Cathy McMorris Rodgers Member of Congress

8/8/17 11:06,Beyond resistance: Holding Wall Street accountable,"Update | Tuesday, August 8, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 11th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: holding Wall Street accountable.
The 2008 crisis was among the greatest challenges that our country ever faced. Eight million jobs were lost. Housing values crashed, leaving millions of families faced with foreclosure, bankruptcy, and homelessness. Billions of dollars of retiree savings were wiped out, while massive taxpayer-financed bailouts were implemented. The crisis also ushered in a financial anxiety that threatened the entire world’s financial system. The resulting panic hindered growth and negatively impacted the global economy for over six years.
To make sure that a crisis like this doesn’t happen again, we should regulate, prosecute, and defend.
	•	We need to reinstate Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era bank regulation that helped promote stability in the financial industry. Not only would it remove unnecessary complexity from the financial markets, but it would also limit some types of risky bets that contributed to the Great Recession.
	•	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) was created to rein in Wall Street, end taxpayer bailouts of big banks, and protect consumers. Among the most important provisions of this legislation is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Just as American consumers are protected from products that can cause serious physical harm, they should also be protected from products that can cause financial ruin.
	•	Extending homeowners the same financial status in bankruptcy as speculators is another simple protection we should put in place. People who speculate in multiple real estate properties can use bankruptcy laws to alter their loan balances and interest rates. If homeowners were treated similarly, we could have kept hundreds of thousands of people in their homes and forced banks to be more responsible lenders. 
	•	We should prosecute wrongdoers. Sending people to jail will send a message. All of the people in U.S. prisons collectively have not stolen as much with guns as the American public, pension funds, and businesses lost in the near meltdown of the economy. Every time someone illegally profits from a financial transaction, someone else loses. Crooks, whatever the color of their collars, should be held accountable.
	•	Finally, we must defend the progress we made during the Obama administration, and block the concerted effort by some in the finance industry to hijack consumer protections and rebuild them in their favor. Regulation like Dodd-Frank and regulatory agencies like the CFPB protect people from irresponsible business practices and ensures that they do not pay the price for others’ illegal actions.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage,

Come and Read It Report
Dear Friends,
I have been back in Texas’ 25th Congressional District for a little over a week now and I’d like to take this time to keep you up-to-date with what we’ve been doing. 
As I am sure many of you heard last week, the House Committee on Ethics unanimously voted to clear me of an on-going ethics review regarding a transportation amendment I offered back in 2015, during the 114th Congress. As I have stated from the beginning, I did not violate any rules, laws or regulations. As a small business owner for my entire working life, I knew I needed to act to protect small businesses and their employees by offering this commonsense legislation. I am pleased with the Committee’s diligence and professionalism and am happy this is now behind us.
On Friday, President Trump signed into law H.R. 3298, the Wounded Officers Recovery Act of 2017, that I was an original co-sponsor of. This will allow donations made to the Capitol Police Memorial Fund to be used for Officers Crystal Griner and David Bailey, who were injured in the Alexandria Shooting back in June. I am proud of the House, Senate and President Trump for being able to turn this bill into law in just a matter of days.
Lastly, I’d like to take a moment to recognize Fort Hood Army Base. A few months ago, I testified before the House Appropriations Committee on behalf of the need for increased funding for Army barracks in Fort Hood. I have been fighting for this funding for years and I am proud to say that last Thursday, Fort Hood received $145 million. This will allow our brave men and women to have appropriate and livable housing and I am humbled to have been able to play a role in this big achievement.
I have included some articles and releases you may find interesting located on the right side of this newsletter. It is an honor and privilege to represent the people of Texas’ 25th Congressional District and as always, please reach out to me with any issues and concerns that are important to you.
Sincerely,
￼
Roger Williams
Member of Congress

Dear Friends,
Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to review some of the highlights from last week.
Securing Our Borders
In case you missed it last week, I unveiled the Border Security for America Act. 
One of the key provisions of my bill authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to build a border wall. By implementing tactical infrastructure including physical barriers, we can achieve operational control of our entire border so we know who is crossing and when. Physical barriers such as a wall, paired with technology are the key to achieving this goal.
To learn more, I co-authored a piece with Chairman Goodlatte titled 'Better border security and immigration enforcement is on the way' published on FOXnews.com.
Also, take a look at the August Terror Snapshot - just another reason why we need to secure our border. Click here or on the image below to learn more. 
￼
 
RACE for Children Act heads to the President's desk!
We ended the week with terrific news - my legislation, RACE for Children Act, passed the Senate and awaits the President's signature. 
In case you missed it, read my July McCaul Column titled ""The RACE for a Cure"" about this bill. 
It would allow the most innovative adult treatments for cancer to be studied for children use. The Senate passage of RACE is a great step forward in providing these children access to the treatments they deserve. I urge President Trump to swiftly sign this bill into law so we can give these children hope for the future. As I mentioned after we passed this bill in the House, I believe it is incumbent upon each of us – especially those elected to serve – to do our part to rid this world of cancer, for the sake of my children and yours. 
You can watch my floor speech on the bill here or by clicking on the image below.

Texans head to U.S. Service Academies
One of the greatest honors and responsibilities I have as a Member of Congress is sponsoring the best and brightest youth from TX-10 for enrollment in one of our five U.S. service academies. 
A big congratulations to this year’s TX-10 appointees: Nishanth Kalavakolanu (U.S. Air Force Academy, from Austin); Joseph Woodring (U.S. Air Force Academy, from Katy); Joseph Canterbury (U.S. Military Academy, from Austin); Brynna Johnson (U.S. Military Academy, from Cypress); Hannah Hirst (U.S. Military Academy, from Katy); Reed Marshall (U.S. Military Academy, from Giddings); Kevin Waites (U.S. Military Academy, from Manor); Andrew Pool (U.S. Naval Academy, from Tomball).
Competing with the best and brightest of America’s youth, these appointments signify years of hard work and dedication by these students. Their decision to serve our country in uniform is admirable, and I am confident the future of our nation is in good hands.   Pictured below is Andrew Pool and his family at this year’s U.S. Naval Academy Induction Day. Andrew’s sister, Natalie, also proudly wears the uniform and is currently in her final year at the Academy.   Thank you to all who are willing to serve our great nation!
￼
Congressional App Challenge   My office is participating in the Congressional App Challenge this year!
This is another great opportunity to showcase the amazing talent among students from Austin to Houston. In the first two years, this competition has reached nearly 4,000 students across 33 states. 
We must continue to invest in our students’ STEM education by providing these types of opportunities that encourage them to exercise those skills. I look forward to seeing this year’s entries and encourage all high school age students to consider submitting their application for the chance to have their creation showcased on a national stage.
Applications can be submitted anytime between July 26, 2017 and November 1, 2017.

 Building America’s Trust


After months of talking with those who live and work along the Texas border and my colleagues in Congress, this past week I introduced border security legislation called the Building America’s Trust Act.
This bill presents a strategic plan to secure the border focused on three main things: increase resources at our borders, boost trade through ports of entry, and strengthen enforcement of existing laws.
The Building America’s Trust Act is endorsed by groups like the Texas Border Sheriff’s Coalition, National Association of Police Organizations, National Sheriffs’ Association, and the National Border Patrol Council.

￼
Click here to watch the video.
It’s time to stop throwing money at the problem and hoping for the best. This legislation provides a much-needed strategic plan to secure our borders, because Texans know that a one-size-fits-all solution to border security won’t work.
The federal government needs to regain the public’s confidence when it comes to border security by restoring order and lawfulness to our immigration system, and the Building America’s Trust Act will help us do just that.

August 7, 2017
Dear Friend,
Amidst the breaking news headlines and countdown clocks, my work this year has been focused on solving problems and strengthening communities in Florida’s 12th District. You didn’t see the pundits discussing it on cable news, but I introduced more than 20 pieces of legislation since January on issues important to constituents, ranging from improving care for Veterans, to lowering generic drug prices, to supporting first responders and public safety. A number of those bills have passed the U.S. House of Representatives already, with progress being made on the others every day. 
First and foremost, as Vice Chairman of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I have made Veterans and America’s service members among my top priorities in Congress. We passed critical legislation this year to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), as well as to improve and expand the GI Bill. The VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which was signed into law on June 23, 2017, enhances the VA Secretary’s ability to remove, demote, or suspend employees for misconduct, and prevents retaliation against whistleblowers.  The House recently passed the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Education Assistance Act, also known as the Forever GI Bill, to significantly increase GI Bill funding and allow future eligible recipients to use their GI Bill benefits at any point in their lives. Proudly, this legislation also includes my provision, the VETERAN Act, which helps the VA modernize its Information Technology systems for more timely and efficient GI Bill claims processing.  More than 70,000 Veterans and their families call Florida’s 12th District home. As a grateful nation, we should be rolling out the red carpet in appreciation of their service and sacrifice.
Turning to another issue that impacts so many across Tampa Bay, I authored bipartisan legislation to lower the cost of generic prescription drugs. Too often, we have seen bad actors take advantage of monopolies in the market and astronomically raise the price of lifesaving drugs. Patients should not have to worry about the cost of the medicine they rely on skyrocketing overnight. By incentivizing lower cost generic drugs to enter markets where there is a monopoly, we are using free market solutions to increase competition and drive costs down. This important provision passed the House and the Senate as part of the unanimously approved FDA Reauthorization Act.
Following the largest health care fraud takedown in history, which included over 80 defendants charged in Florida, I recently introduced bipartisan legislation to crack down on Medicare fraud, the Medicare Civil and Criminal Penalties Update Act. Not only is fraud and abuse in Medicare an affront to hardworking taxpayers, it hurts the millions of people who rely on the program. This bill substantially increases the civil and criminal fines on those who are convicted of Medicare fraud. 
Additionally, I am proud that my bill to enhance emergency preparedness for first responders has passed the House. The Medical Preparedness and Allowable Use Act supports first responders by boosting their stockpiles of countermeasures like medical kits, protective gear, ventilators, and more. When everyone else runs away from danger, our first responders risk their lives to keep us safe during an emergency. This bill helps protect the public, and protect our protectors.
Finally, I am focused on addressing the local issues that hit closest to home. I voiced my continued support for funding the Anclote River Dredging Project in a letter to Florida state officials; brought the Ridge Road extension project to the attention of the Trump Administration as a critical public safety matter; called on CSX to fix the ongoing crossing-arm malfunctions at the intersection of U.S. 41 and State Route 54; and announced a $2 million U.S. Department of Transportation infrastructure grant for the Zephyrhills Municipal Airport.
As your representative in the U.S. Congress, I have answered over 35,000 of your emails and letters so far this year, and my dedicated team has assisted with over 500 federal agency casework issues. If you or a loved one are having problems dealing with an agency like the VA, Social Security, or the IRS, please call the New Port Richey office at 727-232-2921 and we will do everything we can to help you.

The Webster Wire
Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends:
Today, we honor the brave men and women who were wounded in combat or gave their last full measure and made the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf. Created by General George Washington on August 7, 1782 to recognize a soldier’s meritorious action, the Purple Heart is our nation’s oldest decoration. We owe our veterans a debt that we can never repay. It is due to countless lives selflessly lived and lost in defense of our country that we can stand today, free and grateful.
The sacrifice and value of our veterans cannot be overstated and many times attempts to file for benefits or compensation by our veterans results in frustration and delays. Working with veterans whose claims have gone beyond the expected time frame for processing is taken seriously at my office. My staff works diligently with liaisons and county veteran service offices to provide necessary or missing paperwork to the VA or to obtain status updates for our veterans. While we cannot guarantee a favorable outcome, or compel an agency to decide an issue contrary to established rules and regulations, we can be a connection between you and the VA to confirm your claim has not slipped through the cracks. Since January, our office has been pleased to work with veterans whose claims or appeals have been completed favorably, resulting in over $1 million in compensation, pension or retroactive payments. If you need assistance with a federal agency issue, call our district office at 352-241-9220.

 Last Wednesday at the Brooksville NOW Meeting, I was honored to present a certificate to Jackson
￼
Ruppe for his work with Operation Gratitude. Jackson created Operation Gratitude 2016 last year in an effort to provide kindness to soldiers serving overseas. Jackson’s commitment to service is to be a great conversation with Tampa Bay Partnership Investors regarding the future of the federal government’s investment in transit projects. Efficient and multimodal infrastructure adds value to our economy and our local communities. Throughout my service in the Florida state legislature and as your U.S. Representative, I have worked and will continue to work to upgrade our transportation infrastructure.

I also had the opportunity to tour Bayfront Health Brooksville and Munroe Regional – both sister hospitals. Thank you to the health care staff who provide support to patients who are at their most vulnerable.

Last week, I also had the opportunity to tour the Marion County Veterans Resource Center where I met several service organizations who are providing wonderful training programs and resources to veterans in Marion County. We owe a debt to our veterans and their families for their service and sacrifices.

Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.
A constituent from Fruitland Park contacted my office after the VA not only terminated her pension, but informed her that she owed $17,000. My office contacted the Pension Management Center on her behalf and were able to provide a timeline of events regarding the constituent’s eligibility for the pension. This allowed the Pension Management Center to determine that not only was the debt eliminated but they owed the constituent $1,000.

Kansas Common Sense  August 7, 2017
Hello,
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. 
Making Certain the Veterans Choice Program Will Continue to Serve Veterans
The Senate unanimously supported legislation last week to appropriate funding for the Veterans Choice Program, which offers veterans access to quality healthcare closer to home. As Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, I worked on this legislative funding effort to make certain veterans do not experience a lapse in their care and will be able to access it in their local communities.  Veterans in Kansas and across the country have benefitted from the access to quality and timely healthcare that the Choice network provides since its induction in 2014. Veterans deserve the best our nation has to offer, and this is a proven program that veterans like and need. I urge the president to quickly sign this bill into law so our nation’s heroes can continue to receive increased access to healthcare in their communities.  Click here for a comprehensive timeline of my work on this issue, dating back to 2014 when I first introduced the Veterans Choice Act. 
Convening Senate Commerce Subcommittee Hearing on Insurance Fraud
The total estimated cost of non-health insurance fraud in the United States is more than $40 billion annually, and in turn costs the average American family upwards of $700 per year in the form of increased premiums, according to the FBI. As Chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Insurance, I convened a hearing on insurance fraud in America and its impact on industry and – more importantly – consumers.   Insurance fraud schemes are constantly evolving and growing more complex over time. Technology will play a crucial role in catching more sophisticated fraud activity, and I appreciated the thoughtful insight of our distinguished witness panel regarding the use and efficacy of emerging technologies, data collection and consumer education practices to better detect and prevent insurance fraud.  Please watch my opening statement.  ￼  
Supporting 5G Technology Deployment Resolution
I joined colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee in introducing a bipartisan resolution in support of deploying 5G mobile broadband technology across the nation. This resolution promotes strong economic growth and job creation while simultaneously addressing the digital divide between urban and rural areas.   5G mobile broadband will continue to facilitate the development of new technologies within the Internet of Things space, like self-driving cars, robotics and smart cities. In a Senate Commerce Committee hearing last month, I called upon the Federal Communications Committee (FCC) to promote the deployment of this technology in its federal regulatory capacity so that it can benefit Kansans and Americans nationwide.
Holly Teeter Nominated to Serve as Federal Judge
The White House on Thursday evening announced the nomination of Ms. Holly Teeter of Lenexa to serve as a federal judge on the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. I know Ms. Teeter is an excellent choice for this Topeka-based seat due to her bright legal mind and wide variety of legal experience. A product of both the University of Kansas School of Engineering and School of Law, Ms. Teeter currently serves as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Western District of Missouri. Previously, she was a patent attorney in private practice after serving as a judicial law clerk in both the Western District of Missouri and the District of Kansas.  The next steps in Ms. Teeter’s confirmation will require a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and a committee vote to advance her nomination for a vote before the full Senate. I will urge my colleagues to quickly confirm Ms. Teeter. 
Army Strong with Strong Leaders
The Senate unanimously confirmed Ryan McCarthy, a retired Army Ranger of the 75th Ranger Regiment and former special assistant to former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, as Under Secretary of the Army. I had the opportunity to sit down with Mr. McCarthy prior to his confirmation to discuss the strategic importance of Ft. Riley and Ft. Leavenworth in the development of prepared and intellectual soldiers.  Having visited Ft. Riley several years ago when serving then-Defense Secretary Roberts Gates, Mr. McCarthy was instrumental in helping the secretary execute his promise of constructing new schools for Army children and families stationed there. I am encouraged by his personal experience as an Army Ranger and desire to better the lives of soldiers and their families, particularly those who call Ft. Riley home. I look forward to working with Mr. McCarthy to improve the quality of life for all Army families and help ready our troops to be Army Strong in defense of our nation.
Hosting a Townhall Meeting in Geary County
Upon my return to Kansas this week, I hosted a townhall meeting in Geary County. The American Legion Post #45 was gracious to host the visit. Our discussion covered a wide array of issues, including the ongoing conversation about healthcare, education, jobs, Fort Riley troop strength growth and taking care of our local veterans.  I appreciate so many community members spending their Friday morning with me to voice their concerns with the federal government. Thanks to the more than 80 residents who attended – including Junction City Mayor and Army Veteran Phyllis Fitzgerald – Post #45 commander Fred Meyer for the introduction, Post #45 Vice Commander Dave Hill for coordinating my visit, and Geary Community Hospital CEO Joe Stratton for providing us with helpful input on the state of healthcare in the county.  ￼  
Touring Topeka Regional Airport
I was invited to tour Topeka Regional Airport (TRA) at Forbes Field and meet with representatives of the Metropolitan Topeka Airport Authority (MTAA) on Saturday morning. I also met with representatives from the 190th Air Refueling Wing (ARW) of the Kansas Air National Guard (ANG) to learn about their partnership with MTAA.   Topeka Regional, along with Billard Airport, recently received funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation for runway and taxiway rehabilitation and improvements, in conjunction with the Kansas ANG’s monetary contribution to the TRA runway project at Forbes Field, which will provide for reinforcement of the runway.   This runway, which was built in the 1950s and is at the end of its usable lifespan, serves heavy military aircraft and is capable of landing heavy civilian aircraft when needed. To ensure the safety of military and civilian personnel, the current runway needs to be replaced – the deterioration has the potential to cause a significant danger to aircraft and their crews – and will, once completed, have an expanded life of another 30 years, allowing for long-term planning for the Air National Guard.   In addition to touring the runway construction, I discussed possible training opportunities and equipment with leadership of the 190th Air Refueling Wing of the Kansas Air National Guard.   Thanks to MTAA Director of Airports Eric Johnson and Lt. Col Jake Salmond, Base Civil Engineer, 190th ARW for hosting me, and Topeka Chamber President and CEO of GoTopeka Matt Pivarnik, Project Engineer Jay Freund, and Lt. Col. Dan Skoda, ANG, Vice Commander, 190th Air Refueling Wing for attending.

Celebrating KU Cancer Center's NCI-Designation Renewal
It was an honor to join the University of Kansas Medical Center and KU Cancer Center (KUCC) researchers and staff in celebrating KUCC’s renewal as a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Designated Cancer Center. NCI is our nation’s principal agency for cancer research and training.   This is KUCC’s first renewal of NCI designation, which secures another five years of enhanced support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to assist its efforts to discover, develop and deliver innovative treatments for cancer patients in our state and region. The renewal of this NCI designation also positions KUCC to continue to recruit the brightest researchers and scientists in the field to develop cutting-edge treatments and cures in Kansas; in turn, this advances the development of our state into a world-class research hub for medical, pharmaceutical and technological innovation.   I was proud to support KUCC in its efforts to achieve NCI-designation in 2012, and was proud to support its recent pursuit of renewal of this important designation. KUCC has made considerable advancements in the last five years, and I look forward to witnessing its future successes. Congratulations to KUCC Director Dr. Roy Jensen and his team on this outstanding achievement.  Additionally, with the renewal of KUCC's designation, Children's Mercy Hospital has become a formal consortium member institution of the Cancer Center, thereby enhancing research, clinical care and support efforts for pediatric patients and their families from throughout the region. I’m continually impressed by Kansas’s care facilities and have enjoyed watching and helping them grow into world-renowned institutions. 
￼
Meeting With Disability Developmental Agency Directors
One of the important issues for me in evaluating healthcare policy recently considered by the Senate was how these policies would impact those most in need of quality care, such as individuals with disabilities. On Friday in Manhattan, I met with executive directors of several Kansas disability developmental agencies to discuss the value of Medicaid, long-term healthcare solutions, and how policy impacts those most in need. 
I remain committed to supporting innovative ideas that improve the lives of Kansans and lower the many costs associated with healthcare. I appreciate the executive directors who participated in this discussion and look forward to continuing our dialogue. Special thanks to Jerry Michaud, DSNWK in Hays and Lori Feldkamp with Big Lakes Developmental Center for hosting the meeting. Also, thanks to Chad VonAhnen from Johnson County Developmental Supports, Colin McKenney from Starkey, Doug Wisby with MCDS, Shelia Nelson-Stout with OCCK, and Chris Gunn with InterHab for attending the meeting.

One of Indiana’s Finest Confirmed for Surgeon General Post: 
It was a privilege to vote to confirm Indiana’s own, Dr. Jerome Adams to serve as Surgeon General of the United States, last week. Dr. Adams has the experience and has demonstrated the leadership needed to promote the public health and combat some of our most pressing challenges. I am thrilled he was confirmed and look forward to working with him moving forward.
I had a chance to catch-up with Dr. Adams and offer a few words of support during his nomination hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) committee: 
￼
This is Congress’s Responsibility: 
There is growing momentum for Congress to pass a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF). It is important for our men and women in uniform to know that they have the full support of Congress and their communities back home; an AUMF provides that reassurance. I discussed the need for an AUMF on CNN’s “New Day”:
￼
Read more about my position on an AUMF in this op-ed I penned for Real Clear Defense. Additionally, I also laid out why a new AUMF is absolutely essential in a speech at the Heritage Foundation.
Commemorating 100 years of service and sacrifice: 
Senator Donnelly and I led an effort in the Senate to commission a coin to honor the American Legion’s 100th anniversary and, thanks to the bipartisan support of our colleagues, the legislation made it through the Senate last week.
The special, limited edition commemorative coin would be available for purchase starting in 2019, marking the centennial of the organization which was originally chartered by Congress in September of 1919. The Legion has been instrumental in providing support, programs, and advocacy for our nation's veterans, including influential work to help secure the passage of the G.I. Bill.
This commemorative coin will honor the Legion’s achievements and help with continued advocacy work that improves the lives of veterans. Proceeds from the sale of the commemorative coins will go toward supporting American Legion programs and efforts to continue their invaluable work on behalf of our nation's veterans and their families.
A companion version of this legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives under the leadership of Representatives Tim Walz and Phil Roe.
In your neighborhood:
A member of my team is hosting “Mobile Office Hours” in Montgomery County next Tuesday, August 15th from 10:00 – 12:00. If you are having trouble working with a Federal Agency, this is a great opportunity to get the help you need. Take a look at the flyer for full details.
￼
One more thing before you go!
If you, or someone you know, is in high school and thinking about applying to one of our nation’s prestigious military academies, I encourage you to attend one of my “Academy Days”. This is a great way to learn more about the application process and what a career in military service may entail. For more information, including dates and locations, go to Young.Senate.gov/help then click on “Academy Nominations”. 
￼
Thank you for the continued privilege to serve you in the Senate. My mission is to fight on behalf of Hoosiers and the interests that are unique to our state. I look forward to working with you, and sharing our progress, in the days ahead. Until then…
In Service,
￼

This award is a distinguished honor of service to self, nation, and world.

Junior Test Pilot School Museum Program
August 1 was a busy day. After breakfast with local veterans I headed to the Blackbird Air Park to learn about the Junior Test Pilot School Summer Museum Program. This is an 8 week program that is designed for students to learn STEM principles using the aircraft specifications, experiments, and advances at Edwards Air Force Base and Plant 42 in Palmdale. It allows kids from 5-18 to learn about aerodynamics and meet pilots and engineers from our local area. I had a great time talking with the kids, their parents and the staff and interns. Thank you to Danny Bazzell, General Manager of the Flight Test Historical Foundation and the city of Palmdale for providing these amazing opportunities for the students of the Antelope Valley.

AV College Aircraft Training Program
August 3 I had the pleasure of attending the Antelope Valley College’s Aircraft Fabrication & Assembly Rapid Training Program. This program is a great partnership between AVC and local community partners. Cohorts of 24 students take classes in compressed 8 week sessions, gaining valuable hands on training in aircraft fabrication while earning transferrable college credits. The program is rigorous with students spending well beyond 40 hours per week in this classroom and lab setting. With two cohorts, classes begin at 6:30 a.m. and end at 10 pm, six days per week. The program has a 90% job placement rate. I enjoyed meeting Ray Disepio at the open house. He will be graduating in couple of days. Congratulations to Ray and the other graduates and thank you to AVC and Ed Knudson for providing this program for our community.

Dear Friends,

Last week, I had a productive start to the August District work period traveling to different areas of the 10th and meeting with many of you. I was pleased to join elected officials and community leaders for a discussion at the Jefferson Energy Cooperative breakfast in Wrens. At the event, I provided a legislative update and took questions from the audience. The topics of the conversation and questions included health care and tax reform, the Port of Savannah, and the difficulty of getting bills passed through the Senate. Afterwards, I sat down with Jefferson Hospital’s new CEO Lou Semrad to discuss his plan for growing the hospital’s revenue. His proposal includes expanding the hospital’s lab program, participating in the 340 B Drug Program, and utilizing telemedicine in modern, creative ways. Jefferson Hospital provides access to three Physician’s Health Group Clinics (one in each area of the county) and medical emergency care for residents. 
￼

I also had the opportunity last week to tour Glascock County with Sheriff Jeremy Kelley and Commissioner Lori Boyen. My first stop was a visit to the new building space for the Sheriff's office, now located in the center of town.

While in town, I learned about some of the new businesses that have opened in the community, including Hometown Market of Gibson. Located off Warren Street, residents can get a scoop of ice cream or grab some fresh, locally grown apples, peaches, mangos, squash, snap beans, sweet potatoes, bell peppers, zucchini, carrots, and eggplant, among other quality produce. Thanks for having me!

Did you know?
Since January, the House has been pushing forward with our agenda to enact legislation to tackle the issues that matter to your family. Already this Congress, we’ve passed bills to help bolster the economy and create jobs, rebuild our military, secure our border, and fix Washington, while increasing accountability and decreasing regulation. We’ve also passed sweeping reforms to crack down on human trafficking and illegal immigration, provide better care at the VA, and impose sanctions on Iran, North Korea, and Russia. In total, the House has advanced more than 260 measures so far this year, and we’re ready and excited to do more! Read more about what the House has been up to by checking out DidYouKnow.gop courtesy of the House Republican Conference.

Purple Heart Day
Today marks National Purple Heart Day, where we honor and celebrate those who proudly served and earned America’s oldest military decoration for their wounds in combat. I am truly grateful for the generations of our brave men and women in uniform who willingly protect our country, our values, and our freedom. I cannot thank them enough for their service and sacrifice, and I encourage you to take time to thank our heroes. We, as a Nation, owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude.

WTAS: praise for the RAISE Act White House – 8/2 Representative Jody Hice: “Great bill! Addressing the ever-rising tide of chain migration, while admitting immigrants based on the skills they bring to the table.”
Military Service Academy Day Oconee County High School – 8/3 U.S. Congressman Jody Hice is hosting a Military Service Academy Day on Saturday, August 19. The event will be held from 1:30-3:30 PM at the Goldstein Center Auditorium at 325 S. Elbert Street, Milledgeville, GA During this event, students will meet and speak to representatives from the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, and the U.S. Air Force Academy.
POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: Bill would help home infusion Medicare patients News-Press Now – 8/5 “Hardworking American taxpayers are already overburdened and should not be forced to pay for a program that has vastly expanded beyond its intended scope and is riddled with waste, fraud and abuse,” Scott said. “My bill will reform the Lifeline Program and restore it to its original purpose of providing landline services and prohibit Universal Service support for mobile services. “In order to promote government accountability, cut government fraud and waste, and protect consumers from further increases to their phone bills, the Lifeline Program’s free cell phone plans should end.” The bill has 18 co-sponsors — all Republicans — including three of Scott’s Georgia colleagues — Reps. Jody Hice, Rick Allen and Drew Ferguson.
Recap: House committee holds campus free speech hearing, raises FIRE issues Foundation for Individual Rights in Education – 7/31 Speech codes were also front and center during the hearing. Rep. Jody Hice, for example, wanted to know why speech codes continue to proliferate despite a string of court decisions striking them down. Hice: Now we’ve got these … these speech codes in place… We have court decisions… overwhelmingly have ruled against a majority of the speech codes in universities, and yet to this day about 40% of our colleges still have speech codes in place against what has been determined by the rule of law. And why is that? Strossen: You know, law is not self-enforcing. The Constitution is not self enforcing. We still have segregated schools all these decades after Brown vs. Board of Education, and that’s why it’s so important for organizations like the ACLU, FIRE, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, to be able to bring lawsuits to actually enforce principles. I mean the examples of using so-called “time, place and manner restrictions” as a pretext for suppressing ideas, that’s illegal and unconstitutional, but you have to bring a lawsuit in order to vindicate that position.

Dear Friend,  
We all know that the fight to defend the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and its critical protections is not over. Your voice and your opinions remain essential to this debate. That's why for the past month I've asked you to tell me your thoughts on efforts to repeal this landmark law. So far, I've received thousands of responses from people across Monroe County. 
Here's a topline look at what you have to say: 
Eighty percent of respondents do not support Congressional Republicans' efforts to repeal the ACA, 78 percent say they want bipartisan collaboration on improving health care, and 92 percent disagree with what I believe are the Majority's plans to make older Americans pay premiums five-times higher than others. 
I hear your concerns and they are my top priority moving forward. Like the majority of you, I strongly oppose efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and recently joined more than 80 of my colleagues in developing bipartisan solutions to improve the health care law. These improvements include getting more people covered under the ACA, guaranteeing affordable options, and allowing some people approaching retirement age to buy into Medicare. 
I believe that protecting health care and strengthening the Affordable Care Act are a part of members of Congress' obligation to the people we serve. 
As I said, this debate is not over, which is why I won't stop fighting for Rochester families. 
 Sincerely, ￼ Louise M. Slaughter

Last Week in Congress
We Must Help Working Families in Tax Reform
￼ ￼ Click here to read the full article on the PACE Act from the Kansas City Star.
Paying for quality, affordable care for young children is one of the most important line items on every working familys budget. These days its become a larger and larger number, making it more and more difficult for families to find the right solutions, and in some cases even creating a disincentive for both parents to enter the workforce. As we work to reform our tax code in Congress, were working on ways to help Americans keep more of their hard-earned money and grow our economy so they can take home even more of it.
 
That's why I joined my colleague Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) in introducing the Promoting Affordable Childcare for Everyone (PACE) Act, legislation that makes important updates and reforms to the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) and Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) to help middle class and low-income families pay for care for children and other dependents. Were modernizing the way the tax code treats childcare expenses by improving access to the childcare tax credit and flex spending accounts. More Americans will be able to pay for the cost of childcare, which means more Americans in the workforce helping our economy grow. It means more opportunity and more prosperity for the families who are the backbone of this country.
 
￼
￼
Click here to read the full article from Business Insider about Kevin and Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) coming together to make childcare more affordable.
 
Across the country, the high cost of childcare is a barrier for parents who try to work full time and provide safe, quality care for their children. In many states, the cost of full-time childcare is so high that it rivals the average costs of housing or in-state tuition at public universities. Lower-income families are hurt the most by this, as childcare costs on average make up more than 30 percent of their income.
 
According to the Economic Policy Institute, the average annual cost of care for one infant in Kansas is $11,201, which comes out to about $933 per month and almost 18 percent of a typical Kansas familys income. Its about 26 percent higher than the average cost of renting a home and about 52 percent higher than in-state tuition for a four-year public college. According to their research, childcare for two children  an infant and a four-year-old, for example  costs $19,152, which is about 31 percent of a typical familys income.
What the Bill Does: 
The PACE Act makes important updates and reforms to the tax provisions that help families care for children and other dependents. Specifically, the bill:
Improves and modernizes the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) by:
	•	Making the credit refundable. This change will allow the credit to help low-income working parents, whose low or zero tax liabilities prevent them from benefiting from the current CDCTC.
	•	Increasing the value of the credit. The PACE Act raises the credit rate for all families, with a new top rate of 50 percent that phases down to 35 percent for higher-income families
	•	Indexing the credit to inflation. This will help the CDCTC keep pace with rising childcare costs in the future.
Enhances Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) by:
	•	Increasing the amount of pre-tax dollars that families can put into FSAs from $5,000 to $7,500. This money is excluded from gross income and allows families to reduce their tax burden while paying for important care for dependents.
	•	Indexing the new cap to inflation so that FSAs are updated steadily and families can save enough money to pay for childcare.
How the Bill Impacts Families: 
The PACE Act will make tangible improvements to American families ability to pay for childcare. For example:
Low income family of four making less than $15,000 a year:
	•	Current law: receives zero CDCTC benefit.
	•	PACE Act: maximum annual CDCTC refund of $3,000 to help pay for childcare.
Middle class family of four making $55,000 a year:
	•	Current law: maximum annual CDCTC benefit of $1,200.
	•	PACE Act: maximum annual CDCTC benefit of $2,100, which is $900 more to help pay for childcare.

President Signs Sanctions Bill into Law
￼
I'm glad to see President Trump signed the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act into law last Wednesday. Prior the this important bill making it's way to the President's desk, the House and Senate quickly passed the legislation in a bipartisan fashion the week prior. This bill sanctions Russia, Iran, and North Korea for their continued threats to the United States national security with a range of aggressive acts. Vladimir Putin has ordered cyberattacks on the US, and continues to support a murderous regime in Syria. Iran and North Korea continue their march to obtaining nuclear weapons. It's time we held these dangerous, rogue regimes accountable. 
￼
Standing Up for Veterans
Supporting our nations nearly 22 million veterans is one of the most important roles of the federal government. These are the men and women who have risked their lives, and who have lost friends and family members defending our freedoms, and are now home looking to us to protect and defend them. Last week, I spent the day meeting with and touring facilities dedicated to our veterans. 
VA Kansas City Medical Center
￼
First, I met with Kathleen Fogarty, Director of the Kansas City VA Medical Center, and toured the Shawnee Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC). Once construction is complete, the Shawnee CBOC will provide clinical health and wellness services to veterans in Johnson County and the surrounding area. Its an important project Ive been proud to support through my role on the Appropriations Committee in our work on the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bills over the last several years. Two weeks ago, the FY18 bill passed as a part of our security funding package, and included the highest funding level to care for our veterans in our nations history.
￼
Military & Veterans Advisory Committee at VFW Post #846
￼
My second stop on my veterans tour was at VFW Post 846 in Overland Park to meet with my Military & Veterans Advisory Committee. This group of veterans come from across the four service branches and served in combat from Vietnam through Post-9/11 conflicts. They bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table and periodically meet with me to provide advice and counsel on veterans issues being debated in Congress. Our discussion included access to VA health care and accountability of VA employees, continuation of the VA Choice Program, VA tele-medicine, and the need to end veterans homelessness.
Weve passed several pieces of legislation this year to address these issues head on, all with my strong support. Most recently, Congress unanimously reauthorized the Veterans Choice Program that helps veterans to see a private doctor if they are facing long waits or travel times. Its a vital program enacted in response to the 2014 scandal that exposed how bad  and deadly  the backlogs at the VA had become. I want to thank the Advisory Committee members for joining me and as always thank them for their counsel.
￼
Veterans Community Project
￼
My third stop was a visit to the Veterans Community Project campus, where I toured the Veterans Outreach Center and adjoining property called Veterans Village. Veterans Village will include a community network of tiny homes and services dedicated to supporting every man and woman who took the oath for our country. The Veterans Community Project has completed 10 homes so far. With assistance from the government of Kansas City , Missouri and many volunteer contractors, and infrastructure improvements, the Veterans Community Project hopes to place homeless veterans in homes by Thanksgiving.
￼
Small Business & Technology
StoneLock in Olathe
￼ KMBC 9 News Kansas City reports on Kevin's visit to StoneLock.
I enjoyed touring the facilities and speaking with employees of StoneLock, an amazing small business manufacturer of biometric facial recognition technology in Olathe. Thanks to Colleen Dunlap, the CEO of StoneLock, for having me and showing me the impressive technology in the facility. After visiting with me at StoneLock in Olathe, Colleen took part in a special meeting at the White House on Tuesday, meeting with President Trump and other small business leaders - an incredible accomplishment. 
￼
Law Enforcement
Olathe Police Department 
￼ Kevin meeting with the Olathe Police Department.
The men and women of law enforcement across the Third District put their lives on the line every day to keep our community safe. Making sure they have the resources they need to meet their mission, and making sure they are given the respect and gratitude they deserve is something I take very seriously in my role as a community leader and Member of Congress. Thats why Ive supported measures like the Rapid DNA Act, a bill thats headed to the Presidents desk for signature that would give police the tools to do virtually immediate DNA testing to help solve crimes and exonerate those who are innocent.
Ive also joined my colleagues in passing the Thin Blue Line Act, the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act to help encourage the hiring of veterans as police officers, Kates Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act to end the practice of sanctuary cities, and supported the use of body cameras throughout our communities. I enjoyed speaking with members of the Olathe Police Department last week about these issues and more at the Olathe Citizens Police Advisory Council, and want to thank Keith Brown for inviting me.
￼
Local Public Education
Olathe West High School
￼ Kevin with Principal Jay Novacek.
We have some of the most amazing schools in the country right here in the Third District and we have a great new addition in Olathe West High School. I had the privilege of taking a tour of this incredible new high school with Principal Jay Novacek and Olathe Public Schools Superintendent John Allison as finishing touches were being done in classrooms and collaborative learning spaces, teachers were moving in, and band camp was in session. Olathe West will be home to the Public Safety and Green Technology Programs, two of OSDs 21st Century Academy Programs. Olathe West is the fifth public high school in the Olathe School District and will open this fall. It features a piece of the World Trade Center, a remnant of the September 11th Terror Attacks given to the school as a gift in honor of their 21st Century Academy Public Safety Program.
Good luck to all of the staff, administrators, and students entering Olathe West High School as you begin many new traditions for future generations of Olathe West Owls. Thank you to Principal Jay Novacek and Superintendent John Allison for taking the time to share your amazing new school with me.
￼
Olathe School District Superintendent John Allison
￼ Kevin speaking with John Allison on early-childhood education, school funding, and more.
It was great to welcome John Allison back to the Third District last week as the new Superintendent of the Olathe Public Schools. John began his teaching career in the Spring Hill school district, he was a teacher, administrator, and associate superintendent in the Shawnee Mission School District, and has most recently served as superintendent of the Wichita Public Schools.
We spent time together discussing early-childhood education, school funding, the Olathe School District 21st Century Academy program, and his thoughts on models of educational delivery in preparing students for their futures. It was great getting acquainted and I want to wish John all the best as he takes over the second largest school district in the state of Kansas.
￼
Medical Research
KU Cancer Center
￼ Click here to watch a video clip of Kevin's remarks on Instagram (@RepKevinYoder).
Last week, the KU Cancer Center celebrated its redesignation as a National Cancer Institute (NCI) and I was honored to participate in the ceremony at the campus in KCK. I spoke about my commitment to the next generation of researchers to continue increasing federal funding for biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). As I've met with researchers, scientists, and doctors across the Third District and the entire country, I've been told that we have more brilliant ideas than we have dollars and time to research them. That's where Congress comes in, and through continued funding for research, I know that KU is going to continue to be the flagship of the world when it comes to researching cures and treatments to diseases. 
￼
Parks & Recreation
New City Center and Civic Campus in Lenexa
￼
Congratulations to the City of Lenexa Mayor Michael Boehm and the City Council on the ribbon cutting for the new City Center and Civic Campus, unveiled last Monday before an impressive crowd of people from across the community. A lot of long-term planning went into this project, and it was great to see the new City Hall, Rec Center, and Public Market in person.
It was also great to welcome Park University to Lenexa, as the university is partnering with the city in the Lenexa Campus Center and will be open for classes this coming Fall.
￼

Fact of the Week
Over the last 25 years, businesses under one year old have created 2 million jobs per year, which is 20% of all jobs created in that period. 
Third District Trivia 
￼
Olathe West High School, opening up this fall as the fifth high school in the Olathe School District, will be represented by the Owl as its mascot. Can you name the four other bird mascots for the Olathe high schools? 
Send your answers to haley.brady@mail.house.gov and the first correct response will receive a shout out in next week's newsletter.
Congratulations to last week's winner Carl Silkwood from Overland Park!
Last week's answer:  Recently, Congress passed the Forever GI Bill to improve and extend the benefits for veterans found in the GI Bill. The original GI Bill was signed into law on June 22,1944 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Dear Lindsey,
Last week, the Senate unanimously passed the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Education Assistance Act. I cosponsored this bill, which will provide the biggest expansion of college aid for military veterans in the last decade. This legislation will increase veterans' education benefits and make much-needed updates for reservists, Purple Heart recipients, veterans who face school closures while enrolled, and surviving family members. You can read my full release on this bill, which awaits the President's signature, here.
You may also be interested to know that the Senate Appropriations Committee recently passed the Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Milcon-VA Appropriations bill, which provides critical support and care for our veterans and their families. As an Army veteran, I take particular pride in serving as a senior member on the committee that drafted and approved this bill. Our service members, military families, and veterans represent what is best in the American spirit, and I have long worked to ensure that they have access to the care and assistance they need and deserve.
This funding bill includes $182 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a $5 billion increase over FY17 enacted levels. It also contains language that I authored with Senator Patty Murray to help ensure that veterans who are totally disabled as a result of their service-connected disabilities receive a complete discharge of their student loan debt.
I also voted for an amendment that would have added an additional $1.6 billion in funding for the VA. Specifically, this amendment would have provided more resources to support new personnel costs and funds for State Extended Care Facilities. Unfortunately, this amendment was defeated.
Additionally, you may be pleased to know that this legislation does not include the cuts proposed in the President's budget that would reduce assistance for veterans receiving individual unemployability benefits. This funding bill now awaits consideration by the full Senate.
Please know that I will continue my work on behalf of service members, veterans, and their families with your thoughts and concerns in mind.
Sincerely,   Jack Reed United States Senator

8/7/17 16:10,Remembering a Mississippi War Hero,"￼ 
August 7, 2017

Dear Friend, 

Last week, we lost a Mississippi war hero. Retired Command Sergeant Major (CSM) Lawrence E. ""Rabbit"" Kennedy answered the call to serve our nation and distinguished himself on the battlefield. He proudly served our nation in WWII, the Korean War, and Vietnam. CSM Kennedy demonstrated the true character of what it means to be an American hero. He was devoted to military service and served as an example for others to follow.

CSM Kennedy was awarded four Legions of Merit, four Bronze Stars, and five Army Commendations. You can see memorabilia from CSM Kennedy's legendary career at the Amory Regional Museum where a room has been dedicated in his honor. CSM Kennedy had many achievements while in service to our nation. He was equally dedicated to his fellow man back home. CSM Kennedy will be missed.

ACTIONS IN THE HOUSE

What We Have Accomplished in the 115th Congress

Since the beginning of the 115th Congress, the House has made significant progress with legislation that strengthens our national defense readiness capabilities, addresses the healthcare crisis in our nation, and enhances medical care for veterans and their families. We have also passed bills that will grow our economy and create jobs by getting rid of burdensome government regulations. As of June 30, the House has passed 269 bills. More bills have been passed out of the House in the first six months of this Congress than the past four administrations. 53 bills have passed the House, the Senate and President Trump has signed them into law. 15 bills have passed the House repealing regulations and 14 of those have been signed into law.

Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Update)

President Trump has signed into law, H.R. 3364, the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. I fully supported this bill which passed the House and the Senate. The United States will not tolerate regimes that attempt to undermine U.S. national security and threaten our allies.


LISTENING TO OUR CONSTITUENTS

Last week, we talked about some of the most important issues facing our nation with members of the New Albany Rotary Club. It was important to talk about our shared concerns on national defense, healthcare, and burdensome regulations.

I look forward to hearing from more constituents as we travel throughout the First District during the month of August.


MISSISSIPPI WELCOME CENTER ANNIVERSARY

Mississippians are known for their hospitality. We like to make people feel welcome. The team at the Mississippi Welcome Center in Tremont make that their mission every day.

￼

They recently celebrated their 25th anniversary. Last year, 388,000 visitors stopped by, making this the busiest welcome center in Mississippi. 


BACK TO SCHOOL

It is important for our children to have the best education possible. We are fortunate in the First District to have administrators and teachers who give their all to make that happen.

8/7/17 16:00,NEWS: Our Bipartisan Bills to Help Veterans Head to President Trump's Desk,"
￼
￼
Dear Lindsey,
We have great news for you! Congress has put politics aside to unanimously pass three of our bipartisan bills to reform the VA and deliver better care and benefits to Montana veterans.   Two of our bills are now sitting on the President’s desk waiting to be signed into law.  As Ranking Member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I worked with Republicans and Democrats to draft these bills that will strengthen the VA and community care, tackle the massive disability appeals backlog, and break down barriers to higher education for Montana veterans. While the challenges at the VA are many, our legislation will address some of the most pressing issues facing veterans.
 
STRENGTHENING VA AND COMMUNITY CARE
Veterans continually tell me that they like the care they get at the VA, but when that care isn’t accessible they want the option of seeing a private doctor.  So when the Choice Program was slated to run out of funds sooner than expected, I made sure that our bill struck a balance between strengthening VA care and ensuring the Choice Program doesn’t cause any more heartburn for Montana veterans.  Our VA Choice and Quality Employment Act will also allow the VA to move into a new, larger clinic in Missoula, bring more Physician Assistants to the VA, and address crippling VA workforce shortages by:

	•	Streamlining the hiring process for hard-to-fill positions. 
	•	Expanding a private-public sector partnership to foster innovation and better practices at the VA. 
	•	Incentivizing former VA employees to come back to work at the VA after leaving for the private sector. 
	•	Increasing recruitment of talented students and recent graduates to work at the VA. 
	•	Creating a VA-wide database for vacant and hard-to-fill positions. 
 
TACKLING THE DISABILITY APPEALS BACKLOG
More than 470,000 veterans are waiting for the VA to make a determination about what benefits they can or cannot receive. That's because the appeals process can take up to three years and is complex, inefficient, and confusing.
We have been working with veterans and advocates for several years to reform the appeals system and we hit a major milestone last week when both the House and Senate unanimously passed our Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act.
This bill will let veterans choose an appeals path that works best for them. Instead of always relying on bureaucrats in Washington, it allows decisions to be made locally.  This flexibility will ensure veterans and their families get answers more quickly and I expect the bill to be signed into law very soon.
 
BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS TO EDUCATION
The #ForeverGIBill is on its way to the President’s desk to be signed into law, less than one week after it unanimously passed the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee.  This bill strikes down the arbitrary 15-year window for veterans to use their G.I. Bill education benefits so they can get an education when it works best for them.  The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Education Assistance Act makes other much-needed investments in the futures of those who have served by:
	•	Permitting members of the National Guard and Reserve who are training, deployed, or undergoing certain medical treatment related to their service to accrue benefits like active duty service members. 
	•	Extending the Yellow Ribbon Enhancement Program, which provides education benefits to survivors of those who died in the line of duty. 
	•	Restoring benefits to student veterans who receive credits or training from certain educational institutions that subsequently close. 
	•	Extending full education benefits to recipients of the Purple Heart. 
	•	Providing more on-campus educational and vocational counseling services for veterans. 
As important as these reforms are, we need to make sure the VA is staffed to implement them in a timely fashion.  That's why I’m pleased to let you know that the Senate unanimously confirmed six of President Trump’s nominees to serve at the VA and as Judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.  And to honor the sacrifice and commitment of generations of Montanans, the Senate unanimously passed our bill to name three VA facilities after Montana heroes. The VA clinic in Missoula will be name after David J. Thatcher, who received the Silver Star for participating in the Doolittle Raid over Tokyo. One VA Clinic in Billings will be named after Benjamin C. Steele, a survivor of the Bataan Death March. And another VA Clinic in Billings will be named after Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow, an Army infantry scout awarded numerous American and foreign medals, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom. This bill now heads to the House for approval.  So far this year, the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee has held 13 hearings, screened and passed seven nominees, debated 42 pieces of legislation, heard from 50 veterans and advocates and 21 VA officials.   We have sent four bipartisan pieces of legislation to the President’s desk, and President Trump has already signed two of them into law.  But we’re not done yet. While I’m proud of the work we have accomplished, there is much more we must do to ensure that veterans in every corner of Montana have access to quality health care and benefits. And you can be sure I'm working hard to get that done.

8/7/17 15:50,Highlights From The House,"￼

 
Dear Friend,  Medicaid Matters in Vermont   At a press conference at the Vermont Statehouse, Peter joined Senator Leahy, Senator Sanders, and Governor Scott in highlighting the importance of federal Medicaid funding to Vermont, which he believes is at risk under the majority health care bill. “This isn’t an abstract policy debate,” Peter insisted. “This legislation would have devastating consequences for Vermonters and for our community hospitals.”
 ￼
 Peter is joined by Senator Leahy, Senator Sanders, and Gov. Scott to deliver the message: Medicaid matters in Vermont.
Improving the Affordable Care Act  Peter joined nine House colleagues in unveiling a five-part plan to improve the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The plan, Solutions Over Politics, would stabilize the individual insurance marketplace where insurance premiums have skyrocketed and some insurers have ceased participation. The initiative would protect those with pre-existing conditions, stabilize premiums, and promote enrollment in health plans. “Rather than repealing or replacing a landmark law that has expanded quality health care to millions of Americans, the focus of Congress should be on improving the Affordable Care Act,” Peter urged.  On House Budget Proposal: “I Will Vigorously Oppose”  Peter strongly opposed the House GOP budget proposal, which was unveiled this month. “It doubles down on defense spending and tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans funded by slashing environment programs, food and heating assistance, housing programs, job training, and student financial aid,” Peter said in a statement. “I will vigorously oppose this budget every step of the way.”  Renewing the Northern Border Regional Commission  Peter joined House colleagues representing districts along the U.S. Canadian border in introducing the Northern Border Regional Commission Reauthorization Act of 2017, which would reauthorize the Northern Border Regional Commission for five years. “Its success demonstrates that providing seed money to boost local economic and community development projects not only sparks local economic activity but also lays the groundwork for long-term investment in the region,” Peter explained.  Listening to Vermonters  At a Congress in Your Community event at Kingdom Taproom in St. Johnsbury, Peter listened to Vermonters’ hopes and concerns about Congress and the Administration.

Improving Health Care
￼
On Monday, I met at the White House with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and governors to discuss a path forward to repeal and replace Obamacare.
We had a productive meeting.  There are many ideas in the Graham-Cassidy-Heller and Patient Freedom Acts that can be next steps.  I will continue to discuss these ideas with the administration, governors and folks back home, because the American people need relief from Obamacare.
 
Strengthening Mental Health Services
￼
This week, Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz was confirmed as the first Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Abuse at the Department of Health and Human Services.  This position was created by legislation introduced by myself and Senator Chris Murphy called The Mental Health Reform Act of 2016, which passed into law as part of the 21st Century Cures Act.
The confirmation of Dr. McCance-Katz is one more step in fixing our broken mental health system.  I look forward to working with Dr. McCance-Katz towards better care for the mentally ill.
 
Supporting Fisheries
￼
On Tuesday, I unveiled legislation to address long-term solutions for red snapper recreational management in the private recreational sector.  Earlier this year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced a three-day red snapper season for recreational anglers, which the Department of Commerce had to extend for another 39 days.
A long-term solution is overdue.  While the health of the red snapper fishery improved, access for recreational fishermen and Louisiana families declined.  The Red Snapper Act ensures better management and protections to keep the fishery thriving.
 
Honoring Heroes
￼
On Friday, the United States Coast Guard honored David Phuong with the Silver Lifesaving Award for his heroic efforts to save the lives of a woman and her dog during the Great Flood of 2016.  His boat mates Brandon Barrett, Jason Dixon and Robbie Reynold were also honored with Meritorius Public Service Medals.
It is important that we honor those who serve us.  If you are a veteran and never received a medal that you earned, or if you have a family member who became an Eagle Scout or received an academic honor, let us know and we will be glad to help you be recognized.

On Wednesday, I had the privilege of greeting a group of veterans visiting Washington, D.C., with HonorAir Knoxville. The 136 Vietnam War veterans visited the memorial built in their honor, as well as the World War II Memorial, and Korean War Memorial. They also witnessed the changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery.

Committee hearings on stabilizing Tennessees individual health insurance market
The Senate health committee I chair will hold hearings beginning in September on the actions Congress should take to stabilize the individual health insurance market. Unless Congress acts by the end of September, many of the 350,000 Tennesseans who buy health insurance in the individual marketsongwriters, farmers, the self-employedface the real prospect of having zero options to buy insurance in 2018 and 2019. Many who do not receive a government subsidy to purchase health insurance will find themselves unable to afford health insurance because of rising premiums, co-pays, and deductibles. At our hearings we will hear from state insurance commissioners, patients, governors, health care experts and insurance companies on actions we can take.
Our state insurance commissioner, Julie Mix-McPeak called these hearings a positive step in the right direction. She has previously said the individual health insurance market in Tennessee is very near collapse.
There are a number of issues with the American health care system, but if your house is on fire, you want to put out the fire, and the fire in this case is the individual health insurance market. Both Republicans and Democrats agree on this. Our committee had a hearing on February 1 on this subject, and well work intensively between now and the end of September in order to finish our work in time to have an effect on the health insurance policies sold in 2018.
In my opinion, any solution that Congress passes for a 2018 stabilization package would need to be small, bipartisan and balanced. It should include funding for the cost-sharing reductions, but it also should also include greater flexibility for states in approving health insurance policies.
You can read more about our work to stabilize the individual health insurance market here. 
Senate sends President Trump bill to speed cures and treatments to patients 
On Thursday, the Senate passed bipartisan legislation that I co-authored to help speed safe drugs and medical devices into patients medicine cabinets and doctors offices. The first step was last years passage of 21st Century Cures to spur medical research, and this is the next stepensuring patients see the benefits of those research advancements. The legislation includes four different user fee agreements that allow the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to accept user fees from the manufacturers of drugs and devices. If you have a family member with cancer, Alzheimers, or diabetes, you want FDA to move as quickly as it can to get safe drugs and medical devices through the regulatory process to patients, and these user fees support the FDA reviewers responsible for approving new treatments and cures. 
Filling out the NLRB and righting the board 
On Wednesday, I wrote an op-ed encouraging the Senate to reverse the trend of an activist National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and bring stability to our nations workplaces by voting on two nominees who will fill long-vacant openings on the board. On Wednesday, the Senate took the first step by voting to approve one nominee, Marvin Kaplan. While board partisanship didnt start under the last administration, it did become much worse. Just imagine that you are one of the 700,000 Americans who owns and runs your own franchise. Successfully operating a franchise business is one of the best ways to climb the ladder of success. In 2015, the NLRB issued a decision creating a new ""joint-employer"" standard that discourages companies from franchising. It was the biggest attack on the opportunity for small-business men and women to make their way into the middle class in years. My hope is that filling the open seats on the NLRB will restore the board to its intended purpose of acting as a neutral umpire after years of playing the role of advocate. 
 
￼
 
 
Its always great to welcome Tennesseans to Washington, D.C. If youre visiting Washington, be sure to visit my website to learn about how my office can arrange tours. 
 
 
 
Advancing Seven of President Trumps nominees 
On Wednesday, the committee I chair  the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee  voted to approve seven of the presidents nominees, five who will serve in the Department of Health and Human Services and two who will be members of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. On Thursday, the Senate approved six of these nominees, and they can now begin their work addressing workplace safety and helping improve and protect the health of all Americans.
 
￼
 
 On Wednesday, Sen. Corker and I met with mayors from around the country, including Clarksville Mayor Kim McMillan. I said if there was one thing I recommended that they focus on, it would be the Marketplace Fairness Act, because I dont think the federal government should be telling cities and states what their tax policies should be.
 
Congressman Jimmy Duncan has dedicated his life to service
Last Monday, Congressman John J. Duncan Jr. announced he would not seek another term in office. I am proud that Jimmy Duncan has served Tennessees 2nd district and been my congressman for nearly three decades  and has been recognized as the most conservative member of the House for about that long. No one has done a better job of staying in touch with his constituents than Jimmy has. Honey and I thank Jimmy and Lynn and their family for their dedication to our state.

Dear Friend,
Last week, we learned that in a conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, President Trump said that he won New Hampshire because “New Hampshire is a drug-infested den.”
I was disappointed, along with most Granite Staters, by these rude and ignorant comments. At a time when we need to be working together to address the opioid epidemic, Mr. Trump is making disparaging remarks about New Hampshire to foreign leaders while not taking enough action at home to promote policies that will help our response to the substance misuse crisis. Instead, he continues to promote efforts to roll back access to healthcare for thousands of Granite Staters. I’ve found willing partners in both Republicans and Democrats to work together in addressing the national opioid crisis by focusing on creating comprehensive and long-lasting solutions. The President’s comments show that he does not fully understand the gravity of this issue and the need to work together collaboratively on real solutions, and I ask him to apologize to all Granite Staters. 
I remain concerned with the current situation at the Manchester VA Medical Center and am committed to ensuring facilities are providing quality care to our veterans. On Friday, I met with Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin. I appreciate the Secretary’s visit to New Hampshire and the seriousness being given to allegations of quality of care issues at the Manchester VAMC. However, major questions remain. That’s why I announced last week that I will be convening a hearing of the House Veterans’ Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations in New Hampshire on September 18th. This hearing will examine quality of care issues at the Manchester VAMC as well as challenges in access to care for New Hampshire veterans. I have invited the whistleblowers who raised the issues of care at Manchester to testify. I’m hopeful that by bringing the Subcommittee to New Hampshire, we will be able to gain a greater appreciation for what went wrong in Manchester, how we can fix those issues, and how we can prevent this from happening elsewhere. Granite State veterans deserve better, and we must ensure that they are able to access the services and care they need. 
￼

As your Congresswoman, I’m also committed to supporting our local farmers, who play a critical role in our state’s economy. Last week, I introduced the Homegrown Organic Act of 2017, a bill that will modify three existing conservation programs to incentivize farmers who wish to transition to organic agriculture.  Organic agriculture is the fastest growing sector of the U.S. food industry, with demand for sales far exceeding the domestic supply.  In New Hampshire, organic farms play a role in preserving our environment and natural landscape, as well as providing fresh quality food to thousands of consumers. My legislation aims to boost American production of organic products by assisting farmers who are working towards USDA Organic Certification, a process that can take up to three years. It’s my hope that we can expand organic farming in our state by encouraging more farmers to transition to organic. 
In addition to enjoying these beautiful summer days in the Granite State, I encourage you to use your voice and let your elected officials know what is on your mind. I look forward to hearing your concerns and ideas on how to make our state safer and stronger. You can always call my office with any questions, concerns, or ideas you have, as well. My Concord office can be reached at 603-226-1002 and my Washington, DC office at 202-225-5206. 
Thank you for everything you do to make our state such a wonderful place to work, live, and raise a family. I hope you have a great week!                                        ￼

NEWS FROM THE 2ND DISTRICT
Dear Lindsey,
Twenty-six years in the military taught me not to walk by a problem. Since taking the oath of office I have focused on tackling some of the toughest problems my constituents and our country face. The recent debate over the future of our health-care system makes it clear to me that now is the time to address this difficult problem and to act.
For the last several weeks, I have been co-leading a small working group of Republicans and Democrats as part of the Problem Solvers Caucus — 43 Members of Congress, nearly evenly split Democrat/Republican — to find common ground on the urgent issue of stabilizing the individual health care market and providing relief to individuals, families and small businesses.

Building Situational Awareness on the Border Air assets are a critical part of the technology required to build situational awareness for operations and tactical strategy on the border, and they are especially crucial in Tucson. 50% of marijuana comes through the Tucson sector, and in the hot summer there are deaths in the desert and air assets are vital to reach people before it is life threatening. While chairing a Homeland Security Committee hearing I questioned U.S. Customs and Border Protection on the future of air assets in Tucson, and they shared the news that they plan on testing additional unmanned aerial vehicles to fill security gaps in Arizona this month.

The United States Department of Homeland Security's current situational awareness and operational control of the border is inadequate. In order to effectively secure the border, we must first assess the threats that exist, understand and identify the gaps in our defenses and then develop a plan to address those gaps with a blend of more manpower, technology, and infrastructure. That's why I introduced a bill requiring a complete mile-by-mile assessment of the border.

Addressing the pipeline break  I joined with Sen. McCain, Sen. Flake, and Rep. Grijalva to urge the International Boundary and Water Commission to work with the City of Nogales to resolve the International Outfall Interceptor sewage pipeline break. The break has left our border community exposed to over 10 million gallons of untreated sewage waste.

Funding S. AZ military assets  As a 26-year veteran of the Air Force, I am committed to ensuring that our military has the resources it needs to be prepared at all times and that our veterans receive proper care. I voted in favor of legislation to restore readiness shortfalls, give our troops a pay raise, and invest in equipment and training for our troops to counter ISIS and other threats. The bill also provides funding for better and increased access to care for our veterans, and fully funds Southern Arizona's key defense assets.Click HERE to read my full statement.
￼
Strengthening C-TPAT   In Arizona, we understand both the vital economic importance of cross-border commerce as well as the need to secure the border against terrorists. The Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program helps with both. This global supply chain security program led by U.S. Customs and Border Protection improves the security of private companies' supply chains against terrorist activity. It’s been 11 years since C-TPAT first began, and it is time for it to be updated to reflect our modern global economy. I introduced a bill to reauthorize and strengthen this key program.

President Trump Should Fire the Leakers in the White House
On Thursday, Senator Corker encouraged President Trump and his chief of staff, General John Kelly, to fire every single person in the White House who is suspected of leaking information, infighting, or undermining the administration.

Congressman Duncan's Leadership and Voice Will Be Missed
Last week, Senator Corker released the following statement after U.S. Representative John J. Duncan Jr. (R-Tenn.) announced he will not seek re-election in 2018.
My friend Jimmy Duncan has represented the people of the 2nd District well for more than three decades in Congress, said Corker. I appreciate his no-nonsense, principled approach to public service and will sincerely miss his leadership and voice as a member of our delegation. I wish him, his wife, Lynn, and their family all the best as they prepare to enter this next chapter of their lives.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Passes the Taylor Force Act
On Thursday, Senators Corker and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) praised Senate Foreign Relations Committee passage of legislation demanding the Palestinian Authority end its policy of rewarding terrorism. The Taylor Force Act, legislation introduced by Graham and Corker, would restrict U.S. economic aid to the West Bank and Gaza until the Palestinian Authority stops paying terrorists guilty of violence against Israelis and Americans. The bill is named after a Vanderbilt University graduate student who was killed in a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv last year.
We absolutely cannot accept a policy that rewards acts of terrorism like the one that tragically took the life of Taylor Force, said Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. This legislation will force the Palestinian Authority to make a choice: either face the consequences of stoking violence or end this detestable practice immediately. I thank Senator Graham for his important role in this effort and look forward to this bill becoming law.

Combatting Online Sex Trafficking and Modern Slavery
Senator Corker, a leader in efforts to end modern slavery at home and abroad, last week joined 19 of his Senate colleagues to introduce the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act. The narrowly-crafted legislation will target online sex trafficking by providing victims the opportunity to seek justice against websites, such as Backpage.com, that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking and allowing law enforcement officials to take action against these websites.
 This legislation will play an important role in the fight against online sex trafficking by ensuring victims have an opportunity to seek justice and enabling law enforcement officials to take action against websites like Backpage that facilitate this horrific crime, said Corker. This scourge on humanity knows no borders or boundaries, and I remain committed to efforts that will help end human trafficking and modern slavery worldwide.
Corker is a leader in efforts to end modern slavery at home and abroad. In addition to cosponsoring bills to strengthen anti-human trafficking measures domestically, Corker previously proposed the End Modern Slavery Initiative, which was designed to leverage limited foreign aid dollars and galvanize tremendous support and investment from the public sector, philanthropic organizations and the private sector to eliminate modern slavery and human trafficking around the globe. In December, the president signed legislation into law that included authorizing language for the initiative.
Glad Christopher Wray Will Lead the Brave Men and Women of the FBI
Last week, Senator Corker released the following statement after voting to confirm Christopher A. Wray, who was nominated by President Donald J. Trump to serve as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The Senate confirmed Wray by a vote of 92 to 5.
During our meeting last month, Mr. Wray displayed the integrity and independence needed to head the FBI, said Corker. I am pleased the Senate has acted quickly to approve his nomination and am glad he will be serving our country in this capacity and leading the brave men and women of the bureau who help keep our country safe.
Corker met with Wray in his Capitol Hill office last month.

Eastern District of Tennessee Working With Department of Justice to Combat Opioid Epidemic
On Wednesday, Senator Corker released the following statement after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Eastern District of Tennessee has been selected as one of 12 federal judicial districts across the country to participate in the Department of Justices (DOJ) Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit. The pilot program will utilize data and assign an experienced prosecutor to the Eastern District to identify and prosecute individuals contributing to the opioid epidemic.
The prescription opioid epidemic is destroying lives and tearing apart families, and I am glad to see the Eastern District of Tennessee selected for this pilot program, said Corker. This partnership will be an added resource for the U.S. attorneys office, and I am hopeful the efforts can bring to justice the pill mills and unlawful pharmacies that are profiting off the hardships of Tennesseans affected by opioid abuse. I applaud President Trump and Attorney General Sessions for their commitment to this critical issue and will continue working with them to further address this crisis.
Last year, Corker voted for the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which authorized new funding to address the opioid crisis. In December, Corker voted for Senator Lamar Alexanders (R-Tenn.) 21st Century Cures Act, which provided state grant funding through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to support a comprehensive array of prevention, treatment and recovery services to fight opioid addiction. Both bills were signed into law last year.

Dear Friend,  Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to review some of the highlights of what happened last week in DC and here in Texas.
Trump Signs Sanctions Bill Into Law  Russia, Iran and North Korea continue to display hostility towards the US and our allies. As a result, we must take decisive action to stop them. America must hold these nation’s accountable for their actions. That's why I voted for and Congress passed H.R. 3364, the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which increases the economic and political pressure on Russia, Iran and North Korea. I'm pleased to report that President Trump signed it into law. 
Helping TX22 Veterans Replace or Obtain Earned Medals  In my time in Congress, I have learned that some veterans have earned medals of distinction, but either failed to receive them or lost them over the years. My office would like to help with replacing a lost medal or securing an earned medal through a Badges of Honor Medals event. My staff will host an event to assist veterans with the paperwork needed to begin the service medal request process – whether the medal request is for a replacement or to obtain a medal for the first time. The event will be held on September 7, 2017 from 12:00-4:30 pm at my Sugar Land office at 1650 Highway 6 Suite 150. Please call 281-494-2690 ahead of time to schedule an appointment. Veterans are asked to bring a copy of their DD214 form. In order to adhere to the Privacy Act of 1974, please be prepared to sign a privacy release form.  Taking Care of Others   On a recent visit to the Texas State Supported Living Center (SSLC) in Richmond, I saw the incredible care being given to our neighbors with intellectual and developmental disabilities. They offer health care services, therapies, treatments and residential services. Their round-the-clock care is critically important to those who live there. The residents and staff shared stories and opportunities available for volunteers and residents.

Thank you for subscribing to my E-Newsletter! I wanted to reach out to you today and make sure you saw my Sunday column in LNP about a set of bipartisan health care ideas proposed by the Problem Solvers Caucus.  You can read the full column below or online here. You can send me your thoughts on this topic, or any other topics, by sending me an email here. 
The American People Deserve Solutions
By Rep. Smucker

Appeared in Sunday's LNP 

When you sent me to Congress to serve as your representative, I attended the new member orientation, which was a great opportunity to meet new colleagues on both sides of the aisle.

As we met and shared our vision for the country, we agreed to try to work together as much as possible and find common ground among Republicans and Democrats. So we signed a civility pledge and formed a nonpartisan caucus.

You might not read it in the news, learn about it on cable television or hear it on the radio, but during the first seven months of my term, I’ve been working across the aisle to find that common ground, and so have others. Recently, the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group of more than 40 lawmakers that I joined, proposed a set of health care priorities.

While the Senate was unable to advance the goal of repealing and replacing “Obamacare,” I believe it’s necessary to continue efforts to relieve the American people of “Obamacare’s” burdensome costs, regulations and uncertainty. The health care system is broken — that hasn’t changed in the last seven months — but simply letting American families’ health care collapse would be unacceptable.

Problem Solvers Caucus is presenting a path forward to stabilize the insurance marketplace, repeal onerous taxes and regulations, and ensure affordable, quality care. These critical areas of bipartisan agreement start fixing our broken health care system.

The caucus’s proposals, as outlined in a statement by co-chairs Reps. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., are as follows:

1. ""Bring cost-sharing reduction payments under the Congressional oversight and appropriations process, but ensure they have mandatory funding.""

2. ""Create a dedicated stability fund that states can use to reduce premiums and limit losses for providing coverage —especially for those with pre-existing conditions.""

3. ""Adjust the employer mandate by raising the threshold on the requirement for employers to provide insurance under the employer mandate to businesses of 500 employees or more"" (the threshold is now 50). Additionally, define “full time” under the employer mandate as a work week of 40 hours.

4. Repeal the medical device tax, which adds a 2.3 percent sales tax on medical device supplies.

5. ""Provide technical changes and clear guidelines for states that want to innovate on the (ACA) exchange or enter into regional compacts to improve coverage and create more options for consumers.”

I’d still like to see “Obamacare’s” individual mandate repealed and would like to put an end to more of the law’s costly taxes. But why not take the first steps to fix the employer mandate and end the medical device tax? These two areas of agreement will have a large, positive impact on small businesses and lower the cost of things like pacemakers, stents and artificial joints for consumers.

Washington has enough people unwilling to talk to each other. The American people are still waiting for —and deserve — solutions. When the Problem Solvers Caucus meets, we aren’t Republicans or Democrats. We’re a room full of lawmakers putting our constituents first and working together toward commonsense solutions.

But this kind of effort — bipartisan action to help American families — isn’t new. Here are a few more examples:

— The House unanimously passed legislation I co-sponsored to strengthen career and technical education nationwide — a direct investment in schools like Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology, Pennsylvania College of Health Sciences, and others. These schools prepare students for good-paying, family-sustaining jobs that are in demand and available now.

— The House recently passed sanctions against Iran, North Korea and Russia with bipartisan support of more than 400 House members. It passed the Senate and was signed into law last week.

— The House passed multiple bipartisan bills to crack down on human trafficking — increasing protections for victims and toughening penalties for traffickers.

— The House and Senate passed a bill with broad support on both sides of the aisle that overhauls the Department of Veterans Affairs to deliver better care to our veterans. This bill has been signed into law.

In keeping my promise of civility and working to get things done, I’ve also personally worked in a bipartisan fashion. I introduced the bipartisan Susquehanna National Heritage Area Act to help preserve the natural beauty of our community.

I also teamed up with Rep. Terri Sewell, a Democrat from Alabama, to pass legislation making it easier for foster children to be placed in the home of a family member. Our bill received broad bipartisan support.

In fact, of the 100 bills I have co-sponsored, 82 of them have support from both Republicans and Democrats. I know I won’t always agree with my colleagues. But that’s good because the purpose of the House is to be a deliberative body with a wide range of views across the political spectrum. We are supposed to, and in fact even expected to, disagree. But we should do so in a civil and respectful manner.

As a governing conservative, I am committed to the principles of limited government, free enterprise and opportunity for each and every Pennsylvanian and American. In order to make our government more efficient, effective and accountable, I’m listening to all points of view from both constituents and colleagues and working to find creative solutions to complex problems. And that includes health care.

News from Representative Seth Moulton
￼ 





Dear Lindsey, 
I am proud to announce and open nominations for the second annual Peter J. Gomes Service Award. The award is given to an individual in the Sixth Congressional District of Massachusetts who best epitomizes the qualities of integrity, compassion, and commitment to community that were the foundation of the late Reverend Professor Peter J. Gomes’ teachings.
The Reverend Professor Peter John Gomes was a Christian minister who served for nearly forty years in The Memorial Church of Harvard University. As a preacher, teacher, author, and leader, he influenced many with his ready wit and wisdom and, perhaps above all, with his commitment to service, whether to his immediate community, in support of those in the armed forces, or to universal humanitarian causes. As the late Professor wrote, “The very definition of service is to love our neighbors as ourselves, work for peace and not for war, and remember that the only hands on earth to do the work of service are our own.” These words, which echoed through the Memorial Church, erected to honor the Harvard public servants who died in World War I, influenced my own journey to serve in the Marines, and later as a Member of Congress.
The annual Peter J. Gomes Service Award is given to a resident of the Sixth Congressional District who best exemplifies his commitment to service. Last year, we were honored to have an inspiring cohort of nominees for our first ever Peter J. Gomes Service Award. After considerable deliberation we were pleased to present the award to Andrew DeFranza, Executive Director of Harborlight Community Partners, for his incredible work as an affordable housing advocate. I was inspired by many of the nominees and was proud to have the opportunity to recognize their work serving the people of the 6th District. The success of the award was made possible by the many community members who took the time to nominate their friends, neighbors, and coworkers for the award; so today I am asking for your participation again.
If you or your organization knows of someone who might qualify for the award, please take a moment to nominate them here. Nominations should include a list of specific projects with which the individual has been involved, along with pertinent biographical details and an account of his or her vision and practice of service as exemplified by those of the late Professor Gomes.
The nomination period will close on August 27, 2017. The inaugural Peter J. Gomes Service Award will be presented on Sunday, September 10, 2017 and will be directly followed by a Day of Service.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to Dylan O’Sullivan in my district office at Dylan.OSullivan@mail.house.gov or (978) 531-1669.
Thank you for your consideration and interest. 
Sincerely,

Dear Lindsey,
While there is tremendous focus on the work Congress does in Washington D.C., the time I spend in the district assisting my constituents is equally, if not more, significant. In addition to listening to your concerns and having a presence in the community, my district office provides extremely valuable services. One of the many constituents my office helped this week was a senior citizen who needed her address and direct deposit information updated with the Social Security Administration. With all her information now updated she will receive her benefits in a timely manner.
So, whether you are having issues with a federal agency such as the Social Security Administration, the Veterans Administration, the IRS, or you just need help better understanding the resources that are available to you, please contact my office via email or by phone at 636-779-5449. I understand navigating a complicated federal bureaucracy can be difficult and my office stands ready to help you through the process.

I am proud these brave young men and women are representing the St. Louis area at the United States Service Academies. If you know someone who is interested in applying to attend a Service Academy, please visit my website for more information.

 With only a few days left of summer break, students are preparing to head back to school. This week, the Lindbergh School District cut the ribbon on its sixth elementary school, Dressel Elementary.  As someone who was born and raised in South County, I love seeing more families moving into the area because of its growing reputation and top-notch school districts like Lindbergh. This new school will help welcome that influx of students, and I'm sure Principal Craig Hamby and his team will do a great job!

8/7/17 12:42,End Partisan Gerrymandering,"Monday Report from Representative Rick Nolan
￼
 
￼
￼
￼
￼
It’s Time to Restore Democracy – and End Partisan Gerrymandering
￼  Click on the screen above and I’ll explain why partisan gerrymandering is so damaging to our elections and our democracy. 
The Restore Democracy Revolution
Dear Friend, 
By themselves, any of the measures in our Restore Democracy bill would constitute a major boost for our democratic process. Taken together, they are nothing short of revolutionary in scope. 
Partisan gerrymandering has contributed to a rigged political and economic system that works for the benefit of a powerful few at the expense of the many. The hard cold fact is that out of 435 congressional districts, only 25 to 35 are ever truly competitive at election time – because state legislatures use partisan gerrymandering to draw boundaries that almost always ensure victory for the same party. Our Restore Democracy legislation calls for an end to partisan gerrymandering because all 435 districts must be competitive for democracy to be real and survive.
Quite frankly, this isn’t going to be easy. Progress and change take time. And members of Congress who are almost certain to be reelected aren’t naturally inclined to help reform the system and make their “safe” districts competitive. But the future of our democracy depends on the honesty and integrity of our elections; so we are determined to keep building support one member of Congress at a time.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court has taken a strong interest in partisan gerrymandering and its constitutionality. This coming fall, the Court will review a federal court’s ruling that Republican leaders in Wisconsin redrew legislative and congressional district maps in a manner so partisan as to violate the Constitution’s First Amendment and equal rights protections. By upholding the Wisconsin ruling, the Court could open the door to overturning blatantly partisan gerrymandering schemes in many other states as well.
Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled that states cannot use purely racial criteria to redraw congressional districts to give one political party a big advantage over another at election time. This particular case pinpointed two North Carolina congressional districts redrawn by Republican legislatures to concentrate black voters, thereby reducing their influence across the state.
The Restore Democracy Revolution in a Nutshell 
The foundation lies in putting a stop to special interests spending unlimited amounts of secret money to influence government and elections. Our legislation would also put Congress on record supporting small donor-public campaign financing and limiting the campaign season. Moreover, we are calling for full disclosure of all campaign contributions, establishment of national online voter registration and a halt to all voter suppression.
We also call for a return to Congress’s traditional process of Regular Order. Under Regular Order, we compromise and find bipartisan solutions by fully considering every idea and amendment under an open rule – and affording each one an up or down vote. That’s how Congress fixed things, solved problems and got things done for more than 200 years. It’s time to get back to that tried and true method of serving the American people.   We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email.
Sincerely, ￼

The Message from Minnesota Farmfest: Times are Tough and the 2018 Farm Bill Must Provide Help for Rural America
￼  Again and again we heard the message - prices and income are down, debt is up, land values are declining, loans are harder to come by and the future promises more of the same. 
More than 30 percent of Minnesota farmers lost money in 2016. And nationwide, the collapse in farm commodity prices caused overall farm income to fall 45 percent from 2013 to 2016 - the largest three-year percentage drop since the Great Depression. So we’ve got to get the 2018 Farm Bill right. That was the overriding message to me and 10 other members of the House Agriculture Committee last week at Farmfest near Redwood Falls. Hundreds of farmers, ranchers and agribusiness leaders braved wind and rain to remind us that economic times in farm country are tough and getting tougher. Prices and income are down, debt is up, land values are declining, loans are harder to come by and the future promises more of the same.
￼  Do you recognize these Minnesotans on stage at Farmfest in 1976? On my left in this classic photo, is Gloria Griffin (2nd District DFL Congressional candidate). On my right, the Democratic Ticket of Minnesota Senator Walter Mondale and Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter, who would be elected Vice President and President respectively in November. And next to them, Minnesota Senator and former Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Minnesota Governor Wendell Anderson. 
Farm bills are all about providing a safety net when hard times hit farm country, and crop insurance topped list of concerns. As Ranking Member (the minority equivalent of Chairman) of the Agriculture Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities and Risk Management, I’ll be front and center in drafting the crop insurance piece of the bill and enlisting bipartisan support in committee and on the floor of the House.
Basically, we need to ensure that the next Farm Bill contains the risk management tools necessary for farmers to survive fluctuations in the commodity markets, and continue to support the rural communities and small businesses that provide good paying jobs here in Minnesota and across America’s countryside. That will be my focus as we prepare this critically important legislation.

Where is the $1 Trillion GOP Transportation & Infrastructure Bill?
￼  Here in Minnesota and throughout the Nation, municipalities are struggling to fix crumbling wastewater and drinking water systems at enormous cost to taxpayers
President Trump and House Republicans need to get moving and deliver on their promise of a $1 trillion transportation package to help fix our crumbling infrastructure and help create some 13 million good paying jobs. The bill they promised months ago has yet to take shape beyond a page or two of talking points. And now Republican leaders are suggesting that it may be 2018 before we have a substantive plan for our Transportation Committee to begin considering and amending.
The urgency for substantial new investment in transportation and infrastructure could not be more urgent or more clear. Infrastructure lays the foundation for business growth and good paying jobs in a sustainable economy. A trillion dollars is a lot of money. But according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, we should be spending $4 to $5 trillion to rebuild and replace roads, bridges, railroads, airports, ports, pipelines and municipal water systems that have fallen into disrepair.
The situation here in Minnesota mirrors the rest of the Nation. Of course, last week marked the 10th anniversary of the collapse of the I-35 bridge in Minneapolis. That terrible disaster killed 13 people and injured 145. According to the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MNDOT), one in ten of our state’s bridges are still structurally deficient, and half of all our roads are at least 50 years old. Every year, Minnesota drivers spend $1.2 billion to fix vehicles damaged by bad roads. And every year, businesses spend about $232 million on higher transportation costs and delays due to highway and railroad congestion.
Across our state, many sewer, sanitation and municipal water systems are at the brink of collapse after nearly a century of neglect. In fact, experts estimate that it would cost nearly $7 billion to bring Minnesota’s drinking water and wastewater systems up to 21st Century standards. And the longer we wait, the more difficult, expensive and necessary these projects will become. Republicans are in charge of the government and the budget, and Americans expect them to deliver on their promises to reinvest in our transportation infrastructure while there is still time.

As Student Loan Debt Skyrockets, Minnesota Joins Suit to Protect Students From Fraud by For-Profit Colleges
￼  Parents and students protest cases of educational fraud by for-profit private colleges.
When students pursuing an education believe they have defrauded by private, for-profit colleges, they should have the right to go to court and sue to recover their hard-earned tuition. That’s the simple principle behind a new rule that was set to go into effect until U.S. Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos rescinded it earlier this summer. Now Minnesota has joined 18 other states in suing Secretary DeVos to reinstate the measure, known as the “borrowers defense rule.”
Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson is absolutely right in pointing out that the rule would protect not only students, but taxpayers who support the federal student loan program.
As I’ve pointed out in the past, the time for Congressional action to reduce the costs of higher education and address the crushing student loan debt crippling our economy has reached the point of crisis. Some 42.4 million Americans now owe a combined total of $1.3 trillion in federal student loans. And according to a new study by the Consumer Federation of America, the number of Americans who are at least 9 months behind in their student loan payments is growing at record levels. Moreover, at $30,650, the average federal student loan debt has skyrocketed by 17% since 2013.
I'll reintroduce and continue to build support for our Underwater Student Borrowers Act. That measure stipulates that when you qualify to have part of your college debt forgiven after faithfully making your payments over 20 years, the IRS should not force you into debt again with a huge tax on the amount that’s been eliminated. We need to put an end to that burden so people can get on with their lives, buy homes, start families and save for their retirement.
Our Underwater Student Borrowers Act is part of a larger effort to make college more affordable, and lower the exorbitant interest rates on student loans. For example, our Fairness in Student Loan Lending Act would allow student loan borrowers to refinance at the end of each month to a rate equal to the 10-year Treasury note plus one percent. That measure alone could potentially save a borrower thousands of dollars by providing the same right to refinance student loans as people now have to refinance their home mortgages, their cars and other significant debts.

Our Week in Ely and Virginia
￼  ￼  Hats off to the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MNDOT). They’re nearing final completion of two major projects on the Iron Range, both of which my staff and I worked hard to advance in order to make travel faster and safer and help boost business activity and good paying jobs across the region. In the first picture above, MNDOT project manager, Pat Huston, explains alignment changes on the new Highway 53. Mr. Huston stated that the Highway 53 Project is 88% complete. 480,000 hours have gone into the project putting them a month ahead of schedule, which means the new Highway will be opening to traffic at the beginning of September, 2017. Pictured directly above, a caravan of heavy trucks continue work on the Highway 169 “Eagle’s Nest” project between Virginia and Ely. The project is 35% complete and work will continue into late October before winding down during winter months. Over 60 local residents attended two meetings to hear the updates.

Combating Teen E-Cigarette Use 
￼ 
Rep. Lowey hosts a roundtable discussion on teen e-cigarette use. 
This week, I brought together local superintendents, medical experts, substance abuse prevention workers and advocates, and students for a roundtable discussion at my White Plains office on e-cigarette use among teens. Five years ago, parents would have worried about their kids taking in too much sugar from a steady diet of Fruit Loops, Gummy Bears, and Swedish Fish. Today, we're worried that vaping products with those flavors will expose them to dangerous, addictive chemicals. We can't afford to lose another generation to the harms of nicotine addiction. 
Securing Federal Funding for Medical Research I was pleased to announce $503,938 in federal funding for medical research at New York Medical College in Valhalla through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This funding will support research that improves our understanding of vascular disease and heart failure and stimulates the development of new treatments. As Ranking Member on the House Appropriations Committee, I will continue to secure greater funding for medical research institutions, so that they can help Americans live longer, healthier lives. 
Leading Efforts to Protect Women's Health Republicans are using the annual Appropriations process - in which we set the federal government's spending priorities - to advance what I believe is an aggressive attack on women's health. To learn more about my efforts to stop them, click here to read my new op-ed.  
Improving and Accelerating Education Efforts This week, the U.S. Senate passed my Reinforcing Education Accountability in Development (READ) Act, bipartisan legislation that would enhance transparency and accelerate the impact of U.S. basic education programs around the world. Follow me on Facebook to get updates like the one below.

8/7/17 11:09,Beyond resistance: Ensuring paid family leave,"Update | Monday, August 7, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the 10th day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: ensuring paid family leave.
Americans should not be forced to choose between taking care of a sick family member or earning an income. Whether it’s taking care of an aging parent, a sick spouse, or a newborn, paid family leave creates a positive work-life balance. We are the only industrialized country to not have paid family leave on the national level, and that is an embarrassment.
I support the FAMILY Act, which would ensure that workers can take up to 12 weeks of paid leave for a pregnancy, the birth or adoption of a child, to recover from a serious illness, or to care for a seriously ill family member.
Having a family member who requires extra assistance is a heavy responsibility on its own, and with the added stress of balancing a job, it can be entirely overwhelming. We should not require employees to choose between their familial responsibilities and their paycheck.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

Friend,

Fighting poverty is a personal priority of mine as your representative here in Congress. 

I strongly believe that effectively empowering Americans who are experiencing poverty starts in our local communities. One of the best things the federal government can do is partner with local groups who have developed anti-poverty initiatives, and empower them to thrive. They know the community best -- and are positioned to provide the local solutions that are needed to help their neighbors.

A great example of this right here at home is the Highland County Community Action Organization (HCCAO). I recently sat down with Julia Wise, the Executive Director of HCCAO, which, through the Rural IMPACT program, has been able to streamline its services and bring together public and private resources in an effort to give families the helping hand they need to climb out of poverty. Listen below:

￼

Supporting efforts to move Americans from welfare to work and give folks the helping hand they need to rise out of poverty is one of my priorities in Congress, and should be a priority of our nation.

Yours in service,
￼

8/7/17 10:30,Building for the Next Generation,"￼ 
￼
  
Dear Lindsey,
Safe, healthy, modern, and well-equipped schools are essential for advancing student achievement and ensuring that the next generation is prepared to meet the economic, social, and global challenges of tomorrow. Currently, however, far too many of the over 50 million students and six million staff who learn and work in our public schools spend their days in facilities that are in desperate need of repairs or replacement.
That is why I introduced the School Building Improvement Act, which would provide communities in Rhode Island and across the country with the resources they need to invest in high-quality schools.
The School Building Improvement Act would provide $7 billion per year to states for local competitive grants for school repair, renovation, and construction. School equity would be made a priority as states would focus assistance on communities with the greatest financial needs and ensure equitable access for public charter schools. This legislation would also provide $30 billion over a three-year period for qualified school infrastructure bonds and expand the ability of school districts to construct, rehabilitate, or repair school facilities through the use of enhanced Qualified Zone Academy Bonds (QZABS). Additionally, this bill would give a needed boost to the nation's economy by creating an estimated 1.9 million jobs, based on analysis by the Economic Policy Institute.
Please know that I will continue my work to increase student achievement and spur economic growth by pressing for action on this and other proposals that will create jobs today and prepare our children for the jobs of tomorrow.
Sincerely,   Jack Reed United States Senator

Dear Friend,
Thank you for the opportunity to update you on the work of the 115th Congress.  I trust this finds you and your family well, as we work together to bring Hoosier common sense to Washington.
For daily updates, please take a moment to ""Like"" my Facebook page by clicking here ￼ or follow me on Twitter if you prefer ￼ @ToddRokita.

In this week's Rokita Report
	•	House Budget Proposals
	•	Honoring Fallen Police Officers
	•	The Importance of General Aviation

House Budget Proposals
As Vice Chairman of the House Budget Committee, creating a balanced budget that works for Hoosiers is my priority.  A budget is a blueprint for government policy.  I want to share with you some details on two proposals that I worked on that carry out the job the American people sent Donald Trump and Congress to do.
The House Budget Committee passed the Building A Better America Budget earlier this summer.  Without raising taxes, our budget proposal places the government on a sustainable fiscal course that would end Washington's budget deficits.  The budget also tells Washington bureaucrats to stop hindering economic growth.  We lay out a vision for pro-growth policies, including deficit reduction, spending restraint, tax reform, welfare reform, regulatory reform, and repealing and replacing failed Obama-era policies like ObamaCare and Dodd Frank.  We do so while supporting the funding for troop training, equipment, compensation, and readiness that the previous administration neglected to do.  Learn more about the Building A Better America Budget by clicking here.
The Republican Study Committee (RSC) has unveiled its proposal, Securing America's Future Economy.  As a member of the RSC Steering Committee, I strongly support this vision.  It combines RSC initiatives to grow the economy and calls for fiscal restraint.  This budget grows the economy by ending government wage controls set by Davis-Bacon, implementing a National Right to Work, and prohibiting union work by federal employees on official time.  It also ends the cap on merit-pay for union workers by implementing legislation that I introduced, the RAISE Act.  Union workers should be eligible for the bonuses they earned.
Both budgets incorporate my proposal to roll back onerous federal rules on Medicaid through block grants.  Block granting Medicaid would allow states to innovate and tailor the program to meet the unique needs of their communities.  With these budgets we build on the leadership that President Trump and Vice President Pence called for with their budget.  These proposals show our joint commitment to offer real solutions.

Honoring Fallen Police Officers
On July 27, Hoosiers lost two of our finest in blue, Deputy Chief of Investigations James Waters from the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department and Lieutenant Aaron Allan from the Southport Police Department.  Losing these two officers will leave a significant void in our community.
I have personally met with Deputy Chief Waters to talk about the destruction opioids cause in Indiana.  Waters was a dedicated public servant whose love for the community brought him to service.  Lieutenant Aaron Allan was shot in the line of duty while responding to a high speed car crash.  Representatives from my office attended the service for Deputy Chief Waters and I attended the service for Lt. Allan.
￼
The ""Sea of Blue"" was in attendance to celebrate the life of Deputy Chief Waters.
Both Waters and Allan were making a difference in our community and were allies in keeping us safe. These officers chose to put their lives on the line for the safety of families in Central Indiana.  Kathy and my prayers are with both of their families and those serving in IMPD and the Southport Police Department.  I will continue to stand in support of our men and women in blue.

The Importance of General Aviation
Recently, I spoke on the House Floor about the importance of the general aviation community.  We are the neighbors and friends of Hoosiers.  General aviation consists of all civilian flying except for scheduled passenger airline service.  The general aviation industry brings nearly six billion dollars in economic activity to Indiana every year and gives back with time and treasure.
On Monday, I addressed the LaPorte Rotary Club during their annual Rotary Airport Dinner.  We met at the hangar of LaPorte Aviation, and discussed the benefits of a robust general aviation community with the club and how the community gives back.
￼
The LaPorte Rotary Club's annual airport dinner was held at the hangar of LaPorte Aviation.
Organizations like Veterans Airlift Command and Angel Flight show the general aviation community gives back.  Veterans Airlift Command connects service disabled veterans and their families with needed care.  Angel Flight arranges free air transportation for children with any legitimate, charitable, or medically related need, and both individuals and health care organizations can take advantage of this service.  As a commercially rated aviator, I have flown for both organizations.  I appreciate the chance to take to the skies, give back, and become better informed as your representative by directly hearing from those in need.

Thank you for your continued interest in Congress and for supporting my efforts to bring Hoosier common sense to Washington. Take care.

The Time For Tax Reform is Now
In an ever-changing global economy, it is imperative that the United States stay as competitive as possible to attract and retain employers. Unfortunately, the American people and our businesses are saddled with a tax code that restricts growth, hampers prosperity, and burdens those it is supposed to help.
That's why I'm a forceful advocate for simplifying and reforming the tax code. This past Thursday, I was on Fox Business Network speaking with Maria Bartiromo about how tax reform can reinvigorate our economy. Watch my full interview here.

Honoring a Pennsylvania Hero 
Memorializing those who made the ultimate sacrifice is one of the highest honors of being your senator. Recently, I helped rename the Veterans Affairs (VA) facility in Butler Township after Sergeant Joseph George Kusick.
Sergeant Kusick was a native of Bruin, Pennsylvania, and was a member of the Army's special forces during the Vietnam War. On November 8, 1967, Sergeant Kusick was deep in hostile territory when he and his men were ambushed by the enemy. Sergeant Kusick was seriously wounded. Despite his grievous injuries, he bravely refused aid while continuing on with his mission. When the first helicopter arrived to evacuate the men, Sergeant Kusick refused to leave until everyone else had been extracted. Sergeant Kusick boarded the final helicopter out. They were shot down. He never made it home.
For his bravery Sergeant Kusick was posthumously awarded a silver star. His citation read in part: ""Kusick's gallantry in action, at the cost of his life, was in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.""
Naming the VA facility in Butler after Sergeant Kusick is a fitting honor for this Pennsylvania hero. I was privileged to help memorialize his bravery.

Keeping Us Safe From Foreign Despots
North Korea continues to defy the civilized world. Despite leaders from across the globe calling on Kim Jong Un and his regime to end their senseless provocations, North Korea continues to test ICBMs and threaten America and our allies. This must stop.  
The Senate and House recently agreed to increase pressure on North Korea, as well as Iran and Russia, with passage of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. I was pleased to see President Trump signed this legislation into law.
I have also secured an agreement from House and Senate leadership to soon pass additional legislation further tightening North Korea sanctions. That bill will likely include parts of my bipartisan BRINK Act, which I authored with Senator Van Hollen (D-MD).
The key feature of our bill gives financial institutions that do business with the North Korean regime, and those who evade sanctions to assist the regime, an ultimatum: if you continue doing business with North Korea, you will lose access to the U.S. market and international financial system. The legislation also ensures Congress can review any effort by the executive branch to ease or lift mandatory sanctions found in the bill.
ABC 27 in Harrisburg recently ran a story regarding the BRINK Act. Watch the full segment here.

8/6/17 21:11,RECAP: Rep. McMorris Rodgers Spends Week in Eastern Washington,"￼ 
RECAP: Rep. McMorris Rodgers Spends Week in Eastern Washington 
Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers spent the past week in Eastern Washington where she met with a variety of people and organizations to discuss different issues important to Eastern Washington and hear their thoughts and ideas. 
On Tuesday, she began the day with the Greater Spokane Incorporated Health Industry Development Group to discuss health care in Eastern Washington and how to create a better health care future for everyone. They covered her new legislation to extend the Teaching Health Centers program, as well as Medicaid, and efforts to reform the nation's broken health care system. 

She then made her way to the Columbia Grain Elevator and Barge Loading Facility at Central Ferry to take a tour and discuss the important role that the Snake River dams play in supporting Northwest agriculture and shipping. The Congresswoman was reminded that the Columbia and Snake river system is the I-5 of Eastern Washington--allowing people to move and ship products all over the region and world. 

Next, the Congresswoman made her way to Dayton where she visited the XO Alambic Craft Distillery at the Blue Mountain Station Artisan Food Center. Tuesday was National Startup Day, and the Congresswoman discussed challenges faced by startups and other small businesses--challenges like burdensome rules and regulations that discourage entrepreneurship and investment. She stated her continued support for entrepreneurs, who help power our economy through innovation and hard work. She also joined the owner of XO Alambic for a Facebook Live. You can see it here: 

￼ 
Then, the Congresswoman traveled to Walla Walla where she had a meeting with VA Medical Center Director Brian Westfield to talk about veteran care, the Veterans Choice program, and the new leadership staff at the Walla Walla VA. Veterans care is one of the Congresswoman's top priorities--last week, she introduced the Modernization of Medical Records Access for Veterans Act of 2017, which lets veterans have full access to their medical records in order to craft the most effective healthcare solutions possible. 
Then, the Congresswoman stopped by the Walla Walla Veterans Home to meet and spend time with the residents and their families. From the groundbreaking to the grand opening, Rep. McMorris Rodgers has kept up with this project from start to finish and was honored to stop by and tour the facility for the first time with residents. 

Next, the Congresswoman attended a Walla Walla Health Care Systems Roundtable to discuss the steps underway to meet local health care needs following the recent closure of Walla Walla General Hospital. The Congresswoman is committed to finding solutions for everyone in the Walla Walla area and is happy to see progress being made to that end. 

Finally, the Congresswoman attended National Night Out. This annual event is a great time to join with local law enforcement and community members and advocate for safety and unity, and awareness about police programs in the Walla Walla area. 

On Wednesday, the Congresswoman began the day by holding another Coffee with Cathy event to discuss the important issues of the day and hear directly from people in the community. Next, she visited the Little Goose Dam in Starbuck and spent time learning about how our dams create clean, renewable, and affordable energy for people across Washington state. The Congresswoman enjoyed the chance to see one of our state's great dams in action, and remains committed to fighting for hydropower, which represents 70% of Washington's total produced energy and affords low power rates for Washingtonians. 

￼ 
Then, the Congresswoman took a tour of Liberty Lake with Mayor Steve Peterson. She witnessed all of the growth that is happening in this area, including the creation of new businesses as well as businesses that are recovering from the recession. Specifically, she toured Open Eye, Altek, and Accra Fab. She was inspired by the progress that these manufacturing companies have made and the jobs they are bringing to the community. 
Later in the afternoon, the Congresswoman visited MultiCare Valley Hospital in Spokane to take part in the Spokane Valley Chamber Business Roundtable. She appreciated the chance to meet with some of the Valley's business leaders and learn more about the challenges they face in powering the local economy. The Congresswoman firmly believes in supporting small businesses by undoing stifling regulations and lowering barriers to entry in the market to ensure competition and innovation. At the event, the Congresswoman was also awarded the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Spirit of Enterprise Award for her steadfast commitment to supporting small businesses and creating jobs. 

Finally, the Congresswoman hosted a Unity Dinner at David's Pizza in order to bring people together and share ideas from a number of different viewpoints. She enjoyed the chance to hear various takes on the challenges we face as a community and nation. 

On Thursday, she began the day by visiting Lawton Printing, where she took a tour and met with many employees. Lawton has served Spokane since 1940 and the Congresswoman appreciated the opportunity to visit the local business. The Congresswoman also hosted a question and answer session with all of the employees where they discussed tax reform, health care, education, and how to spur job creation here in Eastern Washington. 

￼ 
Later in the day, the Congresswoman toured the New York Life Insurance Spokane office, and had the chance to meet with employees and learn about the work they do. The Congresswoman remains committed to supporting businesses large and small, which drive the local economy by creating jobs and fostering innovation to solve problems in Eastern Washington and around the country. 
On Friday, she began the day by hosting another Coffee with Cathy in which she met with citizens from different backgrounds to talk about important issues including health care, affordable housing, agriculture, and infrastructure. As she said on Facebook, ""I had another great Coffee with Cathy this morning in Spokane. We discussed, at times passionately, the issues facing people here in Eastern Washington. We all have the same goal, and though we may sometimes disagree on how we solve these issues, I am so proud to see people in our community who care deeply about working together to have these discussions and find solutions to the problems we face. Thanks to everyone for joining! If you're interested in joining for a Coffee with Cathy, please contact my office!"" 

Then, the Congresswoman hosted a Higher Education Leaders Roundtable with university educators to discuss Higher Education Act reauthorization and receive updates from the local institutions. To end the day the Congresswoman hosted a Disabilities Family Event and Barbecue to bring families in the disabilities community together. As someone with a child with disabilities, the Congresswoman understands the challenges families face and was honored to spend time with them. 

Rep. McMorris Rodgers will spend next week continuing these meetings and hearing directly from people in the community. She remains honored to represent the people of Eastern Washington, and encourages everyone to follow along on Facebook and Twitter for updates on her work and advocacy on your behalf.

NEWS FROM THE 2nd DISTRICT
Dear Friend,

I spent the week traveling throughout the beautiful Second District and meeting with hardworking Floridians. Please read more about my week below: 

Visiting Our Veterans
￼ 
On Monday, Leah and I spent the morning visiting with local veterans at the Simms Veterans Nursing home in Panama City. It was a privilege to spend time with these heroes and see how dedicated the staff at Simms is to caring for our veterans. This is how all veterans should be treated!


Bay County Chamber of Commerce
￼ 
On Tuesday, the Florida Chamber of Commerce hosted a round table on regional workforce and economic development issues. I enjoyed the opportunity to listen to community and business leaders discuss how we can create jobs in the Second District. In Congress this fall, we will work to cut taxes for individuals and businesses to grow our economy and put more money back in your pockets. 

Supporting Our Small Businesses 
I always enjoy visiting small businesses and learning what makes them tick. This week, I went to Thompson Machine in Crawfordville to see how they design and build state-of-the-art gun suppressors in the Second District. I’ve been calling on the House to hold a vote on the Hearing Protection Act, important legislation to make it easier for law-abiding firearms owners to purchase this these important safety devices. Contrary to what is seen in the movies, suppressors do not silence gunfire. The typical decibel level of a handgun or rifle without a suppressor is enough to cause immediate and irreparable hearing damage. Suppressors can reduce the sound to that of a jackhammer. They do great work at Thompson Machine.
￼ 
Taylor County Railroad Grant  For the past several months I have been urging the Department of Transportation to fund much needed railway improvement in Taylor County. I am happy to announce that the Department of Transportation will award a federal grant of $8.67 million to rehabilitate 80 miles of critical railway between Foley, Florida and Adel, Georgia.These railway improvements will mean improved economic and job opportunities in Taylor County, and I will continue to be a leading voice for the people I am honored to represent. Click here to learn more.  Thank you for your continued energy and enthusiasm, as reflected in your letters and Facebook posts. If you haven’t already, LIKE my Facebook page. You can also follow me on Twitter @DrNealDunnFL2.
Thank you for the opportunity to serve you in Congress!

Dear Lindsey,
Member of President's Cabinet Visits Quincy
It was a privilege to host my former House colleague and friend Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, M.D. in Quincy this week for a tour and round-table discussion at Quincy Medical Group. We were able to hear from local medical and community leaders about some of their best practices and ways that the federal government can help them succeed in fighting the opioid epidemic.
￼ ￼
Nationally, the opioid epidemic continues to worsen. In the last 16 years, over 183,000 people have died from overdose of prescription drugs. Drug overdose remains the leading cause of accidental death in the United States with over 52,000 overdoses in 2015 alone and the leading cause of death for Americans under 50 years of age. Over 20,000 of those accidental deaths were from overdose of prescription pain relievers. Additionally, the CDC has reported that while overdose of traditional opioids has dropped slightly, fatal overdoses involving heroin has tripled. 
In Illinois, Adams County has seen first-hand the impact of opioid addiction and heroin use in recent years. Over the last five years, Illinois has experienced statistically significant increases in overall drug overdose deaths. Unfortunately, Adams County has been one of the hardest hit counties by this crisis. From 2010 to 2015, Adams County experienced a 359.62% increase in emergency department visit rates related to opioid and heroin overdose and a 300.67% increase in overdose mortality rates due to opioids and heroin.  Over the summer of 2015 alone, Adams County EMS saw four times the number of heroin overdoses with emergency first responders doubling the stock of on-hand Narcan to combat the high rate of overdose calls.
Last year, I was proud to vote in favor of both the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) and the 21st Century Cures Act. These bills, which passed Congress and were ultimately signed into law, expanded resources to battle this wide-spread epidemic, including the authorization of $1 billion over two years to directly combat the opioid problem. Passing comprehensive, bipartisan legislation was a step in the right direction, but the fight is not over. Our meeting this week was a great opportunity to update the Secretary on the progress our local communities are making, and a chance to discuss the tools they need as we move forward. I want to thank the Secretary for visiting Quincy and look forward to future opportunities to work together in battling this epidemic.
Hopping Around the District
￼
On my trip around the district this week, I had the chance to catch up with Matt Potts in Normal to hear more about his growth and expansion of Destihl Brewery in the central Illinois area. Local businesses like Destihl are regularly creating jobs and opportunities right here at home and Congress needs to encourage a better business environment for them to prosper. Comprehensive tax reform is one way to begin helping and I look forward to the work ahead to finally reform our tax code and help business like Destihl.
Discussing America's Red Rock Wilderness Act
￼
I had the opportunity to meet with members of the Illinois Clergy & Laity group this week in my Peoria District Office to discuss federal and congressional efforts to protect federal lands, monuments, and wilderness areas in the western United States.
Swearing In Our New Menard County State's Attorney
￼ ￼
It was a pleasure to attend the swearing in ceremony for Gabe Grosboll this week in Petersburg as he was administered the oath of office to serve as Menard County's newest State's Attorney. I am confident Gabe will serve Menard County and the State of Illinois with the highest standards serving in his new role.
Tax Reform Means Jobs and Opportunities for Vermeer
￼
I had the opportunity to meet with various employees of Vermeer Midwest in Goodfield to discuss how comprehensive tax reform will help boost jobs and opportunities for the Vermeer equipment dealer.
Vermeer Midwest was founded in 1971 when Junior Kool (Fourth from the right) opened his first location in Eureka, Illinois. The company is a full service dealership with nine branches total, dealing in parts, service, sales, and rentals.

100 Years of Fire Safety
￼
I had the privilege of joining and recognizing the Peoria Heights Fire Department to celebrate their 100th anniversary recently.
These folks are true heroes of our community, sacrificing their lives each and every day to stand committed to the safety of those in their community. Thank you for your service and congratulations on your first 100 years!
A Congressional Award Silver Medal 
￼
I presented Neeti Warhekar her Congressional Award Silver Medal for her continued work in giving back to her community. The Congressional Award promotes and recognizes achievement, initiative, and service in America's youth and provides a unique opportunity for young people to set and achieve personally challenging goals that build character and foster community service, personal development, and citizenship.
Neeti improved the lives of members of her community by working more than 200 hours at non-profit organizations, volunteering at her local Park District, and at children's camps. She also set (and accomplished) personal goals that led to improved piano skills and physical fitness. Congratulations, Neeti!
￼
Around DC
A Well-Deserved Pay Raise for our Troops
￼
The men and women who keep us safe are one of our country’s most valuable assets, and we have a responsibility to provide them the resources, care and pay raise they need, earned, and deserve. That is why I was proud to support the National Defense Authorization Act again this year.
The House voted 344-81 to rebuild our military by ending a half-decade of cuts, reforming the Pentagon to improve efficiency, and giving our troops a well-deserved pay raise—their largest increase in eight years.

Attending a Signing Ceremony for the 287(g) Program
￼
Attending the signing ceremony in Dallas with ICE officials and 287(g) participating sheriffs.

Last week, I attended a signing ceremony with 18 sheriff's departments, eight of which were from Texas' 27th congressional district, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Dallas for the 287(g) program. 

The 287(g) program allows state and local law enforcement agencies to partner with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for immigration enforcement. Through the program, law enforcement personnel are nominated, trained and approved by ICE to help keep our communities safe and secure.

The following South Texas counties entered the 287(g) program last week: Aransas, Calhoun, Lavaca, Matagorda, Refugio, Wharton, Jackson, and Victoria. Eleven counties from other parts of Texas also joined the program Monday. 

This program is essential to enforcing immigration laws and public safety. I’m glad eight counties in the district I represent are partnering with ICE to keep our communities safe and working with federal law enforcement is one way to do this.

Texas-27 sheriff’s departments participating in the program are:

-Aransas County
-Calhoun County
-Jackson County
-Lavaca County
-Matagorda County
-Refugio County
-Victoria County
-Wharton County

Working Across the District
￼
Clockwise from top left: Holding an employee town hall at Chemours in Ingleside, attending the First Friday Breakfast in Bay City, talking with the Corpus Christi Association of Realtors, visiting the Boys and Girls Club in Bay City.

As your representative in Congress, an important part of my job is listening to the concerns of the folks I represent. I was extremely busy last week traveling the district. Meeting with the people I represent is a great way for me to learn what’s going on in their lives and how I can best represent folks in Washington.

Some of the highlights of last week included:

- Touring the Boys and Girls Club in Bay City and meeting the kids participating in their summer program.

- Visiting the Corpus Christi Association of Realtors for a short real estate town hall. We had a great discussion on port issues, the Harbor Bridge and flood insurance.

- Joining the Port of Corpus Christi for a port stakeholders roundtable. We talked about continued efforts to deepen and widen the channel and the need to incentivize cooperation between business and government in order to get to yes and create jobs.

- Holding an employee townhall at Chemours in Ingleside where, among other things, we discussed improving permitting processes in order to create jobs, putting vocational training back in public education and health care.

- Attending the American Federation of Government Employees' monthly meeting at NAS Corpus Christi to discuss investing in the military and supporting the work performed at CCAD.

Commemorating Startup Day
￼
Debbie and I meeting with the owners of Bloom CoffeeWorks.

Last week, I visited local startup Bloom CoffeeWorks to commemorate Startup Day.

After deciding to create a coffee shop, the creators of Bloom CoffeeWorks, Sarah and Christian, could not find a retail location to fit their budget. After a conversation with the store director at HEB, an idea formed of putting a coffee shop in the store. They pitched the venture to the HEB board and came to an agreement to open a retail space within the HEB in Portland.

Since they opened shop in March 2016, they have been grinding (literally and figuratively!) to grow the business every day and are now in the process of opening their second location at the HEB Plus in Flour Bluff. What started as an idea has now grown to two locations and nine employees in less than two years. Small business startups like Bloom CoffeeWorks are crucial to the American economy, both in terms of job creation and innovation.

Problem Solvers
￼
I’ve said all along: the Affordable Care Act is broken in many areas and desperately needs to be fixed or replaced with a system that works better for everyone. That should be the goal for any lawmaker, regardless of party.
This week, the Problem Solver Caucus stepped up and started that process by outlining ideas aimed at stabilizing the individual markets and helping the American people being harmed by our broken system. 
This isn’t the solution, but it’s a start to address the problems with the ACA.

Senate Passes ‘Right to Try’
The Senate’s bipartisan passage of my ‘Right to Try’ legislation this week is a huge victory for hundreds of thousands of Americans and their families fighting terminal illnesses. 
Every American has the right to fight for their life and the life of their loved one. This action is a critical step toward ensuring that every American has the ‘Right to Try.’  Myself and my colleague, Andy Biggs, will work tirelessly to ensure that the House promptly takes up our companion legislation and that our ‘Right to Try’ mission finally becomes law.

￼

Dear Friends,
Community matters. We're stronger when we come together to find solutions to difficult problems, which is why I couldn't be more proud and excited about the outstanding work we have accomplished through my Community Empowerment Initiative. Monthly, I feature organizations and people whose work    is having a positive and meaningful impact on the lives of those in our local communities.   This month, I wanted to highlight community organizations that have helped families in central Arkansas and across the state through initiatives and community programs that foster both social and economic development. Through these vital programs, lives have been deeply touched and positively affected.   One example is Arkansas’s own Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation (WRF) that has been helping Arkansans through education, economic development, and racial and social justice. Indeed, the late Arkansas Governor Winthrop Rockefeller himself would be inspired. Since its founding, WRF has lived up to its mission, lending a helping hand in communities all over our state and producing noticeable results – including their work on the Arkansas Campaign for Grade-Level Reading (AR-GLR).   In 2011, WRF partnered with Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families and the Arkansas Community Foundation to create the AR-GLR to improve Arkansas students’ reading abilities. The program focuses on helping students read at their appropriate grade levels and invests in encouraging parent and community engagement, school attendance, and summer reading. WRF works to give students the resources to achieve their potential to read at or above their suitable grade level.
       ￼
The campaign’s mission to develop more interest and success in improving youth reading levels in Arkansas is something I personally believe in. While chairman of the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce in 2013, I endorsed and encouraged a similar initiative called AR Kids Read. AR Kids Read partnered with AR-GLR to sustain and improve the reading proficiency of Arkansas’s children.   Since their partnership, AR Kids Read now has a program that provides over 400 tutors from around 50 organizations to each of the four school districts in Pulaski County: Jacksonville/North Pulaski, Little Rock, North Little Rock, and Pulaski Country Special School District. AR Kids Read distributes thousands of books to classrooms in these districts. Furthermore, the AR-GLR is partnering with the Little Rock School District in tackling chronic school absences.   By creating the initiative “Make Every Day Count”, WRF encourages parents to push their children to attend their classes, especially at such a critical developmental stage in their lives. This coming fall, the program hopes to partner with each of the elementary schools in the Little Rock School District to set goals and plans for the 2017-18 school year.   I’m pleased to see the great benefits of WRF’s partnership and investment in our state’s youth. Organizations like the WRF and their partners, including AR Kids Read, are laying the foundation for our Arkansas youth - one book at a time. With further investment and support from citizens and community leaders, the growth of their mission and goals can truly make a difference. Until third grade, we “learn to read.” From that point forward, we “read to learn.” The good work of these organizations fundamentally and truly empowers our communities.   If you would like more information, please visit AR Kids Read and Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation.  Sincerely,
￼ 
Representative French Hill

I’m incredibly proud to be born and raised right here in Southern California. Our communities represent the very best of what America has to offer. That’s why my top focus has always been on helping improve the lives of people all across the San Gabriel Valley and Orange County. Throughout the month of August, I’ll be meeting with local groups, organizations, and small business to hear directly from YOU about enacting practical solutions that grow our economy. 

Keep scrolling below to see my pictures from this past week on the road...

SUPPORTING OUR PUBLIC SAFETY PROS
I spent Wednesday hanging out with our local law enforcement officers and firefighters during the National Night Out in Brea, Fullerton, Placentia, and Rowland Heights. National Night Out is an annual event held in towns across the country where communities can meet our local public safety professionals who keep us safe 24/7. Thank you to all those who protect and serve!

PAVING THE WAY FOR A COMPETITIVE CALIFORNIA
In order for California to compete, we need effective transportation solutions. That’s why today I welcomed Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart to California to discuss transportation priorities for Orange County, LA County, and San Bernardino County. Rep.

EMPOWERING TOMORROW'S LEADERS
When more people are engaged and participating in local, state, and federal government, the more empowered we all become. I'm proud to support organizations like the California Women's Leadership Association, which aims to get more California women off the sidelines and into leadership roles throughout our community. I had a great time this past week meeting with CWLA leaders in Orange County.

One of the biggest honors I have in serving our community in Congress is the opportunity to visit with local small businesses and hear their accomplishments and the successes of their employees.

IndTool in Burlington was created 1986 when Dave Phillips started it using the $2,400 he made from selling his wife's car. Now, IndTool is a successful small business employing more than 40 people. The hard work of Mr. Phillips and the good people at IndTool is a testament to the American spirit. We had a great visit to IndTool this week to hear directly from them.

This week, we also had a great visit with Jane and her awesome staff at Iseley Farm in Alamance County. This farm has been serving our state since 1790. Family-owned farms are the backbone of our community and our entire nation, ensuring we have food on our tables and clothes on our backs. 

We need to continue reforming the federal government and making it work for our small businesses, entrepreneurs and employees – not special interests and insiders.

Please keep reading for the full update. Have a blessed week.

I'm honored to name Victory Junction volunteer Larry Wagner as our Sixth District Community Hero of the Month. Visiting with him this week at the camp in Randleman, you can see the joy he brings to the campers and everyone else around him.  Larry has been the volunteer archery instructor at Victory Junction camp since 2005. Over the past 12 years, he has built an archery program that has inspired countless children and he has developed special bows to accommodate children in wheelchairs.  Larry has the unique ability to help children reach their full potential in a sport that many would think impossible for them to achieve. He sees opportunity where others see limitations. It is individuals like Larry – the “unsung heroes” of our community – who should inspire us all to invest more in the lives of others. Thank you for your service to our community and to kids across the country, Larry!  Read more about Larry's great work here.

More and More NC Parents and Students Are Taking Advantage of Helpful Choices in Education
￼
North Carolina is leading the way in giving our young minds options that serve them best and help unlock their boundless potential. For many, traditional public schools have been successful, but that model simply does not fit every student. We need to focus on what is best for the children.

Children succeed when parents and teachers are empowered with education decisions to help their students flourish. That is why I introduced the A-PLUS Act. A-PLUS will restore local control of education, giving parents and teachers the tools to help ensure each child has access to a quality education and the possibility to achieve their dreams.

Learn more about the A-PLUS Act here and read how parents, teachers and students in North Carolina are celebrating school choice here.

Report: NC Has 41% Increase in Children in Foster Care Because of Parents’ Drug Use
￼
From The News and Observer: ""The number of children in North Carolina entering foster care because of parents using drugs has increased by a remarkable 41 percent from 2012 to 2016.""

This is heartbreaking. Children need their parents. The family is the building block of civilization and this e
epidemic is destroying lives, futures, and families.

In April, we held a roundtable discussion with local law enforcement and treatment facilities about ways to combat this problem. Last year, the House passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act on a 407-5 vote. It added measures to help prevent many cases of opioid abuse and stop tragedies before they occur. This fight is not over though. We will remain committed to working with first responders and local governments to combat it.

Wicker Works to Prevent Child Deaths in Overheated Cars
Public Awareness Campaign, New Legislation Draw Attention to Nationwide Issue
The arrival of National Heatstroke Awareness Day on July 31 came on the heels of some particularly heart-wrenching news.  A 7-month-old and a 1-year-old died within 24 hours in Phoenix after being left in cars as temperatures topped 100 degrees outside.
The tragedy is all too familiar, and it devastates families across the nation.  According to the website NoHeatstroke.org, which compiles extensive research and data on the issue, 29 children have died from heatstroke in cars this year.  Eleven of these deaths happened in July. 
Unfortunately, our state has not escaped these tragedies.  NoHeatstroke.org found that Mississippi has had the worst number of deaths per capita, with 17 children dying in parked cars since 1998.  Other states with excessively hot weather also had high numbers.  Nationwide, heatstroke in a vehicle has been the cause of death for 729 children over the past 19 years  most of them accidental, with parents or caregivers simply forgetting a child was in the backseat of the car.  
How We Can Be More Vigilant
There are ways to prevent the loss of innocent life in a parked vehicle.  Parents, caregivers, and vigilant citizens all play a role in keeping children out of harms way or rescuing them from an overheated car.  Safe Kids Worldwide, a nonprofit group focused on child safety, recommends that drivers put a purse or briefcase in the backseat to remind them that a child is there.  The group also suggests having daycare providers alert parents if their child has not arrived.  Keeping car doors locked can ensure that children will not get inside without adult supervision.    
I have joined the nationwide effort by the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers to raise awareness about the dangers of leaving a child in a parked car.  This effort includes a public service announcement reminding everyone to call 911 if they see a child alone in a car.  Children are especially vulnerable to heatstroke in a vehicle, where temperatures can soar past 120 degrees.  Not only are they unable to unlock or open the door, but their body temperature rises faster than that of adults.  A heatstroke can take a childs life in matter of minutes.
How We Can Make Our Cars Safer
Conversations on the future of automotive technology, including autonomous vehicles, have already begun in Congress.  The development of devices that could help save children from heatstroke in a car should be part of these discussions.  I recently cosponsored the Helping Overcome Trauma for Children Alone in Rear Seat Act (HOT CARS Act), which could lead to the installation of sensors in cars that let drivers know when a child has been left in the backseat.  These features should be as commonplace as airbags or child safety locks.  Given the amount of time that we spend in our cars getting to school or work, safety is not a feature to shortchange.   
I hope these conversations in Congress and public service announcements will raise awareness about the heatstroke risk for children in vehicles.

Update on Congressional Gold Medal for Sen. Dole:
This week, the Senate unanimously passed legislation to award Senator Bob Dole with the Congressional Gold Medal. This is companion legislation to H.R. 3332, which I introduced in the House last month, which currently has 73 bipartisan cosponsors from across the ideological perspective.
This is a promising step toward our goal of awarding a Congressional Gold Medal to Senator Dole. With 100 Senators as cosponsors, it is a remarkable sign of the depth of respect and support for Senator Dole. I applaud Senator Roberts on this effort; he truly went above and beyond. Now, I encourage my House colleagues to join me in this bipartisan effort so that we can get this legislation to the Presidents desk this fall.

The Furthering Access to Coordinated Treatment for Seniors Act:
Recently, I introduced the Furthering Access to Coordinated Treatment for Seniors (FACTS) Act, along with Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-D), which directs the Department on Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a process by which Medicare Part D plans can request drug claims data to promote appropriate use of medications.
Often when our seniors are discharged from medical care with a prescription, they may forget to fill the claim or dont take the full regiment as prescribed. This can lead to folks ending up back up in the doctors office or hospital, causing them great discomfort and costing taxpayers dollars. 
The FACTS Act will remedy this problem by directing HHS to open up lines of communication within Medicare so that Medicare Part D prescription drug plans can request information from hospitals and doctors offices (Medicare Parts A and B). This information will detail prescription claims data in order to ensure those in Medicare are fully utilizing their medications as prescribed. This bipartisan legislation will help to save taxpayers money, and will improve the health and lives of seniors across the country.

Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) play a critical role in ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to needed care. However, the opaque process used by MACs to make coverage decisions can limit or deny patients access to necessary care.
For many procedures, doctors must seek reimbursement permission from one of the 12 local MACs that are responsible for designated areas of the country. However, each MAC is independent, meaning that a procedure covered in one state may not be covered in another.
This arbitrary care needs to stop, for the wellbeing of our seniors. By establishing a clear process so that only health experts are making sound health decisions, we can improve transparency and accountability among MACs and ensure our nations seniors receive quality health care treatment.

ICYMI - Dialysis Accreditation Bill Passes The House:
Recently, my bill, H.R. 3166, to provide independent accreditation for dialysis facilities passed the House of Representatives as part of the Medicare Part B Improvement Act of 2017.
This is another great step in providing independent third party accreditation for dialysis centers. I am pleased to see this legislation passed with bipartisan support and is now headed to the United States Senate. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation as it will help folks get the care they desperately need.

￼

Dear Lindsey,
This past week, I was excited to spend time traveling across the First District for the start of the August work period.  With the House out of session, I am using this time to catch up with the people I represent in Congress and learn more about how national policies are impacting people right here at home. Here is a quick recap and some of the highlights on my busy week in Southwest Alabama.
On Monday, I kicked off the week in Fairhope testing out my radio voice in an interview with Lori DuBose on WABF 1480 AM.  In my interview, I discussed the ongoing health care debate, national security, and other high priorities. If you couldn't tune in last week, you can listen to the interview here.  
￼
Talking the issues on WABF in Fairhope.
As you may know, last month, I introduced the Save Local Business Act to address the National Labor Relations Board's (NLRB's) joint employer standard and the impact it has on small business owners nationwide.  This legislation will provide clarity to our franchise small business owners and their employees about what it means to own and operate your own business.  On the heels of this announcement, I sat down for a round table discussion with local franchise leaders at the Wendy's in Spanish Fort.  We discussed how the franchise model is under attack due to the NLRB's joint employer decision and how I am working to provide a legislative solution in Washington.  
￼
Visiting with our college and university presidents in my Mobile office.
One thing I look forward to each year is the chance to get together with our K-12 Superintendents to talk about issues impacting our local schools.  As a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, these conversations help better enable me to advocate for our local students, teachers, and schools.
In that same vein, another exciting meeting took place this week with the leaders of local colleges and universities.  I talked with presidents from Bishop State Community College, The University of South Alabama, University of Mobile, Spring Hill College, Coastal Alabama Community College, United States Sports Academy, and Columbia Southern University one afternoon for a discussion on higher education issues.  These institutions are very important to our area, and I am committed to working with them to help our students succeed.
￼
Visiting Steiner Construction in Bayou La Batre
This week, I also spent a day traveling around Bayou La Batre. My day began at Safe Harbor, part of the Bayou La Batre Housing Authority.  Safe Harbor has done some impressive work cleaning up the program and turning things around financially.  I also visited Jubilee Seafood and had a good conversation with Walton Kraver and his team about some of the serious regulatory challenges facing his family-owned business and the seafood industry.  
During my trip in Bayou La Batre, I also paid a visit to Steiner Construction, where we discussed some of the various issues they are having with the federal government and ways Congress can help support our nation's shipbuilders.  My final stop in the town was Mostellar Medical Center.  This community health center provides critical services to a large portion of Mobile and Washington Counties.  It is clear that Congress must do more to support community health centers like Mostellar, which provide vital services to under-served areas and populations.
￼
Me and the owners of Cyclops Vapor in Daphne
As always, I enjoy the opportunity to tour locally-owned businesses and learn about different ways Congress can help grow our local economy.  I visited Cyclops Vapor in Daphne to meet with their owners and employees. I have co-sponsored the FDA Deeming Authority Clarification Act, which prevents the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from retroactively regulating e-cigarette and vapor products.  I enjoyed touring the facility and seeing first hand the hard work that goes into this industry. 
Next, I headed down to Foley to visit with the Tanger Outlets team. It was a rainy afternoon, and the outlets were covered up with beachgoers. I talked with the Tanger leadership team about the important impact they have on the local community, as well as their priorities in tax reform.
 ￼
Speaking to the Coastal Alabama Business Chamber in Gulf Shores.
I was up and at it early on Friday morning for a visit with the Coastal Alabama Business Chamber down in Gulf Shores. I enjoyed speaking to a packed house during the First Friday Breakfast at LuLu's. I provided an update on three of our important local priorities: the I-10 Bridge, Red Snapper, and the jobs at the Austal Shipyard. I wrapped things up with a number of meetings in my Summerdale office.
Town Hall Meetings
Also this week, I held town hall meetings in Fairhope and Gulf Shores.  I always enjoy the opportunity to address your concerns and hear directly from you.  We covered everything from education to health care to tax reform.  
I was particularly impressed with by the cordial, productive, and thoughtful dialogue.  During this difficult time, it is easy to place blame and allow the ""noise"" to drown out the overarching goal of improving our country.  As your Congressman, I am committed to listening to your thoughts and doing my best to represent the First District in Congress.  
A huge thank you to all who attended our town halls this week. We had a full house at both stops! 
￼
I am excited to announce I will be holding five more town hall meetings throughout the month of August. You can find the full schedule below:
August 23rd at 3:00 pm - Toulminville Town Hall Meeting (John L. LeFlore Magnet High School, 700 Donald Street; Mobile, AL)

Friends, 
If you’re wired into social media, the internet, 24-hour cable news or talk radio, you would think the only things coming out of Washington, D.C. this year are President Trump; Russia; controversy; investigations; protests; anger; and gridlock.
It’s been difficult to hear or see the reality over the blaring and flashing “BREAKING NEWS” alerts which fill the airwaves continuously each broadcast hour.
The reality is the most common sounds coming from the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2017 are the words “the bill is passed”.
While media talking heads and blogs drone on and on about chaos, soap operas and countdown clocks to drive up their ratings, readership and clicks, the Republican-led House has been focused on what matters to Iowans. House Republicans have been passing common sense solutions which focus on you and your concerns.
As we head into August, the House has already passed a total of over 250 bills so far this year. Bills which make solid progress to bring about more transparency, accountability, opportunity, fairness and freedom.
That is a significant number of times the words “the bill is passed” have been spoken in the House in 2017.
The House has passed bills focusing on Iowa Main Street and your economic security by:
	•	Working toward a fairer, simpler tax code to give more money back to taxpayers and spur economic growth
	•	Revitalizing Main Street by repealing burdensome regulations on local community banks which small businesses and farmers in our rural economy rely on every day
	•	Expanding apprenticeships and skills-based education to help Iowans find new opportunities to get better-paying jobs
The House has passed bills that focused on patient-centered healthcare by:
	•	Keeping our promise and passing legislation to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a system protecting people with pre-existing conditions while bringing down costs and expanding choices for Iowans
	•	Ending rampant medical lawsuits that drive up the cost of your health care
	•	Restoring competition through association health plans for small businesses and others who want to band together and level the playing field
The House passed bills which begin the important work of rebuilding our military by:
	•	Strengthening national security by authorizing additional resources to counter threats, increase end-strength, protect our troops and enhance our military’s readiness
	•	Providing our dedicated service members with their largest – and well deserved - pay raise in eight years
	•	Adding thousands of additional military personnel to help defend our homeland and her people
The House passed bills which provide peace of mind for Iowa’s families by:
	•	Prioritizing and targeting additional resources to fight the opioid epidemic with treatment and prevention
	•	Providing sweeping reforms to end human trafficking with tougher penalties for sex traffickers and increased support for victims
	•	Increasing resources for border security and strengthening enforcement of our immigration laws to protect law-abiding citizens from dangerous criminal aliens and crack down on sanctuary cities
	•	Recognizing the value of human life and protecting it
	•	Delivering affordable and reliable energy, so Iowans find relief in the prices at the pump and at home while continuing to ensure America’s energy independence
And, the House passed bills that begin the monumental task of fixing a broken Washington by: 
	•	Demanding accountability at the Veterans Administration so employees can be fired, demoted, or suspended for not doing their jobs
	•	Offering record relief from the red tape created the past eight years with 14 bills to strike harmful regulations from the books
	•	Adding more transparency and accountability for unelected bureaucrats by making any major regulation subject to an up-or-down vote of Congress
I’ve not been distracted by the newest countdown clocks or partisan sniping in Washington, D.C. You don’t care about those things – and neither do I. You care about what’s best for your family and you.
You care about finding a good job, economic and personal security, taking care of your family and their happiness. And you care about making it so that the lives of your children and grandchildren are better than the lives we and our parents and grandparents lived.
So don’t buy into the internet and media hype. The Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives has spent 2017 focused on issues that matter to you and your family. Our record proves it. And we’re going to continue to stay focused on what matters most to us – serving the people of Iowa and the rest of America by fighting for common sense solutions that help you.
Take care.

Congressman McHenry Weekly Update 


Did You Know?



The House has been hard at work passing bills that are important to you and your families. Since January we have voted to repeal and replace Obamacare, made important reforms to the VA system, and given our troops the biggest raise they've received in years. We've accomplished a great deal that will help improve the lives of the American people. Learn more about what the House has been up to since January by clicking here or on the image below to check out DidYouKnow.gop via the House Republican Conference.

Undoing Harmful Regulations



The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s harmful anti-arbitration rule put trial lawyers and special interests before American consumers. It was another example of deeply flawed regulations from an Obama-era bureaucrat. Recently, the House of Representatives used the Congressional Review Act to undo this regulation and help ensure American consumers are protected. This is the fifteenth time this year the House has used the Congressional Review Act to undo Obama-era regulations. Click here or on the image below to read my full statement on passage of H.J. Res. 111.

31 Years, 31 Reasons
 
 
America’s outdated tax code has stayed the same for 31 years and as a result we are less competitive, less productive, and holding ourselves back. When tax reform was accomplished in 1986, we positioned ourselves to be ahead of other nations. Today, however, other countries are passing us by. For our current well-being and especially for the future of our kids and grandkids, we simply cannot continue to let this happen.  It’s been 31 years since America has reformed the tax code and there are 31 days in August, so for each day this month I’ll be highlighting a reason why we need tax reform for families, individuals, businesses, and the economy. 
	•	Reason #1: The broken tax code has helped cement the slow-growth of sub-2 percent economic growth. But if we reform our tax code, the U.S. economy would have the potential to grow closer to 3 percent or higher, creating millions of new jobs and income for the average family of four would be thousands of dollars higher. 
	•	Reason #2: Our current tax system is burdensome and complex, costing American families hours of compliance and hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars to file. Independent estimates show that taxpayers spend a combined $99 billion each year complying with the individual income tax, money Americans could otherwise use on what is important to them and their families.
	•	Reason #3: Americans at every income level deserve to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks. Every dollar Americans can keep from their paychecks and put toward their own needs and visions is a dollar that helps grow our economy.
	•	Reason #4: Today, small businesses create roughly half of all jobs in the United States. Yet, these businesses are currently taxed as high as 44.6 percent. Starting and sustaining a small business is hard enough, and our broken tax code only makes it harder by forcing small businesses to send so much of their income to the federal government.
	•	Reason #5: America’s tax code is now more than 2.4 million words long. That’s nearly six times as long as in 1955, and almost twice as long as in 1985. The ever-growing length of our tax code only makes it more complex and less useful.
	•	Reason #6: Current tax relief provisions that are available to help families can be incredibly confusing and hard to use. For example, there are over 12 different overlapping tax benefits related to education. Families must wade through 100 pages of instructions to figure out if they qualify for help with tuition costs. The tax code should work for American families, not against them. 
 

 
Jobs, jobs, jobs
 
 
In July, 209,000 new jobs were added across the U.S., bringing the number of jobs created this year to more than one million. The unemployment rate is now at a 16% low and consumer confidence is at a 16 year high. The labor force participation rate is also up, meaning a greater share of Americans are joining the workforce. This is good news for our economy and for our country.

This is thanks in part to President Trump’s agenda of putting America first and working to rebuild our workforce and economy. Already, in some cases with the help of Congress, he has slashed job-killing regulations across industries and helped unleash the growth for American businesses. We’ve also worked together to approve the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines, job-creating projects with bipartisan approval that had been held up by the Obama Administration for political reasons.

There’s still plenty to be done, but this is a step in the right direction and I’ll continue working in Congress and with President Trump to create more jobs, grow our economy, and make America competitive in the world. Learn more by watching President Trump's weekly address below.
 

￼
 
 
A Productive House
 
 
When you turn on the news, you often see footage of people screaming at each other or horror stories of the day. You probably only hear negative things about Congress and while I get frustrated at times, too, we have been working this year to pass bills relating to issues that matter to you and your family. Congress, especially the House of Representatives, is working to get things done for the American people.

So far this year, we’ve tackled big issues like passing a bill to reform our health care system and to roll back the job-killing regulations of the Dodd-Frank banking law. We’ve also passed reforms that help provide better, more efficient care to veterans through the VA and have been consistently rolling back last-minute regulations and rules that hold us back and hinder economic growth.

GOOD NEWS
Police officers and other first responders have the monumental task of keeping our communities and families safe, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. But so often we find that they go above and beyond to help their communities, doing more than just what their job requires. This week the Darlington Police Department did just that when they set up a school supply drive for Robert Odom, a single father raising four kids who are all in school. The kids got the supplies they needed and the community donated so much extra that the remaining supplies will be given to the local schools for other students to use!

Meet Richard | How Can I Help You? | Issues | Media Center | Contact Me
Friends, 
 
Last week, people all across the United States celebrated the 34th Annual National Night Out. Thousands of communities  big and small, urban and rural  held events so people could get to know their neighbors who serve as law enforcement officers. Ive always been a huge supporter of this event every year. Its a great chance to encourage neighborhood camaraderie and help build relationships between law enforcement and the people they protect. The end goal is to make our neighborhoods safer for all. 
 
And, its always a lot of fun. 
 
From the parades, cookouts, and games, to the safety demonstrations and discussions, there really is something for everyone to enjoy. But the best part is getting to say thank you to the men and women who serve as our first responders. These heroes work tirelessly to protect our freedoms, keep us safe, respond to emergencies, and represent our communities as loyal friends and incredible citizens. They are the ones we turn to in times of crisis. And they deserve our unyielding respect and gratitude.
 
Every day, our law enforcement officers leave their homes and put themselves in harms way to protect us and enforce our laws. They make sure our roads are safe. They are always there to extend a helping hand for those in need. And they do all of this with courage, compassion and respect. We are so fortunate for their service.
 
Several weeks ago, Im sure you saw the story about Asheville Police Department senior officers Carrie Lee and Joe Jones. These two officers made a splash  quite literally  when they responded to a noise complaint and, after finding no laws being broken, joined in on a neighborhood slip-and-slide. Did you read the recent story about the time a Greensboro Police Officer prayed with a man on the side of the street? 
 
There are hundreds more stories just like this that show the compassion of our law enforcement community.
 
At a time when the police are too often targeted by unfair rhetoric and even violence, we must never take them for granted. They dont do the job for the glory or the gratitude. But we should never stop trying to give it to them.
 
Thats one reason why I was proud to support the Honoring Hometown Heroes Act (H.R. 1892) which honors law enforcement by permitting the American flag to be flown at half-staff when a police officer, firefighter, or first responder is killed in the line of duty. I was also proud to support the Public Safety Officers Benefits Improvement Act of 2017 (S. 419) which makes several changes to Department of Justice programs to supply death and disability benefits to public safety officers and their families. This critical legislation was signed into law in June. Its an important measure to ensure a law enforcement officers family will be taken care of in the tragic event they are killed or disabled in the line of duty.
 
I am thankful for all those who have answered the call to serve and protect, and I look forward to continuing my work alongside them to build a better future for all North Carolinians.
 
 
Until next week,
￼
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)

Dear Friend, 
It has been a busy week in the Eighth District, as I met with many constituent groups to discuss the work that I have been doing in Washington as well as the issues that are important to them.
On Wednesday, I had the privilege of speaking at the American Peanut Shellers Association and National Peanut Buying Points Pre-Harvest Meeting in Cordele, Georgia. I shared our efforts in the House Agriculture Committee to create and pass a strong Farm Bill, crafting legislation that works for our nation’s farmers, ranchers, and stakeholders alike. The Farm Bill greatly influences our rural economies, international trade, environmental conservation, and food safety policies, so I am grateful to have had the opportunity to discuss its impact with this group.
                                         ￼

Rep. Austin Scott speaks to American Peanut Shellers Association in Cordele. 
I am humbled and honored to have been presented with an award from the National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC), for my support of Federally Qualified Health Centers. The NACHC serves as the national health care advocacy organization for America’s medically underserved and uninsured, continuously working to improve the community health centers that serve as their health care home. 
                                        ￼
Rep. Austin Scott and members of the NACHC in Warner Robins. 
I especially enjoyed spending time with children at Childcare Network in Valdosta. As a father of two, I value a high-quality early care and education system, and I appreciate the work that Childcare Network does to help prepare our children to succeed at an early age.  
                                        ￼

Rep. Austin Scott reads to children at Childcare Network in Valdosta.
In honor of Purple Heart Day tomorrow, I would like to take a moment to recognize the brave men and women who have received the combat decoration of the Purple Heart. Their courage and resolve in the face of battle is an honorable part of our nation’s heritage and an inspiration for generations to come. May the time spent honoring them help ensure that their sacrifices will never be forgotten. Thank you to our veterans for their service to our nation.
                             ￼

NEWS FROM THE 22nd DISTRICT
Renew NY-22
This week, I announced Renew NY-22, a plan to create jobs, grow the economy and increase economic opportunity here in upstate New York.
As the owner of a small manufacturing firm, I ran for Congress to fight for hardworking Americans who have been neglected for far too long and I understand firsthand the hardships that businesses throughout our region face on a daily basis. Throughout my time in Congress, it has been my top priority to provide a voice for hardworking families and small businesses while fighting to rebuild our communities. 
Throughout the month of August, I will continue to highlight aspects of Renew NY-22. This week, I  focused on restoring economic opportunity. Throughout the week, I had the opportunity to hear the problems facing our region firsthand. I spoke to business owners and their employees, toured manufacturing facilities and met with local Chambers of Commerce in an effort to find innovative ways to generate economic growth.
Read Renew NY-22 here:
Restoring Economic Opportunity.
In June, with my support the House passed H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act. This bill rolls back a range of burdensome Dodd-Frank regulations that have restrained growth, hampered innovation, and raised costs for consumers all while boosting profits for big banks. I am also introducing legislation to ease the chartering process for new banks so that rural communities have greater access to capital and banking services. Since 2008, only three new banks have been chartered and, on average, we loose one community bank each day.  This has put rural communities at a serious disadvantage.
To increase growth locally, I introduced H.R. 3293,  the Support Procurement of our Nation’s Stainless Steel Act. This bill would create new opportunities for domestic manufacturers like Sherrill Manufacturing, that produce American made flatware. I am also an original cosponsor of H.R. 2264, the Make it in America Manufacturing Communities Act. This bipartisan bill codifies the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership, which supports regionally-driven approaches to increase manufacturing.
Reforming Our Tax Code.
Simplifying our tax code is key to creating jobs and a level playing field for American businesses. Today, our tax code is riddled with special interest loopholes that benefit the well-off at the expense of hardworking New Yorkers. We must reduce corporate tax rates to bring jobs back to America and simplify our tax code so that all taxpayers have a fair shot.
I will continue to advocate for provisions of our tax code that benefit Upstate families, small businesses, and municipalities while pushing to overhaul those that are simply broken. In addition to protecting the mortgage interest and charitable deductions, it is my priority to preserve the federal deduction for state and local taxes, which saves New York taxpayers thousands each year. I also strongly support tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provide local municipalities a reliable and efficient way of financing local infrastructure projects.  I am also an original cosponsor and champion of H.R. 1871, the Property Tax Reduction Act. This bill will correct an oversight in federal law that has allowed Albany to pass along the costs of its soaring Medicaid program onto local counties, burdening our local governments with increased tax liabilities and driving up our property taxes.
Revitalizing The Agricultural Sector. 
Agriculture is among upstate New York’s most important industries and has for decades been a vital part of our region’s heritage. In recent years, unfair trade agreements, rising regulatory costs, and distortions in the labor market have made it more difficult for family farms to grow and thrive in the Mohawk Valley and Southern Tier.
I am working to protect Upstate agriculture, push back against bad trade deals, and fight federal overreach. I am a cosponsor of H.R. 281, the Family Farm Relief Act. This bill streamlines the H-2A Agricultural Visa program so that it works better for farmers who lack access to a stable and reliable labor pool. I also supported passage of H.R. 26, the REINS Act. This bill would require Congressional approval of significant agency regulations that have the potential to impact agriculture. I am also leading the charge to change and reform the Dairy Margin Protection Program so that it actually works for farmers who are paying into it.
Reinvesting In Our Infrastructure.
Due to a lack of strong and sustained investments, America’s infrastructure is lagging behind the rest of the developed world. In upstate New York, too many of our roads and bridges are in dire need of repair and both Albany and Congress have shirked their responsibilities for too long. As our infrastructure ages and no new investments are made, local municipalities face a growing backlog of projects and our country risks losing its competitive advantage.
With an infrastructure proposal on the horizon, I am committed to making sure upstate New York gets its fair share and that funding is spent in a fiscally responsible way that targets those projects most in need of support. First, Congress must fully fund the highway and transit programs already authorized under the FAST Act and ensure that funding is sustained over time so that states and municipalities have the resources to actually follow through on projects. Second, Congress must act to modernize America’s air travel infrastructure by passing a proposal to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. Third, Congress must provide for the maintenance of our nation’s ports, such as the Port of Oswego, by funding existing dredging projects.
Rebuilding Our Communities. 
Opioid and heroin addiction has reached crisis levels in upstate New York, requiring immediate attention. Stunted economic growth and acute job loss have no doubt contributed to the drug crisis, as a lack of opportunity has led to hopelessness and despair for too many New Yorkers.  As a member of the Congressional Bipartisan Heroin Task Force, I am committed to pushing forward bold policies that aggressively address the problems of drug addiction. I am an original cosponsor of H.R. 2938, the Road to Recovery Act, which will help states increase drug treatment options for Medicaid enrollees.  I am also a cosponsor of H.R. 1781, the Comprehensive Fentanyl Control Act, which increases penalties related to the distribution of Fentanyl. In addition, I continue to call on House and Senate leaders to fully fund provisions of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), which was passed last year to address the growing drug crisis. I will also fight to protect and preserve Social Security, which remains a vitally important lifeline for Upstate seniors.   

Manufacturing Round Table
On Tuesday, I hosted a manufacturing round table at Revere Copper in Rome, NY with representatives from manufacturing facilities across the 22nd District.
During the manufacturing round table, I spoke with local business leaders about the specific hardships and challenges facing job creators in upstate New York. They highlighted the need for tax and regulatory reform, infrastructure upgrades and the high cost of energy. 
In upstate New York, a number of problems have long had a direct bearing on the success and growth of the manufacturing industry in our region. One issue that came up repeatedly was the need for more skills training, which will increase the pool of qualified applicants that our local employers can tap into. 
Expanding career and technical education must be a priority in Washington. Just recently, the House of Representatives passed the bipartisan Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, but we must do more to improve the skills and qualifications of our workforce. The feedback from today’s meeting will be vitally important in helping me craft meaningful legislation to help job creators grow and thrive in Upstate.
￼￼
Manufacturing Plant Tours
￼￼
Following the Manufacturing Round Table, I toured Revere Copper Products. Revere was founded by Paul Revere and is one of the oldest continuously operating manufacturers in the entire nation.
￼￼
On Wednesday, I visited Feldmeier Plant in Little Falls. Feldmeier, a family business, is the largest manufacturer of sanitary alloy tanks in the nation. Thank you to the employees and the entire Feldmeier family for the tour and taking the time to speak with me about your operation here in Herkimer County.
￼￼
On Thursday, I had the opportunity to tour Raymond Corp. in Greene, Chenango County to learn more about their manufacturing operation, employees and the problems they face. Raymond Corp. manufactures forklifts used by a number of nationwide companies including Amazon and Home Depot.
 ￼￼
I also visited DORON Precision Systems in Binghamton. DORON manufactures state-of-the art driving simulation systems to train law enforcement, first responders, commercial truck drivers, transit bus drivers and novice drivers.
Business Round Tables
This week, I hosted round tables with the Greater Binghamton Chamber of Commerce, the Herkimer Chamber of Commerce and the Cortland Chamber of Commerce. During the round tables, I discussed Renew NY-22 and spoke with local leaders to learn more about the specific challenges facing the business community in our region.
￼￼￼￼
Coffee with Claudia in Cortland
Thank you to everyone who joined us at the Cortland Senior Center on Friday morning. I enjoyed the opportunity to discuss a wide range of issues including the challenges facing our community and the work I'm doing in Congress on behalf of the 22nd District.

Greetings,
This week, the Senate passed a bill that Senator John Cornyn and I sponsored to rename the Kingsville, Texas Border Patrol station after fallen Border Patrol Agent Javier Vega, Jr. Agent Vega served in the U.S. Marine Corps, and thereafter served as a Border Patrol agent and canine handler. On a fishing trip with his family on August 3, 2014, Agent Vega was killed while protecting his family from two criminal illegal aliens. Agent Vega dedicated his life to the safety and security of his family, the state of Texas, and this nation. I am grateful for my colleagues support of this bill, which will ensure we never forget his life of service and sacrifice.
I also joined my colleagues in introducing a bipartisan bill to eliminate legal loopholes for websites like Backpage, based in Dallas, that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking, and bring justice for those who have been victimized and exploited. Texas is not immune to the heinous industry of human trafficking, and I am hopeful this bill will hold these offenders accountable in the strongest terms, and save lives.
A few weeks ago,  I had the honor of introducing my friend and former Texas senator Kay Bailey Hutchison at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. I am pleased that this week, my colleagues worked swiftly to unanimously confirm her as our new US ambassador to NATO. Kay’s dedication and commitment to safeguarding America’s national security will serve her well in this new role protecting America’s and our allies’ interests.
Please read below for an update from this last week.

Friends,
It has been great being back in Northeast Ohio and seeing so many friendly faces.
Facebook Event at LCC
I want to thank Lakeland Community College for partnering with me this week to bring Facebook's Boost Your Business program to Northeast Ohio. 
The Facebook small business team provided training to attendees with the most up-to-date tools, insights, and best practices for growing businesses on Facebook and Instagram. Attendees also heard from local business owners during a panel discussion on their best practices. 
It was a great opportunity to work with small business owners and entrepreneurs from the community and I was honored to be a part of the event. 
￼
Safran Facility
I had the opportunity to tour the Safran Group Facility in Twinsburg this week. It was great to discuss the success of the global high-technology company that has brought 5,000 jobs to the country, a good portion of which are in Ohio, in the fields of aerospace, defense, and space. We also discussed the projected 12,000 additional employees the company will bring to the country after their acquisition of Zodiac Aerospace. 
It was great to see the facility and meet the people who are doing great work in Northeast Ohio. 
￼
￼
Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy
On Thursday I had the pleasure of meeting with representatives from the Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy at Caruso's Coffee. Caruso's Coffee, a family business, has been affected by regulatory overreach and we had a great discussion regarding ways in which my colleagues and I in Congress can help alleviate the burdensome regulations that small businesses all over the country are feeling.

8/6/17 11:07,Beyond resistance: Addressing income inequality & ensuring a living wage,"Update | Sunday, August 6, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the ninth day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: addressing income inequality and ensuring a living wage.
It’s no secret that income inequality is a major issue plaguing America today. The richest 400 Americans have more money than the combined wealth of the bottom 61 percent of the country, more than 194 million people.
It is clear that we need to create a more equitable society, where every American earns a living wage for their honest work.
In 2016, nearly 48 million people earned an annual income of $15,000 or less. That’s barely enough to live on, and certainly not enough to support a family. Today’s federal minimum wage is just $7.25 an hour. It’s out of date with the modern economy, and it’s not keeping up with inflation. Raising the minimum wage would help lift American families out of poverty and encourage spending, investment, and economic growth. It’s promising to see individual cities and states – including Oregon – take steps to help workers, but Congress must act as well. That’s why I joined Reps. Keith Ellison and Bobby Scott to introduce the Raise the Wage Act, which would increase the federal minimum wage incrementally to $15 an hour by 2024.
People also need to be compensated fairly for overtime work. I support reducing the exceptions to overtime pay requirements in the Fair Labor and Standards Act (FLSA). The FLSA requires businesses to pay workers time and a half if they work more than 40 hours in a week. But employees with a salary over $23,660 aren’t eligible for overtime pay, a figure that has not been adjusted for inflation or revisited since 2004. This needs to change.
Another way to lift living standards and worker’s pay is to increase and expand the earned income tax credit (EITC). This tax credit is targeted to increase the wages of the lowest income workers, particularly those with children. It is simple, effective, and has bipartisan support. It’s time to raise and expand the EITC, using the tax code to help people who deserve it most.
In addition to these steps, we must once and for all fix our broken tax code to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

Funding the Anclote River Dredging Project
I have long supported funding for the Anclote River Dredging Project, a critical initiative to boost the economy in Tarpon Springs, across Pinellas County, and throughout the Tampa Bay area. That’s why I recently sent a letter to Florida state officials urging them to approve the City of Tarpon Springs’ application for funding. The river services over 150 marine and tourism related businesses, accounting for $242 million in commerce and more than 1.1 million visitors in 2016. Tarpon Springs also accounts for 56% of all commercial fish landed in Pinellas County, which is then distributed around the Tampa Bay region.
However, silt build-up on the riverbed has caused problems for many large boat operators, preventing a number of annually-porting vessels from docking at Tarpon Springs to offload their goods. In some areas, the water is less than three feet deep at low tide. This severely impacts the 150 businesses in the surrounding area. In fact, without dredging, the region could see a decrease in tourism and commerce, and a shortage of space for commercial fisherman.

The Anclote River Dredging Project would help ensure Pinellas County and Tampa Bay remain a commercial hub and tourist destination for years to come.
FDA Reauthorization Bill Passes Senate
Last week, my colleagues in the Senate passed the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Reauthorization Act, legislation to give the FDA the tools it needs to more efficiently approve safe and effective drugs for patients. If the United States is going to lead the world in biomedical innovation, we need an FDA that can keep up. The FDA should act with the same urgency that patients feel while waiting for cures.
I am especially proud that the bill includes my bipartisan provision to help streamline the FDA approval process for generic drugs when there is little to no other competition in a market. Too often, we have seen bad actors take advantage of monopolies in the market and astronomically raise the price of lifesaving drugs. Patients should not have to worry about the price of the medicines they rely on skyrocketing overnight. By incentivizing lower-cost generic drugs to enter those markets where there is a monopoly, we are using free market solutions to increase competition and drive drug prices down. That’s exactly what my provision seeks to accomplish. Check out this editorial from Bloomberg about the importance of generic drug competition.  
When a breakthrough is made in adult cancer treatment, it can take years, even decades, to extend to pediatric cancers. To help fix this, the FDA Reauthorization Act also includes the RACE for Children Act, a provision that supports the study of promising new cancer drugs for children battling the horrific disease. I co-sponsored the RACE for Children Act as a standalone bill, and I’m pleased it is also part of this important legislation.
The House approved the FDA Reauthorization Act on July 12 in a unanimous, bipartisan vote. Now that the Senate has passed it, the bill is headed to the President’s desk for signature.
VA Releases Report on Opioid Prescribing
Opioid abuse is an equal opportunity destroyer; it doesn’t care if you’re rich or poor, old or young, or if you have served our country. Our Veterans, especially those dealing with chronic pain and mental health problems, are at a higher risk for opioid overdose than civiliansThe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of the Inspector General recently released a report on improving prescribing practices and information sharing to help prevent abuse. Click HERE to read the report. This is a good step towards continuing the work of my two bills, the COVER Act and the PROMISE Act.
Both bills, now signed into law, seek to prevent opioid abuse among Veterans. I introduced the PROMISE Act after the tragic death of Jason Simcakoski, a Veteran who overdosed after being overprescribed opioid medication at a VA hospital. The legislation requires the VA to examine its prescribing and pain management practices, to make sure Veterans are prescribed medication safely.
The COVER Act establishes a commission to examine the VA’s therapy models and the benefits of expanding alternative therapies to Veterans. It provides Veterans with more than a “one-size-fits-all” model of care, and promotes a range of options for treatment like service dog therapy, sports therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and more. As Veterans deal with their physical and invisible wounds, we need to make sure they have access to the care that works best for them. Sometimes, that care does not come in a pill bottle.

 Ryan: Foxconn deal is a game-changer for Wisconsin Milwaukee Journal Sentinel 8/4/2017  By now, you have likely heard the good news. The electronics giant Foxconn is coming to Wisconsin, with plans to add 13,000 jobs, in total, in our region.  This is an absolute game-changer. It means more good-paying jobs and opportunities for hard-working Wisconsinites. And it shows the rest of the country — and the world — that our area truly is a manufacturing powerhouse.  *** I could not have been more excited to make our case to Foxconn’s CEO, Terry Gou. It went something like this: I was born and raised in southeastern Wisconsin. In the late 2000’s, Wisconsin suffered manufacturing loses, and it was devastating for people all across southeastern Wisconsin. But Wisconsinites are resilient—in the face of adversity, we push through. And today, manufacturing in Wisconsin has made a remarkable comeback, and things are only getting better.  *** Of course, there is a lot more we can do, especially on the national level. Take taxes. Right now, we have this crazy system where successful small businesses in our country pay a top marginal tax rate of 44.6 percent. And our overall corporate tax rate is 35 percent.  *** We clearly need to fix our tax code. Our committees in Congress are working on a bold plan as we speak. This is something I have been talking about lately with workers throughout Wisconsin, including employees at Allis-Roller, LDV, InPro, Geneva Supply, and InSinkErator.  With tax reform, you get tax cuts that will ease the burden on you and your family. You get a simpler tax code—so simple that you can do your taxes on a form the size of a postcard. (Wouldn’t that be something?) And you get real fairness—fewer loopholes for special interests and a level playing field for everyone.  The bottom line is that, through all the drama and distractions in Washington, we are focused on the real problems that you care about—especially when it comes to jobs and paychecks.  *** Foxconn’s decision is exciting, but it is just one step. In Congress, I will continue to fight for pro-employee, pro-business, pro-job policies. It’s what my employers in the First District care about, and it’s a privilege to fight for them in Washington.  To read the op-ed online in its entirety, click here.

Common Sense at Work 
This week, I've been putting common sense to work. The American people want Democrats and Republicans to come together to solve problems like skyrocketing health care premiums and to create good paying jobs. Instead of focusing on partisan efforts to kill the ACA, the Problem Solvers Caucus I lead has been focused on how to fix it in a smart way and stabilize the health insurance marketplace. And to create Jersey jobs, I brought an expert job creator to talk with New Jersey businesses. Read on to learn more about the common sense, bipartisan work I'm doing to give New Jersey families and workers a boost. 

Working to Improve Health Care 
Partisan health care efforts died in the Senate last week, so the Problem Solvers Caucus I lead is working to improve the health care system for hardworking Americans. For too long, health care has been viewed as a fiercely partisan battleground, but the Problem Solvers Caucus has shown that it is possible to forge cooperation and fight through the gridlock. We all heard what John McCain said -- it's time for bipartisan solutions. And with premiums increasing by 25% this year in my home state of New Jersey, it’s clear this bipartisan effort to stabilize the health insurance marketplace and lower premiums for everyone is sorely needed. This plan will help small businesses and families, especially those with preexisting conditions, by making permanent cost sharing reductions while protecting Medicaid for seniors and those struggling with substance abuse disorders.

To read more about our plan, check out my op-ed in the New York Times. 

To watch coverage, watch my appearance on MSNBC Live.

Creating Jersey Jobs 
The Export-Import Bank provides a tremendous return on investment for New Jersey, helping our local businesses and economy grow while actually bringing in dollars to the national treasury. It's a win, win, win. That's why I held an Export-Import bank Roundtable with local business leaders at the Hillsdale business Fornazor. Fornazor is a New Jersey company that started with four employees and now has hundreds thanks to support from the Export-Import bank. I was happy to help local businesses learn about the Bank directly from the bank's former Chairman, Fred Hochberg, so they can best leverage these opportunities to boost our economy with more jobs and more exports.

Hearing from You at the Warren County Fair
I encourage you to get out to the Warren County Fair if you haven't yet. When I visited this last week, I loved seeing the 4-H students and tractor pull--a great summer tradition.

￼
Strengthening American Security in the Middle East
I am currently traveling Israel with a Congressional delegation to gain a firsthand understanding of the region’s challenges and how to strengthen ties between the United States and its vital ally. Israel is our most important ally and a beacon of democracy in a troubled region, and I look forward to learning more about how we can strengthen our bilateral relationship and work together to fight terrorism. I also look forward to meeting with political leaders across the region and discussing the need for a lasting peace. I will continue to advocate relentlessly on a bipartisan basis for supporting Israel to strengthen our own national security interests as well as those of our vital ally and friend.

Friends,  After extending the session in Washington, the Senate accomplished a lot this week, including passing legislation, confirming dozens of nominations and more. Scroll through my newsletter to learn how West Virginia stands to benefit.  As we head into the August state work period, I want to remind you that my newsletter will resume in September. Have a wonderful summer!  Health Care Update  The recent debate to repeal and replace Obamacare gave me the opportunity to advocate for changes that would address the concerns I championed on behalf of West Virginians. In doing so, I committed to evaluating any legislation through this lens: when I saw a path forward to improve the bill, I would support it. When the bill was going in a direction that would hurt West Virginians, I would vote against it.  I was successful in helping to reshape the repeal and replace legislation to better provide affordable health care coverage for West Virginians, including securing new funding for opioid treatment and billions of dollars in new resources for states to help individuals afford health insurance premiums, deductibles and co-payments if they transition to private insurance coverage.  These policies were part of the comprehensive legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare that I voted for last week. While the measure did not pass, it was a positive replacement that would have benefited West Virginians.  We all know that Obamacare has not delivered on many of its promises to West Virginians. We also know that we must repair what can be fixed, scrap what is not working, and create a better health care reality before it gets worse. As we do, I will continue advocating for a health care system that works better for all West Virginians.  Making Progress in the Drug Epidemic Fight  Earlier this week, the president’s Commission on Drug Addiction and Opioid Abuse released an interim report that endorsed several of the solutions I have championed, including increased funding to support substance abuse treatment, educational requirements for doctors and expanded access to medication-assisted treatment.  This report also cited Jessie’s Law as a way to ensure medical professionals have full knowledge of their patient’s previous opioid addiction when consent is given. This bipartisan bill, which I supported, passed the Senate this week. It was named after West Virginian Jessie Grubb who lost her life last year after battling addiction. Click here to learn more.
￼
David and Kate Grubb joined Senator Capito last year at an event to introduce Jessie’s Law.
Capito Connect Delivers for Lincoln County  On Tuesday, I was thrilled to announce that Lincoln County will soon have expanded cellular service. Making sure our communities are connected here in West Virginia is one of my top priorities. This news will help expand economic opportunities, maintain safety within our communities and improve the lives of so many West Virginians.

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CXXV
 
Monday, July 31, 2017:  I was honored to be the keynote speaker on Saturday night at the 13th Annual Satilla Riverkeeper Gala in Brantley County.  Along with its historical importance in this area, the Satilla River is a home for wildlife, a recreational source for the people who live in this area and an economic engine for the agriculture of the area.  In the First Congressional District, we are blessed with beautiful barrier islands, vast marshland, and wonderful waterways and the Satilla River is one of the ecological gems we enjoy.  On Sunday, I did a live interview on MSNBC to discuss health care issues.  A link to my interview can be found here.  I’m in the Savannah office first thing this morning where I meet with representatives from Codebase Savannah to learn how they are trying to build up tech in the South by helping train people to build apps, create technology and develop new pathways for education.  Next, I meet with the Georgia Child Care Association and my good friends Ellen and Bernard Reynolds from Atlanta and Audrey Singleton from Richmond Hill.  My next appointment is in downtown Savannah at the Savannah-Chatham Public School Board offices on Bull Street as I participate in the “School’s Open-Drive Carefully” awareness campaign event.  As schools throughout the district open over the next few weeks, we are encouraging drivers to drive carefully this school year. 
￼
Congressman Carter at Fort Stewart
Afterwards, I head to Fort Stewart where I am greeted by the new Commander of the 3rd Infantry Division, Major General Leopoldo Quintas, Jr., and other members of the protocol team.  Gen. Quintas has just recently taken command of the 3rd ID and next week will be deploying to Afghanistan as Deputy Commander of a component of the U.S. Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A) staff.  Troops from the 3rd ID began deploying last month for a 15 month mission in Afghanistan to train, advise and assist Afghan forces.  My first stop on base is a meeting with soldiers from various companies of the 3rd ID as well as spouses.  After introductions I have the opportunity to have an informal discussion with these great Americans and hear their concerns and thoughts.  While it is an honor to hear from the soldiers, I am particularly grateful to hear from the spouses and gain their perspective on Army life.  Next, I board a helicopter to travel to training area Red Cloud Alpha for a gunnery visit.  After visits to the staging areas and safety briefings, I climb in an M1A2 armored tank and fire rounds of artillery which gives me a better understanding of the mechanized forces capabilities.  After witnessing the firepower of this machinery as well as the teamwork and precision displayed by these professional soldiers, I can easily sum up my experience in one word- AWESOME!  Afterwards, I visit the Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC) on base to learn more about the training required for individual combat medic skills and competencies.  As is the case with all of the programs on base, the MSTC’s also provides training for teams, squads and platoons.  I’m always proud to be an American but, after today’s visit with these heroes, its taken me to an even higher level.  Rock of the Marne!  Later in the afternoon, I attend the Savannah Banana’s baseball game against the Wilmington Sharks where I have the honor of throwing out the first pitch.  While some reports may vary, I am certain my fastball in the high 80’s made it across the plate without bouncing.  Tuesday, August 1, 2017:  My first meeting this morning is at the Savannah office as I meet with representatives from Hargray to learn of their broadband presence in the First Congressional District and their plans for expansion.  Afterwards, I head over to the U.S. Coast Guard Station Savannah for the promotion ceremony of Commander Marshall Branch to Captain.  We are fortunate to have the U.S. Coast Guard at HAA as they do an outstanding job with all of their work, particularly with their search and rescue missions. 
￼
Rep. Carter at National Night Out in Pembroke
Next, I head down to Glynn County where I am the keynote speaker at the St. Simons Rotary Club and bring them up to date on the affairs of Washington before heading to our Brunswick office for a series of meetings including one with Satilla Riverkeeper Laura Early.  Before leaving the Brunswick area, I stop by the College of Coastal Georgia to visit with Interim President Margaret Amstutz and wish her well in her new position.  My last visit of the day is to Bryan County and the City of Pembroke where I participate in National Night Out, a program that builds relationships between community and police to work together to fight crime.  Pembroke is a great example of the wonderful communities in the First District and their public safety units are top notch.  Wednesday, August 2, 2017:  This morning begins with a meeting with my good friend, Pastor Herbert Hubbard, who did a great job at Bible Baptist Church in Savannah for many years and, working with Executive Director Joel Smoker, is continuing his ministry with the YMCA of Coastal Georgia.  Next, I head to Richmond Hill where I tour Family Promise of Bryan County and learn of the great work they are doing to help curb family poverty and homelessness.  Working with and supported by area churches and groups such as the United Way, this program has a great board and enthusiastic staff that provides a much needed service to the community.  After a radio interview with Georgia News Network to discuss the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, I head to Southside Savannah where I am the keynote speaker at the Savannah Area Republican Women’s monthly meeting and bring them up to date on Washington issues. 
￼
Rep. Carter at the Coastal Center for Developmental Services
The highlight of this group is always the question and answer session as these ladies are politically sharp and well informed.  Afterwards, I travel to the Coastal Center for Developmental Services (CCDS) where Dr. Ken Boyd and his excellent staff inform me of their work and then treat me to a tour of the center where I have the opportunity to interact with these wonderful citizens.  CCDS provides employment-based services, training and community integration to adults with developmental disabilities and is one of the best run programs in our area.  My final visit of the day is a tour of United Distributors in Georgetown where I visit with my good friend Michael Kooden to discuss issues impacting their profession.

Summer District Work Period Update
From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:
Good morning,
During the first week of Congress Summer District Work Period, I received good news for PA-10 families, learned how farmers are improving the health of our watersheds and listened to local leaders about the impact of excessive regulation.
I also encourage our young men and women to serve our nation and recognize one of my hard-working interns.
Here are some of the highlights of my work serving Pennsylvanias 10th Congressional District:
Bolstering our Economy
As a member of Congress, I work with community leaders to help grow our economy and promote economic development.  I am pleased to report the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has awarded over $1.1 million to invest in job-creating initiatives in PA-10 and across our region. 
The Northern Tier Regional Planning & Development Commission, the Northeastern PA Alliance, the SEDA-Council of Governments and Allied Health Programs at Lackawanna College are receiving funding that will produce economic benefits for decades.
Protecting our Watersheds
I joined the Pennsylvania-Chesapeake Bay Foundation Farmer Advisory Council along with federal, state and local officials at its agricultural conservation field day in Mifflintown. 
￼
I had a great visit at the Pennsylvania-Chesapeake Foundations farm stewardship event at Red Sunset Farm where owner Dave Graybill demonstrated the practices dairy farmers are using to mitigate the impact on the Chesapeake Bay watershed.
The event provided great insight on proactive measures Juniata County farmers have taken to reduce pollution, maintain farm sustainability, promote clean water, and improve the health of the Chesapeake Bay.
Combatting Executive Overreach
I met with Lycoming County Commissioners and the Lycoming County MS4 Coalition to discuss Obama-era regulations which require a 10 percent reduction of sediment and erosion for next year.
￼
I had a productive meeting with Lycoming County Commissioners and the Lycoming County MS4 Coalition in Old Lycoming Township
As Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law, I share the concerns of our municipal leaders about the high costs associated with these burdensome regulations and will work to implement solutions to lessen their impact on PA-10 taxpayers.
Military Service Academy Nominations
Each year, members of Congress may nominate candidates for appointment to four of the five military service academies: U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. The fifth service academy, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, does not require a congressional nomination for appointment.
If you know a qualified young man or woman interested in serving in the Armed Forces, encourage them to apply to a U.S. Military Service Academy.  Each year, I have the honor of nominating a number of young Pennsylvanians for this opportunity. The deadline to submit application materials is Friday, October 6, 2017.  You can find more details on my website or call my Washington D.C. Office at (202) 225-3731.
Recognizing Our PA-10 Interns
Over the past couple of months, my office hosted Dickinson College student Stephen Sakowicz as an intern in Washington, D.C.  The Park Ridge, Illinois native will transfer to the University of Michigan for his junior year to continue his studies in political science and history.
￼
Stephen Sakowicz of Park Ridge, Illinois served as a summer intern in my Washington, D.C. office.
Thanks for your dedication and hard work, Stephen!

President Trump Signs Sanctions
I voted to impose punishing economic sanctions on the tyrants that seek to destroy our democracy - Russia, Iran, North Korea. We must hold these nefarious actors accountable for their overt provocations against our country. This week, I was pleased President Trump signed these critical sanctions into law, finally choking off these nations' economic lifelines and their ability to undermine our democracy.

NEWS FROM THE 1st DISTRICT
Dear Friends,
It was a busy week in the beautiful Granite State. Here's how I spent the first week of the August district work period.
 
Making headway on in-state access for New Hampshire veterans
Yesterday I joined U.S. Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, the rest of New Hampshire’s Congressional delegation, Governor Chris Sununu, and VA leaders at the Manchester VA Medical Center to tour the facility and hold a town hall with employees.
 
￼
The current situation is clearly unacceptable, and I am insisting that the VA do everything in its power to provide New Hampshire veterans with timely, high-quality care and also to fully cooperate with the concurrent investigations so we can get to the root of these problems and make sure they never happen again.
 
During his visit, Secretary Shulkin made a firm commitment to implementing needed reforms and investments at our Manchester VA with the urgency New Hampshire veterans expect and deserve. These include $30 million to repair flood damage, create a new Office of Community Care, and continue new construction. He also announced that the VA will begin leasing space to deliver some medical services at Catholic Medical Center.
 
Finally, Secretary Shulkin announced the creation of a task force that will work to find the best way for New Hampshire veterans to receive all their care in-state. This is a needed change that I have been working to achieve for years. This January, I reintroduced the Veterans Health Equity Act, a bill that would remedy New Hampshire’s status as the only state in the nation without a full-service VA hospital or equivalent access. The bill has been cosponsored by every member of the New Hampshire delegation, Republican and Democratic, since I first introduced it in 2008.

Around the District
￼
This week I visited Shoals Marine Laboratory, an education and research facility on Appledore Island that is operated jointly by UNH and Cornell University. During the visit, I discussed marine and coastal ecosystem sustainability with Shoals students and researchers. They are doing great work to advance our understanding of coastal ecosystems and to develop strategies that can protect the Seacoast’s natural marine heritage. Scientific research helps us understand the world around us, and it’s essential to keep supporting it.
 
￼
I was so impressed by the vision and dedication of Lydia's House of Hope founder Theresa Tozier, Somersworth-area business and community leaders, and so many supporters. The all-hands-on-deck community effort made this transitional home for homeless moms and kids a reality in just 5 months!
The progress the women at Lydia's are making is remarkable, and I applaud the hard work of these women and the community that is supporting these new beginnings.
￼
It was a pleasure to present The Congressional Award medal to Dana from Freedom for her community spirit, dedication, and hard work to complete the goals she set for herself as a participant in this wonderful program for young Americans.
 
For more pictures of this week's meetings, check out the Facebook album.

Standing up for the Granite State
I was outraged by President Trump's comments about New Hampshire. To talk about our neighbors and friends who are suffering in such a dismissive way by calling us a “drug-infested den” is simply unacceptable. New Hampshire won’t let this crisis define us. Instead, it’s our response to this crisis that shows what makes this state great.
 
While the President is wrong about New Hampshire, he has also failed to keep his campaign promise help us fight the heroin, fentanyl, and prescription opioid crisis. We need new recovery facilities now. I called on him to stop attacking health care and make the investments he promised.
 
Closing thoughts
This week, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation impaneled a federal grand jury. This indicates that the investigation has entered a new phase. I was pleased to see my Republican colleagues in the Senate introduce legislation to protect Mueller from possible retaliation or removal. It is important to keep him on the job so that the American people can have confidence in the results of the investigation, whatever they may be.

As always, thank you for the honor of representing you in Congress.
 
Best wishes,
￼
Carol

8/5/17 17:42,Modernizing Veterans Education Benefits,"￼

PHOTO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich speaks with veterans at the American Legion Allingham-Golding Post 18 in Silver City, July 4, 2017.

August 5, 2017
Dear Friend,
I am proud that this week the Senate passed bipartisan legislation that I introduced with Senators Tom Udall, Jon Tester, and Johnny Isakson that will modernize and strengthen veterans' education benefits and enhance the post-9/11 G.I. Bill. The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 further invests in the proven educational success of our veterans and helps propel them toward becoming our nation's civic, business, and public leaders.
Since it was approved just weeks after D-Day, the original G.I. Bill has made a tremendous impact on our nation's heroes and their families - and helped build America's post-war economy. We owe it to this generation of servicemembers to provide those same educational benefits and opportunities that they too have earned. Modernizing the education benefits of the post-9/11 G.I. Bill will open doors for New Mexico's veterans and their families and put our entire nation on a more prosperous path.
Our legislation puts an end to the arbitrary 15-year period that a veteran is required to use their G.I. Bill so they can use their benefits at any time in their professional career. The bill also makes much-needed updates for reservists, Purple Heart recipients, veterans, and surviving family members who face school closures while enrolled and surviving family members, and offers additional educational assistance to pursue science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs, computer programming and career technical training.   As your United States Senator, I am committed to keeping America's promise to our veterans and their families so that when our troops return home, they receive the benefits they have earned. My office can help veterans with their VA claims, their military records or medals, their GI benefits, and VA home loans. I encourage you to visit the Veterans Resources Center on my website or call my office at (505) 346-6601 if I can be of assistance to you or your family. 
We must be unwavering in our commitment to our men and women in uniform who deserve more than just words of gratitude for their sacrifice when they return home. 
Sincerely,
￼
MARTIN HEINRICH United States Senator

Dear Friend:
As your representative in the U.S. Congress, one of my most important jobs is to listen. Whether you contact me by mail, email, phone or social media, your input is critical to me as I represent you and our district. This year I have held numerous tele-town hall events, have met or spoken on the phone with hundreds of constituents, visited businesses both small and large, and this past Tuesday, held my second in person town hall at Prairie View High School in Brighton.
Quite a number of the residents of the district attended the town hall and for almost 90 minutes I responded to questions on topics ranging from healthcare and the environment, to immigration and national security. The town hall provided me with the opportunity to discuss with fellow residents of the 6th Congressional District the challenges facing Congress and our nation along with my thoughts on the best ways of tackling those challenges. Many of the constituents who attended the event feel very passionately on particular issues and I appreciated hearing their perspectives. I will also note that hearing from people with different viewpoints, makes me appreciate the importance of seeking bipartisan solutions to our nation’s multiple challenges.  
￼

The issue most discussed at the town hall was, not surprisingly, healthcare reform.  I remain convinced that we need to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but meetings such as these town halls make me appreciate how important it is that we get the replacement part of repeal and replace right when we do so.
I spent quite a bit of time outlining a proposal I have put forward, to leadership, asking to end the current approach and to replace it with a three-prong approach. I am convinced that the complexity and breadth of the ACA make the use of a single, massive bill the wrong way to go about it. By breaking the effort into three parts, I think we can find some bipartisan solutions and move from controversy, to passing legislation that will address our complex and too complicated health care system to the benefit of all Americans. Any plan I support will have as keystones, protections for those with pre-existing conditions and allowing young people up to the age of 26 to remain on their parent’s health insurance. I think there are good ways to keep these provisions in place while addressing out-of-control costs, improving access to care, and improving outcomes. 
Finally, I want to thank everyone who took the time to attend the town hall as well as Prairie View High School (home of the Thunderhawks!) for hosting the event. A special thanks also goes out to the men and women of the Brighton PD for their help that evening. 
I look forward to keeping you up to date on all the things I do on your behalf in Washington.
Sincerely, 
￼

Week in Review 
This week, I’m happy to report that the U.S. Senate took action on three of my bills to help Nevada’s veterans. Using my senior role on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I’m proud I was able to help introduce and advance proposals that ensure access to care, help reduce the VA appeals claims backlog, and bolster education benefits for veterans.
Funding the VA Choice Program 
Earlier this week, the U.S. Senate approved my bill to make sure that the Veterans Choice Program can continue and I played a role in getting this across the finish line. This program is important to Nevada’s veterans because without it, they wouldn’t have access to certain services, such as chemotherapy, that the VA can’t provide. The program also allows rural veterans, like those in Ely, Elko, Winnemucca, and Tonopah, to get care near their homes instead of driving hundreds of miles to a VA facility. I’m happy to report that it’s now headed to the President’s desk to be signed into law. Click HERE or below to watch a short video on why I support the VA Choice Program. 
￼
Improving Veterans’ Education Benefits 
We also passed the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act, a comprehensive bill that improves veterans’ education benefits. I helped introduce it and also fought to include three provisions to directly benefit Nevada’s veteran and military communities. This legislation brings a much-needed update to current law by eliminating any expiration of the G.I. bill benefit and further bolstering the benefit for reservists, Purple Heart recipients, and veterans who rely on it to further their education and improve skills necessary to access good-paying jobs.
Reducing the VA Appeals Claims Backlog 
I worked alongside my colleagues on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee to strengthen the House of Representatives’ version of the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, which overhauls the appeals process for disability claims at the VA. Specifically, we added protections and flexibility for veterans going through the appeals process. We will continue to hold the VA’s feet to the fire when it comes to reducing the claims and appeals backlog so veterans can receive the benefits they have earned from their injuries of war.
I’m incredibly proud of what we got done on behalf of our nation’s heroes this week, and I want to be clear: our work will not stop today. Nevada is home to over 300,000 veterans and I am fighting to ensure our country makes good on its promises to them.

The U.S. Senate took action this week. Well, sort of.    Both parties in the upper chamber valiantly joined forces to unanimously pass a resolution designating September 25, 2017 as...""National Lobster Day."" Yes, you read that right. 
￼
If the Senate has time to adopt a national lobster day, then surely it can pass Kate's Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. These two House-passed bills, both of which I co-sponsored, would cut federal funds for sanctuary cities and toughen penalties against anyone who re-enters the country after being deported.    Time is of the essence.     Just last week, an illegal immigrant was arrested for sexually assaulting a 65-year-old grandmother in the sanctuary city of Portland, Oregon. The attacker, Sergio Jose Martinez, had been deported 20 times and is suspected of a litany of other violent crimes. Because Portland doesn’t follow federal immigration laws, authorities weren’t notified when Martinez was recently released from jail.    It’s time the Senate acts to allow federal law enforcement officials to protect the public and enforce existing laws.   Let me know if you agree by replying to this email or LIKING my Facebook page.   Vern

Dear Friend, 
For the fifth year in a row, I am dedicating the month of August to focus on farms in southeast and south central Missouri, stopping in all 30 counties of our district. Meeting the people who run these operations gives me a real understanding of the challenges they are facing and how I can help them.   The best way for me to represent southeast and south central Missouri is to be in southeast and south central Missouri to meet directly with the families, farmers and small business owners who are often the hardest hit by out of touch government policies. These firsthand conversations allow me to carry the message of southern Missourians back to Washington and fight for our way of life.   Most weekdays, I am stuck in Washington casting votes on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives or attending committee hearings. I relish the weekend when I am able to take the first flight out and get back to Missouri to spend time with friends, family, neighbors and all of the down to earth folks I am fortunate enough to represent. Not to mention, getting a break from sleeping on the floor of my office in D.C. is nice. August is a great opportunity to spend more than just Saturday and Sunday getting to know the small business owners, families and especially farmers in our area. That is why I will continue to dedicate my August to visiting the thousands of farms which call southeast and south central Missouri home.   The state of Missouri has over 96 thousand farm operations and more than 28 million acres of farmland. We are also the 11th largest agricultural export state in the country, shipping nearly four billion dollars' worth of products grown in Missouri across the country and around the world. In fact, in our district alone, we have four of the top soybean producing counties in the state. We are also one of the most diverse agriculture districts in the country, producing everything from cotton and cattle to rice and wine.   It is only the first week of our month-long focus on farms, and I've already heard about the need for less regulations and a simpler, fairer and flatter tax code. When I stopped in Iron County, Josh Campbell, who runs Campbell Farm, told me, ""tell the feds to stop interfering with farmers and just let farmers, farm."" I could not agree more.   One of the regulations I heard most about during last year's focus on farms was the Waters of the United States rule, which was trying to federally regulate every drop of water on Missouri farmer's land.  Fortunately, over the last year, I have been able to work with the Trump Administration to successfully repeal this harmful rule.   Agriculture has a major impact on our economy and our rural way of life in southeast and south central Missouri. This is why it is so important for me to spend time with the folks who run Missouri's farm operations. It is a huge portion of our economy, providing jobs in our area and putting food on the table for folks in Missouri and across America.  After I finish our fifth annual focus on farms at the end of August, I look forward to taking the concerns I hear to D.C. and making a difference on the issues that matter most to the people who work daily to feed and supply America. 
Focused On Farms 
￼ 
  
At Campbell Farm in Belleview, they grow soybeans, corn, wheat, straw and hay. Josh owns the farm and told me the best thing I can do when I get back to D.C. is to ""tell the feds to stop interfering with farmers and just let farmers, farm."" 

I could not agree more. That's why I'm working with the Trump Administration to get rid of Obama-era regulations that hurt Missourians like Josh who just want to work their land free of government interference. 
  
￼ 
I stopped at KSMO in my hometown of Salem before heading over to Smith Valley Angus. I enjoyed chatting with Stan from KSMO about Dent County's farm operations that cover over 180,000 acres of land in the area. 
￼ 
Our next stop in Dent County was Smith Valley Angus. They are a family owned and operated farm that conducts embryo transplants, artificial insemination and manages 1700 of the 180,000 acres of farm land in Dent County. They are even looking to share their new barn with the local FFA and 4H club. I appreciate owners Brian and Kim showing me their cattle operation and sharing what they do for the Missouri Agricultural Industry.  
￼ 
Our focus on farms continued at Price Sawmill where they produce 135,000 board feet per week. Alan told me that he's concerned they will no longer be able to sell their wood chips if the paper industry completely moves out of the U.S. This is why I'm working with the Trump Administration to support industries at home instead of relying on foreign countries for goods that can be produced right here in southeast and south central Missouri. 
￼ 
  
In Koshkonong, we stopped at Trickling Springs Creamery where they process 2,000 gallons of milk per day and have 43 employees. 

They make cheese, frozen and drinkable yogurt, and you can find their products at the Missouri State Fair next week! 

One of the things the creamery struggles with is the cost of shipping and receiving - a cost that could be reduced if America did not have to rely on foreign countries for oil and if Washington bureaucrats didn't single handedly enact rules like the electronic logging device mandate. I have worked with the Trump Administration on projects like the Keystone XL pipeline to make America energy independent and have coauthored legislation to delay the electronic logging device mandate, a rule expected to impose significant costs and regulatory burdens on small trucking businesses. 
  
￼ 
  
Even as I focused on farms, I heard more reasons why we need tax reform. Brinkley Wood Products owners Kawanda and Greg shared that the IRS contacts them YEARS after they complete their tax returns to tell them they've gotten a complicated form wrong, forcing them to stop what they are doing and dig through files from several years back just to prove the form was filed and paid correctly in the first place. 

The IRS should be known for SERVICE, not stopping Missouri farmers and growers from doing their jobs. That's why I'm fighting for a simpler, fairer and flatter tax code that allows Missouri farmers to get back to doing what they do best - providing food and goods for Americans. 
  
￼ 
  
We kicked off the yet another day of our focus on farms with KKountry 95 in Thayer. I enjoyed talking with host Mike Crase about Missouri's incredible agricultural industry. Did you know that our state produces nearly FOUR BILLION dollars' worth of agricultural exports a year? 

￼ 
  
Many people do not realize that Missouri is one of the leading producers of timber products in the United States. I stopped at Reynolds Brothers Lumber where they produce railroad ties and other wood items. 

We talked about the importance of reducing regulations and allowing for more timber to be harvested. In the past, Mark Twain National Forest only allowed 38 million board feet to be harvested in a year. Since I have been in Congress, we have increased the board feet. This year, we are up to 65 million board feet and next year, we are projected to hit 67 million board feet at Mark Twain. This is good news for agribusinesses like Reynolds Brothers Lumber and for the health of Mark Twain National Forest. 
  
￼ 
  
In Shannon County, I stopped at Hilltop Farms to talk with owner John Charles about how he grows and harvests produce to sell at farmer's markets and to the local Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) group. 

While the CSA group is growing, John shared that right now, he is most concerned about the cost of healthcare for his family and that their Obamacare premiums have doubled in the last year. 

Farmers in southeast and south central Missouri should be focused on taking care of their land and raising their crops, NOT worried about how much health insurance is going to cost. In addition to voting to repeal Obamacare multiple times, I have worked with my colleagues in the House to pass several pieces of legislation, one in particular that would help farmers like John. 

It's called the Small Business Health Fairness Act and was passed with bipartisan support by the House. If passed by the Senate, the legislation would help farmers, small business owners and many other folks all across southeast and south central Missouri lower the cost of their premiums by banning together to buy health insurance with a larger group. I hope the Senate will work quickly to get this bill passed and on President Donald J. Trump's desk so folks like John can get relief from crushing Obamacare premiums soon! 

I look forward to even more stops and hearing about the problems we can solve for Missouri farmers as we continue to work through August. Please follow me on Facebook and Twitter for updates from our fifth annual focus on farms. 

As always, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to my office for help.

WEEK IN REVIEW It was a great district work week in Oklahoma! 
I started off the week touring Brakefield Equipment in Chelsea and visiting with Mayes and Craig County city officials. On Tuesday, I toured Souter Limestone and Minerals in Gore. This small business employs 20 people and its doors have been open since 1991. I enjoyed seeing how they operate on a daily basis. 
￼
Learning about the process of coal production 
at Brakefield Equipment
                                           
Later on, I had the honor to present a Congressional Recognition Award to an outstanding member of the Poteau Police Department for his heroic actions both in and out of uniform. Two years ago, Officer Jody Thompson arrived at the scene of a child abuse call to find 8 year old John in horrific conditions. Even after John was safe in the hospital, he knew that he still could not leave him. He sat with him through the night and the next day he and his wife applied to become foster parents. After a few days, John was able to come home with them. Today, both John and his younger sister Paizley are officially a part of the Thompson family. The Second District of Oklahoma is lucky to have people like Officer Thompson and his wife Jeannie to set such high examples for our communities.

Thank you for your service to Leflore County

Thursday was a very productive day in Rogers County! It was great to visit with Rogers and Nowata County leaders to discuss issues of importance to their communities. I also spoke at the Claremore Dreams Think Tank Luncheon about the economic growth the city is seeing and then was able to hear about the growth they plan to see in the future. Thank you to City Manager Jim Thomas for presenting me with this memorable train.

Friday, I spent the morning touring the new Okmulgee County Jail with Sheriff Eddy Rice, Mayor Steven Baldridge, and State Representative Scott Fetgatter. After, I had lunch with the Okmulgee Chamber of Commerce and also met with civic leaders of Okmulgee, Okfuskee and Hughes Counties. It was great to address the concerns they are seeing and to answer the questions they have on behalf of their communities. Click here to view all of the pictures from this week.

WORKING FOR OKLAHOMA SMALL BUSINESSES
Small businesses are the backbone of Oklahoma’s economy. Together, they paint a clear picture of what the American dream can be. In this week’s Mullin It Over column, I explained how I am working in Congress to keep government from interfering in Oklahoman’s aspirations and to provide you with a fair chance at succeeding when you decide to own and operate your own small business.

Dear Friends,  I am writing you today to share the latest edition of Jackie's Reading Picks, a selection of articles that have piqued my interest over the past week and that I thought would be of interest to you. One of the cornerstones of our great democracy is our free press and an informed citizenry. Now, more than ever, it's critical that we remain engaged and keep ourselves informed of the news and issues that impact each and every one of us. I also want to hear your feedback and what you think we should be reading and focusing on at home in the 14th District, and around our great country. By working together and keeping abreast of what is happening in our government, economy, and communities we can continue to contribute to and strengthen our democracy.

Nunes and Valadao joke about Westlands’ water grab. We’re not laughing
By the Editorial Board, The Sacramento Bee
Rep. Devin Nunes’ tweet was supposed to be funny, we guess.

￼
The occasion was the passage of H.R. 23, carried by fellow San Joaquin Valley Republican, Rep. David Valadao of Hanford, although its authorship is clearly at issue.
The bill is the House Republicans’ latest attempt to weaken the Endangered Species Act at the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta’s expense, and at the behest of the Westlands Water District, the sprawling irrigation district where some of the state’s wealthiest farmers tend their crops.
Upon the bill’s passage, Nunes tweeted a photo of five cupcakes, four of which were topped with fish-shaped gummy candies. Perhaps he ate the fifth or maybe he threw it away. Whatever the gummy’s fate, the Tulare politician’s tweet thanked Valadao “for sending this excellent gift: smelt-themed cupcakes.”

Why the Scariest Nuclear Threat May Be Coming from Inside the White House
￼
By Michael Lewis, Vanity Fair
On the morning after the election, November 9, 2016, the people who ran the U.S. Department of Energy turned up in their offices and waited. They had cleared 30 desks and freed up 30 parking spaces. They didn’t know exactly how many people they’d host that day, but whoever won the election would surely be sending a small army into the Department of Energy, and every other federal agency. The morning after he was elected president, eight years earlier, Obama had sent between 30 and 40 people into the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy staff planned to deliver the same talks from the same five-inch-thick three-ring binders, with the Department of Energy seal on them, to the Trump people as they would have given to the Clinton people. “Nothing had to be changed,” said one former Department of Energy staffer. “They’d be done always with the intention that, either party wins, nothing changes.”
By afternoon the silence was deafening. “Day 1, we’re ready to go,” says a former senior White House official. “Day 2 it was ‘Maybe they’ll call us?’ ”
“Teams were going around, ‘Have you heard from them?’ ” recalls another staffer who had prepared for the transition. “ ‘Have you gotten anything? I haven’t got anything.’ ”

The Russians Were Involved. But It Wasn’t About Collusion.
By Daniel Hoffman, The New York Times
Russians are fond of a proverb, “besplatniy sir biyvaet tol’ko v mishelovke”: “Free cheese can be found only in a mousetrap.”
Having long considered the United States its main enemy, the Kremlin deploys a full quiver of intelligence weapons against America and its national security agencies, political parties and defense contractors. Its intelligence services, though best known for clandestine operations to recruit spies, also run covert “influence operations” that often use disinformation to try to affect decisions or events in rival countries. A central tool of those operations is “kompromat,” “compromising material”: things of seemingly great value that are dangled, at what appears to be no cost, before unwitting targets. This is the “free cheese” that ensnares victims in a trap.

Hi Folks-

July was a busy month and I wanted to share with you a look back at some highlights. Working on behalf of the people of the First District is always my top priority in Congress. Although the House was in-session for most of the month, I was consistently advocating for Virginia priorities. Scroll down to take a look.  

￼
I met with the Virginia Agribusiness Council to discuss Chesapeake Bay initiatives and issues with visas for seasonal workers. 


￼
I visited the Branscome Paving Co., which has been serving Northern Virginia since 1988. I got to hear about their company, tour the facility, and speak with employees to hear firsthand how what we do in Congress is affecting their business.


￼
I met with constituent Emily George in my Washington office. After completing her Congressional Sportsman Foundation fellowship this summer, we were able to dicuss the importance of the public policy process and how it impacts sportsmen and fish and wildlife conservation. 


￼
I met with constituents at George Washington's boyhood home, Ferry Farm. We discussed the major issues before Congress-specifically passing a budget and the twelve appropriations bills. 


￼
This month I received the FreedomWorks Freedom Fighter Award for my constant support of economic freedom and individual liberty in Congress. This award honors Members of Congress who have staunchly advocated for policies that promote free enterprise and limited government.


￼
I attended the comissioning of the USS Gerald Ford (CVN 78).This carrier will house over 2,600 officers and crew. I spoke with the crew and shipbuilders about ways I, as the Chairman of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, can work with them to help meet our nation's security goals. 


￼
I attended the Stafford County Armed Forces Memorial Dedication. At the event we honored 28 World War II Veterans and their families. I spoke to these Veterans about ways we are working to hold the VA accountable and protect the benefits our Veterans have earned and deserve.


I also wanted to share with you a few stories I was featured in this month. To keep up with all of my work around the First District and in Washington, connect with me on Facebook.

8/5/17 11:29,Beyond resistance: Encouraging innovation in health care,"Update | Saturday, August 5, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the eighth day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: reducing health care costs and improving care through innovation.
As we debate changes to our overall health care system, there are things that we can do now to bring health care costs down and improve care.
How we deliver care to patients with kidney disease – specifically end-stage renal disease (ESRD) – can be improved. Most patients suffering from kidney failure visit dialysis clinics three times a week. These visits are time-consuming, and typically are not the only medical services dialysis patients require on a weekly basis. I’ve introduced bipartisan legislation to let kidney disease patients receive primary care and other necessary health services while they’re at dialysis clinics – improving their care while saving valuable time and money for patients and providers. 
Often, it’s not necessary to spend more money to deliver care. Rather, we need to spend our dollars more wisely to improve the value of care delivered. I’ve introduced bipartisan legislation to implement Value-Based Insurance Design (V-BID) in our health care system. This legislation would lower or remove out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs and services for patients with chronic conditions, helping to reduce long-term costs and improve health overall. It is an efficient, common-sense way to provide an economic incentive to help more people receive the care they need.
Congress needs to challenge conventional thinking to develop innovative, cost-effective, and compassionate policies that make a real difference for patients across the country. Kidney care and Value-Based Insurance Design are just two examples and a good start.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

Weekly Review
 
July 29

Authorization for the Use of Military Force: I wanted to share with you the video below in which I talk about the need for a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF). Congress has not asserted its constitutional authority for a long number of years now with regard to war.

The Founding Fathers were amazingly deliberate in declaring that only Congress had that power. It’s past time that we reestablish what the Founding Fathers intended here.

July 31

Thank Goodness for General John Kelly... He started work today as Chief of Staff to the President, and one of his first actions was apparently to request that Mr. Scaramucci leave his role as White House Communications Director.

Scaramucci lasted but a week but, in it, issued a strange number of threats and was widely criticized last week for his profanity-filled rant in a conversation with a New Yorker reporter.

I haven’t been looking for ways to be critical of the president, but when things are crazy and not working, it’s vital that we call an ace an ace. If not, under the category of deference and political support, one gives subtle acquiescence to operating styles that would be condemned in most any organization that exists in the First District. I spoke up most recently on this very point on Friday at the Caucus Conference in Washington.

Whether you’re a Republican and actively supporting the president or a regular citizen who simply knows that what goes wrong in Washington can have real effect to your life, Scaramucci’s actions were hurting all of us. That which was already caustic had moved to a rather epic level of crazy last week.

That’s why it was so important that someone step in on the administration’s side and begin the process of establishing order. I don’t know General Kelly well, but in the few times I have met with him, I have always been impressed. It’s my hope that his tenure marks a change in the administration’s West Wing culture that I think would be beneficial to all of us.

Tax Reform: Last week, I joined Fox Business to discuss the latest developments on tax reform and what comes next on that front. The big news was that the border adjustment tax (BAT) was omitted from the House GOP tax plan. You may recall I recently proposed an amendment to this effect during a House Budget Committee hearing, so this was great news indeed. The BAT would have amounted to a $1 trillion tax on American consumers.

Under the Category of Community:  Just a quick update in between stops this afternoon…and a big thank you to those who came out this morning to our Neighborhood Office Hours on Hilton Head and Daufuskie.

I started the morning sharing a legislative update with the Greater Island Council on Hilton Head before office hours and then going over to visit with residents of Daufuskie.

The thing that most stood out for me thus far in the day was the ways in which civility and an understanding ear can make a remarkable difference in any debate. We should bottle what they have on this front and take it to Washington! Under a big oak tree sandwiched between the dirt county road and Lucy Bell’s restaurant, people gathered. They held a multitude of perspectives, and I am sure if we looked for disagreement we could have found it...but the conversation around ideas was fantastic. I was so struck by what was occurring that I asked what was going on, and one of the locals yelled out, “You never burn bridges on an island that doesn't have any!” Wise words to contemplate.

Honoring one of our own  



Friend,
Welcome to your weekly update. As always, you can learn more about these and other legislative issues at my website: upton.house.gov. 
Honoring one of our own         
On Monday, James McCloughan, a native and current resident of South Haven, was awarded the Medal of Honor by our president. I was deeply humbled and honored to join James, the president, and other distinguished guests at the Medal of Honor ceremony at the White House.
Then-Private First Class McCloughan served as a medic and saved the lives of 10 members of his platoon who were wounded during the Battle of Nui Yon Hill on May 13-15, 1969.  McCloughan was discharged with the rank of Specialist (SP5).  
McCloughan was highly decorated, receiving the Combat Medical Badge, two Purple Hearts, two Bronze Stars with “V” device for valor, The U. S. Army Valorous Unit Citation, The National Defense Medal, The Good Conduct Medal, The Vietnam Service Medal with three battle stars, The Vietnam Campaign Medal, The Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with palms and one oak leaf cluster and the M16 Expert Rifle Badge.
I was proud to sponsor legislation alongside Senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters to make then-Private First Class McCloughan eligible for our nation’s highest military honor.
You can see photos from this special event here.
Senate clears important FDA reauthorization legislation by a 94-1 vote. 
On Thursday, the U.S. Senate cleared important FDA reauthorization legislation. This follows on the heels of an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote in the U.S. House.
This legislation is welcome news for Southwest Michigan patients, workers, and job creators and I urge the president to sign it into law. 
Happy to be home
August gives me a chance to spend time meeting and hearing from folks and businesses about their priorities. Below are just a few of the highlights from the week. 
I visited Telamon Corporation’s Migrant Head Start Center, which provides a safe and educational environment for farmworker’s children while their parents and older siblings harvest crops. Our farms here in Southwest Michigan help to feed the world and it’s important our farmers have the labor force they need to do so. Programs like this help in that cause. I also had the chance to participate National Night Out in Portage. It was a great turn out and a nice way to connect with our community police force.
I swung by the Niles YMCA Summer My Way camp, which gives local kids a great way to spend the summer by providing fun, academic-based activities. It is vital that we are investing in the next generation of innovators and giving our students the tools to be successful against global competition. It was especially nice seeing these kids have a blast doing just that.
I had the opportunity to tour the Great Lakes Surgery Center to see the innovative work they're doing right here in St. Joe and spoke to the Lakeshore Rotary about our plans for tax reform. I also was able to meet with dozens of individual constituents in productive, one-on-one meetings. 
You can see more about my week here and as always, stay up to date with me on social media on my Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts.
 Have a great weekend and God bless,
-Fred

Dear Friend,  
The record temperatures and smoke from the wildfires in British Columbia has made it uncomfortable and even dangerous to be outside this past week. Too much time outside in the smoky air, especially for vulnerable groups, can expose you to the potential risks of burning sensations in your eyes and nose, coughing, shortness of breath, and headaches. In more serious cases, it can impact individuals who have existing lung, heart, and circulatory conditions. 
Please click HERE to learn more about the risks of poor air quality, which groups are most at risk, and what steps you can take to protect your health.
Campfire Restrictions
This summer’s dry, hot weather has made it more dangerous to light campfires in our region. As a safety precaution, the Forest Service has announced campfire restrictions implemented tomorrow across most of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Certain designated campgrounds will permit fires in Naches Ranger District and campfires will continue to be permitted in the Goat Rocks, Norse Peak and William O. Douglas Wilderness areas. For more information on campfire restrictions, click HERE.
Promoting Education Around the Globe
Thanks to my colleagues in the Senate who supported passage of the Reinforcing Education in Development (READ) Act this week! This is an important, bipartisan bill I am proud to champion. It will take steps to promote children’s access to school around the world and improve the quality of education for those currently in school. I am hopeful the House will pass this bill quickly so we can send it to the President’s desk and take it across the finish line.
Creating Stability at West Coast Ports 
On Friday, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) and the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA) announced a three-year extension to their current contract, which was originally set to expire in 2019. The 2014-2015 slowdown cost farmers, manufacturers, and retailers across the western U.S. hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and decreased the region’s foreign market share. Since the disruption, I have been vocal about the need of the ILWU and PMA to come together for the sake of the many workers and families who depend on the swift movement of goods to and from the ports. 
This week’s news will bring greater confidence to the countless farmers, workers, and businesses across our region who rely on our strong ports and who suffered millions in losses during the 2014-2015 disruption. I commend the ILWU and PMA for taking action to prevent the situation from repeating itself. Washington State is home to many of the world’s highest quality agricultural products and goods that consumers around the world demand. With this agreement comes certainty for our exporters and their customers.
Justin’s Washington, D.C. Internship
It was a pleasure to have Justin spend part of his summer interning in my Washington, DC office! We really appreciated his help!

Encouraging Energy Efficiency and Saving Money
Encouraging energy efficiency is important to our environment and consumers. A bipartisan bill I recently introduced with Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) and Tom Reed (R-NY) will help incentivize building owners to install energy efficient systems by making the efficient commercial buildings tax deduction permanent and by making it work for non-profits and tribal governments. Our hospitals, schools, community organizations, and tribal community centers provide critical services to residents in Washington State and throughout the country. These entities often operate with limited available funds while doing their best to serve their community. With this tax deduction, they will see a reduction in their energy and construction costs and will be able to focus more on providing important services to the people and families who count on them. Thank you to Reps. Blumenauer and Reed for joining me in support of this legislation.
Celebrating National Night Out
On Tuesday night, law enforcement agencies around the country and the communities they serve came together to celebrate National Night Out. The annual event aims to enhance public safety by educating residents on the resources and services local law enforcement provides, but also to strengthen the relationship between those in uniform and the people living in the neighborhoods they serve. This personal contact is especially important during a time when tensions are high and negative stereotypes about law enforcement are often unfairly promoted in the media.
Click HERE to hear Chelan County Sheriff Brian Burnett explain why National Night Out is important and thanks to everyone in law enforcement and communities throughout our region who participated in Tuesday’ event!

Stay cool out there and I will talk with you next week!

Sincerely,
Dave

31 REASONS FOR TAX REFORM
Our tax code hasnt been updated in 31 years, and its holding our economy back.
Thats why Im working with my colleagues on the House Ways and Means Committee and with the Trump administration to fix our broken tax code so businesses can grow and hire more workers and so families can keep more of their hard-earned paychecks.
Every day this month, Ill highlight a different reason why we need tax reform.
Check out the first five reasons below, and stay tuned throughout August for all 31 reasons by joining me on Facebook or Twitter.
￼
Reason #1: Our broken tax code is a drag on our economy. Tax reform can jumpstart our economy, boost job creation, and grow hardworking Hoosiers paychecks.
￼
Reason #2: American taxpayers spend an estimated $99 billion a year to file their income taxes. It doesn't need to be so complicated or costly  we can fix this with tax reform.
￼
Reason #3: You deserve to keep more of your hard-earned paycheck. We are working toward tax reform that lowers taxes for Americans at every income level.
￼
Reason #4: High tax rates are crushing Hoosier small businesses. With tax reform, we can give our local job creators a chance to grow and hire more workers.
￼
Reason #5: Did you know the federal tax code is now more than 2.4 million words long? It's time to make taxes simpler and fairer with tax reform.
As always, it is a privilege to represent 2nd District Hoosiers in Congress.

Friend,
It’s hard to believe how fast this summer is flying by! I hope you’ve had some time to explore Pure Michigan and get out to our beautiful beaches and lakes. With the changing of seasons comes back-to-school time, football season and all the great things we love about fall. But for now, let’s enjoy the month of August!
For the next few weeks, I’ll be here in Michigan meeting with constituents in all corners of the district and hosting a Jobs & Economy Tour throughout Oakland, Livingston and Ingham Counties, so stay tuned for details on that. I also want to hear directly from YOU – whether it’s about health care, tax reform, things you’re seeing in the news, you name it. You can send your thoughts and concerns to me through my website, www.mikebishop.house.gov. Be sure to follow me on social media to stay up to date on the latest news, as well (links on the right-hand side of this email).

Lowest Unemployment Rate in Michigan
In a recent county-by-county breakdown, the Michigan Bureau of Labor Market Information and Strategic Initiatives found Livingston County now holds the lowest unemployment rate in the state at 2.7 percent, as of June 2017. Read my full comments – as well as those from our other local and state-level elected officials – about this exciting new development. Livingston’s model of low taxes and efficient government is what I’m fighting for in Washington – so we can spread this kind of success across our district, state and country.
 
Supporting our Military and Veterans
The House has made a lot of progress recently on ways to help our veterans. One item I was especially proud to see pass was H.R. 3218, the “Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017” – which I am an original co-sponsor of. This bill tackles something I often hear about when talking with our local veterans: career opportunities after service. As things stand today, veterans have to use their education benefits within 15 years of the end of their service. With the new legislation, we’re taking those limits away. Moving forward, new servicemembers would be able to use the GI bill’s education benefits throughout their lifetimes. This GI bill also gives veterans a better shot at in-demand science and technology jobs that will help in developing meaningful careers after returning home.
In addition, check out some of these other big pieces of legislation that have passed since mid-June:
	•	Bishop Supports Military, Veterans, MSU’s FRIB in Passage of ‘Make America Secure’ Appropriations Bill – 7/27/17
	•	National Defense Authorization Act Passes with Bishop Amendment Included – 7/14/17
	•	Bishop Votes to Strengthen Accountability at the VA – 6/13/17
Also, if you are a local veteran, check out these updated resources on my website for all the various county, statewide, and federal resources that could be a major help to you:

News & Observer: Jesse Helms blocking honor for Black Wall Street leader?
DURHAM --North Carolina partisan politics don’t stay confined to Raleigh’s State House. Go north on I-95 for several hours, reach the Capitol and find North Carolina’s political tensions extending their reach into the U.S. House too. North Carolina partisan politics don’t stay confined to Raleigh’s State House. U.S. Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-N.C., introduced a bill Thursday proposing to rename the U.S. Post Office and federal courthouse building in downtown Durham as the “John Hervey Wheeler United States Courthouse” in honor of his late mentor.
Henderson Daily Dispatch: Congressman Butterfield makes stop in Henderson to talk health care
Congressman G.K. Butterfield, D-N.C, meets Drs. Neal Roberts and William Dennis on Thursday, as he makes a stop at Duke Primary Care in Henderson as part of his Jobs and Justice Tour. When Henderson resident Stephen Allgood was 25, he was healthy and didn’t see the need for health insurance. Now older in his mid 40s with health conditions that include diabetes and the need for more than 20 medications, Allgood sees the need.
Markets Insider: Senate passes the RACE for Children Act!
WASHINGTON, Aug. 3, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Today, the U.S. Senate passed the FDA Reauthorization Act and with it, the RACE for Children Act. Now, new cancer drugs will be developed not only for adults - but for kids too.  With the RACE for Children Act as law. We are grateful to our champions in Congress:  Senators Michael Bennet and Marco Rubio and Chairman Lamar Alexander and Ranking Democrat Patty Murray in the Senate; and Representatives Michael McCaul and G.K. Butterfield and Chairman Greg Walden and Ranking Democrat Frank Pallone in the House.  This could not have been done without their leadership and commitment and without the extraordinary efforts of their able staff.

Dear Friends,
 It’s no secret we live in a world that has grown much more dangerous during the past several years.  As a Congress, it is our primary obligation to take the necessary steps to help keep our country and citizens safe from harm.  That’s why the House of Representatives passed a number of bills during the month of July to strengthen our national security, provide for our military, take care of our veterans, and protect innocent citizens from harm.
Some of the bills the House passed last month include:
	•	Kate’s Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act to increase the penalty for deported criminals who re-enter the United States, protect law-abiding citizens and withhold federal grants from cities that do not comply with federal immigration laws;
	•	The Frederick Douglass Act, Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act and the Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act to end human trafficking, impose additional penalties on sex traffickers, increase support for victims, and support programs to educate children and train employers to identify potential victims;
	•	The Countering Adversarial Nations Through Sanctions Act to impose tougher sanctions on hostile regimes, such as Iran, Russian and North Korea;
	•	The Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act to ensure the agency has the resources it needs to keep terrorists, traffickers and smugglers out of the United States, as well as address our ever-evolving national security threats;
	•	The 2018 National Defense Authorization Act to boost defense spending by 10%, ensure no terrorist detainees at Guantanamo Bay are transferred to American soil, provide for thousands of additional personnel for the Army, Navy and Air Force, and increase missile defense funding by $2.5 billion to ensure we can protect our country from the threats posed by advanced, long-range missiles;
	•	The national security appropriations package, commonly referred to as the “minibus,” to fully fund the President’s FY18 $1.6 billion budget request to build a wall along our southern border, provide our service members with the largest pay raise in eight years, and bolster our nuclear weapons programs;
	•	A number of bills to improve upon the care our veterans receive through the Department of Veterans Affairs – including a bill to fund the Veterans Choice Program, expand upon the VA’s efforts in recruiting and retaining qualified health care professionals, begin a five-year pilot program to train and educate veterans wishing to be a physician assistant at the VA, and require the department to provide child care assistance to veterans while they receive services at a VA facility; 
	•	The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 to modify the GI program to ensure that service members will be able to use their education benefits throughout their lifetime.  The bill would also simplify the benefit for future service members by consolidating the GI Bill into a single program over time, which would help to reduce the VA's administrative costs; and,
	•	The FY18 Intelligence Reauthorization bill to enhance our intelligence capabilities to defend our country from cyber threats and attacks.
All of these bills are critical to help keep our citizens safe from harm, improve upon the care of our veterans, and maintain our operations at military installations across our state and country such as Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, Fort Bragg, and Camp Lejeune.  We owe it to every citizen, our service members, our veterans, and our law enforcement officials to continue to help provide the tools necessary to keep our neighborhoods safe, defeat the ever evolving threat of terrorism and enhance our ability to prevent and respond to any direct attack on American interests at home or abroad.

Greetings!
 
I hope you are having a great summer. Its always a pleasure for me to come home and work in Utah during August, and the month has been very busy so far.  
 
This week, we announced that I am taking on a new leadership role in the Congressional Dietary Supplement Caucus. I will co-chair this committee, along with Sens. Orrin Hatch R-Utah, and Martin Heinrich, D-NM.  My House colleague will be Rep. Jared Polis, D-CO.
 
The industry is a crucial part of Utahs economy, and Im excited to be a part of a group that will promote research, cost savings and better health and wellness for our constituents. Read the Press Release HERE

I held a series of Town Hall meetings this week in every county in the 4th Congressional District.  The meetings were smaller groups, and I really enjoyed the opportunity to hold a meaningful discussion on the issues that concern the people I represent.  Thank you to all who attended. 
 
The environment we created for these meetings was the subject of an editorial in the Salt Lake Tribune this week.
 
 
￼
￼
Dozens of people attended our meetings in our West Jordan District office. Healthcare was an important and sometimes emotional topic at the meetings in Salt Lake County.  People also chatted with me about education, as well as the political tone in Washington and the President.  I am a strong believer in the separation of powers and have concerns about any executive overreach. I will fight to be a voice for Utah no matter who is in the White House.
 
 
￼
￼
I told this group in Utah county that I value quality educationand the local control of the education our children receive. This group also wanted to talk about healthcare and the political environment.
 
 
￼
￼
Water rights, public lands issues and Veterans affairs dominated my time in in Juab and Sanpete Counties.  I also welcomed discussions about the Constitution. I told several of the groups that I will always fight for our veterans, who sometimes face challenges and bureaucracy with their benefits.

Thank you again to everyone who joined me this week. I tell all of my colleagues in Washington that Utah is the best state in the nation, and Utahns are the reason for that. It's truly an honor to represent you in Washington. 

￼

Discussing Local Issues on WPLG 10 
￼ 
On Sunday, I joined Michael Putney and Glenna Milberg on WPLG 10’s This Week in South Florida to discuss transportation issues, the current situation in Venezuela, and other topics important to our community. Click on the image above to view the segment.

Venezuela 
The current situation in Venezuela is devastating. The Maduro regime has elected and installed an illegitimate Constituent Assembly. The illegal attempt to rewrite Venezuela’s constitution reveals once again that Maduro and his cronies will stop at nothing in their desperate bid to cling to power. I commend President Trump for his swift action on sanctioning regime operatives. When he issued sanctions last week against 13 operatives of the Maduro regime, President Trump warned: should the Maduro regime move forward with the illegal Constituent Assembly, there would be grave consequences. The additional sanctioning of Nicolas Maduro is a bold and definitive message to him and other ruthless dictators around the globe that the United States will not coddle oppressive regimes. 

Everglades Funding 
￼ 
Congressman Francis Rooney (FL-19) and I visited the Merritt Pump Station in the Picayune Strand State Forest to see how federal dollars were being used to preserve the Everglades. As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I worked with my colleagues to once again secure this funding for preservation projects. From water supply quality and quantity, to the economic impact and jobs created, and the unparalleled landscape that provides an important habitat for numerous rare and endangered species, the Everglades continues to be a national treasure.
As always, stay in touch on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr and Instagram, or visit my website for any constituent services I am able to provide you with.

Thunes Fifth Farm Bill Proposal Would Simplify and Streamline Federal Forest Management
 
￼
 
This week, Sen. John Thune, a longtime member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, unveiled his fifth legislative proposal that is intended to be included in the 2018 farm bill. Thunes bill, the Forest Management Improvement Act of 2017, would make several improvements to the forestry title of the farm bill by increasing the effectiveness of the Healthy Forest Restoration Act, a necessary improvement to help reduce the threat of wildfires in South Dakota's Black Hills National Forest and other national forests around the country. The bill would also improve the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which would help simplify and streamline federal forest management. 
 
Truly effective forest management must include overcoming the pine beetle infestations in the Black Hills and other national forests, said Thune. It also must include pursuing proactive land stewardship goals for habitat management, recreational improvement, road maintenance, forest health, and wildfire protection, among other areas. All of these are within reach and can be accomplished through adequate and timely management practices, including timber thinning on national forests, which generates revenue and supports jobs. By expediting and simplifying implementation of common-sense timber management tools, as my bill would allow, we can achieve these land stewardship goals, protect our environment, and grow our economy.""

I spoke with Nicole Presley of the Pella Chronicle and Brent Barnett of KMA Radio in Shenandoah about the Senate’s health care efforts, reimbursements for critical access hospitals, legislative priorities, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and my annual 99 county meetings. 
Q&A: Fixing America's Tax System
Q. Are the stars aligned in Washington to enact comprehensive tax reform this year?  Q. What are you working on to secure as Congress negotiates a tax relief package?
Quick Links
I applaud final passage of the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act as part of the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act. This legislation, of which I’m the lead co-sponsor, will make certain types of hearing aids available over the counter to Americans with mild to moderate hearing impairment. The more products available, the more consumers will be able to find something they can afford that works for them. 
The Senate confirmed Christopher Wray to be the new FBI director. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I was proud to lead his nomination through the committeeMr. Wray now has one of the toughest jobs in government, but he has the right credentials, character and independence to succeed in leading our nation’s top law enforcement agency.
My bill to secure new protections for minors and improve accountability in the federal juvenile justice system unanimously passed the full Senate this week. I led the effort to enact these bipartisan reforms to ensure that young people who encounter the justice system are treated safely, fairly and in a manner that encourages greater respect for the law. 
Financial exploitation of seniors has been called the crime of the 21st century, and it could cost older Americans up to $36 billion a year. My bipartisan bill, called the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act, unanimously passed the Senate this week and will equip law enforcement, seniors and caregivers with additional tools so they can deter these crimes and hold perpetrators accountable.
The Office of Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs released the results of its review of the circumstances of veteran Brandon Ketchum’s suicide and whether Ketchum received adequate mental health treatment at the Iowa City VA Health Care System. This case is a tragic example of why we must do better for our veterans. With an average of 20 veterans committing suicide a day, the VA must do everything in its power to extend help before it's too late.

Dear Lindsey,
I wanted to make sure you saw the most recent news about health care.
As a member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, I am proud to join my Republican and Democratic colleagues to announce an agreement on a set of principles to stabilize health insurance markets and provide relief to individuals, families, and small businesses.
The plan, which you can read here, is a starting point for greater discussions about ways we can work together to fix our health-care markets with sensible and fair changes to allow people to afford reliable health care.
I urge my colleagues to move forward swiftly to stabilize the health insurance market to ensure elderly Arizonans, veterans, and those living with disabilities continue to have access to affordable health coverage. Then we can focus on reforming the Affordable Care Act, protecting critical subsidies that make coverage affordable for low-income Americans, and providing critical resources for states to bring down costs.
I will continue engaging you and health care providers in this discussion and will update you on our progress. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Problem Solvers Caucus to move commonsense, bipartisan proposals forward.
Sincerely,
￼
Tom O'Halleran

Dear Lindsey,
          Your personal communications should be protected from Big Brother, but federal laws and statutes haven't kept pace with modernizing technology. When Montanans go out to their mailboxes, they can have good faith that the government hasn't been reading their mail, and when they search through their email, they expect to have the same confidence.
          That's why I have sponsored two pieces of legislation to protect your civil liberties and the privacy of your electronic communications. The Email Privacy Act modernizes the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986 to establish a uniform warrant requirement for law enforcement to obtain stored electronic communications. Under current law, if your email is over 180 days old, law enforcement does not need a warrant to access it. This legislation would eliminate this archaic rule and protect American's constitutional right to privacy while still allowing law enforcement to do their job.
          The ECPA Modernization Act would go further by increasing the acceptable threshold for granting a warrant for electronic communications and real-time geolocation, as well as including a provision that bars the use of illegally obtained information from being submitted as evidence in any trial or judicial proceeding. The ECPA Modernization Act also requires the Federal Communications Commission and the Government Accountability Office to submit reports to Congress on stingrays, devices used by law enforcement to collect data from individual users in public spaces by acting as a cell tower for your cell phone.
          Just because your email ages, doesn't mean your 4th Amendment rights have gone away. And your right to privacy is one of my top priorities in the U.S. Senate. You can be sure that I am working hard to get these bills to the President's desk, because your mailbox and your inbox should both be protected.
Tell me what you think:
Do you believe a warrant should be necessary for law enforcement to have access to your private emails? 
Yes
No

VISITING DC
￼   ￼   ￼ 
August 04, 2017 
This week, the Senate Democrats ceased their blockade of the Presidents key staff, allowing more than seventy nominees to move through the Senate. More individuals were confirmed to important posts across the federal government in one afternoon than in the previous six months  combined. Hopefully this is a sign of things to come so that we can let experienced individuals get to work in critical positions to serve the American people.
 
I was proud to have led hearings for a few of these individuals: David Glawe of Iowa, the new Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis for the Department of Homeland Security, and Susan Gordon of Virginia, the new Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence. These dedicated public servants have spent their lives working to protect their country, and Im thankful for their willingness to serve their country yet again.
 
I am also humbled to see several former staff members going on to important positions throughout the administration. I am grateful for their work on behalf of North Carolinians, and I know theyll bring the same dedication to all of the Americans they now serve.
 
The astonishing level of obstruction in the Senate has come to a brief lull, and I am encouraged to see Senators working together for the betterment of the American people. There are still many nominees that have been considered by their respective committees but have yet to be confirmed. When Congress returns, we should pick up right where we left off.

Kicking Off August Across the 19th District
 As Congress entered its month-long district work period, I had the privilege of traveling across Upstate New York’s beautiful and expansive landscape to meet with constituents. Check out some of the photos from our events below:
Civil Air Patrol Encampment Graduation
￼
It was an honor to address our Civil Air Patrol cadets and their families at their encampment graduation this week at Stratton Air National Guard Base.
Stopping by the Schoharie County Fair
￼
What a pleasure it was to take part in the beautiful opening day of the Schoharie County Sunshine Fair!
Touring the Ten Mile River Boy Scout Camp
￼
Thank you to all our local scouts participating in the Ten Mile River Boy Scouts of America Camp in Sullivan County!
Davenport Celebrates 200 Years
￼
I had a great time joining our local families and neighbors to celebrate the Town of Davenport turning 200 years old! Thanks to Supervisor Dennis Valente for the warm invitation to attend this local bicentennial event.
Honoring Literacy Volunteers of Sullivan County
￼
What a privilege it was to speak at Literacy Volunteers of Sullivan County’s Student-Tutor-Volunteer Recognition Dinner this week and thank this local community group for its important work.
Touring Field Goods in Athens 
￼
This week I also toured the Field Goods facility in Athens, and afterwards joined in a discussion on the issues critical to Upstate New York agribusiness. I want to say a special thank you to Field Goods Founder and President Donna Williams. Watch the Register-Star’s coverage of the tour by clicking here or by selecting the image above.
Checking in on the Hudson Salvation Army
￼
At the Salvation Army in Hudson I got the chance to tour the facility and discuss current Salvation Army programs, plans for future expansion, and food insecurity issues in Columbia County with Director Jill Wishon and others.
Stone House Farm in Columbia County
￼
I was invited to tour Columbia County’s Stone House Farm recently and observe its organic-farming techniques and innovative carbon-capture technology. Stone House’s goal is to increase yields, decrease costs, and reuse energy in ways that reduce its overall carbon footprint. Special thanks to the farm’s Ben Dobson and Citizens’ Climate Lobby’s Jan Storm for accompanying me on the tour.
Discussing Sustainable Practices at Our Local Farms
￼
Thank you to farmer Chris Cashen and Peter Paden who helped guide our tour of Columbia Land Conservancy-assisted 19th District farms. Ironwood Farm and the Farm at Miller’s Crossing are both local crop and vegetable growers utilizing sustainable practices to protect the environment and deliver nutritious products to our Hudson Valley families.
Visiting Delhi Community Mainstay O’Connor Hospital
￼
O’Connor Hospital has been serving the Delhi community for 95 years. I was pleased to join hospital staff and members this week to talk rural healthcare and more. Thanks to Ed McGrath, Senior Director of Operations; Scott Bonderoff, President; Deb Neale, Chief Nursing Officer; Amy Beverage, Director of Operational Support; and hospital Board Member John Hamilton for providing a tour and an informative discussion.
Learning the Fine Art of Craft Distilling at Union Grove Distillery
￼
Union Grove Distillery in Arkville, Delaware County is a craft distillery drawing on the pristine waters of the New York City Water Supply System. This week I toured this 19th District small business and learned more about its operations. Special thanks to owners-distillers Brian Mulder and Todd Pascarella, as well as Todd’s wife Jeanine, daughter Amelia, and son Max for showing us their beautiful Catskills distillery.
Spending Some Time with Some Special Campers at Camp HASC
￼
Camp HASC is a nonprofit summer camp located in Parksville, Sullivan County serving individuals with special needs. I was honored to tour the camp this week and meet with campers and counselors who have made Camp HASC a home away from home for more than 40 years. Special thanks to Abe Eisner and Rabbi David Zwiebel, Executive Vice President of Agudath Israel of America, for the warm invitation to attend. Watch a video clip from my visit here, or by clicking the image above.
A Few More 19th District Visits...
I also took part in a very informative meeting with freight-rail advocates GoRail, I toured Lehigh Cement Co.’s Catskill facility and distribution terminal, and visited Delhi Telephone Company to discuss broadband-access issues and more.

Legislative Corner

Hoosick Falls Gets Long-Awaited Superfund Designation
 
The residents of Hoosick Falls will now see the contaminated Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics site eligible for federal cleanup funding, permanently. I was proud to stand with our residents in this fight for safe drinking water. Now state and federal officials must work together to ensure that the contamination is remediated and the health and safety of our families is protected. I wrote three letters on behalf of the community to resolve this issue. View these letters here:
 
Letter to the EPA, February 17, 2017 – Outlines past actions taken by the EPA, and the September 9, 2016 proposal to add Saint-Gobain site to Superfund NPL.
Follow Up Letter to the EPA, June 22, 2017 – Follows up with EPA Administrator to Pruitt to add McCaffrey site to Superfund NPL.
Faso/Welch Letter to the EPA, June 27, 2017 – Bipartisan letter to EPA Administrator Pruitt encouraging the EPA to take a more prominent role in determining the impacts of PFCs.

ICYMI: Senate Passes House Veterans Legislation

This week the U.S. Senate passed two critical pieces of bipartisan veterans legislation that previously passed in the House with my support. The bills now await President Trump’s signature.

The Veterans Appeal Improvement and Modernization Act addresses the VA’s broken appeals process – where there are close to 500,000 appeals pending – to deliver care to veterans who have been waiting far too long, by streamlining the process and allowing veterans to maintain the original claim date.

For full text of the legislation, click here.
The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act makes much-needed improvements to the post-9/11 GI Bill, including an important expansion of benefits for our veterans pursuing degrees in the STEM field. Upstate New Yorkers understand well the need for more people with this kind of training, and there is no one better to fill this demand than the men and women who have served in our military.
For full text of the legislation, click here.

Spreading the Word on Problem Solvers Caucus

The Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan, solutions-driven caucus I serve on with 43 other Republicans and Democrats, this week released its bipartisan proposal to stabilize insurance markets. I spoke to several local press outlets about these and the other healthcare reforms being worked on by the caucus.

Farmfest Listening Session
Morgan
 
Dear Friends,
 
This week I joined hundreds of Minnesota’s farmers, ranchers, and producers at Farmfest for a House Agriculture Committee listening session on the next farm bill. I was pleased that a number of other members from the Committee and region could join, including Chairman Conaway (TX), Reps. Walz, Nolan, and Emmer from Minnesota, and Reps. Cramer and Noem from North Dakota and South Dakota respectively. Hearing directly from those most impacted by our rural economy only reinforced my conviction that Congress would get more done if they spent more time listening, instead of talking. This listening session was a great example of members taking the time to listen to people about their priories for the farm bill, and things they would like to see improved. I will continue to prioritize your thoughts and concerns as I work to represent Minnesota’s Seventh Congressional District. 
 
Sincerely,
￼
 Congressman Collin C. Peterson
Minnesota 7th District
 
Minnesota Farmfest
￼
 
This week I had the opportunity to attend Farmfest near Morgan, MN. While this year was colder than any I can remember, that didn’t stop people from “braving” the weather and getting together to represent our agriculture community. Farmers and ranchers are the economic backbone in this region, and Farmfest is one of the best chances to hear from them first hand. As always, Farmfest was a great opportunity to meet with folks from across the ag sector, try out the beef sandwiches from the Minnesota Cattlemen Association, Wood-fired Pizza from the Minnesota Farmers Union, and the pork-chop-on-a-stick from the Minnesota Farm Bureau, hear folks concerns about current issues, and see exhibits showing the latest in ag developments. I am grateful for all who were able to attend.
 
Agriculture Committee Listening Sessions
￼
Chairman Conaway; Members of the Agriculture Committee
 
The Agriculture Committee this week traveled to San Angelo, Texas and Farmfest in Morgan, Minn., to continue our “Conversations in the Field,” listening sessions to gather input for the next farm bill. Both events were widely attended and we heard input on a range of topics. Having feedback from those who actually use farm bill programs will help the Committee as we look to potential changes in the next farm bill. The Committee has two additional listening sessions scheduled for this month – August 5 in Modesto, Calif., and August 30 in Decatur, Ill.
 
Archived video of the Farmfest listening session is available here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSAV1Vo40cA&feature=youtu.be
 
Farmfest Radio Shows
￼
 
After our listening session at Farmfest, I joined Chairman Conaway and Minnesota Farm Bureau President Kevin Papp for a live broadcast on Linder Farm Network, hosted Lynn Ketelsen. We discussed the farm bill in further detail and how it can be completed in a timely matter. I was also a guest on Tuesday morning’s AgriTalk radio program. Host Mike Adams and I discussed the Agriculture Committee’s farm bill listening sessions and our work on a new farm bill. I expressed my concern about having an adequate budget to fix the areas we know need to be addressed and also talked about potential changes to the dairy safety net. We also discussed the challenges of passing legislation in a polarized Congress. I also joined Scott Hennen at K-FYR Radio on Thursday to discuss what I heard from those who attended Farmfest and the best ways to help enact their priorities in the farm bill. Hearing from farmers and ranchers continues to give me increased insight and encouragement to finish this important work.

Wabasso FFA Officer Team Road Trip
￼
 
Minnesota was well-represented at the farm bill listening session in San Angelo on Monday. The Wabasso FFA chapter officer team attended the event as part of a road trip to Texas. They headed south to visit rice and cotton farms near Brownsville. The FFA members are doing a great job of learning more about agriculture in other parts of the country - which is exactly what the listening session was about. The other committee members were very impressed and I think they learned a lot from the Wabasso FFA members. Thanks for being a great example and doing a great job of representing Minnesota.
 
Land O’Lakes and CHS
This morning, following yesterday’s Agriculture Committee Listening Session at Farmfest, I joined Chairman Conaway at another event to meet with leaders from Land O’Lakes and CHS. We talked about the upcoming farm bill, but also tax reform and other legislative issues coming up in the fall. As the Chair and Ranking member of the Committee, we work together closely, and joint meetings like this are another example of that.

52nd Anniversary of Medicare
￼
President Johnson signing the bill into law; the bill, entitled “The Social Security Amendments of 1965”
 
President Johnson signed the Medicare and Medicaid programs into law on July 30, 1965. For more than 50 years, these initiatives have helped millions of Americans secure quality and affordable healthcare. In the 115th Congress, I have co-sponsored legislation to expand Medicare’s coverage to include exams, treatments, and medical devices for eyes, ears, and teeth. I also lent my support to bills that will help strengthen Medicare’s mental health workforce and repeal the therapy cap. As Congress explores reforms to our healthcare system, I will work to protect against cuts to the benefits that seniors have worked hard to earn.
 
This Week in American History

Gov. Sibley c. 1862; the flag of Minnesota Territory
 
On August 1, 1849, the Minnesota Territory held its first election, voting Henry H. Sibley as the first representative of the territory’s at-large congressional district. After serving two terms in Congress, Sibley served in the Minnesota Territorial House of Representatives, and in 1858, became the first governor of the state of Minnesota.

Dear Friend,  A newly elected representative recently submitted a document for consideration by all members of Congress. I read it, and it’s wise. And I think it’s smart. I signed it, along with 130 other Members of Congress from both sides of the political aisle. I invite you to read it. It’s called A Commitment to Civility.  As Members of the United Sates House of Representatives and as individual citizens we recognize the gravity of the responsibility we have been given and the significance of this moment in the history of our extraordinary country.  American remains the most free, most powerful and most prosperous nation in all the world, and yet we face significant challenges. Among these challenges has been an increasing division in and coarsening of our culture fueled too often by the vitriol in our politics and public discourse. One result has been a loss of trust in our institutions and elected officials.  We believe there is a better alternative.  Although we represent both political parties and a wide range of individual views across the political spectrum, our common and sincere aims are to serve the needs and interests of the American people, to work with one another to encourage greater confidence in our institutions, and to set an example of statesmanship for the younger generations of Americans that will follow.  To this end, we are dedicated to showing proper respect to one another and all others, encouraging productive dialogue, and modeling civility in our public and private actions. While we may vehemently disagree on matters of law and policy, we will strive at all times to maintain collegiality and the honor of our office.  We believe that a leader can be cooperative and conciliatory without compromising his or her core principles, and we recognize that our political rivals in Congress are not our enemies- but rather our colleagues and fellow Americans. We also believe that maintaining a spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation will help make government work more efficiently and effectively, help build consensus and restore the public trust, and, ultimately, serve as a positive influence on society at large.  For all these reasons, we herby pledge our names to this Commitment to Civility.   Sincerely, ￼  Congressman Jeff Fortenberry

I was on WREG Live at 9 this morning to discuss health care, President Trump and promote the town hall. You can watch the segment here.
Celebrating National Night Out
￼   On Tuesday, I attended several different Memphis neighborhood association events to celebrate National Night Out. National Night Out is an annual movement across the country to help build trust between the police and communities to make our neighborhoods safer, better places to live. I was pleased to meet former Memphis State Tigers point guard Andre Turner, the Little General, and his family (pictured above). Go Tigers!
Attending the COGIC Tennessee Headquarters Centennial Celebration
￼
On Monday, I congratulated Bishop David Hall, Sr., Mother Geraldine Miller, and members of Church of God in Christ (COGIC) on the Tennessee Jurisdictional Headquarters 100th Anniversary at Pentecostal Temple. I was on the Don Imus radio show in June, and I told him we shared a mutual friend, the late Bishop G.E. Patterson. Bishop Patterson was the Presiding Bishop and Chief Apostle of COGIC. I want to thank COGIC for filling the physical, emotional, and most importantly spiritual needs in Memphis.  
Participating in a NAMI Mental Health Town Hall
￼
On Thursday, I participated in the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Memphis Affiliate town hall meeting on mental health issues. At the town hall, we discussed the Affordable Care Act and mental health legislation before Congress. I was joined at the meeting by State Representative Johnnie Turner, NAMI President Dr. John Tetzeli, NAMI Vice President Yvonne Osbourne and other members of NAMI Memphis Chapter’s board.
Speaking at the Frayser Exchange Club Meeting 
￼
On Thursday, I spoke at the Frayser Exchange Club weekly meeting at Impact Baptist Church. During the meeting, I gave attendees a legislative update on health care, protecting our democracy from Russia and President Trump and supporting the Democrats’ new Better Deal economic agenda to bring jobs to Memphis.

Good afternoon from Arizona’s Fifth Congressional District –
I’ve enjoyed being back in the Grand Canyon State this week, meeting with constituents and businesses around our great district. My schedule is packed with more meetings and tours for the rest of the month – looking forward to seeing many of you during this August Congressional Recess.
FRIDAYS ARE FOR FREEDOM
Shedding Light on Unconstitutional Federal Regulations
August 4, 2017 – Protecting American Mining Jobs
Overturning President Obama’s political EPA regulations.
￼
Problem:
	•	In January 2017, President Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a regulation that would usurp states’ regulatory authority and needlessly duplicate state and federal requirements for the hardrock mining and mineral processing industry.   
	•	High costs of compliance with the rule will put a damper on domestic mineral production while leading to an increase in American reliance on foreign metals and minerals.  The result of this rule will be felt far and wide as the domestic manufacturing, energy, and national security sectors are put at a major disadvantage and local economies lose out on high-paying jobs.  
Solutions:
	•	This proposed rule must be rejected in order to protect our economy, ensure global competitiveness of resource extraction companies, deliver affordable American energy, and provide good-paying jobs.   
	•	Earlier this year, I led a letter to the House Appropriation Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies asking to protect the mining industry and job creators by prohibiting federal funding from being used to implement the proposed rule.  The Committee honored my request and my proposed language was included in Section 433 of the Subcommittee’s Fiscal Year 2018 Appropriations bill. It is my hope that Congress will pass this bill into law later this year.
	•	This week, I also co-led a letter with fellow Western Caucus Members to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt calling on the EPA to scrap the Obama-era rule.
What they are saying:
“Imposing billions of dollars in new financial costs on job creators in rural communities just to enact redundant, top-down Washington mandates defies common sense. The CERCLA rule represents a solution in search of a problem. While this nonsensical regulation provides no tangible environmental benefit, the mining jobs it will kill in an already over-regulated industry will be all too real—and impossible to get back. That’s why I was happy to team up with your impressive Representative Andy Biggs to lead 40 other members of Congress in calling on EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to roll back these duplicative requirements for the hardrock mining industry. I thank Congressman Biggs for his continued attention to this and other glaring examples of regulatory overreach that would cause significant harm to hard-working Arizonans, and look forward to future Freedom Fridays.” – Western Caucus Chairman Paul Gosar
“To conclude that today’s mining industry presents the level of risk that justifies an expansive, costly and duplicative regulation, EPA had to ignore modern mining practices, existing state and federal environmental, reclamation and financial assurance requirements, and a sensible reading of the law.” – National Mining Association
“The State of Arizona has a strong financial assurance program in place for hard rock mining to ensure taxpayers are never left holding the bill to clean up mine sites. CERCLA's redundant federal-level bonding requirements would have a chilling impact on an industry that provides over 12,000 direct jobs in Arizona."" – Arizona Mining Association
“Freeport-McMoRan believes the proposed CERCLA § 108(b) rules would cause serious harm to the mining industry, jobs, and the availability of key commodities. If adopted, the proposed rules will result in significant contraction of the domestic hard rock (e.g., copper, gold and silver) mining industry and impede future growth.  Expert economic modeling, prepared with data from large mining companies that would be regulated by the proposed rules, indicates that the proposed rules would eliminate some 10,000 well-paid mining jobs and reduce economic activity in just eight mining states by $1.3 billion to $3.85 billion annually.  Those jobs are likely to be concentrated in certain areas, hurting entire communities.  The proposed rules should be withdrawn, and existing federal and state environmental programs should continue to regulate hard rock mining.” – Freeport-McMoRan 
“The Arizona Rock Products Association supports a ""no action"" position on the CERCLA 108 (B) Rule.  Our members do not support the new rule that, as proposed, will duplicate existing financial assurance requirements by state and federal land management agencies.  The rule is not needed, is onerous and will have a substantial negative impact on Arizona's hard rock mining industry but does nothing to further protect the environment.  ARPA stands side-by-side with Arizona state agencies such as the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, State Land and the State Mine Inspector’s Office and our industry counterparts in opposition of the proposed Rule.”  - Arizona Rock Products Association
FIGHTING FOR OUR VETERANS
	•	Last week, I sent a letter to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary David Shulkin to outline three of my primary concerns with the Phoenix and Gilbert VA. This letter followed seven weeks of internal discussions with the VA as my office attempted to work out these serious issues on behalf of my constituents. Though the VA has made a good-faith effort to maintain dialogue with our office and work through these issues, our veterans are still waiting for the efficient and complete care they were promised. The VA’s culture of inefficiency and broken trust has only seen minimal progress, and our veterans continue to pay a terrible and unnecessary price as a result. I will continue to work with the VA to address the three issues, among others, that I outlined in my letter to Secretary Shulkin. However, my patience has run its course as I have seen the prolonged consequences to our veterans from the lack of basic and common sense service. I promised my constituents that I would fight for them in Congress, and I intend to do just that for our veterans until the VA’s culture is fully reformed. See the letter to Secretary Shulkin here. 
	•	If you’re a veteran, please save the date for our upcoming Congressional Veterans Benefits Awareness Fair.  
At this fair, educational presentations will be given by the Veterans Benefits Administration,  Veterans Health Administration, and TriWest Healthcare Alliance. Representatives from the VA will be there to help veterans file new claims and follow up on existing claims. Please find the details of this fair below:
                                                Date:                      Thursday, August 31, 2017                                                 When:                   11:00 AM to 3:00 PM                                                 Where:                  East Valley Institute of Technology

NO EXEMPTIONS FOR CONGRESS
￼
This week, I responded to President Trump’s weekend tweets about Congressional subsidies for Obamacare premiums:
All too often, Congress exempts itself from laws it imposes on the American people. After Democrats passed Obamacare in the dead of night, multiple loopholes were exploited so that Members of Congress did not have to feel the real economic pain of everyday Americans when paying for their health care premiums.
I previously promised my constituents that I would fight to close these loopholes to ensure that Congress abides by the laws that we pass for our constituents. I also refuse the standard government subsidy for my health care premium, paying 100% of my health care out of my own pocket. Though I have never wanted Obamacare, nor does a day go by when I do not fight against Obamacare, I will not take a subsidy that is not afforded to my constituents.
President Trump is right: the subsidies must be eliminated to incentivize Members of Congress to keep their promise and repeal Obamacare. Only then, will the American people – and their Representatives – see a return to affordable health care premiums.

The Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act  South Fayette Firefighters Receive Federal Grant  Pittsburgh Leads the Way for Self-Driving Vehicles  #ServiceAboveSelf: Murphy Gives Capitol Update to Rotary Club of Upper St. Clair-Bethel Park  

The Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act
￼
In 1972, the Drug Abuse Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act created the 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 2, known simply as “Part 2.” This policy was designed to protect the confidentiality of substance use in a medical record to encourage those with addiction disorders to seek treatment. However, nearly a half century later, in the midst of the worst drug crisis in United States history, doctors are effectively prohibited from knowing their patients’ full medical history, leading them to unknowingly prescribe opioids to a patient in recovery which has caused countless relapses, harmful drug-to-drug interactions and overdose deaths. 
The unintended consequences of Part 2 have been more harmful than helpful. Specifically, a person who is in recovery from addiction runs significant risk for relapse, harmful drug-drug interaction and overdose if a doctor unknowingly prescribes an opiate because they don't know the patient's full medical history. The doctor could prescribe an opiate, which could have extremely harmful and potentially life-threatening effects.
 Likely, patients in recovery are grappling day-to-day with the temptation as well as the stigma for receiving treatment and some may be embarrassed to tell the doctor about their addiction history. In some cases, even if the patient tells the doctor, it may not be communicated to others, and the patient may still receive the unwanted medication. Without that information included in the patient's medical record, the doctor may unknowingly prescribe an opiate, causing the person to relapse back into addiction. Ensuring that a patient's addiction history is included in the medical record - still fully protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) - could be lifesaving. 
To solve this problem and fix Part 2, on Friday, July 28, 2017, Congressman Murphy introduced the Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety (OPPS) Act (H.R. 3545) in the U.S. House of Representatives. The OPPS Act realigns all substance use treatment records used for payment, treatment, or healthcare operation to the requirements of HIPAA, in lieu of Part 2. 

“Right now, information about a patient’s addiction treatment is prohibited from being shared with doctors. This deadly segregation of medical records is wreaking havoc on our nation’s ability to respond to the ongoing opioid crisis,” said Murphy. “You cannot treat the whole patient with half of their medical record. In order to help turn the tide on this crisis and prevent more drug overdose deaths, physicians must have access to their patient's entire medical history.”
Additionally, this legislation provides important new protections against the inappropriate sharing of substance use treatment records, ensuring the highest level of privacy is maintained. Specifically, OPPS strengthens existing Part 2 protections that prevent the disclosure of addiction treatment records in a manner that might lead to prosecution, discrimination or loss of employment, housing, or child custody. 
On July 31, 2017, the White House Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis released its preliminary report, highlighting the need for action on Murphy's Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act.
Original co-sponsors of the OPPS Act include Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), Buddy Carter (R-GA), Jim Renacci (R-OH), Patrick Meehan (R-PA) and Markwayne Mullun (R-OK). Additionally, organizations who support the OPPS Act include: American Hospital Association, National Alliance on Mental Illness, Association for Behavioral Health and Wellness, American Society of Addiction Medicine, Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, The Kennedy Forum and more. For a full list of supporting organizations, click here.

South Fayette Firefighters Receive Federal Grant 
￼
Murphy congratulates South Fayette firemen.
Authorized by Congress, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which falls under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), offers the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) to local fire departments.  Congressman Murphy works hard to ensure that fire departments in Pennsylvania’s Eighteenth Congressional District are awarded these grants in order to support their important efforts to keep our communities safe.  One such grant was awarded to the South Fayette Volunteer Firemen’s Association, which is made up of both the South Fayette Volunteer Fire Department (SFVFD) and the Oak Ridge Volunteer Fire Department (ORVFD).
Surrounded by members of both departments, Congressman Murphy presented a ceremonial check for $186,667 to Chief Joseph Janocha (SFVFD) and Chief Bill Supan (ORVFD) in South Fayette Township, Allegheny County.  This money will be put towards purchasing 30 new Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus Units and a Rapid Intervention Pack, replacing badly outdated equipment.  So far in 2017, Oak Ridge VFD has responded to 60 incidents, and South Fayette VFD has responded to 94. The grant application was written by members of both departments.
Founded in 1937, South Fayette VFD has been in existence for 80 years, and Oak Ridge VFD has been around since 1956.  Family runs deep throughout these departments thanks to this history.  At the check presentation ceremony, there were father and daughter, father and son, and husband and wife families present; some with nearly 50 years of combined service.
Below: Murphy presents check to Chief Joseph Janocha (SFVFD),  Chief Bill Supan (ORVFD) and the South Fayette Volunteer Firemen's Association.

Pittsburgh Leads the Way for Self-Driving Vehicles
￼
Murphy learns more about self-driving technology 
during a ride in one of Ubers HAVs.
Despite being headquartered in San Francisco, Uber’s presence in Southwestern Pennsylvania is undeniable. Notably, Pittsburgh is the home of one of Uber’s three Advanced Technologies Groups (ATG). ATG is Uber’s engineering team that is currently transporting Southwestern Pennsylvanians around the city in self-driving cars and developing self-driving truck technology to move goods around the world. Congressman Murphy sat down with Eric Meyhofer, the newly hired Head of ATG, at Uber’s ATG Center in the Strip District to discuss their developments of Highly Automated Vehicles (HAVs).
As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Congressman Murphy recently voted in favor of sending H.R. 3388, the Designating Each Car’s Automation Level Act (DECAL) Act, to the House floor for a vote. The DECAL Act establishes framework to encourage the testing, development, and deployment of HAVs while enforcing safety measures and protection against cyber-attacks. This bill also creates a Federal Advisory Committee to examine how this new technology can provide mobility access to the disabled community, senior citizens, and other groups who are currently underserved by public transportation.
￼

Advanced Technology Group in Pittsburgh.
“While we are still years away from any major changeover, it is important to prepare for the future today,” Murphy stated regarding his support for this legislation.
Uber hopes to have 300 self-driving cars on the road by next year. Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group alone has brought over 700 jobs to Southwestern Pennsylvania.  
“Pittsburgh has always been a national leader in research, robotics and innovation, and now we are continuing to push forward as the nation’s neurocenter for self-driving vehicles,” said Murphy. “In the city where this new and developing technology was first tested, exciting opportunities are emerging, specifically for populations that have been left behind by traditional public transportation.”   To share your thoughts on the future of self-driving vehicles, please click here. 
#ServiceAboveSelf: Murphy Gives Capitol Update to Rotary Club of Upper St. Clair-Bethel Park
For nearly a century Rotary clubs have played an active role in Southwestern Pennsylvania.  The clubs are composed of leaders that come together once a week to create positive, lasting change in our community and around the world.  Rotarians help local residents connect with a diverse group of professionals who share a drive to give back to the community following the motto ""Service Above Self."" 
￼

#ServiceAboveSelf
On Tuesday, Congressman Murphy joined his fellow Rotarians at Kings Family Restaurant on McMurray Road for the weekly Rotary Club of Upper St. Clair-Bethel Park breakfast meeting.  Murphy provided updates from Congress, specifically the House’s record-breaking legislative year.  Murphy touted the efficiency of the 115th Congress, which has passed more than 160 bills to date, making this the most productive session in the modern-era, stating, “You may not hear about it on the news every day, but we have made great strides for positive change in people’s lives, such as holding VA employees accountable for the first time.”  Murphy also spoke about the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018, which passed the House last week with Murphy’s support and now heads to the Senate for consideration. Specifically, Murphy pointed out important provisions in defense appropriations bill, such as safeguarding US security abroad and at home by funding operations to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), replenishing our military budgets after years of neglect, and improving our missile defense capabilities to defend against threats from hostile instable nations like North Korea and other adversaries. Murphy also noted the bill’s focus on meeting our nation’s security needs by a strong commitment to America’s men and women in uniform, while upholding the Constitutional duty to provide for the common defense.

Dear Friend,

My team and I are still hard at work building One Meck! Take a look below at what we've been working recently. 

Best Regards,            
￼
Congresswoman Alma S. Adams, Ph.D.
                 
  
 
￼
      

On July 10th I hosted a Healthcare Town Hall at Mayfield Missionary Baptist Church to discuss the impact President Trump’s health care legislation would have had on the 12th District if passed. With our district at the top of the list for areas hit hardest in the nation by Trumpcare, hundreds of constituents showed up to ask questions and voice their concerns. 

      


￼ 
Legislative Actions 
Record Funding Secured for HBCUs and Minority Institutions: 
Bipartisan HBCU Caucus members, Reps. Anthony Brown (MD-04) and Hank Johnson (GA-04) and I offered an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act to increase the Department of Defense's Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) Program funding by $4.135 million. With the passage of this amendment, this program now totals $40 million, allowing HBCUs to continue competing for research grants, education assistance, instrumentation purchases, and technical assistance.

Key Letters 
 
Letter to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin in support of the myRA program: This letter, sent on July 25, urged the Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, to demonstrate commitment to the myRA program, an innovative effort that takes steps towards addressing the nation’s savings and retirement crisis by helping workers save.
Letter to President Trump in support of paid family leave: Sent on July 10, this letter expresses support for providing American workers 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave that is sustainable, affordable, and inclusive. It also raises concerns with the proposal included in the President’s 2018 budget request, which  would only provide six weeks of paid leave in limited circumstances and without a solid funding mechanism to ensure that it is fiscally sustainable.
Letter to Secretary Perdue requesting adequate funding for SNAP: This letter was sent to Agriculture Secretary, Sonny Purdue, on July 14. It expressed concerns with President Trump’s proposed budget and it’s requested cut of $193 billion dollars to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) budget. This 25% cut would jeopardize nutritional support to many of the 42 million nationwide that rely on SNAP to feed their families. 
Letter to DHS and CBP urging stricter enforcement of textile and apparel trade laws: This letter was sent to the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection on July 21. It urged the Administration, as it develops a strategy to support U.S. manufacturing, to include increased enforcement of existing trade laws.
Letter to the Election Commission asking that they refrain from requesting state’s voter data due to privacy concerns: Sent on July 19, this letter expresses serious concerns with the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity’s request for state’s voter data due to privacy concerns surrounding the storage of hundreds of millions of Americans personal data.
Letter to EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, about the Clean Water Rule: This letter, sent on June 29th, requested that the public comment period for rescinding the Clean Water Rule be extended from 30 days to at least 120 days. 
Letter to Education and Workforce Committee about legislation to raise the minimum wage: Sent on July 24th, this letter requests that Education and Workforce Chairwoman, Virginia Foxx (NC-05), hold a hearing on H.R. 15, the Raise the Wage act, which would increase the minimum wage to $15 over a seven year period.

POLICY UPDATE: Defense- Budget Control Act
 
One of the most important successes of this year for the U.S. House of Representatives has been the passage of two critical pieces of legislation: the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2018. The NDAA is a product of the House Armed Services Committee andas the name impliesauthorizes the framework of our national security apparatus. But this is only one component of Congress constitutional duty to raise and support a military. The Defense Appropriations Act is a product of the House Appropriations Committeeof which I am a memberand funds the programs, policies, and operations set forth in the NDAA.
 
Though the Senate has not yet taken up the two bills, they provide major relief to the worlds finest fighting force by boosting baseline funding by $68.1 billion, investing $84.3 billion in research and development, increasing equipment and weapons procurement by $31.2 billion, and funding a 2.4% pay raise to our troops. In my capacity as a member of the House Appropriations Committee and as a member of the House of Representatives, I was proud to vote at both levels for these bills that will put our military on the road to recovery. Given their recent passage, I wanted to revisit the big picture of our defense spending and the fiscal challenges that threaten our national security.
 
To fully grasp the current defense budget landscape, one must go back to 2011 when President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), with the intent to resolve the 2011 debt ceiling crisis. Under the BCA, if a designated, special bipartisan committee could not formulate a plan to reduce the deficit, the BCA would impose mandatory caps on federal spending through 2021. The committee failed, and to this day, all federal spending remains subject to these caps, except funds reserved for emergencies or what is designated Oversees Contingency Operations.
 
As a fiscal conservative, I strongly support a balanced budget and the reduction of the national debt. Undoubtedly, these important goals require cuts in all areas. But we must draw a distinction with defense spending. Although complex, actuarial models allow legislators to forecast the cost of entitlement programs with a reasonable degree of certainty, the same cannot be said of defense spending. In order to maintain national security, this spending must be tied to the threats our nation faces. Herein lies the defense challenge of the BCA: it provides ten years of mandatory defense cuts without considering the threat level or our own readiness. That is not proper budgeting. 
 
Some may be tempted to look at the price tag of our defense budget and scoff at the notion of it being underfunded. But this overlooks two important considerations. First, as a percentage of our GDP, our defense spending is near an all time, modern era low at approximately 3%. Despite the fact that we are engaged in two major overseas conflicts, our defense spending by this measure is roughly half of what it was under President Reagan and nearly a third of what it was under President Lyndon Johnson. Second, since we have passed the BCA, we have witnessed and can claim it as fact, that when and where America withdraws from a challenge, our adversaries will fill the void. In 2011, ISIS was unknown, Russia had not yet annexed part of Ukraine, North Korea did not have a missile capable of reaching our shores, and China was not expanding its territory in the South China Sea by manufacturing islands. It is clear that as our nation has been fighting two separate insurgencies for nearly 16 years, our adversaries have been growing in both capability and audacity.
 
This year, both the House NDAA and Defense Appropriations Act exceed the BCA caps. This will require the Senate to either make corresponding cuts to discretionary spending, which is unsustainable, or exercise bipartisanship and raise the defense spending cap. To underscore the urgency, our Navy is half the size that it was under President Reagan; the average age of an Air Force aircraft is 27 years, making it our oldest Air Force ever; our Army is expected to use certain ground vehicles for up to 70 years; and the Marine Corps with aging aircraft and a scarcity of parts has recently seen readiness as low as 30%. We did not arrive at this crisis overnight, and neither will we recover from it overnight. But our nation must choose between retreat and readiness. And the road to recovery begins with the 2018 House defense bills.
 
I believe that one of the most serious, long-term threats to our nation is fiscal disaster wrought by runaway entitlement programs. I am encouraged by the Trump Administration's efforts here and I am more resolved than ever to bring some responsibility to these programs. But I will not ignore the near-term and immediate threat our nation faces.

Dear Lindsey, 
The Connecticut Air National Guard has been making our state proud for more than 90 years. The men and women of the “Flying Yankees” protect our state during natural disasters and other crises, and bolster our national defense overseas when called upon. While many people are aware that the Air National Guard has long stood at the ready from their base at Bradley Airport, many are not aware of the incredible transformation that the Guard is currently undergoing. 
￼
The emblem of the Connecticut Air National Guard which was created in 1923
In 2005, Connecticut lost its A-10 aircraft as part of the base closing process. Left without a flying mission, the future of the Connecticut Air National Guard was uncertain. When I entered Congress and joined the House Armed Services Committee, I worked closely with General Thad Martin, the Adjutant General of the Connecticut National Guard, and his team to work on securing a mission that would keep the Flying Yankees relevant and engaged in support of our nation.
During the debate over the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act, I helped secure an agreement that assigned eight C-130H aircraft to Connecticut. This kicked off a flurry of activity to prepare for the new mission - such as training of aviators, and about $120 million in investment in updated facilities to support the new cargo and airlift mission.

￼

I have been proud to secure some of this funding through my work on the House Armed Services Committee. Just last week, state and Guard officials celebrated the opening of a new $14.1 million dollar facility constructed with federal funding to support the Guard's fleet of eight C-130s. The new 30,000 square foot building was built with funding allocated in the 2015 defense bill, a project I strongly advocated for in Congress.
Two other projects are also on their way. The first, a new air terminal to help with the loading of passengers and cargo, received $6 million in funding last year. Second, a new security entry point for the Bradley Airport base was allocated $7 million in the defense authorization I helped pass in June. Together, this pipeline of investment will help complete the transformation to the C-130 mission and send a clear statement of the important role our state plays in serving the needs of our nation.

￼

In July, members of the Flying Yankees 103rd Airlift Wing began returning home after their successful deployment overseas in support of US military operations in Afghanistan. This was the Flying Yankees’ first mission since they were assigned their C-130H cargo aircraft mission. It was a proud day for the Connecticut Air National Guard and for our state, particularly after the years of hard work to secure the permanent flying mission.
￼
Congressman Courtney visits the Bradley Airport base of the Connecticut Air National Guard with General Thad Martin.
With Connecticut's transition to the C-130 mission well on its way, I am committed to doing all I can to ensure that these aircraft remain viable well into the future. As the Ranking Member of the House Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, I have oversight over cargo aircraft like the C-130. Over the last few years, I have helped to launch a program that will upgrade the avionics and engines on our C-130 fleet. My hope is that these efforts will keep the Flying Yankees in the air for years to come.

Congressman Adam Smith’s Summer Newsletter
As the August District Work period begins, I want to take a moment and share an update on my work on behalf of the 9th District. During the extended period of time I will be home in August, I look forward to the community meetings and in-person discussions with constituents that give me critical feedback on how I can best represent you. 
Upcoming Town Hall Meeting
Throughout last week, the Senate continued to debate proposals to dismantle health care for tens of millions of Americans. With the potential of a vote in the House of Representatives on Friday, July 28th, it was possible that the House would remain in session over the weekend to vote on health care legislation. 
Based on an abundance of caution, I decided to reschedule my previously announced town hall from Saturday, July 29th to instead take place on Saturday, August 12th. Community forums like these are an important opportunity for me to hear directly from my constituents about the issues they care about. 
I hope you can join me on Saturday, August 12th at Foster High School in Tukwila! 
￼
Legislative Updates from Washington, D.C.
Supporting Our Men and Women in Uniform
On July 14th, the House Armed Services Committee passed the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, known as the NDAA. This legislation ensures that our service members they have the tools and resources they need to do their jobs to provide for our national security. During the debate of the NDAA on the House Floor, as well as mark-up in committee, we prevailed on several important measures. 
Confirming Climate Change is National Security
As Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Committee, I was honored to join my colleague Congressman Jim Langevin in supporting his amendment recognizing climate change as a national security threat in the NDAA. The amendment requires a Defense Department report on the effects of climate change on military instillations, and will help ensure that the Department of Defense continues to plan for and mitigate against the impact of climate change. As one of the largest consumers of energy, it is important for the Defense Department to lead the way in pursuing energy efficiency programs and policies to lower our carbon footprint around the world.  
Rejecting a Controversial Study of Islam
My colleagues and I defeated an amendment from Congressman Trent Franks of Arizona that would have required the Defense Department to analyze the Islamic religion for ties to extremist views, and called for the creation of a list of Islamic faith leaders. To target anyone based on their beliefs is an affront to our country’s values and undermines our national security. I joined my colleagues in strong opposition to the Franks Amendment and was pleased to see it rejected from the NDAA. 
Supporting our Transgender Men and Women in Uniform
The service of our transgender soldiers has no effect on readiness. During debate of the NDAA, Congresswoman Vicki Hartzler from Missouri offered an amendment barring transgender health care. This amendment is a social agenda that has no business being in the defense bill. I spoke on the House Floor in opposition to this prejudicial anti-transgender proposal and joined my colleagues in voting it down. 
￼
Soon after the Hartlzer amendment was defeated on the House Floor, President Trump continued the assault on the transgender community by announcing that he will not allow transgender people to serve in the military. This rash decision is an unwarranted and disgraceful attack on men and women who have been bravely serving their country. These service members are defending the United States around the world as we speak, and they have long done so with distinction. To prevent transgender people from joining the military and to push out those who have devoted their lives to this country would be ugly and discriminatory in the extreme. I will continue to fight this reckless proposal from the President. 
I ultimately voted in support of the NDAA because I support the critical programs that the bill authorizes for our men and women in uniform, but I have continued to raise serious concerns with the unsustainable budgeting that has become the norm for defense spending. To simply gut the non-defense discretionary budget in order to plus-up defense spending, does not make our country safer. Funding for domestic priories, like the groundbreaking research being conducted by Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center in Seattle, has an incredible impact on the lives of Americans. Because Congress is not making necessary budget choices, critical priorities like curing cancer are being pushed aside. We need to make hard decisions about our fiscal future and invest in building an economy that works for all Americans. 
Check out my remarks on House Floor during consideration of the NDAA.
￼
Reforming our Federal Grazing Policy
On July 28th,  I reintroduced the Rural Economic Vitalization Act (REVA) with Congressman Raul Grijalva. This legislation improves our wasteful, environmentally harmful, and economically inefficient federal grazing policy. This bill would update federal law to allow ranchers with grazing permits to voluntarily retire their permits to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest Service. Farmers would receive market value compensation for their permits, paid for by private parties, and the BLM and U.S. Forest Service would be allowed to permanently retire these grazing permits.
We need to provide for more environmentally responsible and economically sound management of our public lands. As we look for sustainable solutions to our fiscal challenges, the Rural Economic Vitalization Act provides a mechanism to restore our public lands while providing economic opportunities. This legislation will benefit the American taxpayer while simultaneously protecting our environment.
Learn more about REVA HERE.   
Equal Protection Under Law
Religion should not be used as a legal justification for discrimination. I am proud to cosponsor the Do No Harm Act, H.R. 3222, to ensure that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) can no longer be misused to allow discrimination. The Do No Harm Act simply clarifies that the RFRA is intended to protect religious freedom without allowing the infliction of harm on other people. The bill will ensure that laws such as the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Violence Against Women Act, are able to provide equal protection to all Americans, as they were intended to do. 
Community Advocacy in Washington, D.C.
Girl UP Campaign
Thank you to the local members of Girl Up Campaign who visited my office to share their inspirational stories about their volunteer work with The UN Foundation to raise awareness about educating girls around the world. Keep up the good work!
￼
RESULTS
RESULTS knows that supporting inspired advocates with training leads to meaningful policy that changes the world. Their work is invaluable in enacting effective health, nutrition and education programs, and I enjoyed catching up with the Washington state chapter members during their visit to Washington, D.C. for an update on their efforts.
￼
Borgen Project
It was great to sit down with The Borgen Project for an update on their work to eliminate extreme poverty and to discuss the path forward on the Economic Growth and Development Act, bipartisan legislation I have introduced to promote efficient and effective use of foreign assistance dollars. Development and diplomacy are both cornerstones of our national security, and as Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Committee, I will continue to advocate for robust funding for our International Affairs Budget.
￼
Thank you for staying engaged. Hearing from you with your questions, comments and concerns is incredibly important. Please continue to reach out to my offices in both Washington, D.C. and Renton, and follow me on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to stay updated on my work as your representative.

Dear Lindsey,
It's good to be back in Oklahoma for the August district work period.
I was glad to speak with Dave Morris at NewsOK yesterday. I caught him up to speed on things as we discussed several issues including the MAVNI program, immigration, the debt ceiling, and my opposition to privatizing our nation's air traffic control system.
As always, it is an honor to continue to serve the country and the people of Oklahoma.
 
With respect,
Steve

8/4/17 17:35,Listening to the People I Serve,"News from Representative Tom Emmer
￼
Dear Friend,
The month of August is a district work period for me and my colleagues, so this week I took full advantage of my time here in Minnesota by meeting with folks from all over the state. I am thankful to have the chance to listen to the people I serve and hear their opinions about the direction of our state and nation. 
I had the opportunity to visit the Minnesota Veterans Home to chat with residents and thank the staff for taking such great care of our nation’s heroes…
￼
I toured Sherco in Becker to see firsthand energy production in our state…
￼
I spoke on a panel about empowering women entrepreneurs at the Women 2 Women event…
￼
And I attended National Night Out in Buffalo, an event that strengthens ties between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve.
￼
Finding Solutions to the Skills Gap Crisis
Since coming to Congress, I have toured many educational institutions to learn all about the incredible career and technical programs offered. Additionally, I have met with many business owners, school leaders, and representatives from different industries to learn about the devastating impact the skills gap is having on our economy and workforce. That’s why this week, I held an “Addressing the Skills Gap Summit” with educators, business owners and community leaders to discuss potential solutions to the skills gap crisis facing Minnesota, and the nation as a whole.
One of the biggest falsehoods that we as a society are telling the generation of tomorrow is that they must attend a four-year university if they expect to thrive and prosper. This well-intended but misinformed advice has actually had the opposite effect, leaving many critical jobs unfilled and numerous Americans without the career skills that they need in order to drive our economy forward. We held this summit to address these concerns, and cultivate a conversation with the stakeholders who are – and must be – most involved in finding solutions. After listening to the different conversations and suggestions put forth, I am optimistic that we are well on our way to fixing this problem so we can get our workforce and economy back on track.
￼
￼
Giving Our Farmers a Voice
On Thursday, I attended Minnesota Farmfest to participate in a listening session hosted by House Ag Committee Chairman Mike Conaway. The purpose of this listening session was to hear firsthand the different perspectives and concerns of Minnesota’s farmers and agriculture industry in regards to the next farm bill.
￼
Minnesota’s farmers work hard seven days a week, 365 days a year, so that our state, and nation remains fueled and well-fed. Without their work and dedication, we would not have a future, which is why it is imperative that my colleagues and I hear their input and give them a voice in Congress. I am proud to have had the opportunity to participate in this Farmfest listening session hosted by Chairman Conaway and see so many of our colleagues in the great state of Minnesota for this important conversation. I am now even more optimistic that the next farm bill is well on its way to reflecting our farmer’s needs so we can provide for them, as they provide for us.
￼
Don’t Miss Out…
Fall is right around the corner, which means that my office is currently looking to hire interns for the fall semester. Our internships offer students in college a firsthand look into the inner workings of our nation’s Capital and the legislative branch. If you are interested – don’t wait - apply here today!
￼
(Summer of 2017 interns)
Once again, thanks for staying up to date with the work I am doing for Minnesota’s Sixth District. Until next week…
Sincerely,  ￼

Senate okays more CW permits
The Senate passed my bill making 350 more CW foreign worker permits available for fiscal year 2017 on top of the existing 12,998 permits. H.R. 339 also puts more money into the fund for training U.S. workers for jobs in the Marianas economy and bars future use of CW permits for temporary construction workers. The surge of construction workers using CW permits (3,443 in FY16) forced hospital nurses to leave the Marianas and many local businesses to lose their long-time foreign workers. My bill prevents that from repeating. And an unlimited number of workers for construction projects can be hired using the H2B visa.

Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Maria Cantwell (D-Washington) amended the bill, setting the number of extra permits at 350 and setting aside at least 60 for healthcare workers and at least 10 for power plant operators — two occupations critical to public safety in the Marianas. Getting more CW permits and setting aside some for the most important jobs were policies that the Commonwealth government and the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation asked for. Also important is adding more money to the $9.9 million the Commonwealth has already received to train local workers. According to the Government Accountability Office, between 2010, when the CW program went into effect, and 2015, 1,182 U.S. workers joined the Marianas labor force. Because the bill was amended, the House must now approve it again before it goes to the President for signature into law.



￼



$736K to prevent youth suicide
The Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation is receiving $735,699 in federal funds for programs to prevent youth suicide. The discretionary grant, awarded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, is intended to touch the lives of young people affected by alcohol and drug addictions. CHCC is one of about 800 state and local governments, hospitals, universities and colleges, and nonprofit groups expected to get the grant this year. The five-year award — from fiscal year 2017 to 2022 — does not require a match from the Commonwealth government. Congratulations, CHCC.



Gates Scholarships will continue
Gates Millennium Scholarships have changed the lives of young people in the Marianas and throughout America, since Bill and Melinda Gates began the program in 1999 with a $1 billion donation. In the class of 2016 alone, eleven students from the Marianas won the full tuition scholarships to college. One of our GMS scholars, Chelsea King is studying at Stanford and updated me on the future of the program. Chelsea was kind enough to allow me to share her note with you: 
Dear Congressman Sablan,    I know you have been concerned about the end of the Gates Millennium Scholars program, a scholarship that has meant so much to my persistence and retention at Stanford University and to so many other students from the Marianas.    I am very delighted to report to you that there is a new scholarship program offered by Bill Gates, but it simply takes a different name: The Gates Scholarship. This scholarship fund is more competitive than the Gates Millennium, given that it only selects 300 students instead of 1,000. Nonetheless, it is still an opportunity.     The description of the program is as follows:     ""The Gates Scholarship is a highly selective, full scholarship for exceptional, Pell-eligible, minority, high school seniors. Starting in 2018, the scholarship will be awarded to 300 top student leaders each year with the intent of promoting their academic excellence through college graduation, and providing them the opportunity to reach their full potential.""    Eligibility requirements meet the same exact criteria as the Gates Millennium Scholarship. More information can be found at the following website: https://www.thegatesscholarship.org/scholarship.    I hope you will be able to spread the word to others in the Marianas. My Gates Scholarship has meant so much to me and I would like students from our islands to know that this wonderful opportunity continues.                                                          — Chelsea Arlene Medina King
Chelsea, we are spreading the word! Thanks for the update.

National eyes on shark fin bill
“Now, in the nick of time, bipartisan groups of Senators and Representatives are pursuing life-saving legislation to prohibit the import, export and trade in shark fins,” wrote the heads of The Humane Society and Sea World in Newsweek this week. They are supporting the legislation I authored based on the Commonwealth law that bans the commercial shark fin trade. The Marianas were the first U.S. insular area to end the trade. Guam and American Samoa followed our lead. Eleven states also now have laws on the books. House Foreign Affairs Chairman Rep. Ed Royce (R-California) and I introduced H.R. 1456 when Congress opened in January and already we have 147 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. Thanks to the Humane Society and Sea World for supporting my bill. And kudos to former Lt. Governor and Speaker of the House Diego T. Benavente, who wrote the Marianas law and whose work we are building upon.



￼
At the invitation of Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah), I accompanied him and five other Members (Alan Lowenthal (D-California), Jenniffer González-Colón (R-Puerto Rico), Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen (R-American Samoa), and Paul Gosar (R-Arizona)) on a Congressional Delegation to Germany, Lithuania, and Norway this week to explore the relationship between energy markets and the geopolitical stability and security of Europe. Above, the CODEL wraps up a meeting with Members of Lithuania's Parliament.

Internships for Pacific Islanders
The Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies (APAICS) is offering fall internships to learn about legislative work in Washington, D.C. The program is twelve weeks long and interns are assigned to congressional offices or federal agencies. There is a $3,750 stipend and a round trip ticket to DC. Housing is not included. The program helps interns develop political involvement and leadership skills. Students currently enrolled in college and recent graduates are eligible to apply. They must be of 18 years by September 1, 2017. A cover letter, resume, and writing sample are required. An official transcript and two letters of recommendation are needed as well. The deadline is August 11, 2017. For more information, go to http://apaics.org/fall-internship/.

Dear Friend,
This was a great week for our veterans. The Senate approved three major VA reform bills and confirmed six qualified, exceptional nominees to serve at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals.
￼
You can read a little more about each accomplishment below:
Critical Funding for Veterans Choice
On Tuesday, the Senate passed my VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017, legislation to allow the VA to continue the Veterans Choice Program and strengthen VA care. This legislation ensures that veterans will not lose access to community-based health care providers. After passing the U.S. House on July 28, this bill now heads to the president's desk for his signature.
￼
Updating the VA’s Appeals Process
Also on Tuesday, the Senate passed another bill I introduced, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, to improve efficiency and reduce wait times for veterans who are appealing a decision on their VA benefits claims. Following Senate passage, the measure heads back to the U.S. House for a vote on final passage.
￼
#ForeverGIBill Approved
On Wednesday, the Senate approved the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017. I introduced this legislation to make much-needed updates to the post-9/11 G.I. Bill. There are 1.1 million individuals using VA education benefits each year, and they would all be helped in some way by this legislation, with even more veterans gaining eligibility due to this bill. Among other improvements, it removes the 15-year deadline for veterans to use their G.I. Bill benefits. It now heads to the president's desk for his signature.
￼
VA Nominees Confirmed
Finally, on Thursday, the Senate confirmed six outstanding nominees to serve at the VA and the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. Read more about these nominees, including our staff director in the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Tom Bowman, who was confirmed as deputy secretary at the VA, here.
￼
I am extremely proud to be a member of a Senate that values our veterans' service and sacrifice and is working so diligently on their behalf. The Senate passage of these important bipartisan bills will improve many aspects of the care, support and benefits that our veterans receive at the VA.
This week in the Senate
	•	I applauded $141.5 million in federal funding for a new Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory Campus at the U.S. National Poultry Research Center in Athens, Ga. The $141.5 million grant, awarded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service, will support the design and construction services for the new campus.
	•	I introduced bipartisan legislation that would help stop the scourge of online sex trafficking and help victims of this crime. The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act of 2017 would ensure that operators of websites who knowingly facilitate sex trafficking can be held liable, and that victims can pursue legal recourse in their struggle for justice.
	•	The Senate confirmed Christopher Wray of Georgia to be director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 92-5. Prior to the vote, I spoke on the Senate floor urging my colleagues to support Wray.
	•	The Senate passed legislation that would ensure the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the necessary resources to review new medical treatments while making needed changes to the drug approval process to bring lifesaving drugs and products to the market more quickly. It included provisions on over-the-counter hearing aids, patient safety, and access measures that I previously introduced in the Senate. 
	•	I was also pleased to see the Senate pass the Right to Try Act, legislation I cosponsored to expand access to experimental treatments for patients facing life-threatening medical conditions. 
	•	President Trump signed legislation into law that places mandatory financial sanctions on Iran, Russia and North Korea to increase pressure on and hold each of these countries accountable for aggressive actions toward the United States and its allies.
What’s on Tap?
The Senate is adjourned for the August state work period. I look forward to seeing many of you in Georgia over the next few weeks.
Sincerely, ￼
In Case You Missed It

￼ 

Continued Working to Combat the Substance Misuse Crisis 
On Thursday, the Washington Post reported comments from President Trump about New Hampshire and the opioid crisis that were disgusting and wrong. New Hampshire and states across America have a substance misuse crisis, and to date, the President has proposed policies that would severely set back our efforts to combat this epidemic. I urge the President to stop insulting people in the throes of addiction and join us in working across party lines to actually stem the tide of this crisis. 
Also on Thursday, the bipartisan Opioid Addiction Risk Transparency Act, which I authored with Senator Todd Young (R-IN), passed the U.S. Senate as part of the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization bill that is now heading to the President’s desk for signature. The legislation will help ensure that doctors understand that all opioids – even ones that are called “abuse deterrent” – are addictive. 
Earlier in the week, the White House Opioids Commission released its interim report, which included a number of recommendations that I have long supported, including boosting treatment capacity, requiring more prescriber education, and strengthening access to Medication-Assisted Treatment. This report, however, must be more than just words on a page. We need quick action and real resources to equal the urgency of this crisis. 
In partnership with Senator Shaheen, I also met with Chuck Rosenberg, Acting Administrator at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and implored him to reduce the amount of opioid pills allowed to be manufactured and sold in the United States in 2018. On Friday, the DEA announced a proposal to reduce opioid quotas for a second year in a row.   

Strengthened Veterans’ Access to Healthcare by Supporting the Extension of the Veterans Choice Program 
This week, the Senate passed an extension of the Veterans Choice program, which will help prevent an immediate funding crisis for the program while also building on my efforts to address the chronic workforce shortages at the Department of Veterans Affairs. However, it is also critical that we address concerns that constituents have raised with my office, including apparent delays in scheduling, services, and payments. New Hampshire veterans face unique challenges given our lack of a full-service VA hospital, and I will continue working across party lines to ensure that our veterans get the care they need and have earned. 

Introduced the AIRWAVES Act to Support Wireless Innovation and Close the Urban-Rural Divide 
So many of the wireless services we depend on – from telehealth to wireless phone service to Wi-Fi – require the use of spectrum, which is a finite resource. That is why I joined with Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) to introduce the Advancing Innovation and Reinvigorating Widespread Access to Viable Electromagnetic Spectrum (AIRWAVES) Act. This common-sense, bipartisan bill will help ensure that there is an adequate supply of spectrum for licensed and unlicensed use, which in turn will enhance wireless services to our people, stimulate our economy, and spur innovation. The bill also makes meaningful investments in rural broadband infrastructure in places like New Hampshire. 
The bill has received widespread praise across industries and political lines. Read more here. 

Worked to Decrease the National Deficit by Helping to Introduce Legislation to End Taxpayer Subsidies for Big Oil 
Also this week, I helped introduce the Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act of 2017, which would repeal tax subsidies for the ""Big 5"" oil companies and shift the $22 billion in savings over the next ten years toward deficit reduction. 
Hard-working families – not big oil companies – deserve tax relief so that they can get ahead and stay ahead, and this legislation ensures that we are prioritizing the interests of everyday Americans over the interests of those big oil companies. 

Urged the President to Continue Taking Action to Confront Threats from Russia, Iran, and North Korea 
On Wednesday, the President signed legislation imposing further sanctions on Russia, Iran, and North Korea. These sanctions help make clear to these regimes that we will hold them accountable for their actions. We simply cannot tolerate Russia’s shameless attacks on the foundation of our democracy, Iran’s ballistic missile program and support for terrorism, or North Korea’s destabilizing actions and nuclear program. While this legislation is an important first step, it must be followed by continued action to hold these regimes accountable for their actions. 

Visited Sandbox CoLABorative to Highlight Importance of Supporting Innovative Entrepreneurs 
￼ 
The day before Startup Day Across America, I visited Sandbox ColLABorative, a research and development lab of strategy and innovation at Southern New Hampshire University that supports innovative ed-tech starts ups and entrepreneurs who are creating good jobs and moving our economy forward. Sandbox CoLABorative is an important piece of New Hampshire’s entrepreneurial ecosystem that contributes to our state’s economy, and it was a pleasure to visit. 
In addition to supporting these labs, we must also do more to help relieve the student debt burden that can prevent innovative entrepreneurs from launching new businesses. That’s why the first bill I introduced was the Reigniting Opportunity for Innovators (ROI) Act, which would help provide the relief necessary for entrepreneurs – like those at Sandbox CoLABorative – to start up and grow innovative small businesses.

Dear Friend,
The opioid epidemic is a plague tearing across the country. It is fueled by illicit drugs pouring over our southern border in unprecedented amounts and has shown no signs of stopping. Law enforcement and first responders are stretched thin dealing with overdoses and the collateral damage each one causes. Prevention and recovery experts are overburdened as well, desperately working to mitigate opioid addiction from escalating into more untimely death.
That is why I recently introduced the Border Protection Fund Act. This legislation would take funds seized from cartels through asset forfeiture and divide them equally toward two essential goals. Fifty percent of the funds would go toward border security, including barriers, electronic-smart fencing, and overtime pay for law enforcement. The other fifty percent would go toward programs to combat the opioid epidemic conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services. This policy would hit cartels where it hurts most: their pocketbooks. Funds seized from cartels should be used to counteract the grievous damage they have inflicted on our citizens.

Cambria County Association for the Blind and Handicapped
Earlier this week, I had a chance to sit down with employees of the Cambria County Association for the Blind and Handicapped and listen to their feedback about regulations affecting the Association's projects. Fun fact: many of the products produced at CCABH are used to keep our coal miners safe.

Thank you to the staff at Corsa Coal Company for the briefing and tour of the Acosta Mine.The newly opened mine in Somerset County will provide 70-100 new family sustaining jobs and critical raw materials used in the steel making process. Going underground with the miners provides tremendous insight into remarkable individuals and a classic American industry.

Dear Friend,
This past Tuesday I was honored to attend the Modesto Police Department’s National Night Out – an event designed to heighten crime and drug prevention awareness and provide an opportunity to promote and celebrate police-community partnerships in crime prevention efforts. Not surprisingly, Modesto’s National Night Out is ranked 1st in California and 5th in the county! Thank you to everyone who came out in the heat to join the Modesto Police Department and the nearly 200 block parties throughout Modesto to bring the community together.

Human Trafficking Roundtable Wednesday afternoon I gathered community leaders to discuss the human trafficking epidemic in the Central Valley, what we can do to put an end to this malicious practice, and how we can support victims. This crisis is especially prevalent in California, and it was eye-opening to hear from our local law enforcement, public attorneys, and victim advocacy groups like the local Without Permission organization. There was overwhelming consensus on the need to impose more effective punishments on the traffickers and buyers, bolster law enforcement resources, improve services to traditional and non-traditional victims alike, and increase public awareness. Following the meeting, we all gathered for a quick Facebook Live to debrief, which you can view here or by clicking the image below.
As a father, I cannot imagine the horror families go through; I will continue to bring together key stakeholders to further information sharing that is vital to stamping out these heinous crimes and bringing justice to victims. As a member of our community, you can help by staying vigilant and reporting suspected trafficking to the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888. And as always for emergency situations, dial 911.
￼
Golden Valley Health Center Ribbon Cutting This week I was proud to join the doctors and administrators at the grand opening of the newest Golden Valley Health Center in Turlock, which takes us a step closer to serving the healthcare needs of those in our community. Like many rural areas around the country, we have struggled for years with doctor shortages, and I have recently authored two bills that will help address this, particularly here in the Central Valley. The ACCESS Act will field test the most effective ways to increase the number of doctors willing to accept Medicaid patients by increasing our reimbursement rates, which right now are 48th out of 50th in the country. Additionally, my CARE Act will expand the number of new physician residencies in rural and medically underserved areas like the Central Valley. Since doctors tend to settle down in the communities where they complete their residencies, it makes sense to bring more of those into our community. I have also joined my colleagues in the Problem Solvers Caucus to develop a truly bipartisan solution to our current healthcare policy debate and look forward to continuing those discussions with my colleagues in September. To follow what I’m doing to help improve access to care in our community, visit Denham.house.gov/healthcare.
￼
Capturing our Veterans’ Stories for the Library of Congress My team and I recently began gathering stories from our local vets for the Library of Congress’ Veterans History Project. Housed under the American Folklife Center, the project intends to collect, preserve and makes accessible the personal accounts of American war veterans so that future generations may hear directly from veterans and better understand the realities of war. This week, I had the honor of interviewing several veterans in our community, including Korean War Veteran, Roy Haury, who you may remember received his brother’s Purple Heart at the World War II Memorial in April. I proud to be able to catalogue some of these stories and look forward to sharing some of them with you online soon. To learn more about the Veterans History Project, click here.

#TN7

It was so good to hear from so many of you and answer your questions as I attended events in around the district this week. Here are some highlights:
￼
In Columbia we had a great turnout for the Maury County Chamber and Rotary “Eggs and Issues” breakfast – over 100 in attendance! 
￼
In Lawrence County, I had the opportunity to discuss rural broadband, health care, and the REAL numbers behind the “Affordable Care Act” with NFIB members and county leaders. 
￼
In addition to meeting with the Lewis County Chamber of Commerce and Tea Party, I was honored to help announce that the Tennessee College of Applied Technology is receiving a $50,000 Rural Development Grant.
￼
I joined a great group of moms and businesswomen to talk about our hopes for the nation and the issues of the day. 
￼
Even though I was in Tennessee this week, some of you made your way to the Nation’s capital and took the time to stop by my DC office. We hope your trip to Washington was enjoyable. Come back anytime, you are always welcome. 
 
Can you hear me now? 

As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee I have worked to help lower drug costs and bring new treatments and innovative medical devices to patients everywhere. This week the Senate passed the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid bill that I authored along with Congressman Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts. This landmark bill moved forward as part of our FDA Reauthorization Act with strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. We look forward to the President signing this legislation into law next week.
In some big news for our district and Tennesseans across the state working in or connected to the Health Care Technology industry: the FDA announced they are implementing my SOFTWARE ACT in a new program. This will change the regulations for digital health products—like apps—to let patients take a more active role in their own health care. You will remember that the bill was included with the passage of our bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act and signed into law last December by President Obama.

What's next? 

Health Care
As I travel around our district and hear from you, I understand your frustration with the lack of action on health care and generally the lack of action from Washington. Though the mainstream media would like you to believe otherwise, there is a lot of good work getting done in Washington. But I share your frustration with the stalled progress in the Senate. I discussed this very issue on a number of shows this week. Click the graphics below to watch the clips.

 Tax Reform
In the House, we are committed to continuing our work on our conservative agenda. Next on the list is tax reform. It has been 31 years since our tax code was last reformed. In the 31 days in August, on my Twitter feed I will be sharing 31 reasons we need to reform our bloated and outdated tax code.
￼
The House, Senate, and White House announced that we are united around a set of commonsense ideas for transformational tax reform. Fairer, simpler, flatter is our goal. Hardworking taxpayers are ready to see some relief from taxes they face from the time they get up to the time they go to bed.

Expanding Education Benefits for Veterans
Rep. Murphy recently voted to expand benefits for veterans under the GI Bill. The update to the GI Bill—which she helped pass in the U.S. House of Representatives—removes the 15-year restriction that is currently in place and will allow service members to utilize education benefits at any time over the course of their lives. The GI Bill helps strengthen our nation by putting millions of veteran families on a path to success. Rep. Murphy is committed to ensuring veterans and service members have access to affordable education. 
￼

Growing Veteran-Owned Small Businesses
Rep. Murphy recently helped introduced the Veteran Small Business Export Promotion Act, which would permanently exempt veteran owned businesses from paying upfront fees associated with the Small Business Administrations's export loan program. The program helps veterans by giving them easier access to capital so that they can fund the export of their businesses’ products overseas. The bipartisan bill will provide a boost to our economy and create jobs, as well as aid service men and women in their transitions to civilian life.

The NDAA sets U.S. defense policy and the budget for the Armed Forces, and included a 2.4 percent pay increase for military service members. Rep. Murphy said she was proud to help ensure the brave men and women in our military are rewarded for their sacrifice and reiterated her commitment to support our service members in her role on the House Armed Services Committee.

Carper's Connection
August 4, 2017
Dear Friends,
Today marks the 227th birthday of the United States Coast Guard. Founded in 1790, the Coast Guard’s 42,000 active duty men and women patrol our country’s tens of thousands of miles of coast and shoreline, stopping criminals and smugglers, securing our maritime ports and keeping our waterways safe for recreational and commercial ships alike.
The Coast Guard plays a vital role in Delaware. Along our nearly 400 miles of shoreline, the Coast Guard are the ‘cops on the beat,’ conducting security patrols, leading search and rescue operations, and always preparing for national defense. At the Port of Wilmington, the Coast Guard partners with Customs and Border Patrol to inspect ships and keep traffic running smoothly so the port can continue to move six million tons of goods through the First State each year and support tens of thousands of regional jobs.
￼
Last week, I visited the Port of Wilmington to meet with our Coast Guard sector leadership and climb aboard the Coast Guard’s new Fast Response Cutter (FRC) ROLLIN FRITCH, named after a Coast Guard ‘enlisted hero.’ Together, we toured the ship's decks and discussed with its crew the vital role the Coast Guard plays in maritime security and marine safety. As a former naval flight officer in Vietnam, I used to work with ships and crews just like Rollin Fritch, tracking and reporting enemy ships seeking to infiltrate the shoreline and resupply enemy ground forces. 
The men and women of the Coast Guard have a tough day job. At any moment, they can be called into action for a not-so-routine inspection, to carry out a search and rescue mission, or to support our national defense. On the Rollin Fritch, the ship's crew spends days at a time away from home patrolling our seas. In the Navy, when someone does an exceptionally good job, we say “Bravo Zulu.” So, to the Coast Guard personnel protecting Delaware and serving around the world, I say Happy Birthday, and Bravo Zulu. Keep up the good work.

Dear Friend,
This week we commemorated Startup Day Across America, a chance to recognize the important role startups and entrepreneurs play in our economy. 
Arizona is a great place to start a business. Through our Kyrsten Means Business program, we visit innovative startups that are creating good-paying jobs for Arizonans. At each visit, we hear from entrepreneurs about what they need to successfully create and innovate. We incorporated that feedback into Opportunity for Arizona – our plan to create good-paying jobs, strengthen Arizona’s economy, and ensure businesses have every chance to succeed. 
Our Opportunity for Arizona plan supports startups by cutting unnecessary red tape and increasing access to capital. Our Helping Angels Lead Our Startups, or HALOS Act, makes it easier for angel investor groups to sponsor “demo days” where startups are able share their ideas with business, academic, and investment communities. These early networking opportunities are critical for startups to get feedback on their business ideas and meet potential future investors.
Opportunity for Arizona also works to build global workforce that meets the needs of the businesses of tomorrow. To do that, we need to support and expand STEM education, technical training, community college, and university funding to ensure Arizonans are equipped with the skills and expertise they need for the changing and increasingly global economy.
You can read our full Opportunity for Arizona plan here.
We are honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Arizona families like yours. We always appreciate hearing from you on current topics and issues that are important to you. If there is an issue that concerns you, please let us know by clicking this link or by calling our Phoenix office: 602-956-2285. Be sure to stay connected through our Facebook and Twitter accounts, and let us know how we can be of service.
Sincerely,

Column: Made in America
 

“Made in America.” Whether these three simple words are stitched inside a pair of jeans or splashed in bold letters across a banner outside a local car dealer, they invoke a sense of pride. It’s almost as if a small piece of our national identity has now taken tangible form. 

The same pride rings true in Ohio. Talk to any born-and-raised Ohioans, including me, for very long and you will discover that we love to enjoy Ohio-made products, food, and services. In fact, when you walk into my Congressional office in Washington, D.C., the first thing you notice are the ‘Made in Ohio’ products scattered 360 degrees around the front office. On one shelf sits La Rosa’s pizza sauce, Graeter’s ice cream, Skyline and Gold Star Chili, Montgomery Inn sauce, and even a model Ford car built right here in our great state.

Our American-made products, inventions, and businesses – both big and small – truly become icons of the cities or towns where they are located. They are part of the very fabric, history, and identity of our communities. Equally, the products and companies are shaped by their surroundings and by the men and women who have built them from the ground up.

Southern and southwest Ohio are rich in such success stories. Take GE Aviation’s headquarters, right here in Evendale, Ohio. A walk through the Learning Center takes you through GE Aviation’s timeline back to when it developed the first turbosupercharger for U.S. aircraft during World War I, up through its current experiments to change the trajectory of commercial and military aviation tomorrow. 100 years of flight engine innovation, right here in our backyard -- that’s something special.

Another company with deep Ohio roots is Procter and Gamble. Ending up in Cincinnati by chance, immigrants William Procter and James Gamble partnered together at first with the simple purpose of making ends meet for their families, but then they went on to redefine an entire industry with their consumer products. Today, you can’t go into a grocery store anywhere in the country without seeing a P&G product sitting on a shelf. There’s a sense of pride when you flip over your Crest toothpaste and see “Cincinnati, OH” in small print. 

Unfortunately, too many of these local companies are forced to move their manufacturing plants or headquarters outside of U.S. borders, where growing a business can be cheaper and smarter. When Burger King acquired Tim Horton’s and moved its headquarters to Canada, it could cut as much as $275 million in taxes from its expense sheet – capital that can then be used to reinvest in the company, growing jobs, ideas, and research. 

That’s why, here in the House of Representatives, we’re working on a pro-growth tax reform plan to make it easier for companies to compete, grow, and succeed here in the U.S. Whether you are one person with an idea and the passion to grow that idea into a start-up company, or an established business looking to expand, it’s important that the American economy encourages this growth. This means restoring American competitiveness by lowering our corporate tax rate from the highest in the industrialized world to 20 percent. It means making our tax system simpler and more streamlined, so businesses aren’t spending so much of their valuable time and resources trying to decipher an overly complex tax code. This in turn, helps make it easier to create jobs, raise wages, and expand opportunity for all Americans.  

If you’re skeptical about tax reform, keep in mind the domino effect that comes with policies that are unaffordable for businesses both small and large in America: start-ups can’t afford to start -- and never lift off the ground. Small businesses can’t afford legal fees or taxes -- and close or are bought by a bigger company. Large companies that employ hundreds of thousands of hardworking Americans find better tax rates in another country – and take their ideas and jobs with them.

We want to ensure that American innovation – and American jobs – can thrive right here in Cincinnati, Chillicothe, Portsmouth, Peebles, and elsewhere across our great nation. Because ""Made in America"" is part of who we are.

Dear Friends,
Americans deserve a simpler way to file their taxes and that’s something we can all agree on in Washington. Now that we’ve passed our Budget through the Committee, it heads to the House floor for a vote and will be the vehicle we use to get tax reform done right. It promotes regulatory reform to get the government out of the way in order to allow our free-market economy to thrive.
I share your belief that the U.S. tax system is in dire need of a complete overhaul – the last one occurred 31 years ago. As currently written, the tax code is designed to squeeze dollars from our wages, savings, investments and earnings, placing the burden on the shoulders of hardworking Americans trying to support their families and realize the American dream. This needs to change.
We made sure this Budget paves the way for pro-growth tax reform that will be deficit neutral – this means that our national debt will not be affected. Tax rates will also be reduced so you can keep more of your hard-earned money in your pockets, just as it should be. Small businesses create almost half of all jobs in the United States, and we know the benefits of this all too well in Tennessee. By lowering tax rates for these businesses, employers will be able to grow, hire and support Americans.
Our goal is to ensure most families can file their taxes on a simple form the size of a postcard.  We’re working on ways to lower tax rates for individuals and get the federal government off the backs of businesses.  Reforming the tax code is the best way to let Americans keep more of their money, and force the government to downsize from its current bloated, inefficient and financially unstable state. 
Throughout the entire month of August, the Ways and Means Committee is highlighting 31 reasons for bold, pro-growth tax reform that will allow families to keep their money and spend less time filing forms. Click HERE for more information. This is a once in a generation opportunity we have as Republicans and we’re working with experts, small business owners, and constituents and their families to make sure that we do this right. 
Sincerely,
￼ 
Diane Black
Member of Congress

Dear Friend,








I had the privilege of spending more time with Kentuckians this week to hear their thoughts on health care reform and lay out my vision for a revitalized health insurance market, which we can still achieve by adhering to our conservative principles.
You can learn more about action we can take right away to increase the American people's options and lower their coverage costs in my latest update below, and you can also catch up on my other recent activities!
Dr. Rand Paul Holds Health Care Roundtable in Elizabethtown
I enjoyed meeting with small business owners at the Hardin County Chamber of Commerce in Elizabethtown on Monday to discuss health care reform, including expanding the availability of group insurance through Association Health Plans. 
As I heard from those in attendance, and as I have heard week after week during similar meetings across Kentucky, our small businesses are struggling to find and provide affordable health insurance under Obamacare. 
I remain committed to fixing our health care system, and I will continue speaking out in the Senate to make sure we honor our promises to the American people.
￼
(Dr. Paul Speaks at Health Care Roundtable in Elizabethtown, Kentucky - July 31, 2017)



Dr. Rand Paul: Turning the Power of Big Insurance on Its Head with the Power of the Group
I continued promoting Association Health Plans in my latest piece for The Hill on Tuesday, where I discussed how the Department of Labor can immediately expand access to affordable, high-quality health insurance by revising its rules on group insurance. 
“It is very clear the original language of the law allows for far more wide-reaching groups than the Department of Labor’s bureaucratic rules permit today,” I stated.  “So today, I am calling publicly for what I’ve been working on privately for months: the Department of Labor should revise its rules to allow virtually any group to become a group for insurance purposes.”
You can read my entire op-ed HERE.
I've had the opportunity to speak with President Trump and senior White House officials multiple times on this topic, and I will keep working hard to make this policy change happen.
Dr. Rand Paul Puts Expiration Date on Government Programs with Reintroduced Bill
With our national debt rapidly closing in on $20 trillion, we should, at the very least, acknowledge that government should not automatically fund programs without regard for performance or continued need.
As part of my work to bring fiscal responsibility to the federal government's operations, I recently reintroduced my Legislative Performance Review Act (S. 1583), which requires Congress to regularly review federal programs to either improve them or otherwise consolidate or eliminate duplicative and wasteful efforts.
The legislation places an expiration date on all authorizations in order to force government to properly evaluate results and provide specific reauthorizations for its uses of taxpayer funds. 
According to the Congressional Budget Office in 2016, “On average, over the past decade, about one-fourth of total discretionary appropriations were provided for programs and activities whose explicit authorizations of appropriations had expired.” 
The CBO went on to note that its UAEA report concerning fiscal year 2016 found ""that $310 billion — about one-quarter of discretionary appropriations in 2016 — was provided for programs and activities whose explicit authorization of appropriations had expired and whose appropriations could be identified.”
You can read the Legislative Performance Review Act HERE.
Passing this bill is one of the easiest, most common-sense steps we can take to make Congress a better steward of the American people’s money.  


Dr. Rand Paul: ""'Innocent Until Proven Guilty' is the Bedrock of American Jurisprudence.""
On Wednesday, I condemned the government's abuse of civil asset forfeiture and discussed how my Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration (FAIR) Act would restore the principle of ""innocent until proven guilty"" to our justice system.
“A major problem with civil forfeiture is that it does not reflect the fundamental presumption of innocence that is vital to our nation’s criminal justice system,” I said in a column for Rare.   “The Fifth Amendment protects Americans from being deprived of their property without due process of law, yet civil forfeiture allows the government to take an individual’s property without first proving guilt.”
I cited the example of Russ Caswell, whose motel was targeted for civil forfeiture, to illustrate how the current application of this policy can affect innocent Americans. 
You can learn more about this issue and discover how my legislation would bring much-needed reform HERE.

Media Wrap-Up
This week, I spoke with WKDZ's Alan Watts, WANV's Dave Begley, WVLK's Jack Pattie, and WKYU's Lisa Autry, as well as Joe Pagliarulo, Laura Ingraham, and Sean Hannity.

August 4, 2017
Even though the House is not in session, the work continues, the issues remain and there are some matters for us to catch up on.
New England Community Services
I spent time this week in Dorchester at New England Community Services (NECS), meeting with the organization’s founder and staffers. We talked about the rewards and challenges of their work. This nonprofit organization acts as a resource for young people and their families through clinical assessments, comprehensive family support programs and targeted initiatives. The Mentoring at Risk Kids (MARK) Program is available for young people who are experiencing difficulties in their daily lives. Additional services help children and their families connect with community resources. NECS also offers programming designed specifically for young women, immigrant children and the LGBTQ community. Fitness and sports programs are offered as well as parental support programs. I was impressed with the broad range of services offered and appreciated the time staffers took to share some of their experiences with me. 
St. Mary’s Center
I also visited the St. Mary’s Center for Women and Children in Dorchester. The center offers care and supportive services to hundreds of women and children. Clients have access to emergency housing, educational programming and job training as well as help securing employment and finding affordable housing. Staff operates the Crossroads Family Center, where housing is available for homeless families. The center also operates a food pantry. Additional supportive services are available through St. Mary’s Home, a residential facility designed specifically for pregnant teenagers and young women with small children. The GRLZradio.org initiative is also administered by St. Mary’s Center staff. It gives young women the opportunity to learn about everything that goes into running a radio station. Most importantly, it gives them a powerful outlet for expressing themselves and speaking out on the issues they are most passionate about. St Mary’s Center staffers are working to expand the services currently offered and I talked with them about those efforts. They do important work that helps many needy families and I was impressed by their commitment to giving more people access to their programming. 
Madison Park Development Corporation
Thanks to the Madison Park Development Corporation staff for spending some time with me this week. We talked about the current climate in Washington and its impact on the legislative agenda. I also received an update from officials about economic development projects either underway or in the planning stages. Work is ongoing on a project in Dudley Square that will result in additional affordable housing, retail and commercial space. Madison Park Development Corporation operates Hibernian Hall, sponsoring arts and cultural programming. It’s a vibrant community space. Development is not the only mission of the corporation. Staffers also oversee a variety of programming for young adults. I enjoyed my time, learning about new initiatives and getting updates on established programming. 
Black Box Bill
Last week I re-filed the “Black Box Privacy Protection Act” with Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) to give vehicle owners more control over the information collected through their car or motorcycle’s ""black box"" event data recorder (EDR). The legislation requires manufacturers to notify consumers if an event data recorder is installed in their vehicle, disclose the data collection capabilities, and provide information on how data collected may be used. The legislation also requires manufacturers to give consumers the option of controlling the recording function in future automobiles or motorcycles that are equipped with event data recorders.
Previous versions of this bill placed ownership of the data in the hands of the vehicle owner and required owner permission before the information could be accessed.  Those provisions became law as part of the last transportation authorization bill known as the FAST Act (P.L. 114–94).  While that was a great first step, this makes it clear more consumer disclosure is needed.
Event data recorders, or ""black boxes,"" are installed in vehicles to collect information leading up to an accident. They record factors such as speed and brake application. Many consumers are not aware that this data has the potential of being used against them in civil or criminal proceedings, or by their insurer to increase rates. 
You may have heard about the tragic auto accident involving tennis great Venus Williams.  The information from her black box seems to be playing into reconstructing the accident.  No one is sure how that will end up and the information may well be very helpful in revealing the truth – but shouldn’t YOU know what information your car is recording about you and what control you have over that information?
Under this legislation, all new cars equipped with EDRs would have an option allowing the owner to control the recording function that cannot be restarted without the owner’s consent. For me this is a basic issue of privacy. Consumers should have control of the information collected in their own vehicles. 
Officer Sean Collier Campus Police Recognition Act
 I also re-introduced the “Officer Sean Collier Campus Police Recognition Act of 2017” in memory of MIT Police Officer Sean Collier, who was murdered on April 18, 2013, by those responsible for the tragic bombings at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. I first filed this legislation in 2013.
 My legislation would add campus police officers to the Department of Justice’s Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Program. This federal program provides financial assistance to police officers, firefighters and Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) who are catastrophically injured in the line of duty. If they are killed, the program provides benefits to eligible family members. The legislation adds campus police officers to the list of public safety personnel eligible to receive benefits under this existing federal program. The change would be retroactive to April 15, 2013 – the day of the marathon bombings.
 Officer Collier was a hero who lost his life while doing a job he loved, serving and protecting the MIT community as a member of campus law enforcement. This bill is a small way to honor his memory.  
Behind the Curtain – More House and Trump Administration Actions You Don’t Want to Miss
Here are this week’s additions. If you need to catch up or share with friends, you can find the full list here.
132.     According to July 25, 2017 news reports, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross rejected an Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) recommendation protecting summer flounder stocks. The commission concluded that New Jersey was in violation of a conservation plan for summer flounder (fluke) that was approved by all other impacted states. Now that the Commerce Secretary has overruled the ASMFC, overfishing of summer flounder is a real concern. This will have an impact on many other Atlantic cod species up and down the east coast. That stock has fallen 25% since 2010. If the stock falls another 14% then ASMFC would have to reduce fishing quotas drastically and could institute a moratorium on the fluke stock. If the fishing stock did fall another 14%, rebuilding it will not be easy.
133.     On August 1, 2017, the New York Times reported on a Department of Justice (DOJ) memo recruiting attorneys for a new project that will seemingly be added to the DOJ front office portfolio. This is the office where political appointees are usually assigned. According to the memo, the new project involves “investigations and possible litigation related to intentional race-based discrimination in college and university admissions”. Staffers will have the authority to investigate institutions of higher learning for evidence that their affirmative action policies discriminate against white applicants. If evidence exists, the DOJ could take action against them. This undermines the real need for diversity on college campuses and in fact may cause university leaders to reduce efforts to increase diversity. The suggestion that this project will be placed in the hands of political appointees freezes out the DOJ’s Educational Opportunities Section where career staffers are responsible for issues involving educational institutions. By pursuing this path, the DOJ is effectively abdicating its responsibility to actually defend affirmative action policies.
134.     As of the end of July 2017, more than $21 million taxpayer dollars were spent on President Trump’s travel. To put it in perspective, if this pace continues, Trump will spend more on travel in one year than President Obama did in 8 years. The Coast Guard also spent almost $18 million between October of 2016 and March of 2017 due to the President’s travel schedule. The Coast Guard is one of the many federal agencies that the Trump Administration thinks is overfunded. His current budget proposal cuts Coast Guard funding by 14%. The President is already provided with taxpayer funded lodging at the White House, a facility he recently described as a “real dump” according to a Sports Illustrated report on his golfing. Despite this unfortunate characterization of the White House, it certainly seems unfair for taxpayers to cover these duplicate costs at non-federal properties. 
A Note to Readers
We hope you are finding Behind the Curtain useful. We are working hard to keep up with all actions taking place in Washington - but we know there will plenty of items we miss.  That becomes truer every day as the Trump Administration takes more control of our government and gets even better at distracting tactics like “Hey, pay attention to my inflammatory Tweet while my administration quietly eviscerates the Consumer Financial Protection Board - it won’t hurt a bit if you miss it.”
WE NEED YOU!  Let us know if you are aware of anything we don’t have in Behind the Curtain that you think belongs on the list. We know we can’t include everything, but we really don’t want to miss important actions that impact large numbers of people.  If you think you have an entry, please contact us by calling 617-621-6208, emailing us, posting on our facebook page, or send us a message on twitter.

Quite a Week for Our Nations Veterans
Last week was quite a week for our nations veterans!
The House started the week by approving the Forever GI Bill and seven other bills to improve the lives of Americas veterans and their families. At the same time, the House was working to approve legislation to continue the very valuable Choice Program while we work to create a stronger, more integrated Veterans Administration health care system.  The bipartisan agreement to extend Choice funding for six months also authorized 28 major medical facility leases and enhanced the recruitment, retention and training of the VA workforce.
This package includes provisions that double down on our investment in VA by building their capacity to hire and recruit the best providers to care for veterans. We must always ensure that veterans have access to the very best health care available, and we will continue to come together to deliver the results veterans deserve.
As I previously reported, we also passed the Appropriations Committees National Security package including the highest level of funding ever for veterans programs!  You can get details of the veterans portion of H.R. 3219 here.
Heres a rundown of some of the other bills we passed to support our veterans:
S. 114: The Department of Veterans Affairs Bonus Transparency Act
S. 114 provides $2.1 billion to continue the Choice Program for six months while Congress works on other reforms to the Choice Program. It would also authorize 28 major medical facility leases and enhance the recruitment, retention and training of the VA workforce. Click here for more information.
H.R. 3218, the Forever GI Bill
Also known as the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, the Forever GI Bill would remove time restrictions to use the GI Bill, enabling future eligible recipients to use their GI bill benefits for their entire lives, as opposed to the current 15-year timeline. You can access a fact sheet on the Forever GI Bill here.
H.R. 2772: The VA Senior Executive Accountability Act
The VA Senior Executive Accountability Act, introduced by Rep. Taylor, will improve transparency by requiring VA to inform Congress about where senior executives are being moved. Click here for more information.
H.R. 3262: Physician Assistant Employment and Education Act
The Physician Assistant Employment and Education Act, introduced by Rep. Kuster, would direct VA to carry out the Grow Our Own Directive or G.O.O.D. pilot program to provide educational assistance to certain former members of the Armed Forces with medical or military health experience for education and training as VA physician assistants. Click here for more information.
H.R. 95: Veterans Access to Child Care Act
The Veterans Access to Child Care Act, introduced by Rep. Brownley, requires VA to carry out a pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of providing child care services for veterans receiving mental health services and other intensive health care services. Click here for more information. 
There is no doubt that the VA faces numerous challenges in providing quality and timely access to health care and benefits.  But Congress continues to provide the funding and the reforms which will allow our new VA Secretary, Dr. David Shulkin, to continue to transform the VA into a modern 21sth Century service organization that provides for the men and women who have earned our support.
A Navy Seals Perspective: Worth a Read

Listening Tour Continues: National Night Out Morris County
It was great to attend Morris Countys award-winning National Night Out events on Tuesday.  Hosted by the Morris County Park Police and the Morris County Park Commission, this years county-wide National Night Out, drew thousands of residents and visitors.  Its a great event.  In fact, each year since 2002, the Morris County version at Mennen Sports Arena has been a National Award Winner.
National Night Out is an annual community-building campaign that promotes police-community partnerships and neighborhood camaraderie to make our neighborhoods safer. National Night Out enhances the relationship between neighbors and law enforcement while bringing back a true sense of community.
Calling All High School Students Coders: 2017 App Challenge is Underway
Our annual Congressional App Challenge for high school students in the 11th Congressional district is underway!  Its a competition aimed at encouraging students to learn how to code by creating their own applications.
Intended to highlight the value of computer science and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education, the App Challenge gives local students a national platform to display their skills as coders and engineers.  In order to flourish in the rapidly evolving technology economy, we must ensure our students are exposed to the importance of STEM education and real world applications of their knowledge.
The Congressional App Challenge will last until November 1, 2017, and is open to all U.S. high school students in New Jerseys 11th Congressional District. Challenge participants are invited, either as individuals or as teams, to create and submit their own software application (app) for mobile, tablet, or other computing devices on a platform of their choice. A panel of local computer science professionals will judge the apps, and the winners in each district will have the honor of being recognized by Congress.
I look forward to viewing the submissions of students from our district and urge all students to take advantage of this exceptional opportunity.
More information, including a full list of rules, can be found here: http://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/.
Salute to Wayne Township police officer Adrian Sulejmani as he is honored by Mothers Against Drunk Driving of New Jersey for accruing the most DWI or driving while intoxicated arrests in the Township.

Rep. Johnson took 10 students to meet inventor and high-tech entrepreneur Dr. Lonnie Johnson this week as part of recognizing Startup Day Across America and to introduce young people to the possibilities of working in STEM fields.
 
Dear Friends,
 
The August work period is here, and I want to let you know what I’ve been working on in Washington, D.C. and here in Georgia’s Fourth District. 
 
Before Congress broke for the August work period, I introduced a bill to boost community and economic development in the Southeast, question the President’s hotel lease and its potential violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution and demanded Judiciary hearings over baseless White House attacks on the Department of Justice (DOJ). Attacks of this nature on the independence of the DOJ are not just troubling, they are dangerous and must be addressed head on. 
 
In the district, I’ve hosted a series of business roundtables with local small businesses in DeKalb, Rockdale and upcoming in Gwinnett County to help business owners learn how to do business with the federal government. On Sept. 18, we will culminate the roundtable series with a “Think Tank” event at Georgia Piedmont Technical College in Clarkston. The event is free and open to all business leaders throughout the district who can benefit from informative panel discussions and interactive one-on-one sessions that address specific needs for each business. RSVP here.
 
It has also been a pleasure to recognize healthcare agencies and small businesses in the district for their hard work in moving the Fourth District forward as well as working with our youth to introduce them to entrepreneur, inventor and role model, Dr. Lonnie Johnson, who has turned his success as the inventor of the Super Soaker into a thriving high-tech research lab in Atlanta.

APP CHALLENGE OPEN: I’m excited to announce the opening of this year’s Congressional App Challenge (CAC), an open competition for all K-12 students who reside or attend a school in Georgia's Fourth Congressional District. Read more
 
 
 
URBAN FARMING GRANTS: The U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) recently awarded federal funds to Global Growers Network, Inc. in Stone Mountain. This significant grant was allocated through the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program. The grant will support urban agriculture and community garden projects that help feed families in DeKalb County and bring farm to table. Read more about the farming project here.
 
MEDICARE RX PRICES UPDATE: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has announced that the average basic premium for a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan in 2018 is projected to decline to an estimated $33.50 per month. This represents a decrease of approximately $1.20 below the actual average premium of $34.70 in 2017. Read more

You Belong, You Are Loved
Our nation’s immigrants are the constant reinvigoration of America. By bringing their hopes, courage and determination to succeed to our shores, each generation of newcomers makes America more American.
￼
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi joins the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to introduce the American Hope Act of 2017 to provide a permanent legislative solution to the immigration status of more than 800,000 #DREAMers 
From the start, President Trump has pushed a hateful, senseless anti-immigrant agenda that instills fear in our communities, weakens our nation and dishonors our values. Whether unleashing a deportation force to tear apart families, or threatening the protections of DACA, or backing the tired cruelty of this bill, the Trump Administration continues to choose discrimination over smart policies that strengthen and enrich our nation.
Democrats will continue pushing for comprehensive immigration reform that recognizes and embraces the contributions of immigrant families. We will never stop fighting to ensure that America remains a land of opportunity for those who work hard, abide by our laws and dare to dream.
#ProtectOurDemocracy
The Trump team’s alarming connections and conduct with Russia necessitated stronger sanctions and tougher limits on President Trump’s ability to roll them back. President Trump’s signing statement raises serious questions about whether his Administration intends to follow the law, or whether he will continue to enable and reward Vladimir Putin’s aggression.
The Republican Congress must not permit the Trump White House to wriggle out of its duty to impose these sanctions for Russia’s brazen assault on our democracy. We will demand tough oversight to ensure strong and immediate implementation of the sanctions law.
These strong Russia sanctions must be followed by swift Congressional action to launch the long-overdue outside, independent commission to expose the full extent of the Kremlin’s meddling in our elections and prevent it from ever happening again.  The integrity of our democracy itself is at stake, and Congress has a responsibility to defend it.

My office recently assisted a constituent who lives with disabilities. My constituent applied for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) in the summer of 2014 with the Social Security Administration (SSA). After two years, SSA agreed that he qualified for SSDI based on his disability going back to 2013. However, after waiting for two months following the decision, my constituent still had not received his first payment or retroactive benefits, and he was simultaneously experiencing severe financial hardship. Upon learning of the situation, my staff immediately contacted SSA on behalf of my constituent conveying the details of my constituent’s situation. Shortly thereafter, my constituent began receiving his SSDI benefits and retroactive payment.
Caseworkers in my San Francisco office work to address any problems or concerns you may have with a federal government agency. To submit a Casework Authorization Form, please visit my website.

￼
Congressional Republicans reveal restrictive immigration plan with President’s support  Congressional Republicans unveiled a proposal on Wednesday to drastically reduce immigration to the U.S. by reducing the ability of citizens and permanent residents to bring in family beyond the “nuclear family.”  The proposal also changes the system for new immigrants to a point system that would reward applicants with higher skills, education levels, and English ability. The President voiced his full support for the bill.
+ Sen. John Cornyn has also introduced a $15 billion plan to increase borders security with walls, fences, and border surveillance (cameras, radar, and drones). It would also increase the number of border agents and judges who would assist in clearing the backlog of pending immigration cases—including those of unaccompanied minors. The proposal would tie federal funds to cities’ cooperation with federal authorities, a priority of the administration.
￼
Court ruling a win for Affordable Care Act subsidies  A recent court ruling could make it difficult for House Republicans and the administration to abandon ACA subsidies for 7 million Americans. This comes after a group of 16 state attorneys general (AGs) asked the court for the ability to intervene in a lawsuit that has remained open since the Obama administration. House Republicans sued then-President Obama over the subsidy payments in 2014, and the case has remained open since. The AGs have been granted permission to sue on their states’ behalf to keep the subsidies in place. 
￼
Justice Department investigates discrimination against white college  applicants Justice Department officials are planning to investigate universities over admissions standards and policies they believe may discriminate against white students.
Justice Department announces review of media subpoenas  In a press conference on Friday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions indicated that the Department of Justice would review its policies on subpoenaing news organizations over government leaks. Sessions said the review comes at the request of FBI agents, prosecutors, and investigators. 
Education Secretary kills plan on student loan servicing  Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has dropped efforts to contract with just one firm to handle collection for payments on students loans. The initial proposal was criticized for eliminating competition by creating one student loan company. The Department will instead focus on improving the customer experience for students.
Special Counsel Mueller has impaneled a grand jury in Washington  The Wall Street Journal  and Reuters report that Special Counsel Robert Mueller, appointed to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election, has convened a grand jury and that the jury has issued subpoenas relating to Donald Trump, Jr.’s meeting with a Russian lawyer in the summer of 2016. Normally grand jury proceedings are secret so details remain unclear, but this could mark a significant step in Mr. Mueller’s investigation. 
￼
President Trump signs Russian sanctions bill; voices concerns  While signing the recent Russia, Iran, and North Korea sanctions bill into law, President Trump issued a statement: “While I favor tough measures to punish and deter aggressive and destabilizing behavior by Iran, North Korea, and Russia, this legislation is significantly flawed. In its haste to pass this legislation, the Congress included a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions.” While not particularly important in-and-of itself, the statement could lay the groundwork for the administration to challenge portions of the bill in the future.
￼
EPA will not delay ozone emissions rule  After 16 states launched a lawsuit demanding that EPA curbs on ozone emissions be enforced, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt reversed a previous decision and announced that the EPA would work with states “through the complex designation process.” The rule, first issued in 2015, would lower the amount of ground-level ozone produced by cars and oil refineries to 70 parts per billion from 75. Ozone is widely thought to be linked with asthma and other diseases.
￼
Hackers demonstrate voting machine vulnerability  At DefCon, an annual hacker conference held in Las Vegas, it took hackers two hours to remotely exploit and take over a WinVote electronic polling booth. The same team was able to conduct the same attack from a simple mobile app, without the need for a computer. The demonstration is meant as a reminder of computer vulnerabilities, and allows voting machine producers to make their product more secure.

The Hill Report  A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions Spotlight on Young Leaders
Every summer I have the great pleasure of welcoming some of Texas’ most promising young leaders to Washington, D.C for my Pete Sessions Leadership and Growth Program. This summer I was pleased to have 205 students from 47 different high schools join me and my staff in our nation's capital to get a glimpse into the inner workings of Congress. They had the opportunity to speak with a number of Members of Congress, articulate and craft a debate on current issues in the House, and form lifelong friendships with other future leaders.The students this summer brought an immense amount of ambition and talent to Washington and I wish them all the best in their future endeavors. If you are interested in participating in next year's program, please contact Jacob Durst, at Jacob.Durst@mail.house.gov, or visit my website here. 
In addition to my program, I am also proud to welcome students from the Today Foundation's Texas Leadership Forum participated in the American Leadership Institute. Over the course of the week they spent in D.C., these bright young students met with leaders from the Departments of Defense and State as well as many ranking members of Congress. I am delighted to continue this great tradition and I look forward to next summer’s group.If you would like to learn more about the Today Foundation, click here. 
Here are some pictures of the groups this summer.

8/4/17 15:23,Direct From David: Introducing The RAISE Act," 
￼








President Trump and I have a plan to fix our immigration system.
Our plan is pro-worker.
It creates a skills-based immigration system that will raise wages for American workers and meet the needs of our economy.
Our plan is pro-growth.
It welcomes talented individuals from around the world who wish to come to the United States legally to contribute to our economy. It does not touch temporary work visas regularly used in the agriculture, tourism, and hospitality industries.
Our plan is proven to work.
It is modeled after the Canadian and Australian immigration systems, which have successfully attracted highly skilled workers to their countries.
Click here or on the image below to watch my remarks at the White House.
￼
President Trump campaigned on growing our economy and fixing our legal immigration system, and I'm proud to work with him to fulfill this promise.
Learn more about our plan – the RAISE Act – here.
God Bless,
￼

Texas and Minnesota House Ag Committee Farm Bill Listening Sessions
I am coming off of great House Ag Committee Listening Sessions in Texas and Minnesota. Click the links to read more about each stop. At these stops, we talked to producers, manufacturers and many from the agriculture industry about what they want to see in the 2018 Farm Bill. I will have a lot more to say about these sessions in the near future, but I am bringing a lot of what I heard about cotton, corn, manufacturing and more with me as my team and I embark on our Farm Bill Listening tour across the state.
It is truly an honor to sit on the House Ag Committee, and hearing the stories of those (not just from Kansas) impacted by the farm bill gave each of us a greater appreciation for the work we are beginning!

Before heading home for the August work period, the House voted to fund national security priorities, including money for Department of Defense equipment, personnel, and infrastructure, nuclear defense, care for our veterans, and security in and around the U.S. Capitol. 
Dear Friend,
The primary duty of Congress is to provide for the common defense of the American people. Providing for the security of our homeland and interests abroad are responsibilities I take very seriously. 
That is why I am proud to say that the Make America Secure Appropriations Act (H.R. 3219)  the package of appropriations bills approved in the House at the end of July  delivers on our promise to ensure the safety and security of the American people.
The package provides the fiscal year 2018 funding for the most critical functions of our government by allocating money for the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Energy. It also includes a portion of the funding for the Department of Homeland Security to improve security along our southern border.
As Chairwoman of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I made sure the defense portion of the package will deliver the resources our military needs to restore readiness and begin the long-overdue process of modernization. I am proud to report that the bill will also provide our troops with the best equipment and training, along with a 2.4-percent pay raise.
The package also keeps the promise we made to our veterans to ensure they have access to quality health care close to home when the VAs health care system falls short.  
I commend my colleagues in the House for making national security a priority. The bill now goes to the Senate, where I encourage them to move swiftly to approve it and send it to the Presidents desk for signing. 
Sincerely,
￼

Dear Friend,
Thank you. You called, you advocated, you told your stories, you visited our offices, you wrote, you emailed – and another attempt to take health care away from millions of Americans was defeated on the Senate floor in a dramatic late-night session!
Ever since millions of people took to the streets to raise their voices in January, I’ve known that the resistance against anti-democratic values will continue to have a powerful impact. We all know that more people receiving health care means a healthier America – and a greater America.
I’m ready to work with anyone, Democratic or Republican, who wants to make the Affordable Care Act better without kicking people off their health care. The same goes for working with anyone interested in a budget that prioritizes working Americans with a higher minimum wage, great job training and apprenticeship opportunities, an investment in infrastructure and making sure the economic recovery doesn’t leave hardworking Americans behind.
However, Congress is continuing down a path that doesn’t work for hardworking Americans. As Republicans push for massive increases in defense spending and prioritize a border wall over our crumbling roads, bridges and schools, Democrats will continue to push forward with plans like A Better Deal and The People’s Budget to give every American a fair shot at success.
Keep up the great work and keep in touch as we push back on the bad and move forward wherever and whenever we can.
Thank you, ￼  Mark Pocan
 
DC SPOTLIGHT
Protecting Your Right to Vote
In June, I introduced the Voter Roll Integrity Act (H.R. 3091), which would strengthen voter protections by ensuring that states can no longer purge voter rolls without the knowledge or consent of active and still-eligible voters. This system, called Interstate Cross Check, is all the more crucial given that Republicans—including President Trump’s so-called Election Integrity Commission—push in the opposite direction, making it as hard as possible to cast your ballot. 
Calculating Trump’s GPA
Donald Trump’s presidency has made for unbelievable headlines. How has he fared in other, more important, categories? Watch here as I grade the Trump Administration on its first 6 months.

Military Service Ban
President Trump’s ban on transgender Americans serving in any capacity in the U.S. Military is outrageous and shameful. We ought to show respect and gratitude to all who choose to serve their country. I join with my constituent, retired Col. Sheri Swokowski, in saluting the thousands of patriotic transgender Americans who put their lives on the line for our safety.

Join Me On...
￼ ￼ ￼ ￼


My week in review: Why I voted to protect health care for thousands of North Dakotans 
￼
This is Fran Arusell from Fessenden. Fran and many other North Dakotans reached out to me to share their stories about how the Republican health care bills to repeal the current law would rip away their health care or make it so expensive that they couldn’t afford it. Listening to North Dakotans like Fran, Jennifer, and Anthony, as well as organizations like the North Dakota Hospital Association and North Dakota Medical Association, I strongly opposed the bill because it would have been bad for North Dakotans.
Keep reading to learn more about why I voted against the Republican health care bill – that ultimately didn’t pass, how I have been continuing to monitor and support North Dakota ranchers through the drought, and pushing for needed federal resources for our state. 

Standing up for North Dakotans' Health Care
￼
The Republican health care bill the U.S. Senate voted on last week would have effectively repealed the current health reform law by dismantling core pieces of it and hurting tens of thousands of North Dakotans – it was simply a bad bill. It would have ripped away health coverage from more than 34,000 North Dakotans, raised premiums by an average of $794 per year, and left North Dakota hospitals with $31 million in uncompensated costs – all by 2026. Far too often in Congress, politics dictates legislation, and it needs to stop. Many hoped this bill would pass for political reasons. Instead it failed for the right reason – because it would have hurt our neighbors and communities. Perhaps the failure of this bill is a long overdue wake up call to those on both sides of the aisle that to accomplish results, members of Congress truly need to work together and put partisan politics aside. Republicans and Democrats should be able to join together to pass real, transparent, bipartisan reforms to improve health care for families, as I’ve been working to accomplish. This conversation is long overdue. For years I’ve said the health reform law isn’t perfect, no law ever is. But we can make it work better through needed reforms, and I have many ideas that I’ll keep offering. I’m hopeful there is now an opening for progress. 

Continuing Push for Federal Resources and Support for North Dakota Ranchers Impacted by the Drought 
￼
Since meeting with over 100 ranchers in Bowman last month, I’ve been working closely with top federal officials to make sure they’re providing the relief our producers need. Another important step in that effort happened this week when the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner heeded my call to alert North Dakota ranchers that they are eligible for relief. 
Rising temperatures and grassfires, paired with the costs of hay, water, and forage have pushed tough North Dakota ranchers to the brink – forcing many to make hard decisions about selling cattle they own because the cost of keeping their herd is just too high. Knowing folks are eligible for capital gains tax deferrals is a practical solution that will help make sure ranchers don’t go under because of lasting conditions like this impenetrable drought. 
Read more about this effort in this Adams County Record article, and visit my drought resources webpage for more information and resources, which I’ve compiled to help farmers and ranchers weather this drought. 
 
Helping North Dakota cover costs from Dakota Access pipeline safety efforts
This week, I urged U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions to approve North Dakota’s application to recover a portion of the nearly $40 million that state and local governments in North Dakota spent to keep local residents, protesters, tribes, and workers safe throughout the months-long protests surrounding the Dakota Access pipeline. 
Throughout the many months of the Dakota Access pipeline protests, North Dakota law enforcement worked around the clock to keep folks safe – hoping federal agencies would step in to reinforce their efforts to keep the peace. But for months, no relief came, allowing local tensions and camps to swell as once-strong local relationships frayed, lands were damaged, and local law enforcement struggled. Now that Congress has opened a potential avenue for emergency funding, as I pushed for, it’s time for the Attorney General to make sure the federal government does its part by approving North Dakota’s application for the funding. 
 
Some of my favorites from social media
￼
Leading up to the North Dakota State Fair, I asked folks to send in the best high quality photos they have taken of North Dakota. Based on likes and comments, I selected the top three photos as winners to showcase at my booth at the Fair to celebrate our beautiful state. This photo, taken by Zachary Hargrove near New Salem, is one of the top three winners. Check out my Instagram to see the other winning photos. 
￼
Click here to watch my interview on CNN’s New Day where I reinforced that Congress can work across the aisle and actually get things done, as I’ve always worked to do, if members really want to find solutions. Given the hyperpartisanship, especially over the last few weeks, I can see how folks might not think that’s true. But in this interview, I share a great example of why that’s just not the case. 
￼
Tuesday was Startup Day and a great opportunity to acknowledge the talented entrepreneurs in North Dakota who have helped put our state on the map for innovation. According to the Kaufman Foundation, North Dakota is the state with the third highest startup activity in the country – proving that startups aren’t just in New York or California. After bringing the former Small Business Administrator to North Dakota for the first U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business committee hearing in 2015, I got to work to address some of the challenges local innovators said they had – the main one being early stage funding. That’s what led to my SEED Act – a bill that would help startups in rural states and small cities turn ideas into action by giving them access to the federal funding they need. Click here to watch my pitch for how North Dakota startups would thrive with a bill like my SEED Act.

Conaway Chronicle: San Angelo Farm Bill Listening Session, West Texas Legislative Summit, Town Hall Recap
__________________________________________


Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress and the 11th District. 


San Angelo Farm Bill Listening Session

Agriculture is the lifeblood of Texas, and the stories we heard from farmers and ranchers at the Farm Bill Listening Session in San Angelo this week strike at the heart of why we have a farm bill. The farm bill underpins the entire rural economy – an economy that has been under tremendous strain over the past four years. Improving economic conditions in farm country is instrumental in ensuring that Americans continue to enjoy the safest, most abundant and most affordable food and fiber supply in the world. 

I am grateful to my 7 colleagues who traveled to San Angelo to hear from TX-11: Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Colin Peterson, Vice Chairman GT Thompson, and Reps. Jodey Arrington (TX), Rodney Davis (IL), Roger Marshall (KS), David Rouzer (NC), and Darren Soto (FL). I also want to extend my appreciation for the more than 500 Texas farmers and ranchers who came out to share their stories, and I am eager to take their input back to Washington as we continue crafting the next farm bill. 

If you missed the listening session, you can watch the video here. If you have comments to submit for the record on the 2018 farm bill, you can send them to this email address: HouseAgListens@mail.house.gov. 

￼


West Texas Legislative Summit

On the heels of the Farm Bill listening session, the West Texas Legislative Summit's events on Tuesday allowed us to continue the conversation about what the farm bill means to West Texas. Three of my colleagues were able to stay and attend the summit, taking part in conversations about all things agriculture: the next farm bill, burdensome regulations, commodity prices, and much more. 

A highlight of the summit was a discussion on community engagement with Congress, where we shared tips on how to best communicate your message to Congress and what we can do to help in return. 

￼



Town Hall Recap

Thanks to all who made the trip out to one of my town halls this week in Baird, Breckenridge, and Mineral Wells. We had important conversations about health care, tax reform, the farm bill and many other topics of interest. Town halls are an essential part of my efforts to stay in touch with constituents, and I appreciate everyone taking the time out of their day to participate and have your voice heard.

Longs Short Report  Its August after all, time to staff up not stonewall
By: Rep. Billy Long
After last Novembers election, the incoming Trump administration reached out to me in order to assist in staffing several agencies. Their request was for me to submit names, of both Republicans and Democrats from my district that would be willing to serve our country.
This was a time-consuming effort, as I made lots of calls to individuals to assess what if any interest they may have in working in different agencies. Whether it was the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of Agriculture, etc., I was determined to send names of our areas best and brightest to the President. Job titles from Undersecretary and on down the line were included.
So on July 26th, when I saw on my calendar that I had a morning meeting with HUD Secretary Dr. Ben Carson and a noon meeting with HHS Secretary Dr. Tom Price, I was anxious to see how the staffing process was going and if any 7th District folks were under serious consideration for positions. Dr. Carson shook his head and said: Billy, Im the only Senate confirmed member of my team to this point, then he added (half kidding), one thing about it, Ive had to learn everything about every department myself. At lunch when I posed the same question to Dr. Price, the answer was similar: So far we have three Senate confirmed positions filled, and thats including myself.
President Trump has been in office for over six months, yet many in Washington seem to have a hard time accepting the results of the election. No recent president has had to deal with the type of gridlock President Trump has faced. At this point during President Obamas presidency, he had 228 nominees confirmed. President Bush had 208. How many does President Trump have? Just 60. Thats unacceptable. There are more than 1,200 presidential appointments with Senate confirmation positions to fill, and roughly half are key positions that play an important role for an effective executive branch.
I understand the Senate, just like the House, has procedures that need to be followed to confirm these appointments. However, many Senate Democrats have gone out of their way to make this process longer than it should be and has been for past administrations.
Its time to stop wasting valuable time and get these agencies functioning for the American people. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to work towards quickly confirming President Trumps nominees. The American people deserve better.

Dear Friends,

￼

As I embark on state travel throughout the month of August, I look forward to meeting with constituents and hearing firsthand the successes and challenges happening in communities throughout our great Commonwealth. This August, I will be crisscrossing Pennsylvania visiting senior centers, growing businesses, American Legion posts, county fairs, union halls, towns confronting the opioid crisis, local farms and perhaps a couple of breweries along the way – all to listen to the stories of Pennsylvanians and further enrich my knowledge and inform the decisions I make in Washington as we head into the Fall. I look forward to meeting many of you and seeing the great, diverse communities of Pennsylvania.

See you on the road!

8/4/17 13:52,We Must Preserve Net Neutrality,"￼
August 4, 2017
Dear Friend,
Ensuring a free and open internet is essential for New Mexico businesses and internet users to access broadband on an even playing field. As a staunch supporter of net neutrality, I believe the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) must have strong, enforceable rules. The internet must remain open and conducive to free expression, innovation, and competition, not a tiered system based on financial relationships with internet service providers.
In 2015, the FCC adopted the Open Internet Order, which reclassified broadband as a telecommunication service and prohibited internet service providers from setting up internet fast and slow lanes, ensuring all online traffic is treated the same. But President Trump's FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has proposed gutting those net neutrality protections. Eliminating of the Open Internet Order would prohibit the FCC from adopting other important protections, such as expanding the Lifeline program to broadband, protecting subscribers' broadband privacy, and promoting broadband competition.
Yesterday, I sent a letter to Chairman Pai calling on the FCC to extend its public comment period. The FCC received more than 15 million comments on the FCC's proposal to undo strong net neutrality protections. This incredible volume of comments signals the public's keen interest in this issue. The FCC currently plans to allow only 30 days for reply comments. This is a departure from a similar proceeding in 2014 with when FCC allowed Americans 60 days to submit comments. We must ensure that all voices are heard.
I'd like to thank each of you who submitted comments to the FCC. Your voices matter and can make a major difference. I want to assure you that I'm standing with you. I am a strong believer that innovation is what America does best, and a free and open internet is vital in that endeavor.
Sincerely,
￼

VET Help
￼
I was glad to visit VET Help in Saratoga County. They do important work for our heroes, including providing them with housing, clothing, and food, while ensuring that they live lives of dignity and productivity. In Congress, I've cosponsored bills such as the Housing our Heroes Act, which helps expand supportive housing for veterans. Read more about this legislation here.  
 Saratoga County Veterans Roundtable
￼
Thanks to all who participated in our NY-21 Veterans Roundtable in Saratoga County this week! It was a great discussion on how to ensure our veterans get the care and services they deserve. 
In Congress, I've been proud to support many important initiatives to help our veterans, including introducing the Support Our Military Caregivers Act. This legislation would help better support family members caring for seriously wounded veterans. To read more about my legislation, click here. For coverage of my Veterans Roundtable, click here.
 Herkimer County Economic Development Roundtable
￼
I also hosted an Economic Development Roundtable in Herkimer County this week. I enjoyed the diverse perspectives as we discussed USDA Rural Development Programs, healthcare, infrastructure, broadband access, and invasive species. Let’s continue to make NY-21 a great place to work and do business!
Old Forge Library
 ￼
I had a great time visiting the Old Forge Library, which has been promoting literacy for over 100 years. I was thrilled to be able to donate some books from the Library of Congress. Thanks for a great tour!
Alexandria Bay Port of Entry
￼
This week I also toured the Alexandria Bay Port of Entry, which is one of our country's busiest border crossings with Canada. The economies of the North Country and Canada are closely intertwined, and in Congress, I'll keep working to protect the special relationship with our neighbors to the north.
NTEU Chapter 138
￼
While I was at the Alexandria Bay Port of Entry, I got a chance to sit down with chapter 138 of the National Treasury Employees Union. I'm grateful they took the time to meet with me!
Jefferson County Broadband Roundtable
￼
Increasing access to broadband internet is critical for North Country families and businesses and one of my top economic priorities for the district. I enjoyed hosting a Broadband Roundtable in Watertown Thursday where we discussed the various ways we can increase access to this critical 21st century infrastructure. To read more about our roundtable, click here.
Johnson Lumber Facility
￼
As the daughter of small business owners, it was great to tour the facilities at Johnson Lumber. They've been in business for 40 years and are critical contributors to our North Country economy. I was also happy to hear about their upcoming 20,000 square foot expansion. Thanks for showing me around!
Kruger Hydroelectric Plant
￼
As a supporter of alternative energy sources, I was thrilled to tour the Kruger Hydroelectric Plant today. Every year they produce 63,000 megawatt-hours of clean, renewable energy. In Congress, I supported the HYPE Act, which helps reduce red tape for the creation of clean energy projects like the Kruger plant. Read more about the HYPE Act here.

8/4/17 13:26,The Durbin Report: President Trump Is Threatening Illinois Families By Deliberately Undermining Our Health Care System,"The Durbin Report: A message from Senator Richard J. Durbin
￼ 


The Durbin Report: President Trump Is Threatening Illinois Families By Deliberately Undermining Our Health Care System 
Last week on a bipartisan basis, the United States Senate rejected repeated efforts to rip health care away from tens of millions of Americans, to undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, to raise premiums on older and rural communities, to slash Medicaid funding, all in order to give a tax break to big businesses and wealthy individuals. It was a victory for the country and Illinois families. 
The President of the United States didn’t see it that way. He continues to be obsessed with sabotaging our health care system to score political points at the expense of a lot of innocent Americans. Instead of working with Congress to make our health care system stronger, he's deliberately threatening the well-being of millions of American families.
￼
It’s clear by President Trump’s actions that he wants to sabotage the Affordable Care Act just to watch it implode. On day one of his presidency, he issued an Executive Order instructing federal agencies not to enforce the law, he cut the open enrollment period in half, and he cancelled television and radio ads that educated people about how to enroll for insurance. And even now—after insurance companies, Republican and Democratic Governors, Congress and the American people have urged him to put an end to this sabotage—the President is still threatening to cut off federal funding that helps keep premiums down for working families. Without this funding, premiums will spike, and the President knows it. Don’t just take my word for it: this week, Illinois insurers very clearly indicated that the proposed premium increases for next year are a direct result of actions being taken by the Trump Administration. 
￼
WATCH ME CALL ON PRESIDENT TRUMP TO PUT HIS HEALTH CARE SABOTAGE EFFORTS TO BED
It is well past time for us to get back to regular order with committee meetings, public hearings, and input from experts and the American people. It’s time to put aside the partisanship and work together in an open and fair way to strengthen our health care system for American families across the board.
Sincerely,
U.S. Senator Dick Durbin

 Something special happened in Janesville yesterday—SHINE Medical broke ground on Building One, where they will begin to build prototype machines and train employees. They will produce a medical isotope to assist with treating cancer and other medical conditions, something we currently have to import from other countries. Paul remarked at the groundbreaking:
“Isn’t it kind of crazy that we have to rely on foreign countries to supply us with these medical isotopes . . . why would we want to have to rely on another country to supply something so precious and important as this?”  ""Right here in America, in Janesville, Wisconsin, we will be providing this really crucial medical technology. Right here so we can rely on ourselves.”
Paul also visited Blain’s Farm and Fleet with Secretary Perdue to hear from Blain’s store managers about issues dairy and crop farmers are facing. In case you missed it, here are some highlights:  Janesville Gazette: The event was part of Perdue's ""Back to Our Roots"" tour, a five-state RV journey across the Upper Midwest. Perdue is meeting with farmers and other agriculture industry leaders to gather input on the upcoming 2018 farm bill. Ryan championed the state's connection to farming as he introduced Perdue. “We are America's Dairyland,” Ryan said. “Don't listen to California.”   WMTV: The tour focuses on getting input from people who work in the agriculture business on how policies in Washington could benefit the industry. It's also focused on the 2018 Farm Bill. In his opening remarks, Secretary Perdue said the USDA would work closely with Congress and farmers as it creates the 2018 Farm Bill. Speaker Ryan and Secretary Perdue held a closed question and answer session with employees, getting input on their role as distributors for farmers.   Janesville Gazette: SHINE CEO Greg Piefer told The Gazette on Thursday that SHINE hopes the prototype, which it's calling ""Building One,"" can be completed by the end of 2017, and that SHINE could be using it to test and demonstrate its low-enriched uranium particle accelerator technology “from tip to tail” by early to mid-2018.  *** Ryan called Piefer “dogmatic” and ""tenacious,"" and he said SHINE’s prototype facility is proof of “a concept and an idea coming to fruition” after years of research, development and the at-times daunting processes of private fundraising and federal regulatory approval.  Ryan had scheduled several stops in the area Thursday and Friday. He said he sees SHINE as a company that’s helping Janesville ""lean forward” toward opportunity and innovation and reinvent its economy after the 2008 loss of General Motors.  *** Ryan also praised research programs in Wisconsin’s university and technical college systems, which he said spawn and encourage home-grown companies such as SHINE. The rest of the world is taking note that a Wisconsin startup is trying to bring domestic production of the crucial medical testing drug mo-99 to the U.S., Ryan said.

Week in Review
   
Wayne County Public Forum on Agriculture

Please join us for a community forum focused on Agriculture in Wayne County!  Agriculture is a key driver of Wayne County’s economy, and I’m committed to fighting for policies that will help our local family farms grow and thrive.  As Congress begins its work on the upcoming Farm Bill, it is critical that I take the input of my constituents back to Washington.  I look forward to hearing from our community, and engaging with local farmers and growers at this forum on Tuesday, August 15, at the Wayne County Public Safety Building. More details on the forum can be found here.

Securing Our Northern Border

The Department of Homeland Security recently released an assessment of threats facing our Northern Border. This analysis was authorized by legislation I introduced, which was signed into law last year. The report identifies several areas where we can improve border security – especially in combating drug trafficking and preventing potential acts of terrorism. Stopping the influx of drugs coming into our country through the Northern border is critically important, given the heroin and opioid epidemic plaguing Central New York. I look forward to continuing my work on the Homeland Security Committee to close these capability gaps. You can read the report here.

Legislative Update: Combating Tick-Borne Diseases
 With steady increases in cases of tick-borne illnesses, like Lyme disease and Powassan, in Central and Upstate New York, it is critical that we work to move the ball forward on public health efforts to combat these diseases.  That's why I recently introduced bipartisan legislation to improve public health efforts and to strengthen tick prevention through education and research. The Tick Identification Pilot Program Act of 2017 would educate the general public on general tick-bite prevention methods, engage the public on tick-borne illnesses to improve public health outcomes, and collect data on tick populations.

Bipartisan Legislation to Preserve Brownfields Program Moves Forward in House

I am pleased to announce that the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee recently approved the Brownfields Reauthorization Act of 2017, bipartisan legislation I introduced to preserve and enhance the EPA's Brownfields Program.  Communities across Central New York know all too well the impact of industrial pollution, and have benefited directly from the EPA Brownfields Program. With the approval of this measure by the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee, we are one step closer to ensuring industrial sites in our community and across this country are preserved and revitalized.


Urging FEMA to Declare Lake Ontario Flooding a Federal Disaster

I've joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues to urge the Administration to take action in providing FEMA aid to the many shoreline property owners, businesses, farmers, and municipalities which have been devastated by flooding this year. I’m grateful for Governor Cuomo’s recent request for FEMA assistance for these communities, and reiterated the need for the Administration to act swiftly in approving this aid.

￼

Advocating for Enhanced Mental Health Care, Behavioral Health Services

Glad to be on hand as Syracuse Behavioral Healthcare recently announced its status as a newly certified Community Behavioral Health Center.  When Assemblyman Bill  Magnarelli and I released our bipartisan mental health taskforce report earlier this year, we noted the grave need locally for an increase in mental healthcare and substance abuse treatment centers for young people in our community.  This center will provide that care.  I have and will continue to advocate in Congress for greater resources to bolster treatment and care for those suffering from mental illnesses and substance abuse.

￼

Around Central New York

Excellent news as Nucor Steel announced an investment in its Auburn plant and the people who work there. Nucor has played an integral role in our local economy for years, and I'll continue to fight in Congress against unfair foreign trade practices in the rebar industry and to level the playing field so that local manufacturers like Nucor can grow and thrive.

￼

I recently met with local elected officials and residents in Cayuga County to discuss flooding impacting Moravia and surrounding towns. I applaud the efforts of County and Town officials, volunteers, and first responders who have done tremendous work as they begin repairing damaged infrastructure and re-opening affected roadways. I will continue to work with these folks to ensure that communities impacted receive the vital assistance they need. 

￼

￼

Enjoyed stopping by Novelis in Oswego to see the latest investments in this growing, innovative company. The Scriba plant is a primary supplier of aluminum for automakers like Ford, and provides hundreds of highly technical manufacturing jobs in Oswego County and throughout Central New York. 

￼


Thank you to Michael and Phillip Brady of Fayetteville for meeting with me on behalf of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation to discuss NIH and FDA funding.

Bipartisan Problem Solvers Plan That Would Prevent 2018 Premium Spike and Finally Start Fixing Obamacare Begins to Move Forward
￼
Congressman Dan Lipinski (IL-3) released the following statement today:
With the recent news that 2018 premiums for health insurance in Illinois purchased under the Affordable Care Act (ACA)  also known as Obamacare  will rise as much as 43%, it is time for Congress to finally act to begin to fix the ACA and provide real affordable healthcare.  On Monday, the Problem Solvers Caucus  a bipartisan group of 43 members of the House  announced that they had agreed upon a plan that would alleviate much of the proposed 2018 premium spike, help stabilize the individual market, and create a program that can further lower premiums another 10%.  
Since the release of the agreement, support has been growing across the country.  Newspaper editorial boards including the New York Times and the Washington Post have endorsed the Problem Solvers plan, and many constituents have come up to thank me for this commonsense proposal to make healthcare more affordable.  
We have now begun working on drafting legislation to implement the plan.  Caucus members, including myself, have been in contact with senators from both sides of the aisle who have expressed interest in the Problem Solvers plan.  Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander announced this week that he is going to work with Democrats on bipartisan legislation to accomplish the same goals as the Caucus plan. 
I helped negotiate this compromise plan, which is the first bipartisan effort to begin fixing the ACA.  The purpose of this agreement is not to solve all the issues with the ACA, but to take commonsense steps that will make it work better and help American families right now. 
Some will oppose this plan because it is a compromise, which means no one got everything they wanted.  Others will oppose it because they want the ACA to collapse.  Some partisans in both parties may even believe that if the ACA fails the other side will get blamed in the next election.  But most Americans just want the ACA to be fixed so that they can access affordable healthcare.  They are tired of the status quo in Washington and want their representatives to work together to solve problems like this.  That is what the Problem Solvers Caucus is doing.  
 
Lipinski Introduces Bill to Help Veterans Get Jobs by Entering Apprenticeship and Certification Programs
￼
Congressman Lipinski has introduced H.R. 3492, the Veterans Apprenticeship and Certification Act, to help veterans find the right career after military service and help employers find these qualified, dedicated, and hard-working Americans.  Currently, veterans are not allowed to use their Post-9/11 GI benefits for the tuition and fees associated with participating in an apprenticeship.  Lipinskis bill would change this, greatly helping veterans find a good job and career once they leave military service. 
As a veteran transitions and separates from military service, an apprenticeship can help them bridge the gap between service in the Armed Forces and civilian employment, said Rep. Lipinski.  Apprenticeships offer veterans the opportunity to receive on-the-job training under the direct supervision of a professional as well as classroom instruction.  They also provide veterans the opportunity to demonstrate and transfer the skills they acquired during military service to a civilian career.
 
Lipinski Supports New Sanctions Against Russia, Iran, and North Korea
￼
Rep. Lipinski released the following statement after voting for new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea:
This bipartisan measure sends a strong and clear message to these nations that their continued aggression towards us or our allies will not be tolerated.
Russia is a direct threat to our NATO friends in the Baltics and in Poland, as well as a threat to peace and stability in the entire Western world.  In the recent past, Russia has continued its hostile actions in Ukraine, sought to interfere in elections in the West, deployed treaty-violating nuclear cruise missiles, slaughtered innocent civilians in Syria, and grown increasingly close to Iran.
Despite past agreements, evidence shows that Iran continues to pursue the development and expansion of their military operation.  That and their long record of human rights abuses shows that they have very little interest in relinquishing their status as a state sponsor of terrorism.
In recent months, North Korea has continued to build up and flaunt their illegal nuclear weapons program.  In the face of very real threats to our country, we must close loopholes exploited by the Kim regime, and focus on countries, groups, and individuals that conduct business with North Korea.
This sanctions bill brings reassurance that the United States Congress will not stand by while others attempt to undermine American strength and resolve.  
 
Lipinski Leads Illinois Delegation Against Harmful Budget Caps on Medical Research
￼
Congressman Lipinski - joined by a bipartisan group of representatives from Illinois - is urging the Trump Administration to reconsider a proposed cap in their Fiscal Year 2018 budget on funding for research institutions receiving grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  The cap would significantly reduce cost sharing between the government and these research institutions, including universities, foundations, and private researchers, which would hamper medical research in Illinois and across the country.
Research cannot be conducted without facilities and support staff, yet this is exactly what the Trump Administrations budget request targets, stated Rep. Lipinski.  Illinois is home to many institutions that do important medical research.  This budget would hurt these institutions and result in less research into ways to improve Americans health.   
 
Lipinski Announces $569,674 Grant for Roberts Park Fire Protection District
￼
Rep. Lipinski has announced that the Roberts Park Fire Protection District, which now includes the Village of Justice, has been awarded $569,674 through the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  The grant will help with hiring expenses.  The Village of Justice became part of the Roberts Park Fire Protection District this past April.
It is becoming more and more difficult for local communities to provide the funding needed for fire protection, said Rep. Lipinski.  Im pleased this grant will help the Roberts Park Fire Protection District hire more brave men and women to protect the people of Justice and the surrounding area.

Lindsey,

Last week, we saw democracy at work when the Senate voted against passing the disastrous Republican health care bill. Thanks to people in Oregon and across the country who made their voices heard, the health care of millions was protected.

Political change doesn't come from the top down, it's bottom up. That's why it's so important for members of Congress to get out into the communities they represent and hear directly from their constituents. 

Since I first ran for Congress, I've pledged to hold a town hall meeting in every county in Oregon, every year. I've already held 54 town halls this year, and I'm excited to announce 8 more in the coming week.

Beginning Saturday, I will be holding town hall meetings in Multnomah, Hood River, Columbia, Washington, Marion, Jefferson, and Clackamas counties. Those details are below.

For your easy reference, as I schedule town halls, they are always posted on my website here: https://www.wyden.senate.gov/oregon/events

Looking forward to seeing you at a town hall in the future.

- Ron

August 4, 2017
Lynnwood Today: Own It, Mr. President
A column by U.S. Congressman Rick Larsen (WA-02)
 “Let Obamacare fail…we’ll just let Obamacare fail. We’re not going to own it. I’m not going to own it. I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it.” – President Donald Trump, July 18, 2017

 Own it, Mr. President.    Own the deeply unpopular dumpster fire known as Trumpcare.   Own that you took the helm of an ongoing, seven year disinformation campaign waged against the Affordable Care Act.   And own the fact that Trumpcare failed last week because of you.   But know this: if you drop the attacks on the Affordable Care Act and work with Democrats to improve health care – you will own that too.   Will Democrats agree to erode protections for preexisting conditions or take health care from the sick and elderly so rich folks can get a tax cut? No. That means Trumpcare and repealing the Affordable Care Act are both off the table.   Will Democrats work with Republicans to lower premiums, improve quality and expand access to health care? You bet.   That is how Congress is supposed to work. Sweeping, transformational laws – such as those that created Medicare and Medicaid or launched Social Security – have historically been subject to technical fixes after enactment. The Affordable Care Act is no different: it does not need to be torn out “root and branch;” it needs to be improved.    The American people deserve transparent, bipartisan Congressional action to stabilize the individual health market and maintain the vital consumer protections on which they depend. Democrats continue to be vocal about policies to do just that. For instance:
	•	funding the cost-sharing reduction subsidies that help make health coverage more affordable; 
	•	making permanent federal programs that prevent premiums from spiking, and; 
	•	offering a public option plan alongside private insurers to drive marketplace competition. 
So, own it, Mr. President. Not because anyone tells you to, but for the very reason you suggested in 2013: “leadership – whatever happens, you’re responsible. If it doesn’t happen, you’re responsible.” 
 ￼
The reality is as President of the United States you do not get to decide whether or not you take responsibility for health care in the United States. 
 
No matter what happens – whether you do nothing, take the nightmarishly cynical approach of sabotaging our current system established by the Affordable Care Act, or lead bipartisan efforts to reform health care for the better – you are responsible. 
 
P.S. To everyone who called, wrote, attended forums, or otherwise demonstrated to kill Trumpcare: thank you, and keep it up! Let’s make sure Trumpcare stays dead and work to fix the Affordable Care Act to lower costs, expand access and improve quality.
 
U.S. Congressman Rick Larsen represents Washington’s 2nd Congressional District.
 
Sincerely, ￼ Rick Larsen United States Representative Washington State, 2nd Congressional District

Tracy Shares Her Story: How I Can Help You
￼
Click on the image above to watch Tracy share her story

Dear Friend,

I’d like to share Tracy’s story with you- and she was kind enough to join my team to tell it in her own words. My office can offer a number of services, from tours of the U.S. Capitol or flags flown over the Capitol, to internships and military academy nominations. One of the most important ways we can help is through specifically assisting constituents who are having problems with a federal agency. CLICK on the image above, or here, to watch her video and hear more from Tracy about her story.

Tracy is a service-disabled veteran from right here in the 2nd District. After leaving the Army, she worked at the Veteran’s Benefits Department in St Paul, but unfortunately her service-connected disability became worse, causing her to apply for Disability Retirement.

Tracy’s paperwork was held up by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a year, and her leave without pay was held up by the Veterans Benefits Department too- even requesting a new doctor’s note for the same reason on multiple occasions. Her employer tried to let her go- even though she was in the middle of the appeal process.

After over a year of government red tape, she found my website, www.jasonlewis.house.gov, and discovered that I can help Minnesotans when they are having difficulty with a federal agency. I’m really glad that she came and met with my great team, because if my office can help, we will. 

In this instance, my casework team got a favorable resolution for Tracy in just 30 days. Her disability retirement was granted, and the red tape nightmare was finally over. 

Thank you, Tracy for being willing to tell your story- because that person could be you- or me- or a family member. It could be any one of our veterans, or a relative having trouble with the Social Security Administration, or a neighbor who can’t get a straight answer from the IRS. 

Please call my office or come see us if you are experiencing difficulty with a federal agency. Again, anything we can do, we will do. That’s one of the most important ways I can serve you as your Representative. The number is 651-846-2120 and our address is 2805 Cliff Road, Ste 200, Burnsville, MN 55337.
 


Sincerely, 
￼
Jason Lewis

Blaine's Bulletin
  

The opioid epidemic is real and every community across the country is impacted by it. Nationally, 44 American lives are lost each day to prescription opioid abuse and many Missourians have friends, neighbors, or family members who have been impacted by this crisis. 
This week, I traveled throughout the 3rd District and held roundtables with local officials, doctors, and individuals to discuss what more can be done to combat this epidemic. I started in Crystal City where I met with the Jefferson County Sheriff Dave Marshak, the Jefferson County Health Department, doctors and staff from Mercy Hospital Jefferson, and surrounding organizations. In Jefferson County, 68 individuals died of opioid or drug related overdoses in 2016. My staff and I will continue to get updated on a regular basis from county officials in Jefferson County as we work together to bring that number down.
Next, I went to the Community Health Center of Central Missouri in Jefferson City for a discussion on opioid abuse and behavioral health. There are fewer health-care professionals of all kinds in rural areas but community health centers are a great option to seek treatment and advice for all ages and individuals. Thank you to everyone who participated in this discussion including the Director of Missouri’s Department of Health and Senior Services, Dr. Randall Williams, the Jefferson City Police Department,  the Director of Missouri’s Department of Mental Health, Mark Stringer, the Cole County Health Department, and the President and CEO of Jordan Valley Community Health Center, Brooks Miller. 
By bringing individuals throughout the health-care spectrum together, we are able to discuss what we can do in our communities to face this epidemic head on. I will be taking their notes and ideas back to Washington to share with my colleagues in the House.
Lastly, in the previous Congress, a very important bill was signed into law called the 21st Century Cures Act. This law streamlines the review of life-saving drugs and provides grants for states to supplement opioid abuse prevention and treatment. I was a proud supporter of this legislation in the House of Representatives, and I was pleased to see it become a law.
While Congress has taken steps to address the opioid epidemic, it is clear that more must be done. Please know I will continue to meet with doctors, nurses, treatment professionals, law enforcement officers, and families to hear their stories and discuss what more can be done here at home and in Washington.

Startups, tax reform, and more!                                                           View this email in your own browser

Dear Lindsey,


Wow! The last few weeks have been truly incredible. From meeting with small businesses all over our district, getting to work on tax reform, discussing bipartisan fixes to our healthcare system, and introducing my new bill to help more Americans get back to work, I thought it would be a good opportunity to reach out and share a few updates.
￼ 
Supporting California Startup Businesses 
  
Entrepreneurship happens at every age, in every zip code in America. This week to celebrate ""Startup Day Across America,"" I spent the day connecting great new startups in our district like Ryan's Recycling, Stance, Oceanside Brewing Co and entrepreneurs working hard to build the next great idea.

 See more about Startup Day on KUSI. 
￼ 
Working Across the Aisle To Fix Healthcare     I sat down with fellow San Diego-area Congressman Scott Peters (D-CA) to talk about how Republicans and Democrats can work together to help fix our broken health care system.   Check out the full interview on CBS here.
￼ 
Helping Americans Get Back To Work 

Did you know it takes longer to be licensed as a landscaper than it does to deliver medical care as an EMT? Overly burdensome ""occupational licenses"" are making it harder for Americans to get to work. I introduced new legislation to make it much easier.

 Read more about my bill here. 
 
￼ 

Calling For A Bipartisan Focus on Job Creation   Startup companies produce 2 million new jobs every year. As fellow entrepreneurs, Congressman Jared Polis (D-CO) and I wrote a column calling on lawmakers come together and focus on supporting job creators and American ingenuity.  Read our piece for The Hill.   
￼ 
Giving All Americans Access to Same Health Insurance As Federal Employees    As we looks for new ways to fix Obamacare, I'm asking Congress to take up a plan I've introduced since 2009 to give all American access to the same insurance options provided to federal employees and their families.
Read more in my letter to McConnell.

Dear Oklahoma Friends and Neighbors,
Congress continues to work on healthcare, tax reform, national debt, regulatory reform, job growth, national security, and a budget to fund the federal government.
Historically, the month of August is the only month during the year when Congress is not in session, but the Senate was still in DC this week to resolve a number of important issues such as funding for the Veterans Choice Program and confirmation of several important executive branch nominations. I look forward to connecting with you around the state in the days ahead. In the meantime, please contact my office if you have ideas or concerns about the topics Congress is discussing.
We cannot give up on fixing the healthcare problems in America
As many of you know, last Thursday and Friday the Senate worked into the early morning hours to repeal and replace the failed parts of Obamacare. I am deeply disappointed that the Senate fell one vote short to improve healthcare for millions of people. The vote last week was not the final product; it was only a vote to take the next step to provide access to healthcare for every American. The plan was always to vote on two separate bills in order to address the issues with Obamacare. The first bill, which was a partisan bill, was to eliminate the painful mandates in Obamacare law and to move insurance regulation back to the states. The second bill would have been a bipartisan bill to deal with the growing costs of healthcare. We can still move on to the second step, but without 51 votes we cannot eliminate the debilitating mandates.  
Obamacare did successfully cover a vulnerable population of Americans who previously did not have access to healthcare. But, provisions in Obamacare also forced millions to lose their health coverage due to very high costs and limited access to doctors and hospitals. Almost 100,000 Oklahomans pay the IRS individual mandate penalty each year for not having healthcare, and 81 percent of them making less than $50,000 a year. We cannot forget about our neighbors who pay a fine but still do not have access to basic health insurance. 
Several Committees in the Senate have already announced bipartisan hearings to focus on the problems at hand and discuss solutions to reform the broken government system. I have met with colleagues on both sides of the aisle this week to work on the next steps. I am still committed to eliminating the mandates and penalties for my fellow Oklahomans, while we also work on bipartisan solutions for health insurance.

To read my statement on the Senate's failure to repeal and replace, CLICK HERE. During the final debate, I gave a floor speech—CLICK HERE to watch the video.
US sanctions Iran, Russia, and North Korea
Last week, Congress took steps to sanction three aggressive nations that are determined to intimidate their neighbors. Iran, Russia, and North Korea are oppressive regimes that must be confronted. The sanctions bill was passed overwhelmingly by the House and Senate and was signed into law by the President.
Iran remains the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, Kim Jong-un from North Korea continues to threaten the world, Russia undoubtedly attempted to meddle in the 2016 elections and has murdered thousands of people in Ukraine. The United States cannot ignore these aggressive actions. Provocation from these regimes could eventually impact our homeland. We responded with clear words backed by decisive action.
To read more, CLICK HERE.
Confirmation of President Trump's nominees
Although Republicans have the majority in the Senate—52-48—Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has abused the procedural rules to slow down the Senate confirmation process. They have stalled simple, non-controversial appointments to important positions at agencies like the Transportation Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. As of Wednesday of this past week, the Senate had confirmed just 48 out of hundreds of the President's nominees to agencies and only two of the 23 judicial nominations. 
To give you an example, last month the Senate confirmed a US District Judge for the District of Idaho by a vote of 100-0, yet Mr. Schumer stalled the vote for three days preventing other legislation or nominees to be considered during that time. None of the delay in the vote was used to debate the nominee; it was just delay. If we continued at that rate, it would take 11 years to confirm all the nominations.
After months of delays, the minority finally allowed a group of non-controversial nominations to be confirmed yesterday. I hope this is a sign that we can finally get the Senate back to work on the key issues we must address.
I am concerned, like many of you, about the Senate rules and the future of genuine debate in the Senate. I have offered a proposal to update the Senate rules so we can get back to work. To read my op-ed on possible rule changes that was published in The Wall Street Journal this week, CLICK HERE.
Appropriations Committee working on budget solutions
Last week—yes, we worked on other issues besides healthcare—the Senate Appropriations Committee passed three appropriations bills that prioritized funding for US departments of Commerce, Justice, Science, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development. The Committee also passed the Legislative Branch appropriations bill. This year, I have the honor of serving as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch. In a year with limited resources, it was the Committee’s goal to make thoughtful decisions to prioritize spending. We recommended allocating resources in a responsible way to maintain current services and allow for critical investments in security, information technology modernization, and government transparency. 
To read more about the Legislative Branch Appropriations priorities, CLICK HERE. To read about the other appropriations bills, CLICK HERE. 
Veterans Choice program
The Veterans Choice Program is an important step to reform the way we provide healthcare to our veterans. Choice has allowed an increasing number of veterans the ability to choose their own doctors and healthcare providers. Though this program is new it is the future of veterans' healthcare. This program has allowed veterans in Oklahoma increased, timely access to healthcare providers. I support removing the expiration date of the Veterans Choice Program as well as making the program a permanent part of the way the VA delivers healthcare to our veterans. We owe access to healthcare to the men and women who have fearlessly protected us. 
A Day in the Life 
Oklahomans frequently ask what a typical day looks like for me when I am in Washington, DC. Here is a short video that chronicles a normal Wednesday:

CLICK HERE to watch the video.
Keeping You in the Loop
	•	This week, I joined three of my colleagues to introduce the bipartisan Student Loan Servicer Performance Accountability Act. The legislation would temporarily suspend the US Department of Education from awarding a servicing contract to a sole provider for all student loans owned by the US Department of Education. After the bill was introduced, the Department of Education announced that they would not limit the amount of servicers. To read my full statement, CLICK HERE. 
	•	Last week, President Trump announced his nominee for Ambassador for International Religious Freedom, Governor Sam Brownback. I applaud the President’s choice as the US Commission on International Religious Freedom’s 2017 report claims that many countries continue to imprison, torture, and persecute religious minority communities. Whenever necessary, we should advocate for human rights and the right of all people to live their faith peacefully and freely. CLICK HERE to read more. 
	•	President Trump has tapped another Oklahoman to serve. Lance Robertson, currently serving in Oklahoma's Department of Human Services, was nominated to be Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Aging. On Wednesday, the Committee supported Lance’s nomination, and he was approved by the full Senate on Thursday. 
	•	It was an honor to have Dr. Hance Dilbeck of Quail Springs Baptist Church in Oklahoma City to serve as guest chaplain of the Senate and to lead us in the opening prayer. CLICK HERE to watch a fellow Oklahoman's opening prayer.
	•	On July 19, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, on which I serve, held a hearing with a panel of witnesses to discuss campaign violations by US Postal Service employees during the 2016 campaign. To watch my Q&A with the witnesses, CLICK HERE. 
	•	This week, the Senate voted on a bill that will reauthorize the Food and Drug Administration to collect fees from drug and device makers. The agency will use these fees to help streamline the process to approve new products. It cost the agency over a billion dollars and years of time to approve new drugs and devices. If we can keep the process safe but reduce the time and cost, we can have less expensive life-saving and health-enhancing treatments. 
	•	Earlier this month, I met with Colonel Christopher Hussin, Commander of the Tulsa District US Army Corps of Engineers. Colonel Hussin oversees one of the largest civil works missions in the USACE, with 240 parks and 6,000 campsites as well as the construction and management services for two Army and four Air Force installations. I am grateful for his service to our nation and to Oklahoma.
	•	Save the date! My office will host a Service Academy Information Day on Saturday, September 9, 2017. There will be one event in the morning in Muskogee and one in the afternoon in Lawton. Oklahoma 8th-grade through rising high school seniors interested in applying for a United States Service Academy will have an opportunity to meet representatives from all academies and learn more about the application process.

Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the seventh day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: immigration reform.
I’ve long supported a more rational, compassionate approach to immigration, including:
	•	Comprehensively reforming our immigration system: We need comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the 11.3 million people currently living in the United States without documentation, providing them a clear path to citizenship. This is something that three-quarters of all Americans support, for undocumented residents who are law-abiding, tax-paying, and already part of the fabric of American life.
	•	Keeping our commitment to DREAMers: Because of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), more than 750,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children were protected from deportation and able to work for a specified period of time. I have personally met many of these DREAMers, and they are some of the most determined, brave, and inspiring people I’ve ever known. They put their faith in us by registering for this program. We need to keep our commitment to them.
Immigrants have always added to the diversity, character, and economic vitality of our communities. This diversity is what makes our country great. A compassionate and thoughtful approach to immigration reform is long overdue. I will continue working to make such reform a reality.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here.

Courage, 
￼

Let’s Stop the Bickering and Fix the Health Care System  New York Times  If either of us were building the American health care system from scratch, we’d probably end up in different places. We have contrasting ideas — one of us is a Democrat, the other a Republican — about what ails the system and how to reshape it. But this is not the time for more partisan fighting.
Bill Haslam to Congress, Trump: Control soaring health care costs  Chattanooga Times Free Press Given the collapse of Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam hopes Washington will turn its attention to a longer- term health policy issue he says has been largely ignored in the past. That is making health care actually more affordable by finding ways to rein in perennially soaring costs in an industry that accounts for one sixth of the national economy and even has its own special rate of inflation.
Facebook Drowns Out Fake News With More Information  Wall Street Journal  Facebook Inc. is fighting misinformation with more information. Starting Thursday, when Facebook’s U.S. users come across popular links—including made-up news articles—in their feeds, they may also see a cluster of other articles on the same topic.
Justice Department Links Federal Funds to Immigration Cooperation  Wall Street Journal  ALBUQUERQUE—The Justice Department told four cities that they wouldn’t be eligible for a federal program to combat drug trafficking and gang crime unless they cooperate with immigration agents.
Mayors to Washington (and Trump): You need to listen to us  Politico  America’s mayors have one message for Washington: you need our help to solve the country’s problems.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller Impanels Washington Grand Jury in Russia Probe  Wall Street Journal  Special Counsel Robert Mueller has impaneled a grand jury in Washington to investigate Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections, a sign that his inquiry is growing in intensity and entering a new phase, according to people familiar with the matter.
Senators Introduce 2 Bills To Try To Keep Trump From Firing Mueller  NPR  For weeks, there has been speculation that President Trump would try to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the 2016 election. To try to keep Mueller from being fired without cause by the president, two bipartisan bills have been introduced in the Senate. 
The Loyal Engineers Steering NASA’s Voyager Probes Across the Universe  The New York Times  As the Voyager mission is winding down, so, too, are the careers of the aging explorers who expanded our sense of home in the galaxy.
U.S. Economy Adds 209,000 Jobs In July; Unemployment Dips To 4.3 Percent  NPR  The U.S. economy created an estimated 209,000 jobs in July, representing a modest slowdown from the previous month but coming in better than many economists had expected. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.3 percent from 4.4 percent.
Nashville airport to land nonstop flight to London  Tennessean  Nashville International Airport is poised to land a nonstop flight to London on British Airways, culminating a multiyear effort by government, business and tourism leaders to secure the flight. An announcement is expected as soon as next week, sources told The Tennessean.

Dear Friends,
Thomas Jefferson once said, Agriculture is our wisest pursuit, because it will in the end contribute most to real wealth, good morals and happiness. Here in Idaho, we know that firsthand.  Agriculture is one of our largest, most important industries and a major part of our heritage. Over 40,000 Idahoans work in the ag industry and 20 percent of Idahos sales each year are generated by agriculture and food/beverage processing. On any given day, dairymen in the Magic Valley, wheat growers on the Palouse, and onion growers in Payette County are generating the food and beverages we need to survive and flourish.
Idaho agriculture is typically a family-centered industry, with farms and ranches often owned and worked by a single family and passed down from generation to generation. Agriculture inspires the kind of cultural values that define the best of Idaho  self-reliance, family cooperation, community trust, and true understanding of nature. As Idahoans, we can take pride in our ag industry  not just for its economic benefits, which are numerous, but also because of its unique place in preserving the Idaho spirit. 
To sustain that spirit, the next generation of Idaho farmers and ranchers are hard at work, learning the trade from their moms and dads, friends and neighbors, and great leaders at organizations like FFA. FFA, which was founded as Future Farmers of America in 1928, is a national student organization dedicated to supporting and promoting agricultural education. FFA helps middle and high school students prepare for careers in business, science, horticulture, forestry, and many other diverse fields  making classroom instruction come to life through realistic, hands-on applications. Today, nearly 650,000 students are FFA members, making it one of the largest youth organizations in America. 
￼
With Idaho FFA leaders Randy Clements (left) and Lindsey Sowell (center)
Last week, I had the pleasure of meeting two young Idahoans who are taking a leadership role in FFA: Randy Clements of DuBois and Lindsey Sowell of Wilder. They are Idahos Student State Officers and they were in Washington, D.C., for FFAs State Presidents Conference (SPC). SPC is an annual conference in which the Student State Officers from every state get together to advocate for agricultural education and share ideas. 
Ive had the pleasure of meeting FFA Student State Officers most years Ive been in Congress. When I talk with these young leaders, I am excited for the future of Idaho agriculture and those who work in it. Lindsey and Randy are great examples. Lindsays family works in the dairy industry and Randys works in the beef industry. They both want to stay in agriculture and grow as leaders.  We need them. As Randy told me and my staff, in the next 35 years, the world population will grow from 7.5 billion to 9.5 billion. Thats an extra 2 billion people to feed. Who will feed them? That seems like a great challenge, but its also a great opportunity. With future leaders like Lindsey and Randy, I know Idaho agriculture will be ready to seize that opportunity and grow even further. 
To learn more about Idaho agriculture, please watch this great video produced by the Idaho State Department of Agriculture last year. See for yourself how Idahos farmers are contributing to our economy and our way of life.  Im proud of Idahos farmers and I will always be a strong advocate for them.  
Thank you,

8/4/17 10:53,The Hastings Monthly Report - August 2017,"￼

August 2017
The Hastings Monthly Report


Dear Friend,   Last week, Senator John McCain returned to the Senate following his diagnosis of Brain Cancer. After voting to continue the debate on healthcare reform, he spoke to his colleagues on the Senate floor and urged them to return to regular order. Regular order is important because it implies bipartisanship. When operating without regular order, a few members of the Majority party can unilaterally silence the Minority party by blocking amendments and legislation without even having a debate. 
When my constituents ask me about bipartisanship, I tell them that without regular order, things won’t be likely to change. For years, Republican leadership – from Speaker Paul Ryan to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell – has called for a return to regular order, but failed to follow through. The challenges we face are not insurmountable, but only if House leadership can put aside partisanship and allow for cooperation across the aisle. House Republicans need to stop quashing the overwhelming majority of Democratic amendments and proposals, and return to some form of regular order. 
Reforming Healthcare
President Donald Trump’s healthcare plan known as “Trumpcare” once again collapsed in the Senate last month due to ferocious opposition from Americans across the nation. I strongly oppose Tumpcare, which would force families to pay much higher out-of-pocket costs and take away healthcare from tens of millions of hard-working Americans. It is simply not realistic to gut programs like Medicaid or end the essential health benefits that so many people rely upon. After seven years of undermining and voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act, it is shocking that this is the Republican Party’s plan to healthcare. 
The American people want healthcare that is affordable and high quality; coverage that is there when it is needed and tailored to each individual’s needs. I pledge to you that I will work with anyone to improve healthcare in our country to reach these goals. Democrat or Republican, there are so many places where we can work together to enact meaningful change.    For more information on the various issues that I am working on, visit my official website at www.alceehastings.house.gov.  With warm personal regards, I remain,
                                     Sincerely,
￼

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 8.4.17
Friday, August 4, 2017 –                                 
Filibuster Frustration
I have written often in this column about the modern filibuster/cloture rule. Unlike the classic filibuster, in which a senator might take to the floor for hours to speak on an issue, the modern rule allows a senator to put a secret hold on a bill without having to go to the floor to explain his or her objections. And under the rules, the motion to proceed to debate can be filibustered, meaning the bill might not be debated on the floor at all.
President Trump made news on July 29 by taking to his Twitter feed and blasting the Senate’s filibuster rules. The President agrees with me and is right to be frustrated. As long as the Senate maintains the modern filibuster/cloture rule, it is sidelining Congress as one of the three branches of government and standing in the way of solving some of our country’s problems.
President Trump pointed out, “Many great Republican bills will never pass, like Kate's Law and complete Healthcare.” Kate’s Law, a bill to increase penalties on illegal immigrants who unlawfully reenter our country after being removed previously, is a great example of the harm caused by the modern filibuster/cloture rule. In 2016, 55 of the 100 senators voted to open debate on Kate’s Law, but the motion still failed. Not only did the bill not pass the Senate, but its merits were not even debated on the floor! In this instance, the rules allowed opponents of Kate’s Law to avoid explaining on the floor of the Senate why they wanted to protect illegal aliens who repeatedly violated our immigration laws.
In 2017, the House has already sent Kate’s Law over to the Senate, where it will likely never be debated because of the modern filibuster/cloture rule.
One doesn’t have to agree with President Trump on the issues to see the problems the filibuster poses for our democratic republic. I advocated the repeal of the modern filibuster/cloture rule even when the President was one I didn’t agree with, President Obama.
The electorate doesn’t send senators to Washington to avoid tough votes. It does send elected representatives to Washington to solve problems in accord with the will of the majority – NOT a supermajority. The modern filibuster rule has already eroded public confidence in all of Congress. If a minority of 40 senators continues to obstruct solutions, confidence in our institutions will further erode. 
In this Congress, the House has passed legislation that improves our economy, gets Americans back to work, and moves us toward solutions on other problems, but a minority in the Senate has continued to obstruct and delay. According to Congress.gov as of August 1, the House of Representatives has passed 292 bills so far this year. In contrast, the Senate has only passed 42 bills. In the absence of action by the Senate, the problems facing the country will only worsen.
Some have pointed out that in attempting to repeal Obamacare, the Senate was in fact operating on a 51-vote threshold instead of the 60-vote rule. But the 51-vote threshold for legislation is only available in highly particular situations under the complex process called reconciliation. Knowing that Democrats wouldn’t cooperate on repealing and replacing Obamacare, in order to make health insurance more affordable, the bill had to be carefully tailored to fit the reconciliation rules and qualify for the 51-vote threshold. It is maddening for Congress only to be able to solve problems under an arcane reconciliation process.
Trying to comply with the rules on reconciliation, particularly the Senate interpretations, made it harder to reach a deal in the House and apparently made it impossible to reach a compromise in the Senate.
This year had some minor progress when the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominations was abolished after a minority threatened to obstruct the eminently-qualified Neil Gorsuch. Doing away with that part of the rule was good for our country. If we want to make progress on the difficult issues facing America, the Senate must go further and scrap the modern filibuster/cloture rule entirely.

Marc's Memo - July 2017 Updates 
 

Dear Friends,  The collapse of the Senate’s Trumpcare legislation was a result of the American people speaking out against its devastating effects. Let me be clear, repealing the Affordable Care Act will cause irreparable harm for thousands of families in my district who already struggle to pay for a routine check-up. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) isn't perfect, but it's time that both sides of the aisle come together and work on a bipartisan fix that works for all Americans. 
Although the month of July was focused on Congressional Republicans continued attack on the ACA, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. I am honored to serve on the House Armed Services Committee to ensure that Congress can provide proper resources to keep our country safe from escalating global threats. For more information on what the final House version of NDAA included, please click here.
As your representative in Congress, it is important to hear directly from the residents I represent on issues like healthcare and our national security. That is why I’m proud to host two town halls on Tuesday, August 15 and Thursday, August 17 during the August District Work Period. This will be your opportunity to directly share your thoughts with me on legislation that affects you and your community. For more information on the Dallas and Tarrant County Town Halls or to RSVP, please visit my webpage.
As always, I invite you to connect with me through my official website, Facebook page, and Twitter account to stay informed on what I am working on in the district and in D.C. Don’t forget to remind your friends to subscribe to my e-newsletter, so they don’t miss out on any updates on my efforts in Washington and in the DFW Metroplex.  Sincerely, 
￼
Marc Veasey Member of Congress
Reducing Barriers to College 
After learning that students with immigrant parents, emancipated minors, homeless, and low-income students face additional obstacles when accessing FAFSA, I crafted legislation to ensure that all children have access to college no matter what your background may be.
My legislation entitled, “Reducing Barriers to College Act,” aims to prevent students nationwide from missing crucial federal and state grant opportunities that support their higher education aspirations.
A copy of the bill text can be found here.
  Blue Collar Caucus Meeting  On Wednesday, July  19, the Blue Collar Caucus met with Richard L. Trumka, President of the AFL-CIO, to discuss the needs of blue collar workers and how House Democrats can make it clear that they will continue to serve as their champions in Washington.   
￼
AFL-CIO President, Richard Trumka, speaks with the Blue Collar Caucus on issues directly affecting working Americans.  I was eager to hear firsthand from Richard Trumka, a long-time champion for workers nationwide and a leading advocate for America’s blue collar families, to learn how Democrats can work alongside the men and women who build our nation every day to shape a future that works for everyone.  CBC Voter Suppression Panel  On July 18, 2017, ahead of the Election Integrity Commission’s first meeting, I joined members of the Congressional Black Caucus and House Judiciary Democrats in a forum on voting rights and privacy concerns. 
￼
Congressman Veasey listens closely to panel remarks during the CBC and Judiciary Democrats forum on voting rights and privacy concerns.  The panel featured voting rights advocates, Secretaries of State from Kentucky and Connecticut, and information technology advocates who focus on privacy and human rights concerns. This panel was organized to discuss the many suppressive tactics that may result from the commission and their “investigation” into voter fraud and voting irregularities.  The American Hope Act  On Friday, July 28, I was proud to stand alongside my Democratic colleagues during the introduction of the “American Hope Act,” a bill that will bring hope to the thousands of young DREAMERs who proudly call America home and want to see her prosper.  
￼
Congressman Veasey provides remarks at the press conference announcing introduction of the American Hope Act.  Undocumented immigrants need a pathway to legal status and citizenship and this bill will ensure that certain groups of immigrants who arrived as children finally have that opportunity.

#ICYMI-Teen Vogue Op-Ed on Cuts to Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program
President Trump belittled woman throughout the 2016 campaign and now that he’s in office his Administration has translated that misogyny into sexist health policies that will affect women for decades to come. Sudden grant cuts by the Trump Administration to the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program are particularly worrisome as young women should be empowered with reliable information in order to be in charge of their futures. Instead, the Trump administration has decided to funnel over $200 million dollars to support ineffective abstinence-only sex education. 
In my recently penned op-ed in Teen Vogue, I outline how the Trump Administration’s grant cuts to the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program are detrimental to future generations of young women and men.

Clocking-in At Big State Fountain Grill   On Monday, July 3, I was serving up classic burgers and Blue Bell shakes at Big State Fountain Grill as part of my ‘Marc Means Business’ work day.  
￼
Congressman Veasey busses a table during his shift at Big State Fountain Grill as part of his ‘Marc Means Business’ work day.  During my shift I learned firsthand about the day-to-day responsibilities at the nostalgic 1950s diner as I helped wash dishes, clean tables, and perform daily duties as assigned.   To invite me to work a shift at your place of business, please contact my District Director, Anne Hagan, via email at anne.hagan@mail.house.gov.   Congress on Your Commute   I have the privilege of representing the DFW Metroplex in Congress and chatting face to face with constituents is what motivates me to work on your behalf every day. During my 'Congress On Your Commute' on Monday, July 31, I joined residents on the Fort Worth's T Route #28 and answered many of your questions ranging from  obstacles our veterans face and how the flow of jobs to North Texas is bringing folks from all over to Texas' 33rd.     
￼
Congressman Veasey chats with a DFW resident on the Fort Worth “T” during his ‘Congress on Your Commute’ event.   Grant Writing Workshop  On July 31, I hosted my Grant Writing Workshop to give grant seekers an opportunity to ask questions and get answers to help them with the grant application process. Researching, writing and applying for grants can be a daunting process, and I’m proud to have connected over 400 DFW residents with the resources and support they need to be successful.

SERVING YOU  |  MEDIA CENTER  |  LEGISLATIVE WORK  |  OUR DISTRICT
 
August 4, 2017
 
 
Dear Friend,   Bringing federal funds back to Rhode Island is one of my most current important responsibilities as a member of Congress. That’s why I was proud to announce over $4.5 million in federal SAFER grants to help ensure that our Fire Departments are fully-staffed is critical for the safety and well-being of Rhode Islanders. I look forward to welcoming these new firefighters to our state’s incredible team of first responders, and I am committed to continuing to work with our Chiefs and their Departments to meet the needs of their communities.   I advocated directly to FEMA on behalf of the Barrington Fire Department (BFD)’s application. Its $532,542 award will help cover the salaries and benefits for four additional firefighters for the first two years of their employment, and 35 percent of the salaries and benefits in the third year. The North Kingstown Fire Department (NKFD) will use the $1,540,258 federal SAFER grant to hire nine full-time firefighter positions to staff the department’s ladder truck 24 hours per day, seven days per week.   The Pawtucket Fire Department will receive $2,448,938 to fund the hiring of 13 firefighter positions, and the Kingston Fire District will use its $168,100 grant for a tuition assistance reimbursement program to enhance recruitment and retention efforts of volunteer firefighters.   Russia Sanctions Law   Russia’s interference in last year’s presidential election demanded a strong response in the form of new sanctions, and the Trump campaign’s well-documented ties to Vladimir Putin’s regime obligated us to tie the President’s hands on this matter. The bill that was signed into law this week does both.   Like many, I am concerned about whether the Trump administration will faithfully execute this new law. Republicans in Congress have so far given Donald Trump a blank check to do whatever he wants. Democrats will continue to demand strong oversight of this administration until Republicans start doing their jobs.   Russia’s actions last year amounted to an assault on our most sacred democratic institutions. It’s critical that the President holds them accountable. Not doing so would generate yet another scandal that distracts from the challenges facing American families.   Veterans Community Conversation & BBQ on SATURDAY   This Saturday, August 5th at 12pm, I am hosting a Community Conversation & BBQ for our Veterans and their families in Pawtucket. This event will be a great opportunity for our veterans to learn about important resources available to them and to enjoy a delicious meal. Our veterans have served our nation heroically in uniform, and I am dedicated to ensuring that they have access to the finest resources and services available at the local, state and federal level.   To learn more about the event, click here. To RSVP, contact Marie Magee by email at Marie.Magee@mail.house.gov or by calling 401-729-5600.   Spotlight on the District   Rhode Island is full of amazing people doing incredible work to strengthen our state. I am so honored to represent this community in Congress, and I always look forward to spreading the word about the individuals and organizations working to improve the lives of others. That’s why I am proud to announce a new regular feature of my newsletter “Spotlight on the District.” This new feature will be an opportunity to highlight some of this extraordinary work. If you know of an individual or organization that you think I should recognize in my newsletter, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at Davd.Cicilline@mail.house.gov or by calling 401-729-5600.   Spotlight on the District: Community Boating Center Executive Director John O’Flaherty 
￼
As we all know, students learn best when they are excited and engaged with their studies. Getting our young people interested in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) can be particularly challenging, despite their importance to our state’s future. That’s why I wanted to highlight one individual in our state who is doing outstanding work to make STEM engaging to the next generation: Community Boating Center Executive Director John O’Flaherty.   Recently, I had the opportunity to visit the Community Boating Center and learn about its innovative efforts to expose students to STEM learning, while teaching the fundamentals of sailing. The Community Boating Center’s ‘Sailing Through Science’ initiative is helping students get a foothold in STEM by teaching them how to plot a course, monitor tides and weather, measure buoyancy/density, harness wind energy, and more. It’s making a real difference in the lives of the students of our state, and it should come as no surprise that it has already been adopted as a national model for STEM learning by US Sailing.   I want to extend my sincere gratitude to John, and everyone at the Community Boating Center, for their dedication to our community and unrelenting efforts to find innovative ways to get our student engaged with STEM. Young people who are exposed to STEM at a young age are more likely to become doctors, scientists or engineers, and these are exactly the kind of careers that are going to make Rhode Island more competitive in the future. Keep up the good work!   Cox Technology Centers 
￼
As all of us know, education is the single most important tool for helping young people develop the skills and tools they will need one day to get ahead. And in our high-tech age, our students increasingly require access to digital tools and technology to build the skills they will need to get ahead. That’s why I was so glad to join Governor Gina Raimondo at the Boys & Girls Club of Cumberland-Lincoln to thank Cox Communication and the Cox Foundation for opening four new technology centers in Lincoln-Cumberland, Woonsocket, East Providence and Newport. These centers provide our young people with access to state-of-the-art technology, including 3-D printers, laptops and tablets. This is really key as we work to build a strong, sustainable economy that lifts up our entire state.   Automatic Voter Registration   On Tuesday, I had the privilege of joining Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea and an incredible group of legislators and activists as Governor Raimondo signed legislation to make Rhode Island the ninth state in the country to implement Automatic Voter Registration. Across the country, some politicians are trying to make it harder to vote, but this makes it clear that here in Rhode Island, we believe it should be easier for citizens to exercise this fundamental right.   I want to extend my sincere gratitude to Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea for championing this legislation and to everyone who worked tirelessly to see it become law. I am working hard to pass legislation at the federal level to make Automatic Voter Registration the law of the land, and I am proud that 115 of my colleagues are currently cosponsoring my bill. I am inspired by Rhode Island’s leadership on this effort, and I will not give up until Congress follows our state’s example and takes this important step to protect the right to vote for all Americans.   As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns, please call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov. You can also click here to follow my work on Twitter.     Warm Regards, ￼  David Cicilline Member of Congress

Promoting Jobs on Startup Day
￼  (Rep. Hultgren visits NIU-Naperville for Startup Day Across America)
Jobs remain my top priority in Congress, and I was proud this year to co-lead Startup Day Across America. This celebration connects my colleagues with our local startups so we can learn about the challenges new companies face and meet the business leaders building the future.  I visited NIU-Naperville and engaged in a roundtable discussion with students, professors and others on NIU's regional efforts to support the innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem of northern Illinois. Participants included representatives of the NIU-IDEAL Industries intrapreneurship program (internship + entrepreneurship) in Sycamore, NIU's EIGERlab in Rockford, and the Social Entrepreneurship program at NIU's College of Business in DeKalb. We then toured the DuPage County incubator, Rev3.  Click here to read the Daily Herald story on our discussion.

In and Around the District
We're stronger when our communities and law enforcement know and trust each other. National Night Out is an annual community event devoted to promoted these important relationships. At ours in Kendall County I met with our law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line to protect our neighborhoods. I’m proud of our 14th District law enforcement officers, including Kendall County Sheriff Baird. These officers have done a great job staying closely connected to our communities every day of the year.
￼  (Rep. Hultgren with with Kendall County Sheriff Dwight Baird at National Night Out)
Our local service clubs are staples in the 14th District, serving our communities and improving the places where we live every day. The Geneva Lions Club is no exception, and I enjoyed discussing jobs, healthcare, spending and other important issues.
￼  (Rep. Hultgren meets with members of the Geneva Lions Club)
The Sugar Grove Corn Boil is celebrating 50 years of service. This volunteer-run annual summer festival brings residents together to raise funds for local organizations doing good work in the community. This year the corn boil is focused on helping families and organizations addressing autism.  I joined in on the celebration and entered a statement into the Congressional Record in recognition of their many years of service to the 14th District. Click here to read my full statement in the Congressional Record.

NASA Reports on Engaging Girls in STEM
￼  (Photo: NASA)
Setting students on a STEM trajectory changes their life and our nation’s for the better. One of the most valuable tools to serve underrepresented groups has been NASA mentorship programs. That's why I cosponsored, Congress passed and the President signed into law the INSPIRE Women Act. Among other actions, the legislation mandated the following NASA report which lays out how the agency is continuing to engage girls to increase their STEM activities.  We must do our best to ensure that all girls and all boys are given the same opportunity to be inspired. I look forward to the day when we all will share in the innovations and technologies they create.  Click here to read the NASA report.  Speaking of girls in STEM, I was impressed and inspired by all of the teams competing at the FIRST Global robotics competition in Washington, D.C., including the all-girls team from Afghanistan. I am pleased the State Department and White House acted quickly to approve their visas so they could compete in this STEM competition. Bumping into FIRST founder and Segway inventor Dean Kamen again was an added bonus!
￼  (Rep. Hultgren with members of the Afghan FIRST Global robotics team)

Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) Breaks Ground in South Dakota
￼
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory attracts top talent, employing nearly 2,000 in Illinois and providing a strong economic engine in our state. I was thrilled to attend the groundbreaking of its partner in the international Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), the South Dakota-based Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF). This experiment into the smallest particles of our universe—shot 800 miles from Illinois through the earth to South Dakota—once again puts the United States in a leadership position on the world stage, attracting scientists from around the globe.
￼  (Photo: Fermilab)
We can only guess what breathtaking discoveries will be made, and I'm proud to see Fermilab continuing to serve as a hub of the international scientific community. It’s why I continue to support robust funding for Fermilab and our national labs.

My Take on the Senate’s Vote on Health Care
I am very disappointed that the Senate didn't stay at the table to find a way forward to bring down skyrocketing premiums and address the failing ACA system. The healthcare status quo is unacceptable—doing nothing is not an option.  Illinois’ ACA health exchanges provide substandard care at outrageous prices for residents without employer-sponsored coverage. Families in my district on the ACA exchange will be offered one choice for their insurance next year if nothing changes. In the coming weeks we'll get a glimpse of what this true insurance monopoly will mean for those who can't afford any more premium increases. These facts can’t be ignored. Further, Medicaid must be restored to its original mandate to provide a safety net to the truly needy.  I urge the Senate to take up health reform again. Illinois individuals and families can’t wait.

Legislative Update
	•	I supported legislation, which President Trump signed into law this week, tightening existing sanctions on Russia and putting Congress in control should they be removed. I remain very concerned at how Russia conducts intelligence operations against the United States, and what effects those efforts have had on the country. These sanctions address the ongoing situation in Ukraine and impose new measures, including some in response to Russia’s meddling in our elections and others targeting key Russian oligarchs in the railways, shipping, metals and mining industries. They include restrictions on companies doing business with the Russian oil industry.
	•	As a member of the Party of Lincoln from the Land of Lincoln, I take great pride—and responsibility—in promoting a strong republic where all are equal and engaged in the system that chooses our leaders and promotes a more just society. I support a needed and bipartisan update to the Voting Rights Act to ensure we protect this civil rights legacy for all generations. Read more about H.R. 3239, the Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2017, which is supported by civil rights champions including Rep. John Lewis.
	•	H.R. 3110, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Insurance Member Continuity Act, my bipartisan fix to the Dodd-Frank Act which I mentioned in a previous Hultgren Huddle, passed the Financial Services Committee. I urge support of this legislation, and am hopeful it can move swiftly to the President’s desk.

Oswego Pastor Prays for Congress
￼  (Speaker Ryan, Pastor Scott Poling, Rep. Randy Hultgren)
At the beginning of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, Benjamin Franklin called for the institution of daily prayer during deliberations. This eventually paved the way for the Chaplaincy and prayer before each day of business in the House and Senate, a tradition which remains today.  I was thrilled that an Opening Prayer was delivered last week by Pastor Scott Poling of Harvest New Beginnings Church in Oswego, where my family and I attend.  Click here to watch Pastor Poling’s prayer.  Click here to read Pastor Poling’s prayer.  Click here to watch my floor remarks thanking him.  If you haven’t already, be sure to like my Facebook page, follow me on Twitter (@RepHultgren), or check out my YouTube page to stay informed on everything I’m doing on your behalf in Washington and in Illinois.

Finding a Path Forward on Health Care

Jeff successfully fought battle after battle to protect health care for millions of Americans, ultimately contributing to the defeat of a bill last week that would have raised premiums by 20% and ripped away care from 16 million Americans. Jeff firmly believes that health care is a human right, not a privilege reserved for the healthy and the wealthy. That is why Jeff will continue to keep the pressure on to protect Americans’ life-saving care and to pursue fresh solutions that will help bring down health care costs, improve our health care system, and expand coverage. You can help Jeff fight for accessible, affordable health care for all by sharing your story about what health care means to you and your loved ones.

Fighting for Oregonians in the Latest Government Spending Bills
Jeff joined the Senate Appropriations Committee so that Oregon would have a strong voice in the decisions about the investments our nation makes. As Congress works to draft government spending bills for next year, Jeff is fighting hard to ensure the needs of Oregonians won’t be left behind. As a result, the bills being passed by the Appropriations Committee significantly increase funding for Oregon’s affordable housing, transportation infrastructure, and struggling coastal communities. 
In order to help address the housing crisis plaguing hard-working families, Jeff successfully secured $19.4 billion to renew rental assistance for 2.2 million low-income households in America, a $1.025 billion increase from last year. He also got $70.6 million more for housing assistance for the elderly, in addition to preserving $147 million to help house people with disabilities and $75 million to reunite homeless families. The bill also preserves $950 million for the HOME program that supports building, buying, and rehabilitating affordable housing for rent or homeownership. These funds are used in Oregon to provide rental assistance to low-income individuals. 
At Jeff’s urging, the latest bill also includes over $2 billion dollars for Capital Investment Grants, which fund major transportation projects like the Portland-Milwaukie light rail system. Jeff also successfully fought to secure an additional $50 million in the Transportation Investment Generation Economic Recovery (TIGER) Grant program, a key national competitive grant program that provides critical funds for significant transportation or port projects, such as repairing damaged infrastructure at the Port of Garibaldi and replacing the Sellwood Bridge. 
With half of Oregon’s coast currently closed to salmon fishing this season to protect the record-low populations, Jeff fought hard to secure funding for salmon management and recovery programs that will help Oregon treat these closures as the national emergency they are. Jeff partnered with Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska to offer an amendment that would provide $150 million in emergency funding for fisheries wherever the Secretary of Commerce has declared a disaster in 2017. The Appropriations Committee committed to Jeff that they will work to include fishery disasters in any bill that provides supplemental emergency funding for disasters. This is a critical step for southern Oregon fisheries that are facing massive closures, from Florence to the California border, this fishing season. 
As a member of the Appropriations Committee, Jeff won’t stop pushing for the investments Oregonians need.

Protecting Oregon’s Wilderness While Fueling Rural Oregon’s Economy
Oregon is home to some of the world’s most beautiful places -- places that are both environmentally significant and essential for recreation jobs and the rural Oregon economy. Jeff knows that these Oregon jewels deserve to be protected for future generations of Oregonians and Americans. That is why he and Senator Ron Wyden introduced the Oregon Wildlands Act, to designate more than 200,000 acres of land as wilderness or national recreation areas, and add more than 250 miles to the Wild and Scenic River System. This bill will not only preserve some of Oregon’s unique and most special places, but will also boost local economies -- and help cement Oregon’s well-deserved reputation as one of the world’s greatest recreation destinations.
Read more about the Oregon Wildlands Act here >> 

 
Boosting Manufacturing and Creating Green Jobs
America’s manufacturing economy is the heart of our middle class. That’s why Jeff is working to bolster America’s manufacturers by making small manufacturing businesses more competitive and reducing energy waste. This week, Jeff introduced the Job Creation through Energy Efficient Manufacturing Act of 2017, a bill that would create jobs and save money for manufacturers by putting people to work retrofitting manufacturing facilities to be more energy efficient.
The potential energy savings in the industrial and manufacturing sector are enormous: With investments in cost-effective energy efficiency measures, the industrial sector could reduce its $200 billion annual energy bill by 25% by 2020. Jeff will keep pushing to get this bill across the finish line, create jobs, and strengthen Oregon’s manufacturing economy.

Latta with Ohio Sea Grant Director Chris Winslow on Lake Erie.

Dear Friends,
August means the sun is out and county fairs are hopping. I've been to a number already and was able to help christen the brand new 4-H Milkshake Barn in Wood County.

I also had the opportunity to visit Stone Lab this week with Ohio State University President Michael V. Drake. Stone Lab is part of Ohio Sea Grant, a program I've long supported as they do tremendous research that helps us protect our lake. Their outreach and education is also vital as we teach future generations about the importance of the Great Lakes to the region.

As the Chairman of the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection, I've been working on bipartisan legislation to advance self-driving cars. Just last week, the Energy and Commerce Committee took a major step forward by passing my bill 54-0 to establish a framework to embrace this technology while ensuring safety. 
 Sincerely,
￼
Congressman Bob Latta 

Holding Rogue Nations Accountable 
Three nations - Russia, Iran, and North Korea - continue to wreak havoc around the globe because of their actions. Russia has conducted cyber attacks on foreign nations, they've supported the Assad regime in Syria, and they continue to engage in aggressive actions in Eastern Ukraine. North Korea's advancement of their nuclear program poses a threat to the U.S. and our ally, South Korea. Iran continues to break international law regarding their intercontinental ballistic missile program.

It goes without saying that all three nations have an abysmal record when it comes to human rights as well.

I joined my colleagues in passing bipartisan legislation to hit these bad actors where it hurts - their pocketbook. The world desperately needs American leadership to stand up to these rogue regimes, and stopping the flow of money to support their illicit actions will put pressure on them to stop their behavior. The legislation passed both the House and the Senate and was signed into law yesterday by President Trump. 
Getting Things Done in the U.S. House 
Did you know that the U.S. House of Representatives just finished a seven-month period that is more productive than the beginning of the last five administrations? Unfortunately, the national media has seemed to ignore much of the work that is being done for the American people. In fact, the House has already passed 316 bills. While several have been signed into law, historic obstruction in the Senate has meant a number are still waiting to hit the President's desk.  More than just the numbers, it's what these bills mean for Ohio families. For instance, the House has voted to repeal and replace Obamacare and has also passed legislation to reduce premiums and provide more choice for patients. We've voted to rebuild our military and give a pay raise to our troops. At the same time, the House has passed legislation to provide needed regulatory relief on Main Street so that we can grow our economy.  I've also voted for legislation to protect life and enforce our immigration laws. These bills all are still awaiting votes in the Senate. It's important we keep the pressure on by continuing to work on the priorities that matter most to the people we represent. For a breakdown of the bills we passed, go to my website here.

August 03, 2017 
Dear Friend,
As the health care debate carries on, my staff and I remain plugged into this issue. We will continue to deliver a fact-based analysis of any new information we receive, and break down the specific impact it will have for us here in Nevada. 
While reviewing these updates, its important to keep in mind that the state of health care for constituents in other congressional districts can be quite different than the reality we face in CD-2. As your representative, my goal is to ensure that Im always putting my best foot forward for you in Washington by looking at an issue from all angles, doing my homework, and determining how it will affect us. I ask that you please take a moment to review this information and let me know what you think through my website.
This week, I am addressing Community Health Centers (CHCs), and providing clarification on some of the misconceptions you might have heard about womens access to care.
MYTH: The American Health Care Act (AHCA) cuts funding for womens health services.
FACT: Instead, the AHCA expands womens access to health services by redirecting federal funding to CHCs, which vastly outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics in CD-2 by a ratio of at least 17 to 1. In 2017, CHCs in CD-2 received more than $15.2 million in federal funding, according to the National Association of Community Health Centers. Im pleased to see Nevada using this funding as effectively as possible, spreading it across CD-2s 17 CHC locations to ensure that women in every corner of our district have access to the care they need. The services CHCs do not or cannot provide may be referred to other health care providers, which might sometimes include, but is not limited to Planned Parenthood. 
MYTH: CHCs do not give women access to the same range of services as Planned Parenthood clinics.
FACT: CHCs in CD-2 provide patients with access to the following women's health services: contraception management, general health and wellness screenings, and well-woman exams (pap smears, breast exams, and other Health Resources and Service Administration (HRSA) defined womans exams). Additional services provided at our CHCs include: primary care; dental care; and pediatric care. While CHCs generally do not provide abortion services, neither does the single Planned Parenthood location in CD-2. Not only do CHCs give women in CD-2 access to all of the same services provided at the Planned Parenthood in Reno, but they also provide patients with a greater range of services.
MYTH: CHCs cant actually make up the gap in access to care.  
FACT: In CD-2, not only do CHCs make up the gap in coverage by offering the same exact services made available at the Reno Planned Parenthood clinic, but our CHCs go above and beyond by offering women additional services.
In regards to womens ability to access these services, its again important to remember that the only Planned Parenthood location in CD-2 is in Reno and hundreds of miles away from women living in rural Nevada. Without question, CHCs in CD-2 are actually the health care providers making up the gap in access, providing care throughout Northern Nevada in: Reno, Carson City, Virginia City, Austin, Carlin, Crescent Valley, Elko, Eureka, Jackpot, and Wendover.
MYTH: CHCs are not able to provide care for contraceptive, reproductive, or family planning services for patients with low incomes.
FACT: CHCs are able and do provide contraceptive services including birth control prescriptions and reproductive services for women such as those listed above. Our centers also offer federally recognized teen pregnancy programs with a concentrated focus on families. In fact, to receive this funding, the center must use a pre-reviewed, successful program  so its proven to be effective. Learn more about these programs below:
	•	Northern Nevada Hopes  Families Talking Together Program (Reno)
	◦	Mission: Families Talking Together (FTT) is an evidence based program designed to support effective parent-adolescent communication among families in order to delay sexual initiation among young people ages 10-14. (Source: http://nvpca.org/hopesftt)
	•	Nevada Health Centers, Inc.  Seventeen Days Program (10 locations in CD-2, 7 of those serving rural Nevada)
	◦	Mission: Seventeen Days is an evidence-based interactive film designed to educate adolescent girls (over age 14) about decision-making, contraception, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). (Source: http://nvpca.org/tpp17days)
	•	Community Health Alliance  Making Proud Choices (Reno)
	◦	Mission: Making Proud Choices is an evidence-based, eight-module curriculum that provides young adolescents with the knowledge, confidence and skills necessary to reduce their risk of STIs, HIV, and pregnancy. (Source: http://nvpca.org/tppmpc/)
Furthermore, across Nevada, about 50% of patients utilizing CHCs are on Medicaid, compared to just 5% of Medicaid patients being serviced by the three Planned Parenthood clinics in Nevada. Therefore, the safety net for low-income individuals is being provided by CHCs.
Click here for a list of the CHCs in Nevada and here for additional facts and figures related to our centers.  
As promised, my staff and I will continue examining different aspects of the health care issue and clarifying what it means for folks in Nevada. Stay tuned for the next health care update in which we plan to examine: the state of health care in Nevada.

￼

Dear Friend, 
 
Last week in Washington, legislation I introduced passed the Foreign Affairs Committee. Additionally, I voted to increase sanctions against our adversaries, attended a House Foreign Affairs Committee Hearing on the continued fight against terrorism, spoke to the next generation of leaders at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute’s (CHCI) Ready to Lead Next Generation Program, and attended a markup in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. I also spoke on the importance of affordable housing, and held a number of meetings.

Affordable Care Act
 
Early Friday morning, numerous attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act collapsed once again in the Senate. The repeated failure of these repeal efforts are consequences of a hurried process that excluded Members of Congress from participating in the discussions and the crafting of new legislation. It is long past time for Congress to move beyond bipartisan grandstanding and work together to address issues with the Affordable Care Act and implement effective changes that improve quality, expand coverage, and lower health costs. Stripping health care from millions of American families, seniors, and children is not the solution. My Democratic colleagues in Congress and I remain ready and willing to work across the aisle with our Republican counterparts to update the Affordable Care Act in a way that improves health care for millions, and it is my great hope that we can move forward with this in the spirit of bipartisan cooperation.
 
CHCI Ready to Lead Next Generation Program
 
It was my great privilege to address students participating in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute’s Ready to Lead Next Generation Program last week and share my experiences about coming to America, teaching ESL, and serving in public office with a room full of young adults who are eager to be the leaders of tomorrow. I am encouraged by their passion for change and it is crucial that we continue to support these individuals to follow their dreams and make a difference in our society. 
 
Transportation and Infrastructure Markup
 
At the end of the week, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee marked up several pieces of legislation, which included a bill that would improve disaster victims’ access to FEMA assistance and a bill which would reauthorize the brownfields cleanup program. Additionally, the Committee reviewed and discussed a Resolution of Inquiry into the conflicts of interest surrounding the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C., which unfortunately did not receive the Committee’s approval.  The other pieces of legislation we considered passed the full Committee and now await further action on the House floor. 
 
Affordable Housing Event
 
I was proud to speak at an event hosted by the Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey and Monarch Housing Associates on the importance of investing in affordable housing. As the former Mayor of West New York, I saw firsthand the effect that affordable housing investments made on the communities of New Jersey’s 8th District. I have worked hard at the local, state, and federal level to preserve and expand vital programs and I believe the President’s proposed budget cuts threaten communities in New Jersey and across America. I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to ensure that critical programs such as Community Development Block Grants and the HOME Investment Partnership Program receive the support needed to continue providing New Jerseyans with affordable housing. 
 
Meetings

At the beginning of last week, I welcomed AIPAC back to the office to continue our discussion on how the United States can best work with our ally Israel to fend off continued Iranian aggression. Later, I met with New Jersey representatives of Korean American Civic Empowerment (KACE) to discuss how current events affect the U.S.–Korea relationship. 
 
I also met with Kerry McCarthy, a member of the British Parliament, who visited my Washington D.C. office to update me on Brexit and to discuss the importance of our longstanding relationship with the United Kingdom. 
 
NICA Act
 
On Thursday, H.R. 1918, the Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act (NICA) of 2017, which I introduced with my colleague Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, unanimously passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee. This legislation would assist the Nicaraguan people in their fight for human rights, rule of law, and basic democratic processes by putting conditions on aid for Nicaragua that require the government to certify that they are taking steps to hold free, fair and transparent elections. H.R. 1918 now awaits further action on the House floor. 
 
Foreign Affairs Hearing
 
Earlier last week, I attended a Foreign Affairs Hearing which examined the United States’ continued fight against terrorism. Experts testified on the importance of Congress’ constitutional duty to authorize the use of military force. As Congress continues to debate the use of military action against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, I take my duty to understand and scrutinize this authority very seriously and firmly believe that President Trump must present any future military operations to Congress before acting.  
 
Iran, North Korea, and Russia Sanctions
 
Finally, last week, the House of Representatives took a critical step in protecting U.S. national interests by voting to strengthen and increase sanctions against Iran, North Korea, and Russia. H.R. 3364, the Countering America’s Adversaries through Sanctions Act, would restrict the President’s ability to reduce or terminate existing sanctions related to Russian aggression while also leveraging sanctions against entities that engage in business with the Russian military, intelligence agencies, or oligarchs connected to Vladimir Putin. Furthermore, this bill mandates new sanctions against individuals who assist Iran in their pursuit of ballistic missiles and expands sanctions against North Korea. I voted for this bill, which passed the House by a vote of 419 to 3 and now awaits further action in the Senate.

Sen. Flake Introduces Resolution Advancing Long-Overdue Honors for Pearl Harbor Hero
Urges Navy to reconsider decision not to decorate BM Joe George for defying orders to rescue six injured sailors from USS Arizona
￼
Sen. Jeff Flake spoke on the Senate floor to introduce a resolution honoring Pearl Harbor hero Boatswain’s Mate Second Class Joseph Leon George for rescuing six injured sailors from the sinking USS Arizona. The resolution also expresses the Senate’s desire that the U.S. Navy reconsider a past decision not to decorate George because he defied orders to rescue those sailors. George passed away in 1996 having never received official recognition for his life-saving actions at Pearl Harbor.
“After 75 years, it is time Congress and the U.S. Navy officially recognized what is clear to so many – Boatswain’s Mate Second Class Joe George is a genuine American hero,” said Flake. “I’m humbled to join Pearl Harbor survivors Donald Stratton and Lauren Bruner - heroes in their own right - and the families of Joe George and the men whose lives he saved, in this worthwhile effort.”
George was serving aboard the USS Vestal, a repair ship moored alongside the USS Arizona, when the Imperial Japanese Air Service attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. When the Arizona suffered a direct hit by a Japanese bomb and began to sink, George spotted six severely injured sailors trapped in the Arizona’s control tower - Seaman First Class Harold Kuhn, Seaman First Class Russell Lott, Gunner's Mate Third Class Earl Riner, Boatswain's Mate Second Class Alvin Dvork, Seaman First Class Donald Stratton, and Fire Controlman Third Class Lauren Bruner. 
Defying orders to immediately cut the Vestal free from the sinking Arizona, George first threw a heaving line between the two ships, enabling the wounded sailors to climb 70 feet hand-over-hand across the line to safety. Two of those sailors would succumb to their injuries in the weeks following the attacks, while the four others would recover, serve honorably during World War II, and go on to live long lives.
Stratton and Bruner, along with George’s family, and generations of children and grandchildren who owe their lives to George’s life-saving actions are now urging Congress to secure recognition for George. During a recent meeting in which Stratton and Bruner shared firsthand accounts of George’s heroism, Flake committed to spearhead the resolution. The resolution is cosponsored by U.S. Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.). Flake also plans to submit the resolution as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act when it is brought to the Senate floor.   
Video of Flake’s remarks can be viewed here.

8/3/17 14:00,Service Academy Nominations,"￼
Dear Friend,
Every year, I am honored to nominate residents from Maryland's Third Congressional District for admission into the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the U.S. Military Academy and the U.S. Naval Academy. I am truly impressed and inspired by the caliber of candidates we receive each year, and I look forward to meeting the next class of prospective students.
Back in 2015, I nominated Patrick Nessler to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, where he was ultimately admitted. I was pleased to learn that Patrick has since excelled at West Point. His professor for Thermo-Fluids class recently wrote his parents to say Patrick is one of the best students he's had in 50 years of teaching! Patrick was kind enough to take some time out of his busy schedule to answer a few questions about his experiences at West Point and about what he hopes to achieve after graduation. See our full conversation here. 
For more information about service academy nominations, see here.  
The application for students seeking a nomination from my office for the class of 2022 is available here. Completed application packets are due to my office by 5 p.m. on Friday, October 20, 2017.  
 Sincerely,  ￼ John P. Sarbanes Maryland's Third Congressional District

8/3/17 13:01,Protecting Our Beaches ,"
  
￼

Dear neighbors,
As a lifelong resident of the Jersey Shore, I know firsthand what a tremendous resource our beaches are, both for those who live here and for those who come to visit year after year.   The Jersey Shore is a priceless natural treasure and is the engine for a tourism industry that generates $38 billion a year and directly supports almost half a million jobs—nearly ten percent of New Jersey’s entire workforce. That’s why I’ve spent more than two decades working to stop ocean dumping, to keep our beaches and sensitive coastal areas clean, and to stop the industrialization of our coast. 
Last month, I was proud to announce the reintroduction of the BEACH Act with Senator Bob Menendez. The legislation will protect our beaches by setting national coastal water quality standards, and providing federal funding to states to test water quality and notify the public when conditions are unsafe. The legislation would also authorize $30 million-a-year in federal assistance through 2021 to provide funding to monitor beach water quality and notify the public of health hazards.  The bill also requires the use of rapid testing methods and for states to track down sources of pollution. 
Subscribe to my e-newsletter Follow me on Facebook Follow me on Twitter
I also led a bipartisan group of the New Jersey Congressional delegation in a letter to the Trump administration opposing President Trump's plans for offshore drilling and asking that it consider the severe economic and environmental impacts oil and gas development in the Atlantic would have on New Jersey. You can also read the July 26 op-ed I authored with the head of the Sierra Club, laying out the strong arguments against offshore drilling. Elected leaders on both sides of the aisle have long opposed any efforts to potentially open the Atlantic to oil and gas development and we will continue to do so. 
If you have a moment, please visit my webpage to share your thoughts on drilling in the Atlantic and what we can do to protect our beaches. It is my job to represent you and I would appreciate your input on this crucial issue.
Serving You
Lastly, one of my privileges as a Member of Congress is to assist my constituents on a range of issues, whether it be help with a federal agency, ordering a flag, or requesting tours and tickets for a visit to Washington DC. Please take a moment to visit my website to find out how I can serve you.

8/3/17 12:42,ICYMI: Rep. Chris Collins on why he wants to repeal the SAFE Act,"￼ 
Dear Friend,
In case you missed it, I penned an op-ed in the Buffalo News about why I support repealing the SAFE Act.

Rep. Chris Collins on why he wants to repeal the SAFE Act
Last Friday, I introduced the Second Amendment Guarantee Act (SAGA), legislation that would protect the Second Amendment rights of all Americans by preventing states from exceeding existing federal regulations on rifles and shotguns.
This law would prohibit states from regulating, prohibiting, registering or licensing a rifle or shotgun for the sale, manufacturing, importation, transfer, possession or marketing beyond the requirements of federal law.
If enacted by Congress and signed by the president, SAGA would repeal much of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement (SAFE) Act and stop his ability to infringe upon the rights of law-abiding New Yorkers by instituting strict rifle and shotgun regulations.
While I understand the importance of the 10th Amendment of our Constitution, which provides states the responsibility to initiate laws and regulations, states like New York should not have the ability to take away the constitutional rights of their citizens. The Constitution grants American citizens the right to bear arms in the Second Amendment. This amendment shall not be infringed upon and unfortunately, that is what Cuomo’s SAFE Act does.
Let’s face it. The SAFE Act was a bad idea from the start.
The legislation was drafted in closed-door meetings. The text was not available until 20 minutes before the State Senate was scheduled to vote on the measure. And Cuomo bypassed any debate of the legislation in both the Assembly and the State Senate. That is a pretty cavalier attitude when it comes to taking away a constitutional right.
The SAFE Act also creates an incredible amount of confusion.
The Cuomo bill originally prohibited the sale of magazines that hold more than seven rounds. The problem, of course, was that seven-round magazines do not exist for most popular firearms. This provision of the bill was amended shortly after passage to allow for the sale of 10-round magazines, but now only seven rounds can be stored at any one time.
Adding to the confusion is that many of the SAFE Act’s outlawed long guns are safely used by sportsmen and women throughout the nation.
Despite promises that curbing the Second Amendment rights of Americans will reduce violent crime, the SAFE Act has had no meaningful impact on crime or gun violence. Statistics show that violent crimes where a firearm is used have remained static since 2013 in both New York State and Erie County.
The Founding Fathers envisioned a society where Americans have, and will forever possess, the right to keep and bear arms. The Second Amendment can only be interpreted one way, and that is it guarantees that Americans have the right to own a firearm. It is one of my most important duties, as a member of Congress, to assure that the rights granted to the people in my district are not infringed upon.
Upon passage, my SAGA legislation will stop the infringement of our Second Amendment rights by Cuomo and the state of New York.

Dear Friends, 

As you may know, I am deeply disappointed that Anthem has decided to pull out of the individual health care market in Riverside County, leaving patients with fewer options. Hardworking families are concerned about rising premiums and insurance companies leaving the Marketplace.

Anthem says they are leaving the market due to the uncertainty of whether or not the Trump administration will fund the Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) subsidies that help millions of hardworking families pay their co-pays and deductibles. By threatening not to fund CSRs, the administration is creating uncertainty for political gain, which is driving up premiums and forcing insurers like Anthem to exit the market. This is wrong.

Congress must put politics aside and work together in a bipartisan manner to immediately address patients' concerns by stabilizing the Marketplace. That’s why I have a plan: do no harm, stabilize markets, and take care of patients. Congress must pass my Marketplace Certainty Act now, which will permanently fund CSRs, bringing much needed stability to the Marketplace and providing additional assistance to help hardworking families afford the care they need.

Fortunately, patients in Riverside County have other insurance options in the Covered California marketplace. If you or someone you know is concerned about finding a health care plan, please feel free to reach out to Covered California by calling 800-300-1506 or visiting their website, or by calling my office at 760-424-8888. My top priority is ensuring people have affordable access to the care they need to stay healthy and we will help you navigate the system. 

Sincerely,
￼

Town Hall
We hope to see you at my Town Hall event this Monday, August 7, at 6:00pm! I’m looking forward to having a great discussion on issues that many of you have been contacting my office about recently. You can find all the information in the photo below.
Speaking with constituents is a significant part of what helps me do my job of representing Western North Carolinians in Congress. If you can make it, I’d love to see you there.
￼
Pray for Dr. Belcher
Please remember my good friend, Western Carolina Chancellor David Belcher, and his wife, Susan, in your prayers this week. Dr. Belcher just announced he is beginning new treatment after doctors recently discovered a recurrence of cancer.
The Belchers are dear friends, first class people, and beloved in the WCU community. Debbie and I wish them nothing but the best and are praying for strength for them both during this next phase of treatment! You can read Dr. Belcher’s full update here.

Veterans’ Solutions Seminars
Last reminder: My Veterans’ Solutions Seminars are this week! Our first session was this morning, and we still have two more to go. You can find all the information below or on my website here. 
Nothing we do as an office is more important than serving our country's military heroes. If you or someone you know could use assistance in working with the VA, please come--we'd love to see you and help in any way possible!

House Freedom Caucus Urging Investigation of Lynch, Comey
It's time to investigate the investigators.
If Congress is seriously interested in transparency and holding our government accountable, we should appoint a special counsel to investigate the Obama Justice Department's handling of the Hillary Clinton investigation. Just because Secretary Clinton lost the election doesn't mean that the troubling activity by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and FBI Director Comey should go unaccounted for.
My colleagues Reps. Jim Jordan (R-OH), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and I are pushing a bill to require the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel for that investigation. We joined Fox & Friends last week to talk about it. The House Judiciary Committee, led by Chairman Goodlatte (R-VA), has also officially called on AG Jeff Sessions to appoint a second special prosecutor in a letter. You can read more about that here.
We also discussed the latest healthcare news and the critical need for Congress to push forward until we keep our promise and repeal Obamacare while finding solutions to lower your costs. Watch the full video here.
￼  Interview with Fox News
Hearing on Free Speech
Last week, my colleague Jim Jordan (R-OH) led a joint subcommittee hearing on free speech in higher education--examining the increasing level of attacks on first amendment and free speech liberties on college campuses. Witnesses included Ben Shapiro and Adam Carolla, among others.
Obviously, there are several major legislative battles going on in Congress right now, but nothing is more fundamental to our nation than the right to speak freely and peacefully exchange ideas. Attacks on First Amendment rights cannot and will not stand. I'm grateful to my colleagues on the House Oversight Committee for addressing this topic, and I'm hoping we can commit ourselves to setting an example for honest and healthy debate about critical issues facing America. We the people would all be better off as a result.
You can watch my questioning here. You can also watch the full committee hearing here.

Healthcare Reform Update
In light of the news from last week on the Senate and Obamacare repeal moving forward, I want to make sure I'm clear on my message moving forward.
Obamacare repeal is not optional. American families are hurting under this broken law, and it's on Congress to keep working until we deliver on our promise to the voters. Nothing else should be acceptable to you. I'm committed to working around the clock until we see it done.
You can read more of my thoughts on the issue here, but make no mistake: the Obamacare repeal effort is not over. While I’m extremely disappointed in the result from last week, Republicans made a promise for seven years to repeal and replace this disastrous law. There is no excuse--zero--for us to stop working until we get it done.

Office Visitors
It was wonderful to welcome the Bowen family from Hendersonville and the Watkins family from Asheville to the office this week! Thanks to all of them for stopping by.
If you’re ever in Washington, D.C., please be sure to stop by Longworth 1024 and say hello!

Dear Friend, 

Last week, the Senate failed once again to take much-needed action on health care. Many of us were elected to Congress on the promise to repeal Obamacare, and I am disappointed in their failure to keep their promise to the American people. The House Freedom Caucus has introduced legislation to fully repeal Obamacare, and I am fully committed to following through on my commitment to my constituents. As we continue to work on health care, we are also focusing on another critical issue: tax reform.

The United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world which is why companies are leaving or sending jobs overseas in an effort to cut costs. By lowering the corporate tax rate, we can make American companies competitive again so they can hire American workers and provide our youth with jobs where they can develop skills that they can use throughout their careers. Congress must also lower the individual tax rates in order to put money in the pockets of the American people so they can cover the bills, put food on the table, and pay for health care costs that are going through the roof.

The House of Representatives also wrapped up a busy legislative schedule ahead of the August recess. Below are some of the highlights.

H.R. 3219 - Make America Secure Appropriations Act
The Make America Secure Appropriations Act includes $584.2 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Defense and an additional $73.9 billion in overseas contingency operations (OCO) funding for the global war on terror. This legislation also includes a much needed 2.4% increase in pay for military personnel.

I also introduced an amendment to withhold funds from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for the purpose of distressful or painful testing on puppies at VA medical facilities. I am pleased to report that my amendment was adopted unanimously by the House of Representatives, and I hope to see it signed into law very soon.

National defense is one of the few enumerated powers in our Constitution, and I believe a strong military is essential to the success of our nation. I am proud to support this legislation because it provides our military with the resources it needs to be successful in their efforts to make America secure.

H.R. 3364 - Russia, Iran, and North Korea Sanctions Act
The House passed legislation that expands sanctions against Iran for ballistic missile activity and human rights abuses, and expands sanctions against the Russian Federation for actions in Ukraine and hostile cyber activities towards the United States. The legislation also expands sanctions against North Korea related to recent weapons activities and human rights abuses. Additionally, this legislation reduces the executive branch's ability to terminate these sanctions, particularly in regard to Russia.

As President Theodore Roosevelt said, “Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.” I believe the United States must continue to lead the way against tyrannical dictators and take action when foreign governments threaten the security of Americans and our interests. I am proud to support this legislation and am glad to see that President Trump signed this legislation into law.

Freedom of Speech on College Campuses
As a former professor, I was given the opportunity to speak at the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on the freedom of speech on college campuses and where higher education has gone wrong. Click on the photo below to watch the full video.

￼

WIC Improvement Act
I introduced H.R. 3529, the WIC Improvement Act which would allow for multivitamin dietary supplements to be included in WIC food packages. The goal of WIC is to improve the health of pregnant women, new mothers, and their infants. Including multivitamin dietary supplements in the list of acceptable products that can be purchased is simply a common sense reform to improve the effectiveness of the program. 

My legislation will empower mothers with the choice to purchase multivitamins and other dietary supplements to compensate for potential nutrient deficiencies so we have healthier moms and healthier babies. To see the text of the legislation, click here.

Helping Veterans
The House passed a variety of bills to assist veterans with educational and career opportunities, accountability at the VA, improved health care, and more.  To see a list of the bills, please click here and here.

I am always interested in hearing your thoughts. If you have any comments, questions, or concerns, you can contact me directly by clicking here or by calling my office at (202) 225-2815.

8/3/17 11:24,GREAT NEWS! My bill to help Arla Harrell & his fellow veterans just passed Congress!,"￼
Friend, this is one of the greatest phone calls I've ever had the honor to make.
After a two-year fight, I've passed my bill to help Arla Harrell—a Missouri veteran who was intentionally exposed to mustard gas by the Department of Defense during World War II... and I was able to call his family personally to share the good news. 
My dad was a World War II veteran, so when a Missouri veteran is mistreated, I take it personally—and I'll take the fight to anyone, anywhere, to make it right. And I'm incredibly proud of what this means for these servicemen and their families. After all these years, our government is finally recognizing what these men sacrificed for their country and is following through on promises that are long overdue.
￼ Watch this news segment from KTVO to learn more about Arla and his family's fight for the recognition and benefits he deserves.
The bravery and resilience shown by Arla and his family as they fought the VA for decades is downright inspiring, and it's a reminder that we must never falter in our commitment to serve our men and women in uniform.
Learn more about the secret mustard gas experiments of World War II, and how the Arla Harrell Act will help right a serious wrong at: www.mccaskill.senate.gov/mustard-gas

8/3/17 11:06,Beyond resistance: Improving end-of-life care,"Update | Thursday, August 3, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the sixth day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: improving end-of-life care.
Every patient should be empowered to receive health care consistent with their values, goals, and informed preferences and to have those care decisions honored by their family and providers.
During passage of Affordable Care Act, I saw an opportunity to apply lessons learned in Oregon with its landmark comprehensive palliative care programs, which give patients more of a say about the medical treatment they want at the end of life. I worked to make sure that Congress included a payment for doctors to talk to patients and families about advance care planning in the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately, this provision wasn’t included in the final legislation due to a breakdown of the legislative process.
After years of advocacy, Medicare finally designed a benefit allowing doctors to receive reimbursement for voluntary advance care planning conversations with their patients. Last year, for the first time, Medicare paid for these critical doctor-patient discussions in the same way it pays for any other medical service.
My work to improve end-of-life care, however, is far from over. This year I introduced the bipartisan Patient Choice and Quality Care Act of 2017. This legislation builds on our successes and will provide high-quality care for individuals with advanced illnesses and enhance training, resources, and tools for providers, patients, and their families.
I’m proud to represent Oregon, which pioneered the death with dignity movement. Oregon law allows terminally-ill Oregonians to choose to end their lives through the voluntary self-administration of lethal medications prescribed by a physician. Patients and their doctors should have the ability to make these personal and private end-of-life decisions without federal interference. Everyone deserves to have their wishes for care understood, respected, and enforced.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

A Serious Threat to California’s Proud Citrus Heritage

￼
   
The recent discovery of the citrus greening disease on a residential grapefruit tree in Riverside is a significant cause for alarm for residential and commercial citrus growers.

Citrus greening is a disease that is spread by a pest – called the Asian citrus psyllid – as it eats citrus plant leaves. There’s no known cure for the disease, therefore it is fatal for infected trees. There is no health risk to humans. 

As you know, California has a proud and productive citrus history. California continues to be home to a $3 billion citrus industry that supports tens of thousands of jobs.

The citrus industry is working hand-in-hand with state and federal agriculture officials to try and contain the threat posed by citrus greening. Congress continues to provide significant resources for citrus greening containment and research, including a $25 million Emergency Citrus Disease Research program.

You can help too. If you have a citrus tree, it’s critical that you regularly inspect them for psyllids. 

For information on citrus greening and what to look for on your citrus trees please visit www.californiacitrusthreat.org.

                          Hello Friend, 
In July I hosted an immigration town hall. Those who attended heard about how we're working to help deported veterans and received more information about their rights and the naturalization process. Thank you to the panelists who contributed to a productive and informative discussion about immigration and immigrant rights. 
This past month we celebrated San Diego Pride and the progress made toward achieving equality. Team Vargas also attended the annual San Diego Stand Down and offered services and support to veterans. In addition, this month an American hero was honored at the commissioning of the USS Rafael Peralta.
Hope you're staying cool this summer! Please continue reading to get important updates and learn more about how I'm working for you in Congress. 
Best,  ￼

We danced and celebrated the great strides we have made toward LGBT equality at this year's San Diego Pride. I am proud to be a member of the LGBT Equality Caucus in Congress and will continue advocating for the rights of the LGBT community. We have so much left to fight for to guarantee equality and justice for all, but in the end, we will prevail. 

Supporting Veterans at San Diego Stand Down
￼
Providing services to homeless veterans at San Diego Stand Down
Team Vargas was at the annual San Diego Stand Down event helping provide services and resources to homeless veterans. According to the Veterans Village of San Diego, Stand Down was started with the belief in the triumph of the human spirit over extraordinary odds. It grew out of a conviction that the overwhelming number of homeless veterans on the streets of America is unacceptable, and that the veteran community itself must respond.
 For more information please visit the Veterans Village of San Diego website:http://vvsd.net/stand-down/

USS Rafael Peralta 
￼
USS Rafael Peralta commissioning
The USS Rafael Peralta was commissioned at Naval Air Station North Island. Sgt. Peralta was a Mexican native who attended high school and community college in San Diego. He is an American hero whose service and bravery embodies what it means to be a U.S. Marine. The ship's motto, ""FORTIS AD FINEM"" commemorates his character, ""Courageous to the End."" May this war ship move forward in its mission blessed with the spirit of its namesake.

Thune: Tax Reform Is Necessary for Economic Growth
￼
Click here or on the image above to watch the video.
This week, Sen. John Thune, a member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, outlined his priorities for tax reform.
We need to put our economy on a strong, healthy footing for the long term,"" said Thune. American families and businesses are counting on us to enact a tax system that works for them, not against them and that's what we intend to give them.
Thune has already gotten a head-start on tax reform by introducing several tax-related bills, including legislation to repeal the death tax, a bill to improve and modernize S corporations, the CHARITY ACT, the INVEST Act, and the NEW GIG Act, all of which he hopes will be included in the tax reform package that is being developed in the Senate.
Thune's full remarks can be found here. To learn more about how Thune plans to provide tax relief to American families and businesses, click here.

Dear Lindsey, 
Last week, the House passed a bill that would impose new sanctions on Iran to prevent them from obtaining nuclear weapons. What do you think is the best approach to dealing with Iran and its nuclear ambitions?


 

We should enact even stricter sanctions to affect the Iranian economy and prevent the creation of nuclear weapons.



We should repeal sanctions on Iran and pursue other diplomatic options to prevent the creation of nuclear weapons.



We should maintain the current amount and strength of sanctions.

Thune Urges Prioritization of Veterans Crisis Line on VA Website
￼
This week, Sen. John Thune urged Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary David Shulkin to more prominently feature the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL), a suicide crisis telephone line for veterans, families of veterans, and military personnel, on VA.gov. Specifically, it recommends that the VCL be given a dedicated button that is immediately identifiable upon visiting the VAs website, including its mobile version, or displayed in the first of four rotating banners (as opposed to the second). Thune hopes this modest change could make the VAs resources more readily identifiable to veterans who have decided to turn to help, when seconds count the most, and reduce the rate of 20 daily veteran suicides.
Last September, Thune introduced the Senate companion to the now-enacted No Veterans Crisis Line Call Should Go Unanswered Act, legislation directing the VA secretary to improve the response time and performance of the VCL. Sadly, the crisis of veteran suicide has persisted despite the VAs attention, but some veterans have stepped up to help their brothers and sisters and arms outside of the VA.
This includes South Dakota native Army Major Christopher Mercado, who Thune had the pleasure of meeting at a 2016 Memorial Day service in Sioux Falls and again in July 2017. Mercado was recently in Washington, D.C., to receive the Military Times' 2017 Army Service Member of the Year for his cofounding of the Objective Zero Foundation, a nonprofit that helps connect veterans to suicide prevention resources. Thune applauds all such efforts that seek to reduce the epidemic of veteran suicide.
The Veterans Crisis Line is a critical resource for veterans in crisis and their family and friends. Call 1-800-273-8255 and press 1 or send a text to 838255 to receive confidential support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

August 2, 2017

Aloha,
As the lead Democrat on the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations subcommittee, I'm glad to share that our effort to secure more than $266 million in military funding for Hawai‘i is well on its way. I know how critical this funding is to Hawai‘i, the success of our military, and our national security. I’m also pleased that this bill takes care of our local veterans, showing that we can build for the future while also honoring those who made it possible.
I joined Senator Whitehouse at the American Enterprise Institute to discuss our bill that requires companies to pay a fee based on their carbon pollution.  This legislation would use free enterprise to tackle climate change and does not expand regulations.  With carbon pricing, we have a window to give certainty to the energy industry, give reprieve to the climate, and give Republicans some revenue to get tax reform done.
Thank you to everyone who made your voices heard in the fight to save health care for millions of Americans.  I look forward to the committee hearings that were just announced and working together to make the needed improvements to the Affordable Care Act.
As always, please contact my office in D.C. or Hawai‘i if there is anything we can do.  We are here to help.
Mahalo,


Brian Schatz
United States Senator

Securing Funding for Hawai‘i
Earlier this month, the Senate Appropriations Committee passed the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018. Senator Schatz, Ranking Member of the Senate Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, worked to include $266.3 million for military construction and upgrade projects across Hawai‘i and $78.4 billion that will benefit veterans’ programs, including those in Hawai‘i.   “Our effort to secure more than $266 million in funding for Hawai‘i is well on its way,” said Senator Schatz, lead Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. “I know how critical this funding is to Hawai‘i, to the success of our military, and to our national security, which is why I’m glad to see this bill clear this hurdle. I’m also pleased that this bill takes care of our veterans in Hawai‘i, showing that we can build for the future while also honoring those who made it possible. I look forward to seeing this bill pass the Senate and be signed into law soon.”
The bill will now be reported to the full Senate for consideration.

Addressing Climate Change
Senator Schatz joined Senator Sheldon Whitehouse at the American Enterprise Institute to discuss their legislation that places a price on carbon pollution, significantly lowering the nation's greenhouse gas emissions while generating revenue to boost the economy.  
“A price on carbon pollution is one of the best options we have for bipartisan action, and it is one of the best options we have for tackling climate change full stop,” said Senator Schatz. “Climate change can no longer be a partisan issue.  Our bill would establish incentives that allow capital to flow and businesses to thrive when they use clean energy, letting the free market compete and innovate and make profits.  The price on carbon in our bill is predictable, straightforward, and gets the carbon pollution reductions we need to fight climate change.”

To watch their remarks at the American Enterprise Institute, click here.  Senator Schatz speaks at 12:00.

Promoting Early Childhood Development
Senator Schatz, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will award $2,725,121 to organizations in Hawai‘i to support their Early Head Start programs.
“As research continues to demonstrate how important early childhood development programs are to a child’s successful and healthy future, it is our responsibility to ensure that every child in Hawai‘i is given every opportunity to thrive,” said Senator Schatz. “This funding will help kids across our state begin their academic journeys on the best possible foot.” 
The Early Head Start program is operated by non-profit organizations across the country. The program seeks to provide support services to low-income families with infants and toddlers, as well as promote early childhood development, health, and school readiness. Parents and Children Together on Oahu will receive $1,407,681 and Maui Family Support Services will receive $1,317,440.
￼
Senator Schatz participated in Parents and Children Together's Read Aloud Wednesdays last year to mark the 50th anniversary of Head Start.

Make America Secure
 

Last week in the House we passed the Make America Secure Appropriations Act. Our number one constitutional responsibility in Congress is to provide for the common defense of this nation. That commitment is honored in this bill by increasing defense funding and restoring the cuts and budget shortfalls that have threatened our military readiness over the last eight years.  
This bill also makes critical investments in our nation’s border security by fully funding the president’s request for a southern border wall. The President has promised this funding, the American people want this funding, and today the House is making good on that promise. After all, border security is national security.
The Make America Secure Appropriations Act passed today includes FY 2018 Military Construction-VA, Defense and Energy and Water Development and Legislative Branch appropriations bills. The package also includes $1.6 billion for Trump’s border-wall construction.  In addition, it provides funding for eleven navy ships, including two destroyers and an amphibious assault ship, which will be built in at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula by the greatest ship builders on earth.  Flood Insurance 
Flooding historically and continuously is the most costly natural phenomenon that faces humanity. To help provide protection for America’s homeowners, Congress created the National Flood Insurance Program in order to offer affordable flood insurance. The NFIP is critically important to the Mississippi Gulf Coast. This program is renewed every five years and the current iteration is set to expire on Sept. 30.
All of us on the coast remember the 2012 reauthorization – FEMA decided to implement drastic rate increases on policyholders, threatening to destroy the housing market in the process. I, along with my Gulf Coast colleagues, joined with Northeast legislators to roll back these extreme rate increases in 2014, and as a result the insurance market became steady. But some in Congress, including some in my own party, are trying to raise rates yet again. Despite the fact that the NFIP was created decades ago to protect homeowners, many believe everyone’s rates should go up just to make sure it can fund outlier events like Hurricane Katrina. I will not let this happen.
Make no mistake, the NFIP program is in debt and needs updating. But if you take out Katrina and Superstorm Sandy, and the NFIP program is billions in the black. We can change the underlying problems without putting the costs on the backs of homeowners. These people have played by the rules, built to code, and FEMA changing the maps or adjusting rates is simply not fair. In June, the House Financial Services Committee finalized a package of bills that make a number of reforms to both the NFIP and FEMA. Some of these reforms are well-intentioned, such as trying to bring back a private flood insurance market and offering changes to how FEMA can re-map properties.
But some parts of the bill are unacceptable. There were several concerning provisions that would directly impact the component of affordability, including the elimination of grandfathered properties, higher rate increases, and a prohibition on policies for any new home construction. When we saw what the bill looked like, we immediately reached out to stakeholders across South Mississippi to help us fix the legislation.
Several weeks ago, I joined 25 other Republican members in writing our House leadership to oppose the Financial Services Committee bill in its current form. This was enough votes to kill any bill on the House floor. And they listened. The new draft has removed the harmful provision that prohibited new construction in special flood hazard areas, lowered the proposed rate minimum annual rate increase, and preserved grandfathering.
I also think it’s important to know that there are a number of other NFIP reauthorization options on the table in Congress, some of which will be weaved into the final product. One of the best is the SAFE NFIP Reauthorization Act of 2017, which I co-sponsored in the House among a bipartisan group of Members and Senators. This bill reauthorizes the NFIP for six years, caps any rate increases even further, freezes interest payments on the NFIP debt (freeing up more funds for disaster response), and allows greater access to pre-disaster mitigation funds. The Senate companion bill has wide support as well. This is the gold standard we would like to see passed in the House and Senate, that provides the ultimate protection for homeowners.
As usual, some people are playing chicken little with the flood reauthorization, screaming about drastic rate increases as if the sky is falling, but guess what is not, Congress, especially the coastal delegation. We will not let this happen. Our number one goal is to ensure flood insurance remains available and affordable, and any NFIP reauthorization must meet that goal or I will see that it is never signed into law.

Dear Friend,
As always, there's a lot of news coming out of Washington, but I wanted to pause to share some positive news for Delawareans from one of the committees on which I serve: the Senate Appropriations Committee.
First, a quick note about the committee itself.  The Appropriations Committee is among the most important in Congress, because it decides each year how, exactly, the federal government will direct investments on a wide range of important programs and activities from roads and bridges to schools to national parks. To do that, the Appropriations Committee is charged with passing twelve different appropriations bills representing the wide range of federal discretionary programs that Congress must review and approve annually. In 2013, I was honored to be named to the committee, and it was the first time a senator from Delaware had become a member in 40 years.
Republicans and Democrats came together last week to pass a number of important bills out of committee that can make a real difference in our home state. The bipartisan bills we just passed support state and local law enforcement, economic development, advanced manufacturing, scientific research, transportation infrastructure, and affordable housing.
For example, one of the appropriations bills we passed last week provides funding to the Department of Commerce, Department of Justice, and federal science programs. This bill invested in numerous programs from which Delawares law enforcement community has benefitted. As co-chair of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus, I fought to ensure that $22.5 million in funding would go to the Bulletproof Vest Partnership, which means millions of law enforcement officers are safer when they go to work every day. I also advocated strongly for $15 million to fund the Manufacturing USA program, and $130 million for the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), the only public-private partnership dedicated to providing technical support and services to small and medium-sized manufacturers. I also fought to protect Delawares coastal and ocean resources by funding the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NOAA programs that support coastal management and resiliency, the Sea Grant College Program that benefits UD's Lewes campus, and estuary research and education.
For the appropriations bill that provides federal funds to the Department of Transportation, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and other federal agencies, we included funding to continue to invest in our transportation network as well as to ensure that housing is affordable, safe, and reliable for Delawareans.
I advocated for $1.6 billion in federal support for Amtrak.  I also fought for related rail development programs, including $92.5 million for Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI), $26 million for Federal-State Partnership for State of Good Repair, and $5 million for Restoration and Enhancement Grants. This funding will continue to ensure that rail passengers are able to easily and safely move to and from Wilmington for business and personal reasons. 
I fought for $950 million in HOME Investment Partnership funding, which supports programs like tenant-based rental assistance, housing rehabilitation, assistance to homebuyers, and new construction of housing; $3 billion in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Programs, that provide resources to address community development needs; and $10 million in funding for the Self-Help Ownership Opportunity Program (SHOP), which allows non-profit organizations to purchase home sites and develop or improve the infrastructure needed to set the stage for sweat equity and volunteer-based homeownership programs for low-income persons and families.
These are just a few of the many federal programs that matter to Delaware and the country. Thats why I worked so hard to fight for them in the Appropriations Committeeand thats why Im so proud that they received strong, bipartisan support in the committee, especially in light of the fact that many of these very programs (e.g. Amtrak, MEP, HOME, CDBG) were either severely cut or eliminated in President Trump's proposed budget.  We still have a lot of work ahead, though.  These bills still need to be passed by the full Senate and House of Representatives before they can be signed into law by the President, but we're making real progress, and I want you to know that throughout this process, I'm fighting for Delaware every step of the way.
Sincerely,
￼

Dear Friend, 
 
After seven months of the 115th Congress, I want to provide a status report on where the major legislative issues stand.  While some in the media may be telling a different story, we have seen a lot of progress on many of the issues important to our area and to our country.   
 
As an overview, the charts below show how many bills have passed the House and how many bills have been signed into law this year as compared with the same period in prior administrations.  As you can tell, this year is well above average.

￼
 
                
                               ￼
     


Below are some highlights and issues we have addressed so far, including bills that I have introduced; as well as links to more information. 
 
Regulations and Washington Overreach 
 
Reform and Overturn:  Regulations have been a major focus of the 115th Congress.  The House has worked to restructure how the bureaucracy makes regulations and how the courts litigate regulations.  We also used the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to successfully overturn 14 harmful, Obama-era regulations.  The CRA has only been used once before to overturn a regulation. 
 
Status: H.R. 427, the “REINS Act” - House passed
Status: H.R. 5, the “Regulatory Accountability Act” - House passed
Status: H.R. 21, the “Midnight Rules Relief Act” - House passed
Status: H.R. 998, the ""SCRUB Act” - House passed
Status: 15 separate, harmful, Obama-era regulations - 15 House passed, 14 Signed into Law 
 
Waters of the United States (WOTUS):  In February, I introduced a bill to clarify in statute what “navigable waters” means and especially what it does not. Placing a good definition in law will help ensure that the courts and future administrations will not revive attempts to regulate every bar ditch and puddle across the country with another misguided WOTUS Rule.  Legislation has also been signed into law that allows the Administration to withdraw the WOTUS rule without having to go through the existing processes and restrictions to repeal a rule.   
 
Status: H.R. 1261, the “Federal Regulatory Certainty for Water Act” - Introduced in the House
Status: H.R. 3219, the “Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018” - Signed into Law
 
Wall Street Reform:  One of the most burdensome regulatory laws we have worked to reform is the Dodd-Frank Act, which has hurt everyone from small businesses to homebuyers.  I cosponsored and the House passed H.R. 10, the “Financial CHOICE Act,” in June.  This bill repeals and amends several provisions of Dodd-Frank and aims to create a simpler and more transparent regulatory financial system to create jobs and boost the economy.  
 
Status: H.R. 10, the “Financial CHOICE Act” - House passed
 
Healthcare Reform
 
Obamacare:  The House passed a bill to repeal and replace the worst parts of Obamacare in May with a process that can avoid a Senate filibuster and pass with a simple majority vote.  The House has also passed several additional bills to address other issues with Obamacare and our health care system.  The Senate has not yet been able to pass a repeal and replace bill, but I hope they continue to work to lower prices and provide more choices to patients.  Obamacare is simply not working as promised.  We must continue to work for ways to stop the harmful effects of this law, control costs, and put patients in charge of their health care.
 
Status: Obamacare repeal and replace - House passed 
Status: 7 other bills to improve healthcare  - House passed 
 
Private Property Rights
 
BLM Red River:  This Congress, I introduced H.R. 428, the “Red River Gradient Boundary Survey Act,” which passed the House in February, and the Senate held a hearing on Senator Cornyn’s identical bill last month.  This bill seeks to end questions of disputed land along the Red River to protect private property rights from federal ownership claims.  
 
Status: H.R. 428, the “Red River Gradient Boundary Survey Act,” - House passed
 
Immigration and Border Security
 
Immigration Reform: Our immigration laws are in need of a major overhaul, and the House has passed important bills to address this issue.  The House has focused on making state and local governments ineligible for certain federal funds if they have “sanctuary” policies in effect.  “Kate’s Law,” inspired by Kathryn Steinle will strengthen the criminal penalties for people who attempt to illegally reenter the country after being convicted of certain felonies. 
 
Status: H.R. 3003, the “No Sanctuary for Criminals Act of 2017” - House passed 
Status: H.R. 3004, “Kate’s Law” - House passed 
 
Border Patrol Agents: The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has struggled to recruit and hire additional agents because of the pre-employment polygraph requirement, and as a result, is understaffed.  The House passed legislation to allow the Commissioner of the CBP to waive the polygraph requirement for candidates who have already been vetted and have served as either a law enforcement officer or a member of the Armed Services and have a security clearance.  
 
Status: H.R. 2213, the “Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act of 2017” - House passed
 
Human Trafficking 
 
Protecting Americans: Human trafficking is a global problem.  This is an issue that must not be ignored or underestimated - the safety of our families relies on it.  There is no international system in place to combat human trafficking effectively, and we must do better here at home.  Congress has made this issue a very high priority. 
 
Status: 16 Human Trafficking Bills - House passed 
 
Veterans' Affairs 
 
Supporting our Veterans: Meeting our commitments to our veterans and their families is one of the most important responsibilities of the federal government.  These men and women have put their lives on the line to keep our country safe, and they all deserve our best in return.  
 
Status: S. 1094, the ""VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act"" - Signed into Law
Status: Senate companion to H.R. 369, the ""Eliminating the Sunset Date of the Choice Act"" - Signed into Law
Status: H.R. 244, the ""HIRE Vets Act"" - Signed into Law
Status: 30 Veterans’ Affairs Bills - House passed
 
National Security 
 
Rebuilding Our Military:  The House passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2018 when I introduced as Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.  The bill covers the wide range of programs and activities carried out by the Department of Defense and portions of the Department of Energy.  The NDAA also supports Sheppard Air Force Base, Bell Helicopter, and Pantex in our local area. 
 
Status: H.R. 2810, the “National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2018” - House passed
 
Sanctions on Hostile Regimes: It is our responsibility as the federal government to make sure that Americans are safe. The House has taken several votes to combat global adversaries through stricter economic restrictions. 
 
Status: H.R. 1644, “The Korean Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions Act” - House passed
Status: H.R. 1677, the “Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act” - House passed 
Status: H.R. 3364, the “Russia, Iran, and North Korea Sanctions Act” - House passed, Senate passed, Signed into Law 
 
Supreme Court 
 
Neil M. Gorsuch: This year, President Trump nominated Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, and the Senate confirmed him by a vote of 54 to 45.  This confirmation will have a positive impact on the Supreme Court for decades to come. 
 
Status: Neil Gorsuch - Senate confirmed 
 
Looking Ahead
 
Overhauling Broken Tax Code:  The first bill I introduced this Congress was H.R. 198, the “Death Tax Repeal Act,” that will completely and permanently repeal the federal estate, gift, and generation-skipping taxes.  Death should never be a taxable event.  Small business owners, farmers, and ranchers are especially vulnerable to this tax, making it more difficult for future generations to build upon their family's hard work.  President Trump's tax reform proposal and the House Republican “A Better Way” plan both include a repeal of the death tax.  As we work with the Administration to fix our broken tax code, I will continue to push for a full repeal of the death tax.
 
Status: H.R. 198, the “Death Tax Repeal Act” - Introduced in the House
 
I invite you to learn more about these issues and others by visiting my website here.  Have a question you would like answered?  Please contact me by phone, letter, e-mail, or on Facebook.
 
As always, I appreciate hearing from you.

August 2, 2017
 
Dear Friends,
We're hitting the home stretch of summer- and there's lots of big news going on in our wonderful state, so let's get right to it!

Foxconn Is Coming:
Awesome news for Wisconsin, as international electronics company Foxconn has announced that it will be coming to America's Dairyland with a multi-billion dollar investment. When you combine our state’s work ethic with the ideas from our state and national leaders, good things are bound to happen. With Foxconn coming to Wisconsin, we are on track to create thousands of jobs, offer an average base salary of over $53,000, and generate economic activity throughout the state!

Honoring Hmong Freedom Fighters: 
I recently co-introduced a bipartisan resolution with Wisconsin Congressman Glenn Grothman to honor Hmong freedom fighters who heroically supported and defended our United States Armed Forces in Southeast Asia. There are over 50,000 Hmong people in Wisconsin, and many of them have served in defense of America.

Survey on Repatriate Our Patriots Act
Dear Lindsey,  Last week, I introduced the Repatriate our Patriots Act, a critical piece of bipartisan legislation that brings home deported veterans and expedites their citizenship application process. The bill would allow deported veterans who were honorably discharged or released to go through the naturalization process abroad, expediting the citizenship process, and bringing them home to the country they fought for.   Many of these honorably discharged veterans are highly decorated and had clean records prior to serving. At the same time, many suffer from PTSD and other combat injuries incurred because of their service to the nation. Many served under the impression that their service would earn them status as permanent residents, securing a place for themselves and their families in the United States.   Nonviolent offenses should not be a reason to force honorable veterans from the only home that many of them have ever known. The Repatriate Our Patriots Act would allow veterans deported for nonviolent offenses to return to the United States as a lawfully admitted permanent resident. 

Do you believe that we should allow these veterans re-entry into our country? 

A. Yes, they are heroes and deserve to come home.



B. Yes, but we must maintain vigorous and thorough vetting procedures.



C. No, nobody should receive preferential treatment in the immigration process, regardless if they served or not.



D. No, these are people who have committed crimes and we should not willingly allow criminals back into the country.

Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the fifth day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: the need to advance compassionate solutions to treat mental illness and promote healing.
We see more and more evidence that individuals in our community aren’t receiving critical, necessary mental health services. Emergency rooms and jails, sadly, are becoming primary sites of care for individuals in the midst of a mental health crisis. We must find better, more compassionate ways to help our most vulnerable who suffer from severe and persistent mental illness.
I was proud to help pass the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act last year. This legislation was a starting place for expanding federal resources and removing barriers towards mental health treatment. But more must be done. We need to invest in prevention, funding treatment, and building tools to provide care and healing for individuals with mental illness.
Mental health treatment can be difficult to find. Oftentimes patients who seek help are placed on waiting lists or turned away for a lack of space or providers. There simply aren’t enough providers or mental health facilities. To address this, I support the Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment Accessibility Act, which would provide more funding and better loans to create new mental health and substance abuse treatment clinics. I also support the Medicare Mental Health Access Act, which would expand the types of mental health providers who can treat Medicare beneficiaries. Finally, I’m a strong advocate for the Medicaid Bump Act of 2017, which would increase funding for state Medicaid programs in order to provide more mental and behavioral health services. Together, these bills will help increase the number of clinics, providers, and incentives for states to provide services.
I will continue to fight in Congress for better resources for mental health systems. These are issues that affect us all in our communities – it’s far past time that we stop ignoring them and find solutions that promote healing.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

From the Hill to the Mountains
The Opioid Crisis is a National Emergency
When I’m on the ground in my home state of West Virginia and when I hear the stories of those struggling with opioid addiction it’s obvious our country is in crisis. Declaring a national emergency will allow the Administration and Congress to act with the immediacy that’s needed to end this epidemic. 
This report outlines key provisions that I have been fighting to institute for years. We need to require prescriber education, expand substance abuse treatment through Medicaid, strengthen interstate data sharing between Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs), federal healthcare systems and the VA to better share opioid prescribing data, and we must enforce mental healthcare provisions that require insurance companies to treat mental health issues the same as physical health issues. 
This report also includes provisions like that included in Jessie’s Law to ensure that substance abuse treatment records are more easily shared among medical professionals. We must take these commonsense and meaningful steps in order to start reversing the opioid epidemic.
 
On the Road
Sending Prayers for Those Affected by Recent Flooding
On Monday I visited Rachel, Mannington, and my beloved hometown of Farmington, which were among the towns that faced recent flood damage. I have loved this town and its people all my life. Farmington is the town I grew up in, the town my parents grew up in. It is where I learned the importance of giving people a hand up when they’re down. I know the strength of the people there, and in all of the affected counties. There is nothing that can replace what some people have lost and now, it is more important than ever to keep our strong West Virginian attitudes and keep spirits high to help those who were hurt the most.  I’ve been in touch with state and local officials and my offices are ready to assist in any way possible. Gayle and I send our thoughts and prayers to everyone impacted by this flooding.

How May We Help You?
I truly appreciate the opportunity to hear from West Virginians. As your U.S. Senator, I am proud to be your voice with government agencies during your time of need. My goal is to provide top-notch customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me, or who may need help.  I have a team of caseworkers in each of my four offices to help you with matters of concern. While I have no direct jurisdiction in the administrative matters of any federal, state, or local agency, I welcome the opportunity to assist you with whatever problem you may be experiencing and ask that full consideration be given to your case.
Recently my office was able to help Ronnie Sanford from Morgantown, West Virginia.  Ronnie was diagnosed with Heart and Kidney Failure and spent 11 weeks in the hospital waiting for a transplant that never came.  In May, he lost his WV Medicaid and was removed from the transplant list because he would not have funds nor the insurance to pay for the post-transplant medications.  Gerrie Greene, caseworker in my Washington DC office, successfully worked with the Tiger Catastophic Commission Fund as well as Medicare Part D to get him reinstated on the transplant list.  If you need help with health insurance or know of someone in need of assistance with the VA, Social Security, Black Lung benefits, or recognition, please let me know.

8/2/17 5:19,Human trafficking isn't a partisan issue,"￼
It's just not. That's why I'm joining 17 of my Republican colleagues—including Senator Rob Portman from Ohio, and my fellow Missouri Senator, Roy Blunt—and many Democratic colleagues, to make sure that websites like Backpage (the number one online marketplace for sex in the U.S.) can be held liable and brought to justice.
￼ PHOTO: Senator Portman and I release our report, Backpage's Knowing Facilitation of  Online Sex Trafficking
For years, Senator Portman and I investigated Backpage to get the truth about the company's business practices, and earlier this year, we released a report outlining our findings. What we saw, frankly, was shocking. Backpage was knowingly facilitating the sale of children on its website, and deleting the evidence instead of alerting law enforcement. Using the documents we collected over the course of our two-year investigation, we joined with several other members of Congress to urge the Department of Justice to launch a criminal review of Backpage.
But until our investigation blew the lid off of Backpage's activities, the company successfully shielded itself from accountability using a federal law that was designed to protect online platforms. Our bipartisan bill today would change that, and it would protect Missouri families by making clear, to any company, that the law will not shield them if they choose to go into business with sexual predators.
As a former prosecutor of sex crimes in Kansas City, I refuse to stand by while companies sell children for profit. I was proud to stand with my colleagues to introduce this bill, and I'll continue fighting tooth and nail to protect our kids from this unspeakable evil.
SCROLL DOWN to see a timeline of my and Senator Portman's fight against Backpage. Learn more at mccaskill.senate.gov/backpage:  ￼

Thank You for Your Support
I was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support following the announcement of my health challenge. From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you for your well-wishes and support. I look forward to keeping up a work schedule in Arizona as I receive treatment at Mayo Clinic this summer, and will return to the United States Senate at the conclusion of the August recess.

The Need for Civility and Bipartisanship
After a week of rest with my family in Arizona, I returned to Washington last Tuesday to continue the people’s work in the United States Senate. Upon my return, I spoke on the Senate floor on the current state of politics in our country and need for civility and bipartisanship. As I stated in my speech, the success of the Senate is important to the continued success of America. This country -- this big, boisterous, brawling, intemperate, restless, striving, daring, beautiful, bountiful, brave, good and magnificent country -- needs the U.S. Senate to help it thrive. That responsibility is more important than any personal interests or political affiliations. 
Watch my entire speech below.
￼
 
The Best Path Forward for Health Care
Last week, after a series of votes on health care legislation, I voted “no” on the so-called “skinny repeal” of Obamacare. From the beginning, I have believed that Obamacare should be repealed and replaced with a solution that increases competition, lowers costs, and improves care for all the American people. It was clear to everyone that the skinny repeal would not accomplish those goals. 
I’ve stated time and time again that one of the major failures of Obamacare was that it was rammed through Congress by Democrats on a strict-party line basis without a single Republican vote. We should not make the mistake of the past that led to Obamacare’s collapse, including in my home state of Arizona where premiums are skyrocketing and health care providers are fleeing the marketplace. 
Last week’s vote presents the Senate with an opportunity to start fresh. It is now time to return to regular order with input from all of our members --Republicans and Democrats -- and bring a bill to the floor of the Senate for amendment and debate. I have great faith in the ability of the Senator from Tennessee, Lamar Alexander, the Senator from Washington, Patty Murray, and others to work together in a bipartisan fashion to craft a bill that increases competition, lowers costs, and improves care for the American people. It’s time for members from both sides of the aisle to trust each other, stop the political gamesmanship, and put the health care needs of the American people first. We can do this.
 
Holding Russia Accountable for Election Attack
This month, I was proud to join my colleagues in voting to pass the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, legislation that strengthens and expands sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea. The legislation now moves to the president’s desk for signature. 
In just the last three years, Vladimir Putin's Russia has invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, threatened NATO allies, and intervened militarily in Syria, leaving a trail of death, destruction, and broken promises in its wake. And of course, last year, Russia attacked the foundations of American democracy with a cyber and information campaign to interfere in America’s 2016 election. This should outrage every American, and compel us to action. But in the last eight months, what price has Russia paid for attacking American democracy? Hardly any at all. This legislation would begin to change that by imposing new sanctions, strengthening existing sanctions, and requiring congressional oversight of any attempt to ease sanctions on Russia.
The Senate’s 98-2 vote to pass this legislation sends a strong message to Vladimir Putin and other aggressors that we will not tolerate attacks on our democracy. I hope the president will quickly sign this bill so we can finally respond to Russia’s attack on American democracy with strength, with resolve and with common purpose.
 
In Case You Missed It This July
Independence Day Message: This fourth of July I continued my long tradition of celebrating Independence Day with U.S. service members serving overseas in Kabul, Afghanistan. I can think of no place I would rather be on the day our country celebrates its independence than with the men and women selflessly serving overseas. It is always my special privilege to meet with Arizona’s own service men and women, and preside over the reenlistment of troops from across our great country who have made the ultimate commitment so that we might to continue to rely on their courage and patriotism.
IOI Pipeline Break in Nogales, Arizona: Last week, there was another severe break in the International Outfall Interceptor (IOI) sewage pipeline along the U.S.-Mexico border. The rupture could expose the Potrero Creek to over 10 million gallons of untreated sewage that flows through the Santa Cruz River, impacting countless communities in its path. I sent a letter with Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and U.S. Representatives Martha McSally (R-AZ) and Raúl Grijalva (D-AZ) urging the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) to address the breach and prevent ruptures from taking place in the future.
My Bill to Repeal the Jones Act & Promote Free Trade: Earlier this month, I reintroduced the Open America’s Waters Act of 2017, legislation that would repeal the archaic Jones Act of 1920 and promote free trade for the benefit of American businesses and consumers.
The Retaking of Mosul: This month Iraqi government and its military forces, along with its U.S. and coalition partners retook Mosul, marking an important success in the campaign to defeat ISIL. It is now incumbent upon all of these various actors to formulate a comprehensive strategy to both rebuild Mosul and address the terrorist threat that ISIL will continue to pose.  
Death of Nobel Peace Prize Laureate & Human Rights Advocate Liu Xiaobo: The death of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dr. Liu this month, after Chinese officials refused his release despite his grave medical condition, represented an egregious violation of the fundamental human rights Dr. Liu spent his life fighting to uphold. The United States of America needs to make clear that we will not tolerate China’s pervasive violation of human rights.
Reports Regarding Program to Assist the Syrian Opposition: If this month’s reports indicating that the administration is ending a program to assist the Syrian opposition are true, the administration is playing right into the hands of Vladimir Putin. Assad's removal from power must be a pillar of the American strategy to end the brutal conflict in Syria, which has fueled ISIL’s growth through its cruelty, extended malign Iranian influence, and undermined broader regional stability.
Flight Suspension of Marine Corps KC-130Ts: The recent loss of 16 service members in a KC-130T crash again reminded us of the dangers our men and women in uniform face on a daily basis, and the sacrifices they make in combat and in training. While the investigation into the accident is ongoing, I commend the leadership of the Marine Corps for taking the precaution of suspending KC-130T aircraft flight operations. The readiness and material condition of the aviation arm of the Marines is a top priority and the Senate Armed Services Committee will continue to work closely with the Services to ensure the safety of our service members.
50th Anniversary of the USS Forrestal Fire: Fifty years ago this month, our country lost 134 brave sailors and Marines to a tragic fire aboard the USS Forrestal. Two-hundred and ninety-five people were killed or wounded. Let us always remember their sacrifice.

8/1/17 19:41,A Bipartisan Fix to Our Affordable Housing Crisis," 

￼


Fellow Washingtonians,
An affordable housing crisis is happening across our country. 
If we don’t take action now, as many as 15 million Americans will be spending half their monthly income on rent by 2025.
That's why I requested today's hearing, to address the worsening affordable housing shortage gripping our nation, and discuss my Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act, that would expand the successful Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) - our most effective tool for addressing America's affordable housing crisis. 
WATCH: Senate Finance Committee Hearing on the Affordable Housing Crisis
￼
Under my proposal, which is cosponsored by Finance Committee Chairman Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Ranking Member Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), and 16 others, the expanded LIHTC would help create or preserve approximately 1,300,000 affordable homes over a 10-year period – an increase of 400,000 more units than is possible under the current program.
Senators from both parties spoke in support of the LIHTC program, presenting an opportunity for bipartisan action as tax reform negotiations begin.
“One reason I support the LIHTC is that it… allows decisions on housing to be made within the communities where the housing is needed while involving the private sector."" - Senator Hatch (R-UT)
""The LIHTC is a critical tool."" - Senator Brown (D-OH)
“I’m a big supporter of Ms. Cantwell’s program... It has passed the test of time” - Senator Isakson (R-GA)
“The LIHTC is the major tool available and strengthening that tool is the most important thing I believe we can do.” - Senator Cardin (D-MD)
If we don't take action now, to bolster the program, it's likely that almost $1 billion in investments will be lost in this year alone.
According to the National Association of Home Builders, annual LIHTC development supports approximately 95,700 jobs and $9.1 billion in wages and business income.
“America's housing affordability crisis affects millions of families in urban, suburban, and rural areas nationwide, and the federal government must do everything in its power to help communities address it—beginning with expanding the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. We commend Senator Cantwell and her colleagues for pursuing a bipartisan solution to this pressing issue and urge every member of Congress to reflect on today’s hearing and support the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act of 2017.” - Anthony J. Alfieri, president, Affordable Housing Tax Credit Coalition. 
My bill would also allow the 58,000 homeless students in the U.S. to finally access the affordable housing units created with LIHTC, expanding development opportunities in rural and Native communities and providing flexibility and financial feasibility to developments so they can more deeply target their units to the neediest individuals, including the homeless.
Over the past year, I’ve met with local communities and visited affordable housing developments in Seattle, Tacoma, Spokane, Vancouver, Walla Walla, Longview, Kent, Bremerton, Bellingham, Portland, New York City and Salt Lake City and they've all told me the same thing: we need more affordable housing.
I hope you will join me as I continue fighting to expand the LIHTC and build more affordable housing, for more Americans.
As always, you can contact me with your questions and concerns through my website. Follow me on Twitter and Facebook to stay updated on the issues. Let's stay in touch!  Sincerely,
￼
Maria

 Home | Newsroom | Helping Iowans | Contact

Good evening –
Following last week’s debate over health care, I wanted to provide an update on the U.S. Senate's recent efforts to repeal and replace ObamaCare.
Read more below...


What happened last week? 
Last week, my colleagues and I debated the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare. Throughout this debate, I supported three proposals to repeal this flawed law and instead implement affordable, patient-centered health care solutions.   This support is a direct result of my commitment to provide Iowans with relief from the harm ObamaCare has caused. Medica remains as the only health insurance provider selling individual market plans in every county statewide for 2018, and folks turning to the state’s individual market for health insurance will see their premiums drastically increase, again.   To my disappointment, none of the proposals advanced.
The reality in our state is that continuing with the status quo is no longer an option. ObamaCare is failing, and we must take action to provide Iowans with real choices and access to affordable, patient-centered health care.
What happens next?
I am disappointed that the Senate was unable to advance important changes to ObamaCare at this time, but even though we fell short, I won’t give up.
In late June, I joined a group of my colleagues requesting the Senate work through the August state work period (also known as “recess”) to make progress on important priorities, such as health care. Majority Leader McConnell took our concerns to heart and delayed the August state work period by two weeks. In a letter to Leader McConnell this week, I stressed that the Senate should use this as an opportunity to begin working legislative efforts through our committees and engage with all of our colleagues to find a solution. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues on solutions that enhance competition, increase flexibility, constrain rising costs, and ensure that folks have a voice in their own health care.

I am honored to represent you in Washington, and am here to serve you. Your feedback is critical and I want to hear from you about your concerns, ideas and solutions. 
Additionally, if you are looking for more information, need assistance with a federal agency, or have questions or concerns you'd like to share with me, please do not hesitate to reach out. You can send me an email, call, or see our office locations by clicking here.

8/1/17 18:12,Homegrown Tech Workforce,"￼
August 1, 2017
Dear Friend,
If we want to build a vibrant economic future in New Mexico, we need to get serious about laying the right foundation now. I hope you can take a moment to read and share an op-ed I wrote in today's Albuquerque Business First about bipartisan legislation I introduced with Senator Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) to help provide New Mexico workers from all backgrounds with the skills and knowledge they need to fill good-paying tech jobs. 
As the technology sector continues to grow in New Mexico and across the country, we need to ensure that our students have the skills they need to compete for these high-paying jobs. Apprenticeships provide clear pathways from the classroom and practical experience to successful careers in growing tech fields. A great local example of what this model looks like at Central New Mexico Community College aired on KOB last month. 
New Mexicans are looking for real solutions to turn things around and address the systemic challenges our state faces. We are only going to grow if the direction we take is one that makes smart, forward-looking investments in our families and communities. 
Sincerely,
￼
MARTIN HEINRICH United States Senator

Viewpoint: NM must build a homegrown tech workforce. Here's one way to do it.

By U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich
August 1, 2017

New Mexico has long been at the center of technology innovation. Research and development at our national laboratories, universities and military installations has led to major breakthroughs in computing, energy, health care and national security.

The technology industry is a driving force in creating jobs and expanding economic growth. In 2016 alone, the technology sector contributed more than $1 trillion to the U.S. economy, employed more than 7 million workers and added more than 100,000 new jobs. Almost 50,000 New Mexicans work in the tech sector at both our federal research labs and in the private sector at innovative information technology, manufacturing and engineering companies. The average tech industry wage in New Mexico is $85,200 a year, which is double the average state wage.

Despite these impressive numbers, tech employers often say they can't find candidates with the right skills to grow their businesses. In the fourth quarter, there were more than 2,000 tech occupation job openings in New Mexico. Additionally, Sandia National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratories estimate they will need to fill over 5,000 vacancies in the next five years. Equipping our students and workers with the skills they need to fill those high-paying 21st-century jobs is essential if we want to build a vibrant economic future in New Mexico.

Post-secondary education is increasingly important for success in the modern economy. However, not every tech career requires a four-year degree - and that includes numerous positions at our national labs. For many career paths, complementing classroom training with practical on-the-job experiences is the most effective and efficient way for workers to develop the skills necessary to thrive.

Apprenticeships are a proven method to develop workers, but America lags far behind peer countries implementing them. That's why I introduced the bipartisan Championing Apprenticeships for New Careers and Employees in Technology (CHANCE in Tech) Act with Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) to encourage educators and businesses to start apprenticeship programs for the tech sector. This will connect more American workers to a growing sector where jobs are opening up every day.

Under the CHANCE in Tech Act, public-private partnerships would serve as intermediaries between employers participating in registered apprenticeship programs, industry and training partners, and government entities like state agencies and community colleges. Each intermediary would assess and train potential apprentices, lessening the regulatory burden on participating employers by taking on the responsibility of tracking success.

Community colleges have an important role to play in this effort because they understand the needs of local employers and can design programs and courses that are responsive to employers' current and future needs. The CHANCE in Tech Act was inspired by the New Mexico Information Technology Apprenticeship Program (NMITAP) at Central New Mexico Community College, which is using federal funding from the U.S. Department of Labor and partnerships with local technology businesses to build an information technology pipeline in Albuquerque.

Graduates of NMITAP learn new computer coding skills and earn industry-recognized credentials. They put those skills to use at local technology companies that provide work experience through apprenticeships. Jesse Grider, a New Mexico National Guard member who is enrolled in the program, said, ""Before the apprenticeship program, I had a little real world experience."" After his apprenticeship at local health technology company UnityBPO, Grider will have the skills and work experience for a long-term career.

For our state to remain competitive in the future economy, we need to recognize that learning and skill development for each New Mexican must continue over a lifetime. Investing in our workforce starts well before college or even high school. This is why access to universal pre-K is so important and why I am a strong advocate of the two-generation approach to support programs that provide opportunities for and meet the needs of parents and their children together.

We need our students and workers to be able to build their careers and start their families here in New Mexico. We have enormous potential to create jobs and major new industries if we can prepare our students and retrain our labor force for a lucrative high-tech job market. This is America's future, and one where New Mexico can shine - but only if we make the right choices today.

Democrats propose changes to health care, Republicans want to move on  House Democrats plan on unveiling a series of amendments and improvements to strengthen the Affordable Care Act. Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray have also announced the Senate health committee will begin holding bipartisan hearings on stabilizing the individual market.
+ Republican leaders in the Senate have indicated that they do not plan on continuing efforts on health care and will instead focus on other legislative priorities, including tax reform. Sen. John Thune said that the Senate has “had our vote, and we’re moving on to tax reform.” Thune’s comments clash with the administration’s priorities, with both President Trump and White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney lobbying the Senate to repeal the Affordable Care Act before moving on to other issues.
+ President Trump has threatened to withhold vital subsidies from insurers in order to pressure congressional Republicans to pass health care reform. The payments, totaling about $7 billion this year, are cost-sharing reductions that help insurers lower out-of-pocket costs for 7 million low-income Americans. 
Presidential commission urges Trump to declare opioid epidemic a “national emergency” The Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, led by Gov. Chris Christie, released a report Monday that called for more money for substance abuse treatment, expanded access to medication-assisted treatment, and help for states as they enhance their prescription monitoring programs. The commission also recommended mandatory education for doctors to treat drug addiction, which kills more than 142 Americans a day, and a new partnership with the pharmaceutical industry to develop non-opioid pain relievers.
￼
Fears rise of aggressive Russia, China, and North Korea  The Russian government is planning on moving as many as 100,000 troops to territory bordering North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states to conduct military exercises. Featured will be the First Guards Tank Army, a unit not seen since the Soviet Union’s collapse. Meanwhile, North Korea continues to develop missiles potentially capable of striking U.S. territory. Iran is beginning to challenge the U.S. by launching its first missile into space. Finally, relations with China (both diplomatic and military) are beginning to sour. All of these are fueling concerns that the U.S. may face an increasingly hostile international area.
+ While visiting Estonia, Vice President Mike Pence issued a warning to the Russian government that “[the U.S. hopes] for better days, for better relations with Russia, but recent diplomatic action taken by Moscow will not deter the commitment of the United States of America to our security, the security of our allies, and the security of freedom loving nations around the world.”
￼
Another round of staff changes in the White House  General John Kelly, President Trump’s new chief of staff, moved quickly firing Anthony Scaramucci 10 days after he was hired as White House communications director. Kelly’s abrupt move came after Scaramucci’s salacious, highly criticized interview with The New Yorker last week. Scaramucci is the third high-profile departure from the Trump White House in recent weeks, coming after Trump replaced former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus with Kelly. Former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer previously announced his intent to leave the administration.
+ Recommended reading from Republican Sen. Jeff Flake: “My Party Is in Denial About Donald Trump.”
Kushner says Trump team too disorganized to collude  “They thought we colluded, but we couldn’t even collude with our local offices,” President Trump’s son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner said in an off-the-record meeting with congressional interns. Kushner also discussed his goals for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and working in the White House. 
￼
Millennials and Gen Xers led the way in 2016 election According to a new study from the Pew Research Center, Baby Boomers and older voters did not represent the majority of voters in a presidential election for the first time ever. Millennials and Generation Xers cast 69.6 million votes in the 2016 general election, slightly above the 67.9 million votes cast by Baby Boomers and older generations. A total of 137.5 million votes were cast in the November election. Baby Boomers still account for the single greatest share of the electorate, at 48.1 million votes, but Boomers and older voters represented fewer than half of all votes for the first time in decades. 
+ Still, millennials are not voting as often as their counterparts. Only 49% turned out in 2016, whereas 69% of eligible Boomers and 63% of eligible Gen Xers voted. In Nashville, 47% of registered 18-24 year-olds voted, and 70% of non-voters were under 50. 
￼
Retired generals warn Trump transgender ban would degrade military readiness Today, 56 retired generals issued a statement opposing President Trump’s ban on transgender individuals serving in the military. The statement, issued by the Palm Center, reads in part, [fix spacing] “ This proposed ban, if implemented, would cause significant disruptions, deprive the military of mission-critical talent, and compromise the integrity of transgender troops who would be forced to live a lie, as well as non-transgender peers who would be forced to choose between reporting their comrades or disobeying policy. As a result, the proposed ban would degrade readiness even more than the failed ‘don't ask, don't tell’ policy.”
￼
Court rules for gray wolf The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has ruled against the Department of Interior’s 2011 decision that delisted the gray wolf from Endangered Species Act protections. In restoring protections for the wolves, the court ruled that Fish and Wildlife Service regulators “failed to reasonably analyze or consider two significant aspects of the rule — the impacts of partial delisting and of historical range loss on the already-listed species.”

Healthcare Update
Dear Friends, 
Since I arrived in Congress, as a part of my healthcare tour across the Second Congressional District, I have had wonderful conversations with doctors, nurses and patients at medical centers and hospitals throughout our District. From Lankenau to Temple to Einstein and many other stops in between, I have listened and tried to hear from as many people as I can to get everyone’s perspective on our nation’s healthcare system. 
Earlier this year the Majority Party launched their attack on the Affordable Care Act (ACA). When it comes to healthcare, we can safely say the Majority Party's plans are entirely inadequate and would have a devastating impact on residents that live in our District, the Commonwealth and our nation.
As you know, last week the ""Skinny Repeal"" bill in the Senate failed to pass. What happened on the Senate Floor last week is not a victory but a much needed opportunity for President Trump and the Majority Party in both the House and Senate to focus on the needs of the American people. I’ve long said there is a big difference between governing and campaigning.  It’s time for the Republican Party and the President to govern.
We need to live the values laid out in the founding documents of our nation. As elected officials we truly are of the people, by the people, and for the people. This is our chance to roll our sleeves up and get about the business of governing. It’s time to stop the political finger pointing, lower the tone, and put the American people first to build a stronger tomorrow for our children and grandchildren.
I want to share a story with you about a woman I met earlier this year named Ms. Jones who has been on dialysis for two years. She receives dialysis treatment for several hours a day, three to four times a week. Even though Ms. Jones is in a tough situation, she had an incredible spirit and shared with me how if she didn’t have help from the state and the Affordable Care Act she wouldn’t be able to get the lifesaving care she relies on. 
￼
Speaking about the importance of quality, reliable healthcare with Ms. Jones at Davita Dialysis Center near UPenn. 
We know that each and every American deserves reliable, affordable healthcare. When we think about how the healthcare debate in Congress impacts the quality of life for Philadelphia and Montgomery County residents we are sharing the stories of people like Ms. Jones. Her story is like so many of our stories. I have been opposed to the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and will continue to work with my colleagues to improve it, hopefully in a bipartisan fashion. I will continue to speak up and speak out against the Majority Party's attack on our nation’s healthcare system, as their attacks are completely out of touch with the needs of the people. It’s time to stand united and come together to support a healthcare system that makes our neighborhoods less divided and more united. 
Senator Casey and I Sent a Letter to Save Cheyney University's Accreditation
I joined with Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey to send a letter to Frank T. Brogan, Chancellor of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education outlining why we must do everything we can to protect Cheyney University’s accreditation. 
As you may know Cheyney University, located just outside of Pennsylvania’s Second Congressional District, is the oldest Historically Black College and University (HBCU) in the country. After years of heartbreaking financial and enrollment trouble this September Cheyney is sadly on the verge of collapse and in danger of losing its accreditation. 
Our HBCUs are critically important to the strength and diversity of our nation. Our letter outlines how we have an obligation to protect both the institution and its significant societal contributions to our neighborhoods. 
A report issued by the United States Commission on Civil Rights reports that in our nation, HBCU graduates make up 40% of the African-American Members of Congress, 40% of engineers, 50% of lawyers, and 80% of judges.  For years, our HBCUs have produced amazing leaders that not only contribute to their respective fields, but who also pride themselves on their “lifting-while-they-climb” attitudes.
It’s time for the Commonwealth to stand together and stand united to ensure Cheyney University regains it’s strengthen and viability.

Meeting with Rabbis at Beth Am Israel 
This July, I had the opportunity to go on an extremely informative, encouraging and enlightening trip to Israel. While in Israel I spoke with policy makers, elected officials, and residents to hear their stories and learn more about their experiences. For me, it is always all about people. Talking to people is the only way to learn about their needs and figure out solutions.
We visited the vibrant and culturally diverse city of Tel Aviv, toured historic sites like Jerusalem’s Old City, took a trip to the Iron Dome to see firsthand what’s at stake when it comes to safety and security in the region, had a meeting at the Knesset, and visited many more memorable sites.
Throughout my visit in Israel, I was so impressed by the sense of pride everyone had in their neighborhoods. You may know that I talk a lot about the strength of our neighborhoods and making our neighborhoods nationwide that much stronger. I loved seeing that as pride in our neighborhoods is a theme near and dear to me.
￼

Now that I have had some time to reflect on my visit to Israel, it was nice to reflect and share more about my time away with local Rabbis from a variety of Congregations in our District. Over the weekend, it was wonderful to have such a thoughtful, productive conversation with Rabbis in our community at Beth Am Israel in Lower Merion. 
When we work together and listen to each other it is amazing what we can accomplish. I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to be a part of this very beneficial and valuable trip.
Middle Neighborhoods Featured in the Huffington Post 
Researchers at the Reinvestment Fund in Philadelphia report that 48 percent of city residents in the United States live in Middle Neighborhoods. Middle Neighborhoods are neighborhoods caught between growth and decline, these are neighborhoods that are generally affordable and functional, they offer a reasonable quality of life, but many are in danger of tipping towards decline if we are not careful.
­­­­­A host of facts such as a shrinking middle class, the suburbanization of jobs, obsolete housing styles, and dwindling homeownership rates cloud the future of our Middle Neighborhoods that serve as the lynchpin of success for most American cities and older suburbs.
With all of this in mind, our Middle Neighborhoods—that provide a substantial portion of local property-tax revenue—are often ignored by our policymakers who have focused on problems like concentrated poverty, gentrification, and the need for downtown revitalization.
￼
In an environment of proposals to severely cut funds for cities, the federal government would be wise to allocate some funds to test approaches to prevent the decline of America’s Middle Neighborhoods.  
There is not a one-size-fits-all approach for supporting Middle Neighborhoods. Something that works in one area of a city may not work in another due to a host of factors such as the average age of homeowners, the quality of housing stock, and other existing neighborhood assets. Targeted improvement strategies, such as Philadelphia’s Rebuilding Together, are working to increase both homeowner and neighborhood value through low-cost, high-impact home improvement projects.  
I know that together we will build stronger neighborhoods, block by block.

I voted three times last week to repeal and replace Obamacare, which President Trump recommended we do, but, unfortunately, the U.S. Senate did not pass a bill to repeal and replace the health care law.
I voted to take the next step toward what I believed was our best opportunity to repeal and replace Obamacare. This vote would have moved debate out of the Senate to a conference committee with the House of Representatives where we would have continued to work to give Americans more choices of health insurance at lower costs.
The Senate's failure to do this leaves an urgent problem that I am committed to addressing: Tennessee's state insurance commissioner says our individual insurance market is very near collapse. Unless Congress acts, many of the 350,000 Tennesseans who buy health insurance in that marketsongwriters, farmers, the self-employedface the real prospect of having zero options to buy insurance in 2018 and 2019.
I traveled around West Tennessee recently and spent some time in Lauderdale County at the Ripley Tomato Festival as well as the Alex Haley House and Museum, the boyhood home of my late friend and author of Roots. 
 
￼
￼
 
 
 
It was good to be Lauderdale County and enjoy some of the special attractions they have to offer. I attended several events at the Ripley Tomato Festival -- including the Saturday Salad lunch at the First Methodist Church, and I stopped by the Lauderdale County Chamber of Commerce tent at Ripley City Park.

 
 
￼
 
 
 
I revisited the Alex Haley House and Museum in Henning and enjoyed learning even more about Alex Haleys boyhood home from the museum director, Richard S. Griffin.
 
￼
 
 
 
My late friend Alex Haley lived his life by these six words, Find the good and praise it, and Im glad I was able to be a part of all of the good things happening in Lauderdale County.
 
 
Voting to fund meth lab cleanup and provide grants for roads and bridges  
On Thursday, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved three bills that provide critical funding for Tennessee projects. The Transportation, Housing & Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill includes grants for transportation projects like highways and bridges and a program that provides funding for economic development and housing in communities in Tennessee, as well as my provision directing the transportation secretary to issue a rule prohibiting the use of cell phones for voice calls on commercial flights.
The Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill includes funding to clean up methamphetamine labs and helps ensure the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is prioritizing the massive backlog of more than 73,000 unresolved workplace discrimination complaints it inherited from the Obama administration.
The committee also approved the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill that funds the U.S. Capitol Police, Library of Congress, and Government Accountability Office. 
 
￼
 
 
 
It was great to catch up with Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland on Wednesday and discuss all of the good things happening in Memphis. 
 
 
 
Funding energy research and supercomputing at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
Two weeks ago, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved legislation that will fund the Office of Science, which conducts basic science and energy research, and ARPA-E, which supports transformational, high-impact energy technologies. The bill also contains record levels of funding for energy research and supercomputing at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to improve water infrastructure, such as continuing work on Chickamauga Lock and dredging the Memphis Harbor McKellar Lake. As chairman of the subcommittee responsible for the legislation, I worked with the lead Democrat, Senator Feinstein, in a bipartisan way to ensure these important Tennessee projects were funded. You can read more about other priorities included in the bill here.
Labor committee approves nominees who can help return the NLRB to the neutral umpire it ought to be

On July 19, the Senate labor committee approved the presidents nominees, Marvin Kaplan and William Emanuel, to fill the two open seats on the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). For over 80 years, the NLRB has been tasked with acting impartially to resolve labor disputes. The board hasnt had its full five members in nearly two years  one seat has been open for 23 months since President Obama declined to nominate a Republican for the then-minority seat, and the other seat for 11 months.  My hope is that filling these seats will restore the NLRB to its intended purpose of acting as a neutral umpire after years of playing the role of advocate. It is important to American employees and employers alike that the Senate quickly confirm Mr. Kaplan and Mr. Emanuel to bring balance to the board and stability to our nations workplaces. 
Introducing Dr. Moe Khaleel, Associate Laboratory Director for Energy and Environmental Sciences at Tennessees Oak Ridge National Laboratory 
￼
On Tuesday, I introduced Dr. Moe Khaleel, Associate Laboratory Director for Energy and Environmental Sciences at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, before he testified at a Senate subcommittee hearing.  I emphasized how important it is to continue supporting the kind of government-sponsored research that helps develop new clean energy technologies. I think the best way to lower the cost of energy, clean the air, improve health, increase family incomes, and produce good-paying jobs is to double funding for basic energy research and drive American innovation, and we must continue to support the good work our national laboratories are doing.

 
￼
 
On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet with Claire from Germantown, Tenn., and Jackson from Knoxville, Tenn., during their visit to Washington as part of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundations 2017 Childrens Congress. Last year, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act, legislation I sponsored to help drive research discoveries predicted over the next decade by Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, including the development of an artificial pancreas to help children who suffer from Type 1 diabetes. 
Wishing Nashvillian Bill Hagerty well as he is sworn in as U.S. Ambassador to Japan
￼
 
On Wednesday, Senator Corker and I wished Bill Hagerty well before his swearing in as U.S. Ambassador to Japan on Thursday. Bill is headed to Japan not only being able to speak the language, but having lived and worked there, and understanding how close ties between Japan and the United States can create bigger paychecks for Americans as well as for the Japanese. There is no relationship more important than the one between the United States and Japan. And I would say there is no more important relationship between a country and a state than between Japan and Tennessee, so it is especially significant that a Tennessean will serve as ambassador. You can read my speech on the Senates confirmation of Bill Haggerty here. 
Voting to support Tennessee farmers and agricultural research at the University of Tennessee
Two weeks ago, I also voted to approve a bill that funds important agricultural programs that support the more than 66,000 Tennessee farmers and agricultural research at the University of Tennessee to help find ways for those farmers to grow better crops. The bill also funds the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the agency responsible for approving life-saving drugs and medical devices and getting them through the regulatory process and into doctors offices and patients medicine cabinets more quickly. The Department of Agriculture and the FDA are also responsible for protecting our nations food supply and preventing foodborne illness to help ensure that the food Tennessee families buy at their local grocery store is safe. 
 
￼
 
On Thursday, I met with Tennesseans participating in Girls Nation and Boys Nation, programs run through the American Legion Auxiliary and American Legion that bring two girls and two boys from each state to Washington, D.C., each year to meet with their senators and congressmen and participate in a mock Congress. I had the opportunity to represent Tennessee at Boys Nation when I was in high school and enjoyed the experience. 
EPA selects Oak Ridge to apply for a loan to improve water quality 
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has selected the City of Oak Ridge to apply for a loan through the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act Program. I sent a letter in May to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to express support for the citys efforts to build a new water treatment plant with funding through the program. Replacing the existing water treatment plant is crucial not only for Oak Ridges 30,000 residents, but also for the daily operations of the Department of Energys Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the National Nuclear Security Administrations Y-12 National Security Complex. You can read more here.
 
￼
 
Recently, I met with Melissa Collins, a teacher at John P. Freeman School in Memphis and finalist for 2014 Tennessee Teacher of the Year, and Karen Vogelsang, the 2015 Tennessee Teacher of the Year. We talked about what the Every Student Succeeds Act means for Tennessee, including that it gives teachers like Melissa and Karen more control of their classrooms.
 
 
Recommending ways the U.S. Department of Interior can move forward on two federal lands bills 
At a Senate Energy and Natural Resources subcommittee hearing two weeks ago, I talked with Acting Deputy Director for Operations at the National Park Service Robert Vogel about ways the department could move forward on two bills Ive cosponsored  the Every Kid Outdoors Act, legislation to provide young students with free national park entry, and the 21st Century Conservation Service Corps Act, legislation that creates a public-private partnership between federal agencies and the private sector to allow youth and veterans to participate in conservation corps.
I suggested the department consider a Red Team, like the one I supported for the Uranium Processing Facility at the Y-12 National Security Complex, and pilot programs as two ways to move forward on these pieces of legislation. Mr. Vogel agreed to take the recommendations back to Secretary Zinke. You can watch a video of my questions at the hearing here.
Praying for John McCain and Phil Roe
Those of us who know John McCain know his bravery and his grit. There is no one better equipped for a fight than John McCain, and Honey and I are sending our prayers to John and his family.
Phil Roe is a good friend, and Honey and I send our thoughts and prayers to Phil and his family for a swift recovery.

Dear Friend,
Last week was a busy time in Washington, and I wanted to give you a quick update on the latest news and announcements from my office. From joining President Trump to discuss gang violence in New York to passing critical legislation that helps U.S. veterans and strengthens homeland security, I'm working hard in Congress to deliver results to the hardworking families of Staten Island and South Brooklyn. 
	1.	Combating Gang Violence with President Trump: I traveled to Long Island with President Trump aboard Air Force One last Friday for an event focusing on gang violence in the region. As a former prosecutor, I know all too well the threats they pose. I support the President's work to help local and federal law enforcement dismantle MS-13 and similar gangs.
￼
	2.	Supporting U.S. Veterans:  Saying 'thank you' is not enough, and it's our duty to support and create effective solutions to the challenges U.S. military service members face when returning home. I'm happy to report that I helped pass a series of 8 bills to support U.S. veterans. The package of legislation includes measures to improve veteran education benefits, strengthen the quality of VA services, and enhance opportunities for businesses owned by veterans.    
	3.	Securing the Homeland: With my support, the House passed a package of appropriations bills to ""Make America Secure Again."" This legislation rebuilds our military, gives our troops a well-deserved pay raise, secures our borders, and includes funding for flood protection projects. Learn more about the bill here.< /span>
￼
	4.	Improving Emergency Preparedness and Response at FEMA: I met with newly-appointed FEMA Administrator Brock Long to discuss ways to strengthen U.S. emergency response and resiliency capabilities. As Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I look forward to working with Administrator Long to strengthen our anti-terror preparedness, improve storm resiliency capabilities, and address flood insurance affordability. 
￼
	5.	Working to End Sexual Violence on College Campuses: Ending sexual violence on college campuses is a priority issue for me and my colleagues on the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence. That's why we sent a letter to the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) calling for more transparency related to Title IX investigations -- which review incidences of sexual violence and harassment on college campuses. Learn more by reading the letter here. 
	6.	Holding Russia, North Korea and Iran Accountable: It's critical to national security that we continue to hold rogue nations accountable for their aggressive actions against the U.S. and our allies. That's why I voted to implement tough sanctions against Russia, North Korea, and Iran. This legislation will help deter threats from these nations including, election meddling, state-sponsored terrorism, and the testing of intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
Sincerely,
￼
Daniel M. Donovan, Jr.

11th District of New York

*Rep. Messer discusses military issues with Hoosier veterans. 
Dear Hoosiers,
I’ve been working to deliver on our promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. In May, I voted to pass legislation in the House of Representatives to do just that. The U.S. Senate, however, recently failed to pass healthcare legislation due to its outdated rules and procedures.
Please take a moment to answer the questions below and give your feedback as we continue this process.   
Have your healthcare costs increased, decreased or remained the same since Obamacare was enacted?
 

Increased



Decreased



Remained the same


 
Are you worse off, better off or about the same as you were before Obamacare was implemented?
 

Worse off



Better off



About the same


 
Now that the Senate failed to pass healthcare legislation, what actions should be taken?
 

Keep working to repeal and replace Obamacare



Keep working to repeal Obamacare



Work to make changes to Obamacare



Leave Obamacare in place and move on to other issues



Unsure

Dear Lindsey,
          Last week, I spoke on the phone with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Brock Long - he called me to say that at my urging, he would be giving Montana emergency funding to help address the severe drought and wildfires impacting much of our state.
          This historic drought in Montana is devastating family farms and ranches and as fires burn across our great state, we need to ensure Montana has the support it needs from the federal government. That's why Representative Greg Gianforte and I requested that FEMA reconsider Montana's request for eligibility for fire management assistance on the Lodgepole Complex fires, fires that have already consumed more than 270,000 acres. It was good to speak with Administrator Long and I'm glad he made the decision to grant emergency funding to Montana. I was also pleased to work with Secretary Ryan Zinke to get relief for ranchers hit by these fires. Secretary Zinke's announcement allowing for emergency grazing on the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge for those ranchers who lost grazing land in the Lodgepole Complex fires was welcome news. I also urged the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to grant emergency relief from certain trucking regulations to make it easier for Montanans to transport livestock, hay and supplies. FMCSA granted my request and it will help facilitate getting assistance to those who need it most. 
          Last week, I took to the Senate floor to talk about the drought in eastern Montana and the wildfires that are blazing all across our state.
￼
Click HERE to watch Daines remarks.
          These conditions in eastern Montana warrant relief from regulations that limit producers ability to use our lands in the best way possible. I was pleased by USDAs decision to allow impacted producers to best use the Conservation Reserve Program acreage for grazing, and I believe Montana producers unable to sleep at night for fear of losing the family farm deserve more support from those who have benefited from their legacy of hard work.
          I have and will continue to hold USDAs feet to the fire, urging additional emergency relief for farmers and ranchers. I have been engaging with producers, local elected officials and folks on the ground about what the lack of rain has meant for them and I understand the severity of the drought and the corresponding increased risk of wildfires.
          Right now, the nation's top ten wildfires are burning in Montana. Forest management reform is needed so that we can use proven tactics to reduce the threat of wildfires on our Montana communities and reduce the rate of spread and intensity of the fires that do occur. I have joined Senator Amy Klobuchar in sponsoring legislation to encourage partnerships between the Forest Service and State Foresters to carry out cross-boundary restoration projects that will reduce fuels and wildfire hazards across the country. These partnerships and projects will make fighting these wildfires safer for our firefighters, and allow them to return home safely to their families.
          Firefighters are some of the bravest men and women out there. The courage with which they run towards danger to protect our lives and property is awe-inspiring. Trenton Johnson was such a man. Trenton, a nineteen-year-old firefighter in his first fire season, died while battling a fire near Seeley Lake recently. I hope you'll join me in praying for the family and friends of Trenton and continue to pray for firefighters who are out battling the flames right now.
          As always, I encourage you to contact my office to express your concerns or opinions on policy issues important to you. And if were not already connected on social media, I invite you to follow my daily updates on Facebook.
          Its my number one priority in Congress to represent the values and interests of the people of Montana, and your input is very helpful as I do. I also invite you to visit my website, www.daines.senate.gov, so we can stay in close touch.
Best Wishes, 
￼

Working for Eastern North Carolina
I am humbled to represent you in Congress, and I would like to update you on my recent work for Eastern North Carolina.
￼
In Memory of 16 Brave Service Members
On July 10, a KC-130T plane leaving Cherry Point crashed in Mississippi. Tragically, this country lost all 16 service members aboard, including six Marines and 1 Navy Corpsman based at Camp Lejeune and members of the Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 452 (VMGR-452) based at Stewart Air National Guard Base. On July 18, my colleagues and I held a moment of silence on the House Floor to honor Staff Sergeant Robert Cox, Staff Sergeant William Kundrat, Sergeant Chad Jenson, Sergeant Talon Leach, Sergeant Joseph Murray, Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman, Petty Officer 2nd Class Ryan Lohrey, Major Caine Goyette, Captain Sean Elliott, Gunnery Sergeant Mark Hopkins, Gunnery Sergeant Brendan Johnson, Staff Sergeant Joshua Snowden, Sergeant Julian Kevianne, Sergeant Owen Lennon, Corporal Daniel Baldassare, and Corporal Collin Schaaff. We will never be able to thank these men enough for their service to this country. I will continue to hold their families and loved ones in my thoughts and prayers. 
￼ 

Serving Those Who Have Served Us
	•	On July 24, I continued my strong support for veterans and military families of Eastern North Carolina by voting for legislation to greatly expand GI bill benefits. Enactment of that legislation – H.R. 3218, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act – would be the biggest GI bill expansion in a decade.  H.R. 3218 would allow veterans to use their education benefits throughout their lifetime, not just during the 15 years following their service, as is currently the case.  H.R. 3218 would also give full GI bill eligibility to all post-9/11 Purple Heart recipients, regardless of how long they served.  Currently, post-9/11 Purple Heart recipients need to put in three years of service to receive full benefits. It was an honor to help approve this package - our veterans certainly deserve it. 
	•	No veteran should be subjected to a delay in treatment because the VA hasn’t paid its bills to outside vendors. In late June, I joined 45 of my colleagues and urged the VA to pay its bills on time. Federal law requires the VA to pay its vendors within 30 days, but outstanding invoices go back to 2013. I know the Secretary is working hard to improve the processes within the department that hamper their ability to provide veterans with the excellent care they’ve earned and deserved.  This is one item on that list, and it’s something that needs to be addressed.
	•	I am honored to co-chair the House Depot Caucus, which focuses on the outstanding work done by our military depots in support of our men and women in uniform, including Fleet Readiness Center East right here in Eastern North Carolina. Last week, the Depot Caucus hosted its quarterly breakfast to discuss depots' abilities to meet wartime requirements. America's depots continue to work at maximum capacity to ensure military readiness. During the breakfast, we were happy to host General Gus Perna, the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Material Command, to discuss how Congress can assist our depots with proper resources. Thank you to Gen. Perna and to the service members, civilian, and contract employees for all you do to provide military readiness.

￼

	•	I had the pleasure of meeting with leaders of the North Carolina National Guard while they were in Washington for their professional development seminar. Thank you to these men who serve and represent our state very well.
￼

	•	I was also humbled to receive this year's Capitol Police Inaugural Badge, as a token for the work my office has done to help improve K-9 working facilities on Capitol Hill. We appreciate everything the men, women, and canines of Capitol Police do to ensure the safety of the American people when they visit Congress.

￼  
Defending Eastern North Carolina Conservative Values   This month, I was honored to receive Freedomworks' Freedom Fighter Award after being ranked one of the most conservative members of Congress. I will never stop fighting to preserve freedom, liberty, and the founding principles of this great country. Thank you FreedomWorks for this humbling recognition.
￼
￼
Fighting Illegal Immigration
Last month, I continued my work to protect our nation’s borders and the rule of law by voting for the passage of two bills, H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004. H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act restricts federal funding to jurisdictions that refuse to enforce immigration law. H.R. 3004, Kate’s law, increases penalties for illegal aliens who commit felonies. The tragic murders of Kate Steinle, Jamiel Shaw, and countless other acts of violence committed by criminal illegal aliens cry out for action. I believe America must do more to stop illegal immigration.

￼
Supporting America's Economy
	•	In continuing my efforts to defend American jobs and end bad trade deals, I joined 19 of my colleagues in encouraging the Trump administration to insist on strong Buy American rules as part of the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico. The original rules created under the Clinton administration have been disadvantaging American workers and companies for 20 years. It is vital that our trade agreements are negotiated to allow domestic content preferences. Strong Buy American laws support manufacturing jobs, decrease the trade deficit and support the Administration’s ‘Buy American, Hire American’ initiative.
	•	I also weighed in concerning the proposed takeover of the Chicago Stock Exchange (CHX) by a Chinese firm. Several colleagues and I sent the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to deny the takeover in order to prevent financial, economic, and cyber-security risks to America. In my opinion, a communist Chinese takeover of a trillion dollar American market could have highly dangerous and detrimental effects on the US economy.
￼
Reversing Federal Overreach
Under the Obama administration, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers tried to expand jurisdiction over “waters of the United States,” creating drastic federal regulatory overreach over private lands. Since then, I have been a vocal critic of this rule, voting to block, overturn, and rescind it. I commend the Trump administration for finally withdrawing this rule in June. If left untouched, it would have unnecessarily inflicted tremendous economic pain on Eastern North Carolina small businesses, farmers, and families.

Congressman Cook Votes for Increased Sanctions on Russia, North Korea, and Iran

Congressman Paul Cook voted for HR 3364, the Countering Adversarial Nations Through Sanctions Act. The bill includes a package of comprehensive sanctions against North Korea, Russia, and Iran – three regimes that continue to threaten their neighbors and undermine US national security. The bill passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support. 
The first provision of HR 3364 targets those involved in the Iranian regime’s ballistic missile program, its efforts to destabilize the region and threaten Israel, and its ongoing human rights abuses. It imposes sanctions on any individual who contributes materially to Iran’s ballistic missile program, weapons of mass destruction programs, or participates in the sale or transfer of military equipment to Iran. It also calls for increased sanctions on anyone who is identified to be responsible for torture and other violations of internationally recognized human rights.  
The second provision of HR 3364 counteracts Russian aggression by strengthening sanctions in response to cyber-attacks and interference in Ukraine, empowers Congress to review any sanctions relief, and works to strengthen international cooperation in opposing Russian aggression. Specifically, the legislation provides for a mandated Congressional review if sanctions are relaxed, suspended, or terminated. It targets corruption and key sectors of the Russian economy, including arms sales and the export of oil and gas. Lastly, it also fixes a provision in a previous Senate bill that could have hurt the US economy while benefitting Russian energy oligarchs. 
The third provision of HR 3364 amends the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 to enhance the President’s authority to impose sanctions on those who violate U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding North Korea. It expands sanctions to further deter North Korea’s nuclear weapons programs by cutting off Kim Jung Un’s access to cash. Additionally, the bill cracks down on North Korea’s shipping and use of international ports and targets those who employ North Korean slave labor.
Congressman Cook said, “Iran, North Korea, and Russia continue to pose a serious threat to U.S. national security. These additional sanctions will give us additional tools to combat their continued aggression and ensure their illicit activities don’t go unchecked.” 

Congressman Cook's Bill to Foster Robust Domestic Helium Market Passes House Natural Resources Committee 

Congressman Paul Cook announced that his bill H.R. 3279, the Helium Extraction Act of 2017, unanimously passed out of the House Natural Resources Committee. The bill amends the Mineral Leasing Act to allow helium extraction from gas on federal lands under the same terms as gas and oil.
Helium is an essential element used in MRIs, air-to-missile guidance systems, and semiconductors. As such, a steady supply of helium is critical for the medical, defense, and energy industries. The United States is currently the world’s largest supplier of helium. The next largest producers are Qatar, Algeria, and Russia. 
Historically, much of the American demand for helium has been satisfied by the Federal Helium Reserve. However, there are major concerns about the future of our domestic helium production. According to the Bureau of Land Management, the reserve has enough helium to meet about 40 percent of the domestic demand for the gas. Additionally, the Helium Stewardship Act of 2013 requires that by September 30, 2021, the reserve must be sold and the facility closed. Given the vast political, economic, and diplomatic uncertainty surrounding many the largest foreign suppliers of helium, it would be dangerous for America to become dependent on them.
Congressman Cook said, “Helium has become irreplaceable in our space, defense, and medical industries. Without this bill, we could become dangerously dependent on unstable foreign countries for our supply of helium. This bill encourages the development of American sources of helium and will boost both our national security and economy. I’m grateful to Chairman Rob Bishop and the Natural Resources Committee for moving this bill forward.”

Congressman Cook Votes To Extend VA Choice Act

Congressman Paul Cook voted for S. 114, the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017. The bill passed overwhelmingly in the House, and the Senate previously passed this bill in May.
The Veterans Choice Program was enacted in 2014 and provided $10 billion to the Department of Veterans Affairs to allow veterans to receive health care from private care facilities rather than VA hospitals. It was originally scheduled to expire in August of this year, but this past April, Congress and the President eliminated the program’s sunset so veterans could continue to receive private care. This legislation provides an additional $2.1 billion in funding to extend the program for approximately six more months, ensuring that veterans benefiting from this program will continue to receive care. The bill also authorizes 28 major medical facility leases and enhances the recruitment, retention, and training of the VA workforce. It requires the VA to conduct an annual performance plan for political appointees and to develop a plan to hire highly qualified directors for medical centers that have not had permanent leadership. 
Congressman Cook said, “The VA Choice Act has been crucial for helping our veterans get the care they deserve. This legislation will ensure that we continue funding this important program which provides our nation’s heroes with timely medical care rather than enduring long wait times at the VA.”

Dear Friend:  Recently, I had the pleasure of welcoming Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke back to southern Oregon. As a fellow Oregon Duck, Secretary Zinke knows this region well and loves the beauty of our public lands -- he even chose to hang a painting of Crater Lake behind his desk back in the Department of the Interior. 
Secretary Zinke spent two days getting a firsthand look at the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument and the recent expansion. Secretary Zinke is taking a personal approach to his review of Cascade-Siskiyou. Rather than looking at the monument on a map in Washington D.C., he came here to see what’s on the ground and meet with passionate folks on all sides of this issue. 
￼
Click here or on the image above to view a recap video of Secretary Zinke’s tour of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument
During our visit, we saw some of the traditional uses, landscape, and features we love about our public lands in southern Oregon. We can all agree that there are values worth protecting and that we can achieve a balance. That is certainly a goal of mine, and I know it is a goal of Secretary Zinke’s as he conducts his review of Cascade-Siskiyou.
￼
Local ranchers discuss range management with Secretary Zinke and I during our tour of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument 
￼
Secretary Zinke and I took a few questions from the local press at the conclusion of our tour. 
As a lifelong Oregonian, protecting our environment and the natural treasures in our state is an important and personal issue for me. That is why I’ve worked on legislation in the past to protect areas like Soda Mountain and Steens Mountain. These efforts work best, however, from the ground up with local input from all sides. 
￼
The Secretary and I heard from proponents of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument at the BLM office in Medford recently.
Following the expansion of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument by President Obama, I heard from county commissioners, ranchers, foresters and private property owners who had concerns with the expansion and felt ignored during the process. More than a third of the newly designated area is private land and a large amount of public lands are governed by the O&C Act which prescribes active timber management with considerable proceeds going to fund local services. Under the 1906 Antiquities Act, the President has sole discretion when determining how much land is designated and how it will be managed. Some Presidents have had thorough, local vetting processes and others have chosen to designate areas with no opportunity for local input. I think there’s a better way. That’s why I’ve introduced the Public Input for National Monuments Act, to require these designations to go through the National Environmental Policy Act, and formally gather public input like is required on other public land management decisions. 
￼
Secretary Zinke and I met with local officials to discuss the impact of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument on local counties and timber lands.
President Obama’s expansion of Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument was like a bad sequel. Ignoring concerns from opponents has once again left a patchwork of public and private land and uses within the monument creating conflicts much like  the challenges after the original designation by President Clinton.  Of the 80,000 acres within the expansion boundary, 38 percent is private land. Nearly 90 percent of the BLM land is timberland that was designated by Congress for permanent timber production and revenue to fund our counties under the O&C Act of 1937. During our tour, Secretary Zinke and I visited a rancher whose grazing allotment had been cut in half by the expansion, inhibiting a cooperative grazing program developed between the rancher, BLM and Forest Service to improve management of the range. We also saw irrigation canals, electric transmission lines, and a buried natural gas pipeline that cross this landscape--that’s far from being an untouched wilderness.

In southern Oregon, we’ve seen the problems left behind when land management decisions are made without meaningful public input. Secretary Zinke’s visit represents another productive step forward to rebuild public trust in the management of our federal lands. I know he will strongly consider the concerns and input -- from all sides -- as he completes his review of Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument. His report to the President is due by August 24.
That’s all for this update. Remember, you can always keep in touch with me via email, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 
It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. Congress.

Greg Walden U.S. Representative Oregon's Second District

￼


Here’s what’s happening in the office of U.S. Representative Carlos Curbelo (FL-26):  SOLIDARITY WITH VENEZUELA: Carlos spoke on the House floor and stood in solidarity with the Venezuelan people ahead of the Constituent Assembly election Nicolás Maduro organized to try and hold on to his power. Carlos discussed the stifling chaos of the Maduro regime and denounced any further abuse of the freedom-loving Venezuelan people. “The United States will no longer stand by and watch Maduro and his thugs ignore human rights and the rule of law,” Carlos said. “There is a bipartisan consensus that Maduro’s undemocratic and tyrannical rule is unacceptable.  All options are on the table, and I look forward to continuing to work with this Administration and my colleagues here in Congress to stand in solidarity with the democratic opposition and people of Venezuela.” After Sunday's election, Maduro went on to replace the National Assembly. In response, the U.S. Department of Treasury expanded its sanctions to include Maduro. Carlos issued a statement in support of the Administration's decisiveness and action in Venezuela. 
￼
MAKING AMERICA SECURE: Last week, the House passed the “Make America Secure Appropriations Act of 2018,” marking a major victory for U.S. national defense, troops, and veterans. The bill also included two amendments Carlos introduced that provide funding for projects such as the Florida Keys Water Quality Improvement Project (FKWQIP) and further research and development of energy storage technologies that advance grid resiliency while improving our nation’s low-cost electricity supply. 
MILESTONE FOR BIPARTISAN CLIMATE SOLUTIONS CAUCUS: As co-founder and Co-Chair of the Climate Solutions Caucus, Carlos celebrated a milestone of 50 members with the addition of Rep. Steve Knight (CA-25) and Rep. Marcy Kaptur (OH-9) last week. Carlos reiterated his commitment to building consensus on climate policy and reflected on the Caucus’ accomplishment in a video message. “We have a responsibility to our constituents and future generations to present a united front to combat anti-climate policies and to have a productive, fact-based dialogue about market-oriented solutions, investments, and innovations that could mitigate the effects of climate change and make our nation more resilient,” Carlos said. “Together we are showing the American people that Members of Congress can work across party lines to improve quality of life in our communities and strengthen our great nation.
￼

SANCTIONING ROGUE REGIMES: Last week, Carlos voted in favor of a bipartisan sanctions package against Iran, Russia and North Korea. These sanctions send a strong message and hold the regimes accountable for their actions against the United States and its allies. 
￼
FUTURE OF MIAMI INFRASTRUCTURE: Carlos welcomed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s announcement inviting Miami-Dade County to apply for Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) loans. The loans were made possible by legislation Carlos introduced that was later signed into law in the 114th Congress. This legislation provides $2 billion in funding for counties across the U.S. to revitalize aging water infrastructure systems. “The WIFIA program will encourage investment and create jobs in South Florida, and I’m glad Miami-Dade County will be granted the opportunity to apply for these funds,” Carlos said. “I look forward to supporting their efforts to secure the loans necessary to upgrade our water pipes and sewers.”

Last Week in Congress
House Passes Security Package with Yoder Bill
￼ Click here to watch a video of Kevin's floor remarks in support of the bill.
Last week, the House of Representatives passed the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, a package of funding bills that include the Fiscal Year 2018 Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, Energy and Water, and my Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill. The package provides funding for major security priorities, including border security, nuclear defense systems, veterans, active duty military, and Capitol Police, and passed by a 235-192 vote with my support.
￼
The Legislative Branch Appropriations portion of the bill maintains funding on the House more than 12 percent below 2010 levels and continues the policy of preventing any pay increases for Members of Congress for the eighth fiscal year in a row, funding legislative branch operations at a level $228 million below the Presidents request. In response to last months shooting at the GOP practice for the Congressional Baseball Game, it makes structural changes that will improve security at the Capitol and at congressional events in Members districts.
We are leading by example by tightening our belts and spending taxpayer dollars wisely, and we are continuing the policy of preventing any pay increases for Members of Congress. At the same time, were making sure to provide the US Capitol Police with the resources they need to meet their mission in today's increasingly polarized climate. We provide the necessary resources to enhance security at our constituent events in House districts across the country.
 
￼
 
In addition to my provisions, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act includes these other security priorities:
	•	Largest military pay raise in eight years.
	•	Largest level of funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs in history.
	•	Substantial funding increase for the Department of Defense to rebuild our military after nearly a quarter of its budget had been cut over the last eight years.
	•	Funding for updated equipment and weapons so our military is prepared for the threats of modern warfare and defense.
	•	Funding for improved military infrastructure.
	•	Increased funding for the Department of Energys nuclear weapons program.
	•	Authorization for the EPA to withdraw from the Obama Administrations disastrous WOTUS Rule.
	•	Full funding to meet President Trumps request for a wall along our southern border.

Congress Sends Sanctions Bill Against Russia, Iran, and North Korea to President's Desk
￼ Click here to read the top ten reasons why we need our sanction bill, courtesy of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Russia, Iran, and North Korea have continued to threaten United States national security and undermine global stability with a range of aggressive acts. Vladimir Putin has ordered cyberattacks on the US, and continues to support a murderous regime in Syria. Iran and North Korea continue their march to obtaining nuclear weapons. Last week, the House voted to sanction these hostile regimes by passing the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. The Senate quickly passed the legislation in a bipartisan fashion as well, and President Trump has indicated he plans to sign it into law.

￼
Last week, I joined my colleagues in the House of Representatives in voting to pass another package of bills to help the men and women who defend our freedoms. Perhaps the most important of the several pieces of legislation passed tonight is HR 3218, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, which will extend and expand the GI Bill benefits available to veterans and their families.
 
Over the years, the GI Bill has helped millions of veterans pay for college, graduate school, and other training programs  and tonight we're updating it to meet the times. Currently, veterans have to use their education benefits within 15 years of the end of their service. HR 3218 is called the ""Forever GI Bill"" because it will allow new service men and women to use the GI bills education benefits throughout their lifetimes. This bill also gives full GI Bill eligibility to all post-9/11 Purple Heart recipients, as well as gives veterans a better shot at in-demand science and technology jobs.
 
￼
 
An important provision in the Forever GI Bill is the Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses (VET TEC) Act. This provision will open up new education opportunities for veterans and help them close the skills gap in todays workforce. I'm proud to have been an original cosponsor of VET TEC. I look forward to HR 3218 with this provision making its way to the Presidents desk to be signed into law.

Pushing Reforms to Our Legal Immigration System
￼ Click here to watch a video of Kevin's remarks.
More than 700,000 high-skilled immigrant workers from India are in the United States today on temporary work visas. These people are working hard every day, helping grow our economy, and raising their children as Americans right here in our communities. But under our legal immigration system, they are essentially here as indentured servants, stuck on a cycle of temporary work visas, unable to change jobs or even start their own small businesses to create more American jobs. Theyre stuck because of the arbitrary 7 percent per-nation cap on employment-based green cards. That's why I spoke on the floor of the House of Representatives about the need to reform our legal immigration system through passage of the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act. 
 
Right now, there is a mother in Greenland whose unborn child will be able to obtain permanent residence in America before someone from India who has already been working here for years. Thats absurd, and wrong. My bill, called the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, would fix this problem. It would transition us to a first-come, first-serve merit based legal immigration system. It would help these people in need, and help create new jobs. With more than 230 cosponsors, its time to pass this bill and get this done.

Cady Housh and Jason Flatt Teen Suicide Prevention Act
￼ Click here to read the full article and watch full video on 41 Action News of Kevin discussing suicide prevention.
Far too many families struggle with the pain and loss experienced by the Housh family. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for kids from middle school through college. I think thats unacceptable, and were working to arm teachers and administrators in our schools across America with the tools to help prevent these tragedies. 
Last week, Representative Emanuel Cleaver II (D-MO) and I introduced the Cady Housh and Jason Flatt Teen Suicide Prevention Act. This bill would require teachers, principals, counselors and other school officials to receive youth suicide awareness and prevention training in schools.
￼
Fair Access to Science and Technology Research 
￼
Last week, I also joined my colleagues Representatives Mike Doyle (D-PA) and Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) in introducing legislation to increase the openness, transparency, and accessibility of publicly funded research results.
 
The Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act (FASTR) would require federal agencies with annual extramural research budgets of $100 million or more to provide the public with online access to research manuscripts stemming from funded research no later than six months after publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The FASTR Act will bring tangible benefits to the American people in the form of transparency, accountability, and greater access to research theyve already paid for. Taxpayers are footing the bill for research across many disciplines, from biomedical science to new technology, but right now they cant access the findings. Were working to right this wrong so the private sector can more easily take ideas and concepts and turn them into innovation and economic growth.
 
Specifically, the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act would:
	•	Require federal departments and agencies with an annual extramural research budget of $100 million or more, whether funded totally or partially by a government department or agency, to submit an electronic copy of the final manuscript that has been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.
	•	Ensure that the manuscript is preserved in a stable digital repository maintained by that agency or in another suitable repository that permits free public access, interoperability, and long-term preservation.
	•	Require that each taxpayer-funded manuscript be made available to the public online and without cost, no later than six months after the article has been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
	•	Require agencies to examine whether introducing open licensing options for research papers they make publicly available as a result of the public access policy would promote productive reuse and computational analysis of those research papers.

Senators Lee and Leahy Introduce Email Privacy Act in the Senate
￼ Click here to read the full article from The Hill about Senators Leahy and Lee introducing Email Privacy Act.
Back in February, the House of Representatives sent a strong message to the American people that their privacy matters. The Fourth Amendment is clear, if the federal government wants to access Americans digital content, it must get a warrant. We voted as a unanimous, bipartisan group to pass my Email Privacy Act, which enshrines that principle into law.
We must bring our digital privacy rights into the 21st century, and after unanimous passage in the House, it's great to hear that the Senate has released bipartisan legislation with similar provisions to my bill. Last week, Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced the ECPA Modernization Act of 2017, legislation that would modernize the privacy laws that protect the digital communications of all Americans.

Kansas Delegation Introduces Bill to Award Senator Dole with the Congressional Gold Medal
￼
Senator Bob Dole has spent his entire life serving Kansas and our nation. Service, sacrifice, statesmanship  these are the words that come to mind when you think of Senator Dole. Hes a larger than life figure in American politics, but hes one of the kindest, funniest, and most humble men Ive ever had the privilege of knowing. I can think of no one more deserving of the recognition of Congress and the utmost respect of the American people than Bob Dole. That's why I joined the entire Kansas delegation in introducing legislation to award former Kansas U.S. Senator Robert J. Dole the Congressional Gold Medal in recognition for his service to the nation as a soldier, legislator, and statesman.

27th Anniversary of Americans with Disability Act 
￼
 
It was wonderful participate in the Congressional Deaf Caucus' 27th Anniversary Celebration of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) last week. I have the honor of chairing the caucus with Representative Mark Takano (D-CA), and he and other distinguished speakers joined us to discuss the work we've been doing to carry the legacy of the ADA into the 21st Century and beyond. 
 
Our nation was founded on the principle that all men are created equal. The ADA is a monumental piece of legislation that embodies that principle, with its impact making ripple effects throughout our nation still today, benefiting countless disabled Americans. It has helped open up doors to employment for many people with disabilities, and ensured that those with disabilities are afforded equal access to government services and public accommodations. 
 
As we mark the 27th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, I hope we can both celebrate the accomplishments that have been made, as well as roll up our sleeves to continue the work that still needs to be done. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the fight for the rights of disabled Americans, and for the Deaf community in particular. Im proud to join in this effort as we work to preserve the legacy of the ADA.

Meetings in DC
Heartland Seating
￼ Kevin with Kathy Peterson. 
Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy providing over half of all jobs in the United States. Last Thursday, I was able to visit with Kathy Peterson who co-owns Heartland Seating, a small business in downtown Shawnee, to discuss issues facing her business and what I can do in Congress to help her and other small businesses in Kansas. Thanks Kathy for coming by our office while you were in DC.

Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation
￼ Kevin visiting with the Lindsay family from Olathe.
Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation holds Childrens Congress every two years and selects children with type 1 diabetes to gather in DC to discuss with lawmakers what life with type 1 diabetes is like and why research to find the cure for diabetes is so critical. Last week, I met with Caden and Keigan Lindsay from Olathe while they were in DC with this great group of children. It was wonderful meeting the Lindsay family, and hope you enjoyed your Capitol tour through my office.

Fact of the Week
When the President signs our security funding package into law, it will mean we are funding the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) at the highest level in American history and it means we will be spending more to care for our veterans than any other nation combined. 
Third District Trivia 
Last week Congress passed the Forever GI Bill to improve and extend the benefits for veterans found in the GI Bill. What year was the original GI Bill signed into law and by what President? 
Send your answers to haley.brady@mail.house.gov and the first correct response will receive a shout out in next week's newsletter.
Congratulations to last week's winner Andrica Wilcoxen from Kansas City!
Last week's answer:  Senator Bob Dole turned 94 years old on July 22nd. Senator Dole served in the Kansas House of Representativeswas as his first position in government. During his first campaign for the United States House of Representatives, Senator Dole always served Dole pineapple juice. 
Washington Kastles Charity Tennis Tournament
￼
I always enjoy playing in the Washington Kastles Charity Classic with other members of Congress and press. This year's ticket proceeds from the match went to charities including DC Public Education Fund, N Street Village and Food & Friends, and more. Although Team Stripes just barely lost to Team Stars, we put a good fight. I look forward to joining this great event next year!

Dear Lindsey,
Over the past several months, Washington has engaged in a debate about repealing health care. 
Wisconsinites have also engaged and made their voices heard. I know this issue is deeply personal to families across our state, as many of you have been reaching out to share your health care stories with me. For this, I want to thank you. It is important for me to tell your stories here in Washington. 
One thing is clear: the people of Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take people’s health care away, and you sent a message that you want us to work across party lines to make things better - not worse. 
I agree. As I have said throughout this debate, it's time to work together to make things better by stabilizing the health insurance market, making health care more affordable, and taking on rising prescription drug costs. 
I have cosponsored legislation, the Marketplace Certainty Act, to stabilize the health insurance Marketplace and provide certainty with cost-sharing payments that lower health insurance costs. I have also cosponsored the Affordable Health Insurance for the Middle Class Act, which improves the Affordable Care Act by eliminating the cliff that currently blocks many middle-class individuals and families from affording insurance through the Marketplace.
As we move forward, let’s get the job done on bipartisan reforms like my FAIR Drug Pricing Act with John McCain (R-AZ) and take on sky-high prescription drug costs by holding drug companies accountable for price hikes. My bipartisan legislation to support family caregivers with Susan Collins (R-ME), the RAISE Family Caregivers Act, is another example of what we can accomplish if we work together. 
If both parties look past the partisan debate in Washington, I strongly believe we can find common ground and solutions that work for the American people.
Please continue to let your voice be heard.
Sincerely,
￼
U.S. Senator for Wisconsin

Turning the Page on Congress' Reckless Spending
￼ 
Our children and grandchildren do not deserve the burden of debt we are passing on to them. The problem is too great to sit idly by and let the government mortgage our nation’s future by spending money we do not have. It is not too late to stop the bleeding, but we must act now. On Thursday, July 27, I spoke before the House Judiciary Committee on my balanced budget amendment; we are one step closer to ending the spending crisis in a responsible way.

Many states, including Georgia, operate under a balanced budget, and do not spend more than they take in. This responsible approach to budgeting should be mandatory at the federal level as well, especially as our national debt continues to climb toward $20 trillion. That is why I, and other conservatives, have joined together in proposing a much-needed balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This ten-year plan gives Congress the time it needs to get its financial house in order and come up with long-term solutions to tackling our out-of-control spending. The time to turn the page on Congress’ reckless spending is now – not later, when our grandchildren are handed the bill.

Make America Secure Appropriations Act 
￼ 
The predominant responsibility of the federal government is our national defense; however, the drastic cuts made to our armed forces over the past several years has severely impacted the readiness of the men and women in uniform, and their equipment. The Make America Secure Appropriations Act restores critical funding to our military and gives a well-deserved pay raise to our troops. The bill also includes funding to secure our southern border and resources to implement major reforms to the Veterans Administration to improve services for our veterans.

8/1/17 11:12,Beyond resistance: Protecting women’s reproductive rights,"Update | Tuesday, August 1, 2017
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Dear Friends,
It is the fourth day of my email series, “Beyond Resistance: The things we should do to make us safer, healthier, and more economically secure.” Today’s topic: protecting women’s reproductive rights.
Government should not interfere between health care decisions made between women, their families, and medical care providers. Throughout my career, I've worked to protect, support, and expand women’s reproductive rights. I have repeatedly voted against attempts to undermine a woman’s right to a safe and legal abortion, and I strongly oppose efforts to limit access to reproductive health services and defund Planned Parenthood.
I am proud to represent Oregon, which recently passed legislation to protect a woman’s right to abortion care. Oregon insurers are also required to cover contraception, prenatal and postpartum care, screenings for reproductive cancers and STIs, and counseling for survivors of domestic violence. These comprehensive services should be available and affordable for all women and families in the United States, without burdensome costs and requirements or arbitrary waiting periods.  
As a member of the Pro-Choice Caucus, I’ve worked with my colleagues to introduce the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance (EACH) Woman Act and the Women's Health Protection Act. Together, these bills would repeal the Hyde Amendment, which currently prohibits the use of federal funds for abortion, and prohibit states from imposing strict and costly barriers on abortion providers and the people they serve.
I also strongly support the Global Health, Empowerment, and Rights (HER) Act, which would permanently block the Global Gag Rule, also known as the “Mexico City policy.” This current misguided policy, reinstated by the Trump Administration, bans federal funds for foreign non-governmental organizations that provide abortion services or that merely provide information about abortion as part of comprehensive family planning services.
Making sure the federal government is a stronger ally and partner to women and supports their reproductive rights is essential to a safer, healthier, and more economically secure America.
I welcome your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. You can connect with me here. 

Courage, 
￼

GOP leaders say it’s time for Senate to move on from health care  The Washington Post Senate Republican leaders signaled Monday that they intend to move on from health care to other legislative priorities, even as President Trump continued to pressure lawmakers to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.
Dems pivot to offering ObamaCare improvements  The Hill House Democrats are poised to advance a flood of proposals designed to address the problems dogging President Obama's signature healthcare law — a move that puts pressure on Republican and Democratic leaders alike.
Trump decision looms on crucial Obamacare payments  POLITICO President Donald Trump at any time could make good on a threat to scrap crucial Obamacare payments to insurers — a decision that could raise Obamacare customers’ costs and potentially leave tens of thousands more without any coverage options next year.
Trump dictated son’s misleading statement on meeting with Russian lawyer  The Washington Post The extent of the president’s personal intervention in his son’s response, the details of which have not previously been reported, adds to a series of actions that Trump has taken that some advisers fear could place him and some members of his inner circle in legal jeopardy.

Putin and an exercise in intimidation that recalls the most ominous days of the Cold War.

Leonard Lance announces town hall meeting in Warren County
By Kurt Bresswein
For lehighvalleylive.com
Constituents of New Jersey's 7th Congressional District have a chance this week to ask questions of and hear from U.S. Rep. Leonard Lance, his office announced Monday.
The Republican whose district includes Hunterdon and southern Warren counties, is holding his 45th in-person town hall 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. Thursday in the John LaPorta Theater at Warren County Technical School, 1500 Route 57 in Franklin Township, Warren County.
According to the announcement: ""During the town hall meeting, Lance will take questions on the important issues facing Congress and the American people. Lance will discuss his leadership role in imposing sanctions against Russia, his involvement in a bipartisan health care solution, the federal budget, tax reform and foreign affairs.
""Additionally, members of Lance's staff will be available to assist residents who are experiencing difficulties with federal agencies such as the IRS, Social Security Administration, Veterans Affairs, the State Department or any other federal agency.""
The town hall is free, but tickets are required and are only available to district residents. They will be made available on a first-come-first-served basis at Lance's website, lance.house.gov, beginning at noon Wednesday. There is a limit of two tickets per online entry.

Hitting the Rhode 
           ￼ 
Dear Friends,  
I thoroughly enjoy hosting events that bring together the constituents I represent. They provide me the opportunity to engage with members of the community, listen to the thoughts and concerns of my constituents, and deliver updates from Washington, D.C.  
During the month of August, I am hosting a series of public forums that will allow you and your neighbors to share what’s on your minds. These forums include town hall meetings on Tuesday, August 8th at Narragansett Town Hall and Tuesday, August 22nd in Council City Chambers at Warwick City Hall, both from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. In addition, I will visit the Cranston Senior Enrichment Center on August 22nd at 10 a.m. with representatives from Social Security and Medicare to discuss senior-related issues.  
Your concerns are always my foremost consideration, and your feedback helps shape my work in Washington. This is an opportunity to have a productive conversation about a variety of issues facing Rhode Islanders, from growing jobs and strengthening the economy to protecting Medicare and supporting students.  
My office doors are always open, and I encourage you to call or email me if you have feedback about my work. But there is nothing that can replace a direct, face-to-face conversation and personal connection, so I hope you will also take the opportunities this month to join me in person. And I hope you will also take the time to hear the thoughts and opinions of your fellow Second Congressional district residents as we continue to build civic engagement.  
Learn more about my town hall meetings and many other issues through my website and blog and follow me on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.  
            Sincerely,  
           ￼

Full STEAM Ahead 
Art and design play a critical role in enhancing skills that are essential to the disciplines of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Art fosters innovative thinking and requires students to develop new methods of creative problem solving. The integration of art and design into STEM will give America the edge it needs to compete in the global marketplace, which is why I proudly introduced the STEM to STEAM Act of 2017. This bill would promote the inclusion of art and design in after-school and extracurricular STEM activities. The Rhode Island School of Design has been a pioneer in the STEM to STEAM movement, and I hope other schools will follow its lead so our students become the most creative graduates on the planet.

Protect Our Children 
As a co-chair of the Congressional Foster Youth Caucus, I’ve heard terrifying stories about children who are victims of ‘re-homing.’ Re-homing occurs when parents transfer custody of their children outside of the child welfare system, and often their children are placed in dangerous situations. I recently introduced two bills aimed at eliminating this practice: the Protecting Adopted Children Act and the Supporting Adopted Children and Families Act, which both strengthen support services for children and families.

Come and Read It Report
Dear Friends, 
We’ve been working hard in Washington over the past two weeks before we enter the August district work period, and I am proud to say we have accomplished a great deal on the House side. Whether it’s rolling back regulations of government agencies, or funding President Trump’s budget, we’re taking more positive steps forward now than we ever did over the past eight years. 
Last Thursday, we passed H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, with a vote of 235-192. With this bill, we fully funded President Donald Trump’s request to build a southern border that will keep our country safe from outside threats. We appropriated enough to give our service members the largest pay increase in eight years. Additionally, this legislation provides the Department of Veterans Affairs with the highest level of funding – ever. As soon as this bill passes the Senate, it will go straight to the President’s desk.
We also voted to continue funding the VA Choice Program that will authorize and appropriate the necessary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Here are some highlights I want you to be aware of:
	•	This will authorize funding for 28 major medical facilities around the United States
	•	Our veterans should have access to health care no matter where it is. This program allows our vets, who are enrolled in VA healthcare, to receive services from private providers
	•	It will enhance recruitment and retention of the VA’s workforce
Zack and I traveled to the White House last week and had the opportunity to meet with Vice President Mike Pence during the Public Safety Medal of Valor Ceremony. Capitol Police Officers Crystal Griner and David Bailey, as well as three officers from the Alexandria Police Department, were awarded this medal for exhibiting exceptional valor that went above and beyond the call of duty last month during the shooting. I am proud to know these heroes and call them my friends. 
In addition, Congress passed a bill that will assist Officers Griner and Bailey, who were injured in the shooting. This will bill allow donations made to the Capitol Police Memorial Fund to be used to cover their medical costs. These two are more than deserving of any help we are able to provide them to make this tragic event a little easier. 
Lastly, I’d like to touch on what we’re doing about the far-overreaching Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). I spoke on the House floor in support of Congress passing a Congressional Review Act (CRA) that would overturn the CFPB’s newest arbitration rule. This rule did not protect consumers and would have cost them their hard-earned dollars and time. I am happy to report Congress successfully passed this CRA and we will continue to hold government agencies accountable to hardworking Americans. 
I have included some articles and releases you may find interesting located on the right side of this newsletter. It is an honor and privilege to represent the people of Texas’ 25th Congressional District and as always, please reach out to me with any issues and concerns that are important to you.
Sincerely,
￼
Roger Williams
Member of Congress

The Huizenga Huddle:  August 1, 2017
Protecting The Great Lakes Ecosystem and Economy  On Friday night, the Army Corps of Engineers announced they are going to release the long awaited Brandon Road study on August 7th. This assessment will provide critical information on how to best prevent Asian Carp from entering the Great Lakes ecosystem. I am proud to have worked in a bipartisan manner to get the Administration to release this important document.   In June, I joined Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) in introducing the Stop Asian Carp Now Act, which upon enactment would have forced the release of the Brandon Road Study. After the discovery of an Asian Carp less than 10 miles from Lake Michigan, I led my fellow Michigan Republicans in writing an op-ed for MLive & The Grand Rapids Press discussing the threat Asian Carp pose to the Great Lakes both ecologically and economically.  
￼
While the scheduled release of the Brandon Road study is an important and positive step, it is my hope that we can continue to build upon this bipartisan foundation to enact policies that will protect the Great Lakes.  Strengthening Our National Security, Supporting Our Veterans  Last week, the House passed legislation to strengthen our military by providing our troops with the tools they need to complete their mission, secure the border by prioritizing border integrity and funding construction of a wall along our nation’s southern perimeter, and enhance veteran care by improving mental health services, opioid addiction treatment, and suicide prevention programs. 
￼

On Wednesday, I discussed these important funding measures as well as health care and tax reform in a Facebook Town Hall. I encourage you to follow me on Facebook to receive notifications about future town hall events and legislative updates. You can watch Wednesday's discussion by clicking on the image below.

Holding Iran, Russia, and North Korea Accountable
Recently, the House passed legislation to sanction North Korea, Iran, and Russia by a vote of 419-3. The Senate then passed the measure by a vote of 98-2.  North Korea and Iran have continued to develop hostile weapons capabilities that threaten our troops and our allies despite diplomatic efforts to stabilize both regions. This bipartisan legislation also enhances sanctions on Russia because of their hostile cyber activities as well as their intervention in the Ukraine. Lastly, this important bill limits the ability of the Executive Branch to unilaterally provide sanction relief to Russia without congressional review.  To learn more about this sanctions package that the Administration has said the President will sign, click the picture below.  
￼
Maintaining the Healthcare Status Quo is Not Acceptable  Nearly everyone agrees that our nation’s health care system is broken. However, due to the Senate’s inability to pass any type of reform, the status quo will continue to deteriorate forcing Michigan families to face even higher premiums, larger deductibles, and fewer choices to purchase the health insurance that best meets their needs.   The House passed legislation to jump-start the process of reforming our nation’s health care system in May. Michiganders should remember that both Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters created the status quo and are now refusing to fix it. That isn’t leadership and frankly it’s unacceptable. I am equally frustrated by Republican senators who once voted in support of legislation to repeal ObamaCare when President Obama was in the White House but somehow are unable to support it today. It is my hope the Senate will revisit healthcare.  West Michigan's Impact Around the Globe  Hoekstra Nominated To Serve As Ambassador: Last week, President Trump nominated my colleague, mentor, and friend Pete Hoekstra to serve as our nation's Ambassador to the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Pete's heritage, deep-rooted ties to the Dutch community in West Michigan, and combination of public service and private sector experience make him uniquely qualified to serve as Ambassador to the Netherlands. I cannot think of a better person to further strengthen the relationship between the United States and the Netherlands than Pete Hoekstra. To learn more about Rep. Hoekstra's service to West Michigan and our nation, click on the image below.  
￼
Vice President Pence in West Michigan: What an honor to welcome Vice President Pence, his wife Karen, and Governor Snyder to celebrate our nation's independence in Grandville! It was the Vice President's only event outside of Washington on the 4th, and it definitely a day to remember.  Click here to see what Vice President Pence said about his visit to West Michigan.  
￼
The USS Gerald R. Ford Joins The Fleet: On July 22nd, the USS Gerald R. Ford was officially commissioned. The Ford is the first of its kind, next generation aircraft carrier and the first new design in 40 years! Prior to the commissioning, I had the honor of joining President Ford's Family for a tour of this incredible ship that bears the name of the only President from Michigan.  
￼
After the ceremony, I discussed on Facebook Live what it means for West Michigan to play such a large role in representing the latest class of ships in the Navy. If you would like to learn more about the USS Gerald R. Ford, I encourage you to visit the Navy's website.

8/1/17 4:04,I won't let companies turn a blind eye to this crisis,"￼
Curbing the opioid crisis in Missouri is one of my top priorities, and that's why last week, I expanded my investigation into the root causes of the epidemic, and added seven new companies to my inquiry.
￼ WATCH NOW: Learn more about the opioid crisis in Missouri, and my investigation into opioid manufacturers and distributors 
In March, I began this investigation by looking into the marketing and sales practices of some of the country's major opioid manufacturers, to see what role—if any—they may have played in this crisis. Last week, I made the scope larger, and requested information from four more manufacturers, plus three distributors, on their efforts to prevent the illegal diversion of opioids into the black market.
We need to get to the bottom of what fueled an epidemic that has tragically touched so many families in Missouri and around the country. And to do that we've got to ask hard questions and demand answers from the companies that produce and distribute these drugs.
Learn more about my investigation at: www.mccaskill.senate.gov/opioid-investigation
All the best,
