Dear Friend,   
This longer-than-usual Fort Report gives you some highlights of a wide-ranging radio interview I did this past week about the many issues facing this upcoming Congress.  We covered issues such as the dynamics of a lame duck session, leadership change, the budget, the border, and what is hanging up completion of the Farm Bill.  
Q: What do you hope Congress will tackle immediately in the new session? 
Well, the budget has to be finished.  Significant portions of the budget are already done, particularly those affecting defense, national security, as well as health and human services, but there are larger chunks of the government still underfunded, unfunded for 2019, and I suspect that will be finished soon.  A Farm Bill sits out there incomplete as well.  It’s unclear as to whether that will get done, but that is under active consideration as well.  Those are the two biggest items.
Q: What are your priorities for the new session? 
From my perspective, we’re going to go back to work on key security issues.  National security — keeping you safe.  Being in favor of strong defense but also smart diplomacy as well as sustainable development for the world’s poor.  Economic security.  Making sure that we have a robust economy. Making sure that people have meaningful work for so many that have been sidelined.  And then this deeper philosophical issue that I call family security, including important work on health care. 
We need front porch strategies not just Washington balcony strategies.  That’s where the heart of America really applies itself in both culture and politics. 
Q: What are the prospects for the Wall? 
That is a point of negotiation.  There probably will be some funding for border wall security.  It has been funded previously in incremental amounts and I suspect another incremental payment will be made toward some further enhancement of wall barriers.
Q: What are the prospects for the Farm Bill? 
Unclear at the moment.  There are negotiations going on as we speak.  They’re very tight-lipped, unfortunately, but clearly there is a desire to finish the Farm Bill, particularly to give certainty to farmers and ranchers in this uncertain economic period.  So, pressure will mount I think to get it done.  If not, there may be an extension or a renegotiation...
Q: How will the Democratic leadership battle affect Congress? 
Well, I frankly think any leadership battle is healthy.  Again, you’ve got Members who have been there for decades, whom I know, who have been accorded this position of power and have left very little space for newer Members who have new ideas, who are agitating for change on the Democrat side.  Again, one of whom is a very close friend of mine.  She has signed the letter saying she will not support Nancy Pelosi for Speaker, for instance, and sixteen Democrat Members have.  There’s another 20 in their congressional races who said they would not support her.  So that means that she does not have the majority of Congress to be elected Speaker.  Will she get there?  I suspect so, but that’s going to take a lot of wrangling and a lot of ... restructuring to give some more authority to new Members who are demanding it--and rightly so.
Q: How will anti-Trump sentiment on the part of some Democrats impact the session? 
With the changes of committee leadership, that means new leadership will go into the judiciary committees and government oversight committees as well as intelligence committees.  These are the primary places in which there have been investigations or threat of investigations and subpoenas.  However, I think this is counterbalanced with what you saw during the political campaign in which there was a very significant deemphasis on running against President Trump and an emphasis on fixing the broken aspects of the health care system, for instance.  And if the culture in Congress is just one of harassment and agitation, it will constantly exhaust the American people and we will miss the opportunity to try to find some necessary bipartisan movement on health care-- changes that actually lower cost while protecting vulnerable persons, particularly those with preexisting conditions. 
On things like the Endangered Species Act, I have a bipartisan bill called Recovering America’s Wildlife Act that actually gets in front of the problem, gets us off the one-yard-line, so that species do not become endangered in the first place.  And we enhance community recreational opportunity as well as sporting opportunity by protecting the continuity of habitat for wildlife.  So, if there is just an exhaustive effort at investigations, then we are going to miss the opportunity of trying to build some consensus and getting things done, which is what the America people want and certainly what Nebraskans want.
Q: What are some areas of potential bipartisan consensus in the new Congress? 
I am going to put it in three terms.  You have to go back to a robust, bipartisan attempt at consensus around health care.  For instance, the individual market in the rural communities has been absolutely decimated.  You have people leaving the farm or ranch just to go get a job in order to have health care benefits.  This is not only disruptive to their freedom of choice about how they want to organize themselves economically, but the huge cost run-up, particularly for rural communities for health care, is not sustainable.  Drug prices are potentially another area in which we could work together. 
I have proposed some things that would create what we call invisible risk-[sharing].  That’s a fancy way of saying that the government provides a backstop so that people with a preexisting condition, those who are sick, would pay normal rates for insurance and the government would protect them through direct payments to insurance companies for those who have higher than average annual costs of care.  This was part of the original health care reform bill and now is in a bill that I have cosponsored.  These ideas appear to be appealing to both political parties.  America is demanding that health care be dealt with in a smart, consensus-building way that achieves three goals: lowering cost, improving well-being, while protecting vulnerable persons.  It will be an important focus for me in the next Congress.
Secondly, conservation.  If there is an area that transcends the political divide, it is this—trying to move us towards a healthier environment, move us toward a more sustainable renewable energy portfolio, as well as the kinds of continuity of habitat that create recreational opportunity and get us out of endangered species problems.  These are areas around which we could find bipartisan consensus.  Because everybody wins.  When we move ourselves to a more sustainable energy portfolio, when we are respectful toward our environment, we create the conditions for an abundance of green space, while providing affordable living conditions to people through meaningful work.  Keeping those things in balance transcends any partisan divide and appeals to the deeper value of stewardship in our country.
Third, Farm Bill.  This is one of the most important pieces of legislation that America has.  It provides risk stabilization for farmers and ranchers and protects those who have food insecurity.  America enjoys some of the lowest food prices in the world.  We pay less for our groceries than anyone else in the world.  And this is the result of a smart legislative process that creates an abundance of food supply that actually helps feed the world’s poor as well.  These are areas in which I hope to find consensus.
Q: Do you still find fulfillment in Congress? 
I continue to believe that public service is a noble and honorable pursuit.  And we are living in a time in which the ideal of public service has been so denigrated, and there is such cynicism toward the institution—a lot of that brought on by the behavior of Congress itself.  I am really hopeful, in trying to balance what I call front porch strategies with Washington balcony strategies, that we can actually return to a balance in which communities thrive, neighborhoods are safe, and Washington public policy dynamics take a normalized place among American society.  We have outsourced everything to Washington.  We have nationalized every conceivable problem.  Congress is not a 24/7 alarm to be set off by the media whenever it wants to generate crises and entertainment.  This is not Netflix.  This is a serious business of trying to get public policy right so that we have just governance and the appropriate space for thriving in community and individual liberty.

NC Congressional Delegation Fights for Additional Florence Disaster Relief Funding
 
This week, the North Carolina Congressional delegation received the state’s formal request for additional disaster relief funding as our state continues to recover from Hurricane Florence. I support the new request, and Senator Tillis and I are working with Senate appropriators to secure additional, long-term funding to assist rebuilding efforts across the state for those affected by the storm. 
 
As soon as the storm hit, our delegation went to work. In September, we secured an expedited major disaster declaration from President Trump to allow FEMA to begin its work as soon as possible. We then secured $1.14 billion in disaster relief through Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program funding. The additional funding will go a long way towards rebuilding homes, businesses and livelihoods that were swept away and is critical to helping North Carolinians get back on their feet after the historic destruction left by Hurricane Florence. 
 
I want to reiterate if you were affected by Hurricane Florence, please reach out to my office at 336-631-5125 or 800-685-8916 or visit DisasterAssistance.Gov for additional information. Rest assured, I will continue to work with Senator Tillis and our colleagues in the House of Representatives to ensure that North Carolina gets the federal support it needs.

Securing the Ways & Means to Rise Up Out of Poverty
￼

I was able to work my way out of poverty with education and welfare support, but GOP attacks on our nation's welfare system have foreclosed that chance for so many of our community members. This month, I talked to Deray McKesson on Pod Save the People about what we can do in Congress to reopen the doors of opportunity for all our brothers and sisters. Tune in here!

Foxx Report
 
Under Obamacare, small businesses were hit hard by flawed mandates, soaring costs and limited choices. Last October, President Trump issued an executive order that built on the solutions of the Small Business Health Fairness Act, directing the Department of Labor to remove barriers to viable Association Health Plans (AHPs) for businesses and their employees. Small businesses can now to band together and negotiate lower costs on behalf of their employees, and I’m pleased to share that the North Carolina Restaurant & Lodging Association announced the state’s first AHP last week. North Carolinians in the hospitality industry will soon have access to an AHP that provides affordable, comprehensive coverage. That’s nearly half a million workers in North Carolina alone who will have new health care thanks to this policy. Learn more here.
Securing Our Border
As a nation built upon the rule of law, it is crucial for our national security and integrity that we strengthen and secure our Southern border. Congress should fully support President Trump’s request for border wall funding because national security is the number one job of the federal government. And to keep America safe, we must go further to prevent illegal immigration and other crimes carried out across our Southern border. That’s why this Tuesday I cosponsored H.R. 7059, the Build the Wall, Enforce the Law Act. This bill appropriates the full amount of funding requested by President Trump to construct a wall along the Southern border, including technology and infrastructure improvements. Additionally, it affirms Congressional opposition to abolishing ICE, supports border patrol agents, penalizes sanctuary cities and combats transnational crimes including human and drug trafficking.
Ode to the Joy of Real Christmas Trees
This year’s National Christmas Tree Contest winner hails from North Carolina’s Fifth District, Mr. Larry Smith! Each year, the winner of the National Christmas Tree Association’s competition has the honor of providing the official White House Christmas Tree. I was delighted to join Mr. Smith, his family and friends in presenting the First Family with its Fraser Fir Christmas tree last week.
 
￼
   
As a former Christmas tree grower myself, I can attest to the importance of recognizing this often overlooked, yet highly significant farming industry. This week, I congratulated Mr. Smith and thanked Christmas tree growers across the country for contributing to our economy and keeping alive the tradition and joy of having a real Christmas tree. View my remarks here or click the image below.

Leading the Way with Education
The question on everyone’s mind used to be: ‘Where are the jobs?’ Today we have 7 million job opportunities waiting for workers to fill them. We have 4.5 million more jobs than we had two years ago, and a quarter of a million more jobs than we had just over a month ago. The members of the Education and Workforce Committee have worked incredibly hard during the 115th Congress to make this new era of opportunity a reality. It is an honor to have the trust and confidence of my colleagues to help lead all of us to uncovering and implementing more ways to empower Americans to build successful lives as I take on the role of the committee’s ranking member next Congress.

On November 29, 1898 Clive Staple Lewis (better known as C.S. Lewis) was born in Belfast, Ireland. Authoring the classic children’s series, The Chronicles of Narnia, and numerous other literary works, Lewis engaged the culture of the 20th century with theology and his astute understandings of human nature and history.
What’s Coming Up?
Next week, the House will take up legislation to fund the remaining government agencies that have yet to receive FY2019 appropriations. The House made great progress this Fall when it secured the largest boost in pay for our nation’s troops in almost a decade, along with the equipment needed to keep our military as the greatest in the world. I look forward to continuing this success as we turn to funds that would secure our nation’s borders.

Sincerely,

News from Representative Lee Zeldin
￼
Dear Lindsey, 
￼
￼
￼
November has been an exciting month, championing issues important to Long Islanders. 
￼
Rep. Zeldin demands reauthorization and full 
funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund
on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. 
I joined a bipartisan coalition of House and Senate Members of Congress to demand reauthorization and full funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). In our district alone, the LWCF has provided funding for over 65 parks, supporting public access, fishing, hunting, recreation and our environment without taking a dime of taxpayer money. On Long Island, our coastal economy is a vital component of our overall economy, and clean water, land and air are essential priorities all protected by the LWCF. I’ve been proud to lead the fight to reauthorize this important fund in the House, and I will continue to do so on behalf of our district and communities across our country. Learn more here.  
My legislation demanding the FAA reevaluate the North Shore Helicopter Route was passed and signed into law, requiring the FAA to hold a public comment period and public hearing. When the FAA failed to comply with this new law by holding a public ""workshop"" instead of a public hearing, I rallied a bipartisan, bicameral delegation to hold their feet to the fire. It is imperative that the FAA schedule this public hearing immediately and address the concerns and improve the quality of life of impacted Long Islanders. Read my op-ed on this issue here.  
Earlier this year, I secured $3 million for the dredge of the Long Island Intracoastal Waterway, and, earlier this month, the contract to carry out this dredge was awarded to H&L Contracting of Bay Shore. This is continued great news for our coastal economy, commercial and recreational fishermen, boaters and all whose livelihoods rely on the vitality of our communities’ waterways. Coming on the heels of an emergency dredge of the Moriches Inlet, this dredge of the Long Island Intracoastal Waterway will continue to revitalize and support the surrounding maritime industry and the tourism it attracts. Learn more here.  
￼
Reps. Suozzi, Zeldin, and Himes meet with local 
environmental organizations to discuss their 
priorities on Long Island. 
I was joined by Congressman Tom Suozzi (D, NY-3), Congressman Eliot Engel (D, NY-16), and Congressman Jim Himes (D, CT-4) in meeting with local representatives of Save the Sound, Citizens Campaign for the Environment, Sierra Club, Audubon Society, Long Island Sound Study Citizens Advisory Committee and others in our nation's capital to discuss saving Plum Island, restoring the Long Island Sound and other local environmental priorities. As co-chair of the Long Island Sound Caucus, I recently helped secure a 5-year reauthorization of the EPA Long Island Sound Program at $65 million per year to restore the waterway. The Long Island Sound supports tens of billions of dollars in economic value per year. Restoring this critical waterway, which has suffered from pollution and over development for too many years, is so important to improving our area’s water quality and restoring our natural habitats.

Dear  , 
As I wrap up the week in Washington, I want to provide a quick update on some of the things I’ve worked on both in Connecticut and in Washington. 
Overdue Honors for Eastern Connecticut Veterans 
On Monday, I was honored to present Mr. Thomas Southiere of Hebron and the family of the late Mr. William Beaulieu of Vernon with medals of distinction in recognition of their great service to our nation, which my office worked to secure. As always, these medal ceremonies serve as an important opportunity to meet and thank our region’s veterans and their families for their sacrifices. Thank you to all who participated in Monday’s ceremonies. To all of our readers, my district office welcomes requests for military medal recovery for service members, veterans, and their families. Please contact my district Veterans Caseworker Mr. Manny Meseses, USN (Ret.) at 860-886-0139.

More Progress Made Towards New London’s Coast Guard Museum 
This week, the House passed a two-year Coast Guard Authorization bill which included many of the important changes that I advocated for in this year’s Coast Guard Authorization bill, including a provision to help ensure the success of New London’s future National Coast Guard Museum.  Among other things, the bill passed this week expands federal law to allow federal funding to be used to support engineering and design of the new museum – a step that will help provide additional support and momentum to this important project.  
The Coast Guard is the only military service without its own museum, and the project is well on its way to becoming a world-class destination to showcase the rich heritage of our Coast Guard’s role in protecting the shores of the United States. I am glad to see the progress made in this bill, along with a number of important changes that will strengthen our Coast Guard and support the men and women who serve.

Trade War Hurts Eastern CT Dairy Farmers
The Trump administration’s trade war with Mexico and Canada continues to hurt the American agriculture sector. This year alone, our nation’s dairy farmers have already lost over $1 billion in profits as a result of these tariffs. Eastern Connecticut is home to many of our state’s dairy farms, including Oakridge Dairy in Ellington. Oakridge is one of over 40 eastern Connecticut farms who received federal dollars from a mitigation program created to compensate American farmers for these losses. However, as co-owner Seth Bahler told the CT Mirror, the relief they’re seeing from this program is really just a drop in the bucket.   
Nationally, these dairy assistance payments will cover less than 10% of the losses incurred by farmers, who already operate with shoestring margins. This week, I sent a letter alongside my colleagues to Secretary Perdue at the Department of Agriculture asking the department for additional compensation for our farmers that exceeds the payment made earlier this year. The federal government owes it to our farmers to protect them from the damage inflicted by the President’s trade war.

Critical Need for Robust Climate Change Response 
The report is in and the consensus is clear; climate change is a serious and present danger to the welfare and lives of the American people. The 4th National Climate Assessment, conducted by the U.S. Global Change Research Program - a federal program established through an act of Congress—in collaboration with 13 federal member agencies, finds once again that a warming climate poses  a severe threat is to our national security and military infrastructure, economy, and the health of our citizens.   
Already, American lives have been impacted by volatile storm systems and extreme temperatures, which have cost billions in damage and taken the lives of thousands. If nothing more is done to combat what is undoubtedly unfolding, millions more will lose their homes, livelihoods, and health.  Notably, the report makes clear that climate change is a growing threat to our nation’s security and military readiness. For example, rising sea levels threaten our navy bases and shipyards, such as the Norfolk Naval Shipyard that supports repair and maintenance of our fleet. 
It is critical that Congress and this administration embrace these findings, and implement a robust climate change strategy to save American lives.

Weekly Update From Congresswoman Anna G. Eshoo 
H.R. 390, the Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability Act 
This week the House passed my legislation to provide emergency relief to victims of the ISIS genocide in Iraq and Syria. It will now be sent to the President for his signature. 
H.R. 390 requires the U.S. government to direct humanitarian aid to entities assisting displaced religious and ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria targeted for genocide by ISIS. The legislation also includes important provisions that will help the international community document the crimes against humanity that have been committed by ISIS, hold the perpetrators accountable and prevent another genocide from occurring. This legislation will send a powerful message to these communities that we have not forgotten them.
Legislation Anna Cosponsored This Week 
Cosponsored H.R. 7082, Bill to Prohibit US Arms Sales & Military Aid to Saudi Arabia 
On Friday, November 17th the media reported that the CIA concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) ordered the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul last month, contradicting the Saudi government’s claims that he was not involved in the killing. The CIA’s assessment is the most definitive to date linking MBS to the operation and complicates the Trump Administration’s efforts to preserve its relationship with the Saudi government. 
The United States has yet to hold the Crown Prince or the Saudi government accountable for this horrific act, but Congress can and should do so by passing H.R. 7082, a bill I’m cosponsoring to prohibit all U.S. military aid and arms sales to the Saudis.  
Letters Anna Wrote and Cosigned this Week 
Letter to the House Foreign Affairs Committee Requesting a Vote on Armenian Genocide Legislation 
I joined colleagues this week in writing to the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, requesting that he hold a vote on a bipartisan resolution that seeks to intentionally expose and publicly acknowledge the systemic and deliberate annihilation of 1.5 million Armenians, Assyrians, Greeks and other minorities by the Ottoman Empire in 1915. 
Over 100 years after the fact, the U.S. government has yet to make an official statement labeling the atrocities carried out against these minorities as what they were: genocide. I’m proud to have cosponsored the Armenian Genocide Resolution in every Congress I’ve served in to formally recognize one of the darkest chapters in human history. Our letter seeks to finally bring this Resolution to the Committee for a vote. To read the full letter, CLICK HERE. 
Letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Title IX Rules 
Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos released her latest attempt to roll back protections for survivors of sexual violence in K-12 schools and college campuses. In September of 2017, the Department of Education received over 16,000 formal comments during the public comment period on deregulation, demonstrating overwhelming support for the Obama Administration’s 2011 and 2014 Title IX guidance documents. Despite this support, Secretary DeVos chose to rescind these critical civil rights documents and released a dangerous proposed rule that will result in fewer survivors coming forward, making it harder for those who do come forward to seek justice, and ultimately making schools across the country less safe.
Our letter urges Secretary DeVos to rescind the guidance and instead, arrange meetings with a broad range of survivors and survivor advocacy organizations to develop meaningful guidance on Title IX so that all students are protected. To read the full letter, CLICK HERE. 
In the Words of My Constituents 
Every week hundreds of my constituents call and write to me to express their concerns, share their passions and ask questions regarding a wide range of legislation and policies. I actually read every communication and every constituent receives a personal response from me regarding their specific questions and comments.
Here’s a snapshot of the issues constituents wrote and called me about this week:         
·         236 constituents wrote to me to express their concern about the asylum issues at the border. 
·         207 constituents wrote to me to express their support for H.R.15, the Raise the Wage Act to increase the federal minimum wage. 
·         39 constituents wrote to me in support of reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
Weekly Highlights  
This week I held two Tele-Town Hall Meetings with constituents from communities in San Mateo, Santa Cruz and Santa Clara Counties to answer their questions on a variety of issues. The communities participating in the Tele-Town Hall Meeting included: Atherton, La Honda, Ladera, Loma Mar, Menlo Park, Pescadero, Los Altos Hills, Portola Valley, Redwood City, Woodside, Ben Lomond, Bonny Doon, Boulder Creek, Brookdale, Davenport, Felton, Lompico, Scotts Valley, Zayante, Los Gatos and Campbell.
Approximately 1,700 constituents participated in each Meeting and the questions ranged from climate change, to immigration, the Saudi government, health care, and the importance of Congress exercising its war powers. My constituents have consistently told me how valuable they think these meetings are, and I consistently draw a great deal from what my constituents say. My thanks to everyone who participated in the calls. To listen to the Tele-Town Hall Meeting, CLICK HERE. 
Anna in the News 
Anna’s work is written about in the news. Here are some excerpts: 
San Jose Mercury News (11/16/2018) “H-1B spouses: Eshoo, Lofgren introduce bill to protect work authorizations” 
“Two Bay Area congresswomen introduced a bill Friday that would protect thousands of Silicon Valley immigrants from a Trump administration move to strip their right to work. 
“The bill, written by Reps. Anna Eshoo, D-Palo Alto, and Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, would prevent the administration from revoking an Obama-era rule giving work authorization to certain spouses of H-1B visa holders. 
“Since 2015, more than 100,000 immigrant spouses have been authorized to work in any field as long as their husbands or wives have an H-1B visa for skilled workers and are on track to get permanent residency. That lets them earn a living and develop their careers while their families wait in the long backlog for green cards. Most H-1B workers and their spouses are immigrants from India, and the wait for a green card for Indian citizens can stretch on for decades.”
Anna’s Recommended Reading 
I frequently read articles or see videos I think my constituents would benefit from.   
New York Times Editorial (11/27/2018) “Mars Beckons” 
This week NASA successfully landed their spacecraft InSight on Mars. In the months ahead, InSight will begin its study to measure tremors beneath the surface of Mars in order to learn about what’s going on in the innards of the planet and also to shed light on Earth’s origins. This Editorial from the New York Times applauds this challenge.

• Hearing probes disaster response
• More funding for disaster relief
• Marianas in disaster tax relief bill
• Typhoon Yutu relief updates
• Service Academy deadline Friday
• Democrats choose their leaders
• Meeting Guam's delegate-elect
• Vets benefit counselor next week

Hearing probes disaster response. As a guest of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Thursday, I questioned FEMA Administrator Brock Long on his agency’s delivery of services in the Marianas after Typhoon Mangkhut and Super Typhoon Yutu. The hearing was focused on recurring problems with disaster response nationwide, many of which we have seen in the Marianas. Watch a clip of my exchange with Mr. Long by clicking here. 
 

More funding for disaster relief

With the number of disasters nationwide this year—hurricanes Florence and Michael, wildfires in the west, the Marianas typhoons—it is likely that Congress will take action to supply assistance above and beyond what the Federal Emergency Management Agency can do. In response to 2017 disasters Congress included special supplemental aid in four separate laws, most recently last month in the FAA Reauthorization Act. Even before leaving Saipan I spoke with the incoming Chair of the House Appropriations Committee, Nita Lowey, about what the needs would be for the Marianas and received her assurance of help. I have been working since my return to Washington to develop more detailed assessments. I am particularly concerned that federal programs, like food stamps, that are block granted to the Marianas be made whole again after spending unbudgeted money for disaster relief. And I want to make sure that infrastructure, like the power and water systems that are repeatedly put out of commission by typhoons, are hardened against future storms. 
 

Marianas in disaster tax relief

The Marianas have been included in the Disaster Tax Relief bill introduced in the House this week. The legislation allows individuals affected by named disasters, such as Typhoon Mangkhut and Super Typhoon Yutu, to withdraw money from retirement accounts to use for recovery and and later re-contribute money to the account. Survivors would als be eligible to extend loan repayments. Employers, who keep their staff after a storm, would get a a tax credit for 40 percent of wages paid, up to $6,000 per employee. Special rules would also be applied to income qualifying for the Child Tax Credit. The bill specifically provides that the U.S. Treasury make payments to the Commonwealth government equal to any revenue losses resulting from these disaster tax relief provisions. 
 
 

Typhoon Yutu relief updates
 
 
 

Water
Water restoration and water production on Saipan now exceeds 80% complete, with 104 of 131 water wells operating. On Tinian, Maui Pump Station remains operational and water is 100% online in San Jose, Marpo Valley, Carolina Heights and Marpo Heights I and II.

Power
47.9% of power feeders on Saipan are restored (based on feeder loads). All feeders on Tinian remain offline.

SBA disaster loans
The U.S. Small Business Administration has approved more than $1.3 million in low interest disaster loans to help businesses and homeowners recover from Typhoon Mangkhut, and more than $11.3 million in loans post-Typhoon Yutu.

Private nonprofit organizations have one month left to apply for SBA federal disaster loans for property damage caused by Super Typhoon Yutu. The deadline to apply is December 31, 2018.

Transitional shelters
379 occupants remain in shelters as of Thursday, November 29.

Tents
804 tents have been installed on Saipan and 203 have been installed on Tinian as of Thursday, November 29. The Temporary Emergency Tent and Roofing Installation Support (TETRIS) program continues through coordination between the CNMI government and FEMA. To apply for the program, residents must complete a Right of Entry (ROE) form, which can be picked up at the Saipan Disaster Recovery Center (Multipurpose Center) or Fire Station #4 in Koblerville. Deadline for ROE submissions is Saturday, December 8. For questions on the program, call 644-9083.

Schools
The Public School System will reopen schools on a staggered basis on December 3 and 10. Depending on the extent of damage at each campus, some students will not return to their own campus and may experience altered schedules. Click here for details. 

Northern Marianas College will reopen on December 3 at the Saipan Southern High School campus in Koblerville. View the adjusted calendar, schedule and campus map here. 

﻿Food stamps
The Disaster Nutrition Assistance Program has been extended next week. Only 1,000 applicants are being processed daily. 
 
 
 

Application deadline Friday. Young men and women from the Northern Marianas, who are interested in an exceptional college education at no cost and are committed to serving our country should apply now for a congressional nomination to one of the U.S. service academies. There are openings for the Marianas at the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy, and the U.S. Military Academy for next year’s incoming class, as a result of legislation I have had enacted over the last 10 years. Though, as your Congressman, I make nominations, the final selection among nominees is made by academy admissions officials. They look for strong grades, high SAT or ACT scores, physical ability, and leadership potential. Service academy graduates receive an officer’s commission and must serve for five years. More information and an application form are available here, and at your local congressional office. Applications are due on Friday, December 7. 
 

Democrats choose their leaders

The full House of Representatives will vote for Speaker on January 3, when the 116th Congress convenes. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus also this week elected Joaquin Castro of Texas as our new Chairman. Ruben Gallego, Arizona, will be 1st Vice Chair; Nanette Barragan, California, 2nd Vice Chair; and, Adriano Espaillat, New York, Caucus Whip.
 
 

Meeting Guam's delegate-elect. Guam Delegate-elect Michael San Nicolas (D) was on Capitol Hill this week, along with his incoming class of new members for the 116th Congress. We spoke at length about how to be effective as a Delegate and about the issues that both Guam and the Marianas face in the years ahead. I look forward to a continuing strong working relationship between our neighboring districts. Welcome, Delegate San Nicolas. 
 
 

Vets benefits counselor next week. This Thursday, a Veterans Affairs Counselor will be on Saipan to assist veterans who have questions and concerns about benefits and to assist with the claims process. The counselor will be at the Saipan VA Clinic at the MH II Building, Suite 206 in Garapan from 9:30 am to 4 pm. For more information call (670) 322-0035. 
 
 

Visitors. Lino Olopai, Francisco and Patricia Kapileo, Dr. Ignacia Demapan, Leoloni Taule and Paul Ythemar were in Washington, DC this week to attend the annual grantee meeting of the Administration for Native Americans. They visited the congressional office and toured the U.S. Capitol on Thursday. Mr. and Mrs. Kapileo and Mr. Olopai will go on a tour of the White House on Saturday morning.

Dear Friend, 
Putting Veterans’ Interests First  
Today I am calling on the Department of Veterans Affairs to publicly reveal the VA’s plan to ensure all veterans receive the GI Bill benefits they have earned, summarize how the VA will properly implement the Forever GI Bill, and respond to concerns about leadership of the VA’s IT transition. Veterans have not been receiving the proper benefits and this situation is completely unacceptable. The VA must take immediate action to ensure that veterans receive the benefits promised to them through the Forever GI Bill. The failure to properly administer these benefits will cause undue financial hardship for the men and women who have bravely served our nation in uniform. These veterans must be made whole, and steps must be taken to ensure no veteran loses their educational opportunity or housing because of the VA’s incompetence. I will work with my colleagues to continue pressuring the VA to undertake the work necessary to ensure all veterans receive the GI Bill benefits they have earned.
If you are experiencing financial hardship because of GI Bill funds not received, please call 1-888-442-4551 ASAP. 
New Voices 
I’m excited about the many new voices and perspectives that will be a part of our leadership team. Our caucus has elected my friends Rep. Katherine Clark as Vice Chair of the House Democratic Caucus, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries as Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Rep. Ben Ray Luján as Assistant Democratic Leader, Rep. James Clyburn as Majority Whip, and Rep. Steny Hoyer as Majority Leader. We have an array of candidates who will diversify the leadership of the House and help us pursue an agenda that will benefit hardworking families in New Hampshire and across the country. I also voted for Nancy Pelosi for Speaker of the House because of her proven effectiveness as a leader and experience advancing meaningful legislation through the House of Representatives. I look forward to working with our entire caucus to improve access to quality, affordable healthcare, protect our environment, and expand economic opportunity for all Americans.
￼ 
I was honored to be selected by my colleagues as a Vice Chair of the New Democrat Coalition. The New Democrat Coalition represents the type of results driven focus that the American people expect from their elected leaders. We strive to build consensus amongst our colleagues on both sides of the aisle and advance legislation that will bolster economic opportunity for hardworking families and create an environment in which small businesses can grow and thrive. As Democrats assume the majority in Congress, the New Democrats will be a force for action. I look forward to pursuing policies that will protect our environment, improve access to healthcare, and restore accountability in Washington all while growing our economy and creating jobs. 
￼ 
Taking Action on Climate Change 
The extensive report on climate change released last week by the U.S. Global Change Research Program helps confirm what we already know: climate change poses a serious threat to our environment, public safety and economy. We’re already seeing the impact of climate change in New Hampshire, and we owe it to our children and future generations to act swiftly and boldly to address this growing crisis. You can read the full report here. 
Get the Healthcare You Need 
There’s still time to explore your options for health insurance in 2019 and get the healthcare plan that works best for you and your family. Open Enrollment ends December 15th, so be sure to visit http://healthcare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596 to start shopping and get covered. 
Strengthening Safety for Students 
Last week, I joined Senator Hassan and survivor advocates from the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence (NHCADSV), the University of New Hampshire Prevention Innovations Research Center, Keene State College, Colby Sawyer College, Plymouth State University, and Rivier University in Concord to highlight the potential negative impacts of the proposed changes to Title IX announced earlier this month by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. Title IX mandates equal opportunity to education, and the proposed changes will undermine that goal, as they serve to make schools, campuses and students less safe. Secretary DeVos should reevaluate her proposals and instead focus on improving the safety and well-being of students. I appreciated the opportunity to hear from so many incredible survivor advocates and educators at this discussion, and I will continue to work with them to strengthen safety for all our students. 
￼ 
Discussing Title IX changes with Senator Hassan, educators and survivor advocates 
Here to Serve You  
As your Representative, my most important responsibility is supporting Granite Staters when they need help with federal agencies. I was contacted by Shahad Mattloob of Nashua, who had an issue of concern regarding her Employment Authorization Document (EAD) card from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). My staff worked with USCIS and helped resolve Shahad’s issue. If my office may be of assistance with a problem you are experiencing, please reach out to my staff at 603-226-1002 so we can learn how we may help.
As always, thank you for everything you do to make New Hampshire such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise a family. Have a great weekend! 
Sincerely,

News from Representative Bustos 
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
All-American Flag Act 
￼
Congresswoman Bustos speaking on the House Floor in support of her legislation, the All-American Flag Act 
Last night, I was pleased the House passed my bipartisan bill that requires all American flags purchased by the federal government to be made in the United States and from materials grown or produced in the United States. This idea came from a conversation I had with a Vietnam veteran in Moline. Since then, I have worked across the aisle to require the Department of Defense to purchase American-made flags. By purchasing flags made on American soil, we can ensure that the symbol of our nation is preserved while supporting American jobs and manufacturing. Click here to watch my full speech. 
Supporting Local Health Centers 
￼
Congresswoman Bustos meeting with advocates for community health centers 
Today, I was pleased to announce that health centers across the district will receive more than $8 million in total grant funding. These federal dollars were awarded through the Department of Health and Human Services to help community-based organizations provide primary care for underserved communities. All hardworking Illinoisans should have access to affordable care, and community health centers are vital in providing this care throughout our region. I’m pleased these investments will help keep our communities healthy. Read more by clicking here.  
To keep up on the work that I am doing to fight for the hardworking families of Illinois, make sure to stay connected with me @RepCheri!

11/30/18 18:11,Solving The Debt Crisis," 
￼ 








Here are some big things from this week:
  
1. Solving The Debt Crisis 
  
￼ 
  
Unfortunately, Congress has once again put its political self-interest ahead of our national interest. We had a chance to make meaningful changes to Congress's broken funding process -- instead, it turned out to be a lost opportunity. This is completely irresponsible. I will keep fighting for a politically neutral platform to fund the government because without that we will never solve this debt crisis. 
  
Read more in Politico.  
  
2. Funds Secured For Harbor Deepening
  
￼ 
  
We secured additional federal funding to keep the Savannah Harbor Expansion project on track in 2019. There's no doubt the Port of Savannah is an economic engine for Georgia, and this funding is a huge win for our state and nation. 
  
Read more in Savannah Morning News. 
  
3. Holiday Cards For Troops
  
￼  
  
I joined the American Red Cross to write holiday cards to military personnel deployed overseas. Our service members are our best and brightest. We are grateful for their sacrifices, especially this time of year. 
 
Learn how you can send some holiday cheer to service members and their families here.

Dear Friend,
I hope you and your loved ones had a wonderful Thanksgiving, filled with family, friends and great food. I’m thankful every day to represent the community where I’ve spent my life, and as we prepare for a new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, I’m working to achieve action on our shared values and priorities.
One critical goal is stopping the rapid and dangerous progression of climate change, which was examined in great detail in the Fourth National Climate Assessment. The Trump administration cynically tried to bury this report by releasing it last Friday, in the middle of the holiday weekend, but they couldn’t hide the shocking conclusions from experts across the federal government: the effects of climate change are already happening -- wreaking havoc on our environment,  our economy, and our communities -- and could get much worse.  
￼ 
Though President Trump callously dismissed these dire warnings, we will continue demanding action on this crisis; we’ll keep working to expand and preserve our public lands through efforts such as my Colorado Wilderness Act, prevent harmful emissions that pollute our air, hold accountable public servants tasked with environmental stewardship, and much more. I’m prepared to lead this charge because stopping climate change is the moral imperative of our time.
We also have a responsibility to oppose the Trump administration’s inhumane and cruel immigration policies. Like many Americans, I was shocked and alarmed by last Sunday’s events that took place at our southern border near San Diego, in which federal agents used tear gas on civilians seeking asylum. We must demand answers regarding why these heavy-handed tactics were employed, and we must scrutinize every action this administration has taken to advance its reckless, xenophobic agenda. This can’t be who we are as a nation. 
￼ 
The actions of President Trump and his Republican allies have forced us to examine our national conscience, but we can help right these wrongs by committing to a new agenda that puts people over partisanship, and hope over fear. When Democrats lead the House next year, we will introduce H.R. 1, which helps to restore our democracy by getting dark money out of our politics, strengthening ethics rules and tackling voter suppression. We’ll also work to achieve gun safety reforms that save lives, equality for all, more affordable health care, and fairer wages for working families. It won’t be easy, but it’s the job we were elected to do. The 116th Congress will truly be for the people. 
And as we enter the holiday season, I encourage you to give the gift of good health and peace of mind by purchasing a health plan under the Affordable Care Act. Open Enrollment lasts until January 15 in Colorado, but why wait? Visit connectforhealthco.com today to easily shop for quality and affordable coverage.

Happy Friday –  
I’m about to head back to the best district in the country, and I’m ready for a few days of warmth and sunshine. I do not take Arizona’s climate for granted being in D.C. week after week. It’s always good to be among my family, friends, and constituents – even for a short while.
Remember Our Fundamentals 
￼ 
If you’re like me, maybe you sit back and wonder how our spending got so out of control, or our national debt so high, or our judicial confirmation process so partisan. These are all good questions that fewer people seem to have the answers to nowadays. Thankfully, Senator Mike Lee has the answers, and he brings us back to the constitutional fundamentals that have made this nation the greatest in the history of the world. I interviewed him for my podcast this week. Click this link or the logo above to listen. 
Secure the Border 
￼
￼
Countless public servants have promised to secure the border. Yet, the border is still not secure; the wall is not built; our Border Patrol agents are undermanned; and time is running out to do something meaningful with this situation while Republicans control both chambers of Congress. This week, I wrote an op-ed on this subject, and I appeared on Fox News to talk about what Congress must do in the remaining weeks of the 115th Congress to fund and build the wall. 
Looking Back on the 115th Congress 
￼ 
Speaking of the remaining weeks of the 115th Congress, the new year – and the 116th Congress – is almost upon us. However, there is a lot to look back on and remember form the past two years. My office has accomplished a lot for Arizona’s Fifth District; follow my Facebook and Twitter, starting tomorrow, for daily posts on what we did since I took the oath of office.
Fighting for Veterans 
￼ 
This week, I met with Dan Caldwell with Concerned Veterans for America to discuss the best way to continue fighting for our veterans. I am committed to working with all of my colleagues in Congress to ensure that the United States keeps its promises to those who have sacrificed for the freedoms we enjoy today.
We’re Moving 
￼ 
Before the start of each new Congress, dozens of Members vacate their offices. The empty offices are available to returning members by seniority. This week I participated in the office selection process, and thanks to an extensive search by my staff, we selected 1318 Longworth House Office Building to be our new Washington office for the 116th Congress. 
We will move later next month and will alert you when it happens. Until then, we will continue to operate out of 1626 Longworth. 
Christmas Time is Here 
￼ 
It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas here in D.C. This year’s Capitol Christmas tree is from Oregon. 
Military Service Academy Interviews 
￼ 
My District Office recently conducted our annual series of military service academies interviews, and I was honored to spend some time with the distinguished panelists during their busy day. Special thanks to the Chairman of the panels, Col. Towers, along with the rest of our panelists.

Fixing Our Broken Democracy


￼
The Promise of Our Democracy 
The American people and our young new Members have made their priorities clear: when Democrats take the gavel, delivering a better deal for our democracy will be H.R. 1.  
￼ 
Congresswoman Pelosi held a press conference today with the newly elected Members of Congress to discuss H.R. 1, a bold new reform package to restore the promise of our democracy. 
H.R. 1 is a bold reform package to restore the promise of our democracy – a government of, by and for the people.  We will reduce the role of money in politics, restore ethics and integrity to government, and strengthen the Voting Rights Act.  With bold action to fix our democracy, we can renew Americans’ trust in Congress to drive progress in the issues that matter most in their lives.
￼ 
Remembering Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk  
Forty years ago, in a moment of horror and heartbreak, San Francisco lost two beloved sons and our nation lost two visionary, progressive leaders. Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Milk’s lives were dedicated to expanding opportunity and promoting justice.  Their vision and integrity helped ensure that all voices were heard and that every member of our community had a seat at the table.   
In San Francisco, we like to say ‘the beauty is in the mix,’ and thanks to Moscone and Milk’s pioneering work, our city and our government more fully reflect the beauty and diversity that is our strength.  It was a true blessing to know Harvey Milk and to see first-hand his and Mayor Moscone’s exuberant, expansive and compassionate leadership.  They were beacons of hope to us all, and they transformed the political and social culture of San Francisco for all time.
Today, our communities face an unprecedented assault on our guiding values of liberty, justice and equality.  Our new House Majority will proudly honor Moscone and Milk’s legacies by expanding economic opportunities, protecting our patriotic Dreamers and passing the Equality Act to remove all doubt that sexual orientation and gender identity warrant full civil rights protections, not just in the workplace but every place.  Four decades after Moscone and Milk’s work was so tragically cut short, we proudly reaffirm our shared mission to oppose bigotry and discrimination, and advance progress for all Americans.

￼ 
My office recently assisted a veteran regarding his disability benefits claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). He had contacted our office because his claim was reopened after an initial denial in 2017, but he had not received any updates. Our office contacted the VA on his behalf and conveyed the details of his situation. As a result, the VA rendered a decision in favor of my constituent, awarded him a $29,000 retroactive payment, and resumed his monthly benefits.

NEWSROOM 


November 30, 2018 
WEEK IN REVIEW 
￼
To start off this week's From the Front... I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nation’s capital, including James Arel of Cabot, Jason Carter of Texarkana, Dolores Chitwood of Fort Smith, Cammie Scott of Springdale, Robert Waddell of Springdale, Howard Woodall of Fort Smith, Mark and Karen Lundy of Rogers, Kevin Horn of Rogers, Julie Paladino of Russellville, Braden Vaughn of Russellville, Bill and Jen Horton of Rogers, Ryan Hollingsworth of Bentonville, Tracy Neal of Rogers, Kevin Butzlaff of Rogers, and Brett and Joanna Thompson of Fayetteville. Safe travels back to the Natural State.
This week, the House considered and passed, on suspension, the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act (S. 1768), the Women in Aerospace Education Act (H.R. 4254), the Global Fragility and Violence Reduction Act (H.R. 5273), the United States-Mexico Economic Partnership Act (H.R. 1567), the Preventing Destabilization of Iraq Act (H.R. 4591), the Democratic Republic of the Congo Democracy and Accountability Act (H.R. 6207), the Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability Act (Senate Amendment to H.R. 390), the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act (Senate Amendment to S. 140), the Strengthening the Health Care Fraud Prevention Task Force Act (H.R. 6753), the Action for Dental Health Act (H.R. 2422), the State of Modern Application, Research, and Trends of IoT Act (H.R. 6032), a bill to add Ireland to the E–3 nonimmigrant visa program (H.R. 7164), Federal Agency Customer Experience Act (H.R. 2846), the All-American Flag Act (H.R. 3121), the Inspector General Access Act (H.R. 3154), the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (H.R. 5759), the Settlement Agreement Information Database Act (H.R. 6777), the Federal CIO Authorization Act (H.R. 6901), and the National Flood Insurance Program Further Extension Act (H.R. 7187). 
￼
The end of the year is fast approaching, which means that we are in the final stretch of the 115th Congress. The House is busy wrapping up legislative business, while also looking forward to next year. This week, I was re-elected to serve on the House Republican Steering Committee, where I represent members from Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Puerto Rico. The Steering Committee recommends members of the U.S. House of Representatives for committee assignments and chairmanships. We do this by analyzing a range of factors, including member background, expertise on issues, and level of seniority. 
Why does this matter? Committees are at the heart of the legislative process and where significant work occurs. Legislation is written by committees, hearings are held by committees, and policy priorities are impacted by committees. Committee assignments also determine what issues and policy areas members will have a direct influence on. 
My focus in this role will always be to position members for success, and in a way that allows them to serve their constituents and the American people in the strongest way possible. There is a lot of work to be done in the 116th Congress and effective leadership will be critical to turning our priorities into results. It’s an honor to serve on the Steering Committee, and I thank my colleagues for entrusting me to be their voice through this process again. 
￼
I also spent a majority of the week trying to advance the work of the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform. The panel of 16 members – four House Republicans, four House Democrats, four Senate Republicans, and four Senate Democrats – spent the last year working to accomplish our charge: producing bipartisan, bicameral recommendations to reform the federal budget and appropriations process. 
And we did. We came up with a proposal that – while not a silver bullet – began to take steps towards improving federal budgeting and found consensus amongst our diverse panel. In spite of this, our plan failed with five Republicans and two Democrats voting in the affirmative, three Republicans and two Democrats voting in opposition, and four Democrats voting present. 
We had the wonderful opportunity to serve as an example to our colleagues and our country—the opportunity to prove that Washington can work together. We let them down. I am extremely disappointed in our failure and in my colleagues who lacked the ‘political will’ we have preached is so needed in Washington to vote out this good, bipartisan proposal. Their votes were on politics, not product and proved us deserving of Congress’s low approval rating. (Full statement) 
￼
On Thursday, I was honored to say a few words at the unveiling of Speaker Ryan’s House Budget Committee chairman portrait and recognize his time at the helm of the committee. His dedication to entitlement reform and innovative policies to set our nation on a fiscally responsible path set the standard of excellence that is expected in this role – one I have worked to uphold during my tenure as Budget Chairman.  It has been a privilege to serve beside him, and an even a greater honor to call him a friend. I wish him the utmost success in the years ahead and thank him for his commitment to our great nation. 
I’m now headed to the Reagan National Defense Forum to talk about our national defense and discuss how we can better improve our military readiness. With today’s ever-evolving national security landscape, it is critical that we constantly analyze how our country can better prepare for and confront the challenges we face.

Thief River Falls in 1905 – Pennington County
 
Dear Friends,
 
This week, I was glad to announce that House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway and I have reached an agreement in principle on the 2018 Farm Bill along with our Senate counterparts, Chairman Pat Roberts of Kansas and Ranking Member Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. While work continues to finalize the bill – we are polishing off language and waiting on scores from the Congressional Budget Office – I look forward to presenting it to folks in the Seventh District and around the country as soon as we are done. On Tuesday, my office learned that Northbound U.S.- Canadian border crossings were ordered to close early, causing problems for people that rely on border crossings for work. My office contacted U.S. Customs and Border Control on Wednesday and got them to reverse this order. I am happy that this change could be made quickly to spare folks from racing the clock home every night.
 
Sincerely,
￼ Congressman Collin C. Peterson
Minnesota 7th District
 
Border Decision to Lock Northbound Gates Early is Reversed
On Tuesday night, travelers heading into Canada from Roseau were surprised when northbound traffic was blocked at the U.S. border after 8 P.M. even though Canadian authorities keep their ports open until 10 P.M. and midnight. On Wednesday, my office spoke with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers in the Seattle field office where the decision was originally made. That evening, CBP reversed course and will allow northbound traffic to reach the Tolsoi Port until 10 P.M., Piney Port until 10 P.M., and the South Junction Port until midnight.
 
I’m glad this issue was resolved quickly, and I’m still urging CBP to keep the Lancaster and Roseau ports open longer.
 
U.S. Canada Inter-Parliamentary Meeting
￼
 
I met with members of the Canadian parliament on Wednesday to discuss our national relations, the new trade deal to replace NAFTA, the administration’s continued tariffs on steel and aluminum, and dairy policy in Canada and the U.S. We also discussed the northwest angle and the history of the Blue Dog Coalition.
 
Bayer Crop Science Vice President of Government Relations
￼
Duane Simpson and Scott Kuschmider
 
Bayer Crop Science’s new Vice President of Government Relations, Duane Simpson, stopped by my office on Thursday to introduce himself and to share a few of Bayer’s priorities for the 116th Congress. This division of Bayer develops crop protection and seed products with the goal of increasing the productivity and nutritional value of crops around the world. I was glad to meet Duane and I look forward to hearing more from him and his team.
 
Minnesota Chamber and Building and Construction Trades Council
￼
President Doug Loon and President Harry Melander
 
Doug Loon of the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce and Harry Melander of the Building and Construction Trades Council traveled to Washington to advocate for H.R. 3115, the Superior National Forest Land Exchange Act. I support this bill that codifies an already-approved land exchange between the U.S. Forest Service and PolyMet. It passed the House of Representatives by a strong bipartisan vote of 309 - 99. The project has undergone more than a decade of environmental review and will create jobs in Minnesota.
 
CentraCare Health
￼
Ken Holmen (CEO), Santo Cruz (Director of Community and Government Relations) and Paul Harris (Vice President, General Counsel)
 
This week, representatives of CentraCare Health visited my office to discuss rural nursing shortages and the system’s response to the opioid epidemic. The group also thanked me for my support as they participate in the Medicare Shared Savings Program to achieve better health outcomes and lower costs for Medicare beneficiaries. CentraCare is a non-profit health system comprised of hospitals, nursing homes, senior housing, clinics, and pharmacies spanning 12 counties in greater Minnesota. 
 
Discussing the Future of U.S. Hemp
￼
Michael Bowman and Hillary Barry (LAKE WILSON)
 
I recently met with Michael Bowman, a Colorado producer of industrial hemp, and his uncle, Hillary Barry of Lake Wilson, on the likelihood of deregulating the production of industrial hemp within the 2018 Farm Bill. I supported provisions in the 2014 Farm Bill which encourage additional research on this promising new crop and I look forward to the possible encouragement of wider plantings of industrial hemp by the 2018 Farm Bill.
 
Pheasants Forever – Dave Nomsen
￼
 
I sat down with my friend David Nomsen this week. Dave is the Vice President of Governmental Affairs for Pheasants Forever and I was glad to give him an update on the Farm Bill. We discussed the conservation title of the bill and our shared desire to increase the maximum number of acres allowed in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), a program that incentivizes farmers to take cropland out of production and plant species that improve environmental health. CRP land frequently becomes a habitat for wildlife and investing in this program is an effective way to grow regional animal populations.
 
Sharing Rural Values with Urban Members
￼
 
Congressman Tom Suozzi represents New York’s 3rd District containing most of the North Shore of Long Island and parts of Queens. Last fall, Rep. Suozzi visited the 7th District to learn about our part of Minnesota and tour a sugarbeet processing plant. We went duck hunting together, and he took the wood duck shown in the picture above. I had his duck mounted and I presented him the trophy this week. It is important for Members of Congress to understand the differences in lifestyle and attitude that exist in other parts of the nation, and I was happy to accompany Congressman Suozzi during his visit.
 
National Association of Conservation Districts
￼
President-Elect Tim Palmer, Executive Board Member Ian Cunningham (PIPESTONE) and my staff aide Cody Hollerich
 
Representatives of the National Association of Conservation Districts (NACD) met with my staff this week to discuss the importance of local input on the use of federal conservation funds. NACD represents more than 3,000 conservation districts across the United States and they believe that conservation works best when strategies are coordinated with input from all levels. They stressed the need to maintain funding for conservation programs and the benefit of giving local working groups the freedom to use resources for the activities that are needed most.
 
Gift Making with the Sons of Norway
￼
 
The Sons of Norway taught children in Thief River Falls to make traditional Scandinavian Christmas gifts this week. The children learned to make decorative wheat sheaves, spiced orange pomander balls, tree and table ornaments, Christmas cookies and more. The Sons of Norway used this event to kick off the holiday season and to emphasize the importance of giving during this time.

Farm Bill
After months of work on the farm bill, I was pleased to announce that House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway and I have reached an agreement in principle on the 2018 Farm Bill along with our Senate counterparts, Chairman Pat Roberts of Kansas and Ranking Member Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. While work continues to finalize the bill—we’re polishing off language and waiting on scores from the Congressional Budget Office—I look forward to presenting it to folks in the Seventh District and around the country as soon as we’re done. I’ve repeatedly heard from farmers and ranchers, rural community advocates, and a range of other farm bill stakeholders and I understand how important it is to get this done. We’re almost there!
 
The Great Outdoors with Dennis Anderson
Last week I was a guest on The Great Outdoors radio show, hosted by Dennis Anderson. We discussed deer hunting and the Manage Our Wolves bill that had just passed the House, a bill in which I spoke about on the floor.

This Week in American History
￼
 On November 28th, 1922, Lake of the Woods County was established. It contains the northernmost point in the Lower 48 states, the Northwest Angle. According to the 2010 census, Lake of the Woods County has a population of 4,045. The county seat is Baudette.
 
What’s the Story?
￼
 
Arctic Cat is a snowmobile and ATV manufacturer based in Thief River Falls. Formed in 1960, the company has been an important part of the Thief River Falls community for over fifty years. They unveiled their first front engine snowmobile in 1963 and have since improved and expanded their line of vehicles to fit the needs of recreational and competitive riders across the country. I have a copy of their book, 50 Years of the Cat, on display in my Washington, D.C. office.

Last week I sent out my bi-annual priorities poll. See the results in this edition.   
This week, the House Democratic Caucus voted on its leadership for the 116th Congress. I have no doubt that these capable individuals will help us accomplish great things in the coming Congress and beyond. 
On the Friday after Thanksgiving, the Trump Administration released its federally-mandated climate report, which reiterates what the scientific community has known for years: that global climate change is real, it is exacerbated by human activities, and if left unchecked, it will continue to have catastrophic effects on ecosystems, public health, infrastructure, and economies worldwide. 
In this edition of Alan’s Inbox, see my response to constituents who have contacted me to express their opposition to the Manage Our Wolves Act.  
Lastly, don’t forget to take this week’s poll in the right-hand column.

Last week, I sent out my 2019 Priorities Poll where I asked people to answer this question: What should the first session of the new 116th Congress focus on throughout 2019? I’m proud to say the poll was the most successful priorities poll I’ve ever sent out. More than 3,300 people responded, providing 35,389 responses. I’ve had time to look over the responses and see what you thought were the most important things to focus on. I’m sure you will be glad to know that I have already been working hard on many of these issues and will continue to focus on them in the 116th Congress. This week, I wanted to share the full results of the 2019 Priorities Poll with you.

Electing House Democratic Leadership for the 116th Congress 
This week, the House Democratic Caucus voted on its leadership for the 116th Congress. I’d like to offer my sincere congratulations to the new leaders of the Democratic Caucus: Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, Assistant Democratic Leader Ben Ray Lujan, and Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries. I have no doubt that these capable leaders will help us accomplish great things in the coming Congress and beyond.

Responding to the Trump Administration’s Climate Report 
Late in the afternoon on the Friday after Thanksgiving, the Trump Administration tried unsuccessfully to sweep its own federally-mandated climate study under the rug. This tactic was not surprising, given that the report is at odds with the President’s own statements and policies on climate. It reiterates what the scientific community and American public have known for years: that global climate change is real, it is exacerbated by emissions from human activities, and if left unchecked, it will continue to have catastrophic effects on ecosystems, public health, infrastructure, and economies worldwide. 
Despite the Climate Assessment’s decisive findings, the Trump Administration continues to roll back rules intended to reduce emissions, such as those from power plants and automobiles—two of the largest sources of greenhouse gasses. The President claims that implementing such policies would “sacrifice the economic well-being of our country.”
In reality, though, it is climate change that will devastate the U.S. economy, let alone the environment, if left unmitigated. According to the Climate Assessment, “in the absence of increased adaptation efforts, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century.” 
On Monday, when asked about these findings—which were reached by 300 scientists across 13 federal agencies—President Trump said that he, quote, “[didn’t] believe it.”  The President may choose to ignore the facts before him, the American people will not. Fortunately, starting next year, the House of Representatives will have a majority ready to take the threat of climate change seriously. There is simply no more time to waste.

Each week hundreds of constituents contact my office to share their views on a variety of topics. I have recently received many messages from constituents expressing their opposition to the Manage our Wolves Act. Below is a portion of my response to those messages:  
  
“This legislation would remove protections for most gray wolves across the continental United States under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and prevent any judicial review of these actions.  
The gray wolf is currently a protected species in most states under the ESA, and because of that protection, significant strides have been made toward restoring populations that had once plummeted due to hunting and habitat loss.  However, despite these gains, gray wolves still only occupy a small portion of their historic range. 
This bill would not only undermine the ESA by replacing science-based judgements with a political process, but by preventing judicial review of decisions to delist, it would limit the ability of everyday Americans participate in the process.  For these reasons, I voted against this bill when it came to the floor of the House for a vote on November 16th, 2018, but unfortunately it passed. 
I have a long history of advocating for strong and active protection of our environment and biodiversity for future generations, and I am proud of my 95% lifetime score from the California League of Conservation Voters.  You may also be interested to know that I am the sponsor of the Wildlife Innovation and Longevity Driver (WILD) Act, a bipartisan bill that would preserve wildlife and promote innovative measures for conservation.  I will continue working to support conservation efforts and put an end to practices that threaten endangered species and other wildlife.”

11/30/18 17:25,Rep. Grothman Newsletter - Stopping Invasive Species,"￼ 
  

Protecting Wisconsin's Waterways
This week, I introduced a bipartisan bill along with Representative Mark Pocan (D-Madison) that will help keep Wisconsin's waterways healthy by restricting the access of invasive species of fish. The bill, H.R. 7170, would amend the Federal Power Act to ensure that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would be required to consider the threats posed to Wisconsin's waterways by invasive species of fish prior to authorizing the construction of a new fishway. 

Wisconsin's Sixth District is home to a significant amount of lakes and waterways that should be protected from invasive species of fish in order to conserve their natural habitats. Fishways help enhance and preserve the populations of native fish by providing them with a passageway through dams. However, invasive species, such as Asian Carp, use the same fishways to invade rivers and lakes and devastate native species and their habitats.

Wisconsin experiences this problem firsthand with Asian Carp, a well known invasive species that can grow up to three feet in length. Recently, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ordered the installation of a fishway at the Prarie du Sac dam, a site where Asian Carp populations have been spotted. Installing a fishway in this location would allow the Asian Carp to migrate upstream to the Wisconsin River, Lake Wisconsin and eventually the Great Lakes. This would wreak havoc on native species and threaten the Great Lakes $7 billion fishing industry. Federal decision makers need to consider all possible consequences before ordering the installation of new fishways. I am proud to promote legislation that brings awareness to this issue and helps protect Wisconsin's native fish species and waterways.

Improving Prisons
This week, at a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing, I questioned The Honorable Michael E. Horowitz, Inspector General for the Department of Justice and Mr. Hugh J. Hurwitz, Acting Director for the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) on how the BOP holds both inmates and guards accountable for wrongdoing.
Specifically, I questioned them about the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). Since being signed into law, PREA has led to a large number of frivolous accusations against guards, which in turn leads to a litany of paperwork. I wanted to see things from the BOP's perspective in order to gain insight to these false accusations in an effort to to discern how we can both A) protect actual victims under PREA and B) reduce frivolous reporting that only serves to distract from other important prison matters.  Additionally, I touched on the treatment of prison guards by inmates throughout the country and within the Sixth District. Specifically, the need to bring more awareness to the difficulty prison guards experience when attempting to discipline or prevent inmates from causing disturbances. Prison guards have a very difficult job that involves dealing with many unpleasant circumstances and I am grateful for their service.     For more information and to watch my entire line of questioning, please click here.          

USMCA 
Today, President Trump, along with Prime Minister Trudeau and President Pena Nieto, officially signed the United States-Mexica-Canada Agreement (USMCA) at the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The trade agreement will now make its way to the U.S. International Trade Commission to assess the economic impact of the deal and to Congress for approval, which will likely be determined  in the new session beginning in January.  

The trade deal is good news for dairy farmers in Wisconsin who have struggled significantly over recent months. The deal will allow the US to export the equivalent of 3.6% of Canada's dairy market, up from the existing level of about 1%. Additionally, Canada eliminated its Class 6 and 7 pricing systems which allowed low priced dairy ingredients to undersell United States dairy sales in Canada. 

Overall, the deal gives the United States more access to Canada and Mexico's markets which creates more of a level playing field for American farmers and businesses. I look forward to examining the final draft of the deal in detail and assessing the benefits it will provide Wisconsinites and Americans as a whole.

News from Congresswoman Shea-Porter
￼
NEWS FROM THE 1st DISTRICT
Dear Friends, 
This week, Congress started finishing its work for the year, but we didn’t vote on much. House Republicans even pulled their tax bill, so we only voted on a handful of small items. Earlier this year, we passed full-year funding for the Defense Department, the VA, and several other agencies, but we still need to reach an agreement to fund the rest of the government by the end of next week, or several important government agencies, such as the Departments of Commerce and Homeland Security, will shut down. I am hopeful that we will reach an agreement that funds the rest of the government. 
We also learned this week that President Trump’s former lawyer lied to Congress about the president’s business dealings in Russia during the 2016 campaign. These are very disturbing developments in the Russia investigation, and you can read more about them here and here.  
Urging FDA to require clear labeling of sesame products 
I founded and co-chair the Congressional Asthma and Allergy Caucus to raise awareness of and promote research into allergies. That’s why I sent a letter this week with Congressmen Elliot Engel (D-NY) and Gregg Harper (R-MS) to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, urging the FDA to require clear labeling of foods that contain sesame products. An allergy to sesame is the ninth most common allergy, and it can cause severe reactions for many. Uniform and easily understandable labels will help Americans with sesame allergies and their families safely navigate their food choices and avoid preventable reactions. Considering the prevalence and severity of sesame allergies, I strongly encouraged the FDA to regulate sesame products in a manner similar to the eight currently labeled allergens and require the clear labeling of these products.  
Hampton Harbor dredging moving forward 
Last week, the Army Corps of Engineers announced that it will spend $4.6 million this fiscal year to dredge Hampton Harbor. This is great news! 
Hampton Harbor is our state’s largest commercial fishing port and is an important part of our Seacoast economy. It needs to be dredged as soon as possible, as severe shoaling has made it nearly impossible for vessels to enter or leave the harbor when the tides are low. This critical project will make the harbor safer and help our commercial fisherman. 
In June, I wrote and passed an amendment through the House to the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) to allow the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge Hampton Harbor. This provision was retained in the final bipartisan water infrastructure bill that the president signed into law last month, and made it a lot more likely that the Army Corps would take the action they did last week to move forward with this project.   
Announcing significant funding to reduce violence against women 
The Department of Justice’s Office of Violence Against Women has awarded the State of New Hampshire and several Granite State organizations nearly $2.5 million. These grants will help our state address the backlog of sexual assault kits, while better supporting the survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence. I am pleased that our state will be receiving significant federal funding to support law enforcement efforts to strengthen responses to sexual assault, domestic violence, and dating violence. I have always supported fully funding these important programs. Congress needs to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and increase funding for Justice Department efforts to reduce violence against women.    
Supporting resilient coastal communities 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has awarded $136,242 to the New Hampshire Nature Conservancy for the Tidal Crossing Replacements for a Resilient Coastal New Hampshire project. This project will help replace and improve tidal crossings. Well constructed tidal crossings, such as culverts or small bridges, allow people to move across our region while ensuring that tidal flows can ebb and flow appropriately. I am pleased that this grant funding will enhance our state’s ability to preserve and construct tidal crossings that are equipped to deal with the impacts of our changing climate. Congratulations to the Nature Conservancy and the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, which are doing excellent work in this field, on receiving this significant federal funding that will enhance New Hampshire’s coastal resiliency. 
Reacting to the latest CDC drug overdose report 
Yesterday, the CDC released a report showing that life expectancy in the US is falling largely due to increases in suicides and drug overdose deaths. There was some positive news in this report— the drug overdose death rate in New Hampshire did not increase, which is the first time there has not been an increase in several years.  
It is a promising sign that New Hampshire’s drug overdose death rate did not increase last year, but our state and our country have a long way to go to turn the tide in this deadly crisis. We are still losing far too many Granite Staters to drug overdoses. The federal government has to step up and help our state by providing the resources and support that the severity of this crisis demands. The health care workers, first responders, community leaders, and social workers on the front lines of the opioid epidemic are doing a tremendous job, but they need more help. 
I hope that the next Congress will significantly increase federal funding to combat the opioid crisis, and that the White House will finally give this issue the attention it deserves instead of trying to rip health care away from those who need it, especially those trying to access treatment. We cannot end this crisis by attacking health care the way this administration has done and continues to do. These attacks threaten to reverse the progress we have made, and will have a devastating impact on all those working to stop drug overdoses and to make our communities healthier and more prosperous.  
Announcing new funding for Families in Transition 
I was pleased to announce this week that Families in Transition, a fantastic organization that provides important health care services to people in need, will be receiving $312,000 to help homeless Granite Staters. Congratulations to Families in Transition on receiving this funding, which will help improve access to health care for many who are trying to exit homelessness. 
Closing thoughts 
It was an honor to speak at Veterans Day ceremonies at the State Veterans Home in Tilton and the New Hampshire State Veterans Cemetery. I am grateful to all who have served, and their families, for standing watch.

Nation’s biggest passport agency gets ripped in US report 
AP 
PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) — Staffers at the nation’s largest passport-processing agency accuse the office of bullying, retaliation and unfair hiring practices, saying supervisors, among other things, put a “hurt feelings report” on the desks of workers perceived as whining and displayed a Walmart job application as a message to unhappy employees, according to a federal report. 
U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, a New Hampshire Democrat, called for an immediate response. 
“This workplace environment, which has led to security lapses, retaliation, bullying and ineffective passport services, cannot continue,” Shea-Porter told WMUR-TV. “The OIG recommendations need to be followed and these issues corrected now. No excuses.”

Local Health Clinics Receive Multi-Million Federal Grant
￼ 
Last year I had the opportunity to visit with the staff at Katy Trail Community Health and learn what services they offer to Missouri’s Fourth District. 
Katy Trail Community Health (KTCH) clinics serve a vital role in Missouri’s Fourth District, especially in areas that lack health care professionals and affordable care. I’m happy to announce that KTCH, which has several clinics in Missouri (including in Sedalia, Versailles and Warsaw), received a $3.5 million federal grant this month to continue its delivery of comprehensive, affordable, quality primary care services to low income families. This includes providing doctor appointments, performing routine check-ups, providing treatment for chronic diseases like diabetes, and diagnosing and treating illnesses like strep throat or the common cold.
This grant will also help KTCH continue its recent efforts to integrate pain management services into its primary care, which is especially helpful for those struggling to manage chronic pain without the use of opioids. I got a front row view of this operation when I visited the KTCH Sedalia clinic last year. During my tour, I met with staff and learned firsthand about the chronic pain program, which provides evidence based interdisciplinary treatment, including behavioral health treatment, to patients suffering from chronic pain. 
The grant KTCH received will also help the clinics maintain their partnerships with local organizations to prevent people with mental illness from being incarcerated. Additionally, the funding will sustain their school based behavioral health services initiatives in three school districts, which I hope will ultimately lead to safer schools in Missouri’s Fourth District.

Mo Business for MO
￼ 
I had a great meeting with Missouri’s Procurement Technical Assistance Program, which has helped create or retain an estimated 87,000 jobs in the Show Me State. 
Recently I had the pleasure of meeting with the representatives of Missouri Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (MO PTAC), which assists businesses in obtaining government contracts at the federal, state, and local levels. There are numerous government contracts available, but many small businesses lack the expertise they need to win them. MO PTAC solves this problem by helping small businesses in Missouri identify opportunities and then navigate the red tape to actually win government contracts.
This program already has many success stories in Missouri’s Fourth Congressional District. One of them is Veterans Worldwide Sales and Services in Gravois Mills. With the help of MO PTAC, this business secured $2 million worth of federal contracts, including work for the Army at Fort Leonard Wood. 
Several businesses in Columbia have also benefited from MO PTAC’s assistance, including Midway Development Company, which recently completed one of the largest national cemetery synthetic turf installations in the country on the Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery in St. Louis. 
If you are wondering which goods or services you provide that the government needs, you can sign up here to receive a streamlined daily customized “bid email” from MO PTAC, outlining all the opportunities available each day that match your interests. Once you find an opportunity on which you would like to bid, MO PTACT staff stands by to assist you. Their counselors will help you unravel guidelines and understand the government’s expectations for accounting capabilities, a delivery/performing schedule, and integrity and ethics, to name a few. 
Government buyers are looking for what you have! To learn more, visit MO PTAC’s homepage or sign up here.  
Helping Those Who Have Suffered at the Hands of ISIS
￼ 
Minority groups in Iraq and Syria, especially Christians and Yazidis, have suffered unspeakable atrocities at the hands of ISIS. So much so, that in 2016, our State Department designated the crimes committed against them as “genocide.” Despite this designation, the existential threat to Christians and Yazidis and other minorities continues to this day. Even worse, these groups feel abandoned by America and other countries around the globe.
This week, we took steps to bring them urgently needed aid. The House passed legislation that the Senate also approved called H.R. 390, the Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability Act. This bill would support groups who are already on the ground in Iraq and Syria delivering aid to groups persecuted by ISIS and increase accountability for perpetrators of war crimes. Specifically, it would encourage and support countries and organizations collecting evidence on perpetrators of war crimes, so they can be prosecuted. Congress is doing everything we can to help these communities that have suffered unspeakable atrocities for their faith. I hope this aid package will begin to provide the security and justice these persecuted people so desperately deserve after years of suffering under ISIS.

Weekly Dose of Good News
As Christmas shopping begins, small business confidence remains at a near-record high. A National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) survey credits a strong labor market, high profit trends, and historically low inflation for that high confidence. This survey is taken monthly, looking at the practices of small businesses nationwide, and is considered to be a reliable indicator of hiring and wage trends across the country. Additionally, wages in October rose at the fastest rate we’ve seen in nearly a decade. We can all be glad about this great news for Americans who are looking for jobs and those seeking better jobs and higher pay!

Securing the Benefits Our Veterans Earned 

 ￼
  ￼
  ￼
  ￼
This month’s Veterans Day celebrations around Ohio are a reminder that nothing is more important than serving those who have sacrificed so much for our country.   With the Senate back in session, we need to get to work and show this country that we can work together – and there’s no better place to start than ensuring all the women and men who served this country get the care and benefits they’ve earned.   Right now, in order to receive VA healthcare and disability benefits for conditions resulting from Agent Orange exposure, Blue Water Navy veterans must meet a higher burden of proof than veterans who served on land or on inland waterways.  They’re forced to navigate additional bureaucracy that can delay or even deny them benefits they’ve earned, simply because of where they served.  That makes no sense.   If you were exposed to a toxic substance while serving our country, we should make sure that you receive the benefits you have earned, period. No exceptions.  I talked to Joe Benedict, a Blue Water Navy veteran from Cleveland and the president of Cleveland Honor Flight about this issue last week. Like too many, Joe has been denied benefits because the VA changed its policy.  That’s why last year I worked with my colleagues on the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2017, which would guarantee that all Vietnam veterans exposed to toxic Agent Orange chemicals have equal access to the care and benefits they earned.  I’ve also raised the issue with VA Secretary Wilkie at a meeting in September and at a Veterans’ Affairs Committee hearing, pressing him to expand benefits to all Vietnam veterans.  After a long campaign season, we need to show the American people we can work together, Republicans and Democrats, and we should start by putting partisanship aside and finally getting this fixed for the veterans we serve.  I’ve spoken to Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Senator Isakson about this, and I’m hopeful we can get a solution soon.

Dear Friends,
 
I started the Salton Sea Sentinel to keep constituents like you informed about new developments in our joint efforts to rehabilitate the Salton Sea. Here’s the latest news:
	•	On Wednesday, I brought together a bipartisan coalition of southern California Members of Congress to call on Governor-elect Gavin Newsom to prioritize management of the Salton Sea in his new administration. I also invited the Governor-elect to visit the Sea in the first six months of his administration. It’s key that our new Governor sees the Salton Sea’s public health and environmental consequences firsthand.
	•	Recently, four Salton Sea-area residents published a documentary called ‘Estamos Aqui’ (We Are Here) to draw attention to its negative impacts on the surrounding communities. These communities face the worst public health impacts from a receding Salton Sea, and their voices are now more important than ever before.
	•	I sent a letter in October urging the House and Senate Agriculture Committees to include funding for water conservation and drought prevention in the Farm Bill. These provisions could provide new federal funding to mitigate the Salton Sea’s decline – so stay tuned for new developments.
I envision a Salton Sea that hosts renewable energy jobs, preserves wildlife habitats, and protects local residents from dangerous respiratory illnesses. Together, we can realize this potential and create a better life for our children and our community.
Sincerely, ￼  Raul Ruiz, M.D. Member of Congress

Long’s Short Report – From MoDOT to mental health
By: U.S. Rep. Billy Long
In a cost cutting move a few years ago, the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) decided to close one of its district offices in Joplin, Missouri. The former MoDOT building has since been transformed into the Ozark Center, a state-of-the-art behavioral health facility that I toured in November. The Ozark Center, unlike some behavioral health facilities, focuses on treating the whole person rather than just the mental illness. It has become a great asset for the Joplin area.                                                      
Unfortunately, folks with mental illnesses live 25 years less on average than the general population. They can expect to live a quarter of a century less than their neighbors. But the reason for this startling statistic is just as surprising. This shortened life span, it turns out, is due to medical conditions that could be easily treated if given access to adequate resources. That’s why providing more resources for mental health is crucial. 
In 2014, Congress created a pilot program expanding access to mental health services and strengthening quality of care. Missouri was one of eight states picked to take part in the Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers (CCBHC) program. The CCBHC program aims to integrate behavioral health with physical health by providing services such as crisis care, wellness services, screenings and treatment.
The Ozark Center focuses on comprehensive behavioral health services. This facility is one of three clinics in southwest Missouri picked to participate in the CCBHC program. 
This program launched in July of 2017 and has been nothing short of a tremendous success. Like many health care clinics throughout the country, the Ozark Center has only a limited number of resources to work with. However, thanks to the pilot program, many of these resources are much more sustainable. Unlike previous years, the Ozark Center has been able to increase their scope of services, provide a safety net for their patients, reduce wait times and increase access to care.
During my tour of the Ozark Center, I was shown firsthand the resources made available to patients struggling with mental illnesses. One resource in particular was transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy, which is used for patients with severe depression. This non-invasive treatment is fairly new to the Ozark Center, but according to some patients they are already seeing improvements. Before starting TMS therapy one patient at the Ozark Center had tried a number of antidepressants, but none seemed to work. It wasn’t until he started TMS therapy that he saw improvements, such as sleeping better and eating more.
The Ozark Center is proof that investing in mental health works. It’s among many reasons I have supported legislation, such as the 21stCentury Cures Act and the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, that provide more resources for mental health and targeted care. I look forward to continuing to support the Ozark Center and its work to help those suffering.

Dear Friend,
All Americans deserve access to quality, affordable health care. During Open Enrollment, I want to make sure San Diegans have the resources and information they need to find the right heath insurance and get covered for 2019.
Get Covered
Now through January 15th

￼
 
Open enrollment is happening now through January 15th, so now is the time to compare plans and purchase health insurance for 2019. For coverage starting January 1st, be sure to sign up by December 15th. Visit www.coveredca.com for more information on how to enroll for 2019. 

I’m working to make health care more accessible and affordable for families, which means rejecting reckless proposals that would leave thousands of San Diegans without coverage and fighting for bipartisan health care solutions that keep premiums down and stabilize the markets. I look forward to continuing this fight next Congress.

Dear friends,
Last week, Georgia got some great news in that the administration is providing $52.12 million in additional funds for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project. This additional funding in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers fiscal year 2019 work plan, combined with the President Trump’s original budget request of $49 million, brings the total federal funding for this vital infrastructure project to roughly $101 million, keeping this critical economic development project on track
U.S. Senator David Perdue, U.S. Representative Buddy Carter and I have worked tirelessly to ensure that the federal government does its part to fund the deepening of the Port of Savannah to maintain the incredible growth it has experienced.
President Trump is delivering for Georgia in a big way, and I’m grateful for the administration’s dedication to this expansion. Our commitment is unwavering, and we will keep pressing until the job is complete.
Fixing Forever G.I. Bill Payment Issues 
This week, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced that it is seeking to fix payment issues that have arisen as the department implements provisions of the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act and works to improve the information technology (IT) system needed to accommodate the updated G.I. Bill changes.
While I am disappointed that the VA does not yet have an effective IT system in place, I understand VA Secretary Robert Wilkie’s decision to reset implementation of certain sections of the ‘Forever’ G.I. Bill while improvements continue to be made. Right now, the VA’s priority must be to ensure accurate payments are sent to student veterans in a timely manner. 
Student veterans rely on the G.I. Bill to support themselves and their families while they are in school, and the VA is responsible for keeping those payments going, even as it implements the new law. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, I will continue to keep a close watch to ensure the VA implements this law as Congress intended and does so without interrupting the benefit payments on which student veterans rely.
If you or a veteran you know has experienced a delayed, inaccurate or missing G.I. Bill payment, please call the VA’s education call center at 888-442-4551 for help. You can also call our office at 770-661-0999. 
In Other News
	•	This week, the Senate continued its work to confirm the president’s nominees who require Senate approval. Since we began our work in January 2017, we’ve confirmed a record 29 circuit court judges as well as 53 district court judges and two Supreme Court justices. We are continuing to make history by confirming judges who are dedicated to fairly interpreting the law and who will have an impact on our nation’s courts for years to come.
	•	On Wednesday, the Senate passed U.S. Representative Rick Allen’s legislation to name the Statesboro, Ga., VA community-based outpatient clinic the ‘Ray Hendrix VA Clinic.’ 
	•	On Wednesday, the Senate passed a resolution I introduced that designates Monday, Dec. 3, as “Phenylketonuria ‘PKU’ Awareness Day.” More information can be found on this genetic metabolic disorder disease from the National Institutes of Health here. 
	•	On Wednesday, I was so pleased that the Senate passed the PEPFAR Extension Act of 2018, H.R.6651, legislation to extend the lifesaving President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program through fiscal year 2023. PEPFAR has helped break the infection curve, and it’s an important success story we must do our best to continue.
	•	This week, I also sent letters to Senate leaders to request additional supplemental disaster assistance funding for losses due to Hurricane Michael. Our state’s agriculture industry alone suffered more than $2.5 billion in losses. If you are seeking individual assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) related to Hurricane Michael, the deadline to register for assistance is Thursday, Dec. 13. Registration is available online at www.disasterassistance.gov or by calling 800-621-3362.
	•	Last week, Senator Jon Tester, D-Mont., and I announced that the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs will be sponsoring the annual Toys for Tots drive in honor of the upcoming holidays. The Senate unanimously passed a resolution to permit the collection of charitable donations in Senate buildings during the holiday season. We’re excited to host the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve’s Toys for Tots charity drive to help bring holiday cheer to children in Georgia and across the country.
	•	The United States benefits when we are engaged on free trade agreements. Today the president signed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement. I look forward to reviewing the final details of this agreement and evaluating its merits. Georgia exports more than $12 billion of its goods and services to Mexico and Canada each year, and I am working to ensure that our trade relationships continue to benefit Georgia’s farmers, manufacturers and service providers.
What’s on Tap?
Next week, the Senate will continue its work on the Farm Bill and confirming nominees. On Thursday, the Senate and the House Veterans’ Affairs Committees will hold a hearing to review the VA’s progress on implementing the VA MISSION Act.
The Senate must also complete its work to fund the federal government for the remainder of fiscal year 2019. The current short-term funding bill will expire on Dec. 7.

Rep. Tom Reed would have refused Amazon tax breaks, subsidies-Olean Times Herald






Dear Neighbor,
The news coming out of Albany and the Governor’s office does not put New Yorkers’ interests first.
We are concerned over Governor Cuomo’s decision to give Amazon $1.7 billion in subsidies, in exchange for Amazon to locate their second headquarters in New York City.   This deal represents a slap in the face to the hardworking New Yorkers struggling to survive in Governor Cuomo’s oppressive business environment of high taxes and unreasonable regulations.
And even Governor Cuomo understands this, saying: “It’s not a level playing field to begin with. All things being equal, if we do nothing, they’re going to Texas.”
Governor Cuomo should focus on providing relief for existing businesses in New York so all can prosper – not just those who can navigate New York’s ridiculous bureaucracy.
We sent a letter to Governor Cuomo addressing our concerns and asking him to work with us to give the small business owners of New York a chance to prosper while creating new jobs, attract new businesses and keep existing businesses in our state.
But wait, there is more.
The state Legislature will consider a controversial bill next year that would allow illegal immigrants to apply for a driver’s license — and Cuomo says he will sign it if it passes.
We feel this is not fair for the men and women who immigrated here legally, for the hardworking taxpayers and the residents who worry about the safety of our neighborhoods.
This dangerous proposal will create a hardship for our law enforcement community to accurately identify criminal illegal aliens.
New York deserves to prosper but under Cuomo’s new New York, we will be left behind.
As always, please reach out to our office if you need assistance. Our door is always open.
Until next time,
￼
Tom

ABOUT NITA           CONSTITUENT SERVICES           NEWSROOM           LEGISLATIVE ISSUES           17th DISTRICT           CONTACT ME 
Dear Friend:
Here are some of the ways in which I'm fighting hard to keep Lower Hudson Valley communities safe, healthy, and secure: 
• Pressing the FDA on Flavored E-Cigarettes
• Fighting to Protect the Mueller Investigation
• Honoring the First African-American Woman Elected to Congress
• Helping a Constituent Secure Life Insurance Benefits from the VA
Pressing the FDA on Flavored E-Cigarettes 
￼ 
E-cigarette use among young people is becoming the next public health emergency.
	•	That's why I was encouraged when, earlier this month, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed to ban flavored cigars and menthol in cigarettes. I have called on the FDA to quickly implement these rules, which could significantly prevent more young people from getting hooked on nicotine and would save lives.  
	•	But sadly, as I wrote in a letter published recently in The New York Times, the FDA's effort will not fully stem the growing epidemic of teenage e-cigarette use.  
	•	In response to my letter, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said that he looks forward to working with me and other members of Congress ""on efforts that can help make sure no child starts using a tobacco product."" Rest assured that I will continue to fight to close the window of opportunity for younger generations to get hooked on nicotine. 
Fighting to Protect the Mueller Investigation  
Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty this week to lying to Congress about plans to build a tower for President Trump in Russia-a major development in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling and possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. 
	•	With Cohen's guilty plea, the links between President Trump and Russia are becoming even harder to deny.  
	•	Special Counsel Mueller must be allowed to complete his investigation free from outside interference.   
	•	I will continue to call on House Republicans to join Democrats in passing bipartisan legislation-the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act (H.R. 5476), of which I am a cosponsor-to protect Mueller and his investigation.  
Honoring the First African-American Woman Elected to Congress  
￼ 
This year marks the 50th anniversary of Shirley Chisholm's historic election to the United States Congress. She was the first African-American woman elected to Congress and represented New York's 12th Congressional District from 1969 until 1983.
	•	Congresswoman Chisholm was a force of nature and a tireless champion for women and minorities who worked every day to improve the lives of New Yorkers.   
	•	That is why I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 7107, the Shirley Chisholm Congressional Gold Medal Act. The Congressional Gold Medal has been awarded to recipients who are American trailblazers, just like Congresswoman Chisholm.   
	•	As a Member of Congress representing New York, I am especially proud to honor Congresswoman Chisholm in this way. 
Helping a Constituent Secure Life Insurance Benefits from the VA  
A constituent from Rockland contacted my office about his late veteran father's life insurance policy with the Department of Veterans Affairs. His father's automatic payout check, which was sent after his father turned 95, arrived just after he passed away. The constituent sent the check back to the VA for it to be reissued in his mother's name. When months had gone by and the check still had not been reissued, he contacted my office. After I contacted the VA, a check for $16,213.74 was sent to the constituent's mother.

Dear Lindsey, 
It has been exciting to start working with my new colleagues in the House. We welcomed several amazing, qualified members-elect, including many women. The diversity of the incoming members better reflects the population of our country, and their voices will help Congress better address the issues that matter most. 
I will continue working on the issues that matter most to you: climate change, affordable health care, quality public education, strengthening our workforce, and more. 
Averting a Climate Crisis
￼
In its latest attempt to diminish science, the Trump administration released the Fourth National Climate Assessment on the day after Thanksgiving when they thought no one was paying attention. But make no mistake - we noticed, and we will fight for real action to protect our environment.
The National Climate Assessment is too important—and too urgent—to ignore. Without intervention, we will see heat waves, more acidic oceans, raging wildfires, unprecedented hurricanes, rising sea levels, and a surge in extreme weather patterns – all in our lifetime. Every day until the new Congress starts and Democrats are in the Majority, I will be sharing on Twitter important findings from the report. Please like, share, and retweet #ClimateCrisisCountdown to raise awareness about climate change and how it affects us all. ￼ 

Investing in On-the-Job Training
￼
Efforts to get our economy back on track have benefited some, but far too many workers are still struggling to make ends meet. This month, I spoke on the House floor in honor of National Apprenticeship Week and Women in Apprenticeship Day to advocate for more investments in apprenticeships and work-based learning programs. 
In Oregon, we're leading the way. Women's participation in Registered Apprenticeship programs is more than double the national average. Industry partnerships, like those at the Oregon Manufacturing Innovation Center, support the creation of apprenticeship programs that benefit workers and the economy as a whole. I stand ready to fight for policies to help more people access better-paying jobs and meet the demands of our local employers. 
 ￼ 

Standing Up for the LGBTQ Community
￼
The Trump administration is proposing to redefine ‘gender’ in a way that would take away protections for 1.3 million transgender Americans and for those who are gender non-binary or intersex. I firmly oppose these harmful efforts. Equality for everyone and the right to privacy are fundamental American values that we hold dear as Oregonians. I stand with those in the transgender community and will continue to speak out when anyone disrespects you or tries to silence your voice. ￼

Being Elected to Influential Steering and Policy Committee 
On Thursday, I was elected by my Democratic colleagues to the powerful Democratic Steering and Policy Committee for the new Congress that convenes in January. I’ve served as a member of the committee in an appointed capacity since January 2017 when I was named to it by the once and future House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 
The Steering and Policy Committee nominates Democratic Members for committee assignments and has both elected and appointed positions. 
I am honored to receive this vote of confidence from my colleagues and the opportunity to serve again on the Steering and Policy Committee. As a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, I look forward to using my experience in Congress to help advise the House Democratic Caucus. Democrats must remain committed to ensuring civil rights and voting rights for all Americans, preserving the Affordable Care Act, protecting Medicare and Social Security,creating jobs to build a stronger economy, and exercising oversight over the current administration’s culture of corruption, among other issues. I am grateful my colleagues have placed their trust in me. 
Holding an Evening “Congress On Your Corner”
￼ 
My staff and I held a “Congress On Your Corner” event Monday night at the Benjamin Hooks Central Library where I had the opportunity to meet constituents as my staff and I helped them with their dealings with federal government agencies like the Social Security Administration, Medicare, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Small Business Administration (SBA) and other programs. We worked with one centenarian in need of in-home assistance and a veteran with some employment guidance. I look forward to having a “Congress On Your Corner” again soon. 
Celebrating Tiger Victory over Houston and Advance to AAC Final 
￼ 
Last Friday, I watched our fighting University of Memphis Tigers defeat the University of Houston Cougars 52 to 35. I was particularly impressed with our offense and was pleased that Sam Craft, a sixth year senior, ran for a 28-yard touchdown as we earned a place against UCF in Saturday’s AAC Final Game in Orlando. Go Tigers! 
Flagging Open Enrollment Now Available at HealthCare.gov   
￼  
Open enrollment for 2019 HealthCare.gov insurance plans is now under way. This year, open enrollment runs only through December 15. I will be making use of every possible means to make my constituents aware that the time available to sign up has been limited again this year compared to the enrollment periods during the Obama Administration -- six weeks shorter than it was in 2016. Listen for my public service radio announcement encouraging signing up. For more information on the importance of health insurance, check out my flyer and, to sign up, see Healthcare.gov.    
Electing Nancy Pelosi Speaker-Designate for 116th Congress 
￼ 
On Wednesday, I was proud to cast my vote in the Democratic Caucus for Nancy Pelosi of California to become Speaker of the House of Representatives when the new Congress convenes in January. Pelosi, who became the first woman Speaker when she was first elected in 2007, is a proven leader who will lead our unified caucus as it takes on the current culture of corruption in the White House. When the nation is in crisis, as I believe it is, the people need a strong leader at the table negotiating on our behalf. 
Reintroducing Constitutional Amendment on Presidential Pardon Power 
The President’s pardon power is supposed to be a safety valve preventing injustice. It is not supposed to be a vehicle for presidents to put themselves, their families or their administrative or campaign staffs above the law. Unless we change the Constitution to prevent those kinds of abuses, that’s how it could be used. That’s why I announced this week that I will be reintroducing a constitutional amendment I introduced in October 2017 to prohibit the current and all future presidents from pardoning themselves, their families, or members of the administrative or campaign staffs. Trump’s dangling the possibility of a pardon before those associated with his 2016 campaign who have already been convicted or pleaded guilty in the ongoing probe of Russian interference in our elections should concern us all.  
Expressing Unease at Twists in Manafort Case, Trump Tweets 
This week, a series of fast-moving events – including the collapse of a plea agreement with Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign chairman and convicted felon Paul Manafort – appeared to place the investigation of Russian interference in that election by Special Counsel Robert Mueller in further jeopardy. With Trump now identified as “Individual One” in a federal criminal filing and with Trump acolyte and acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker now overseeing the probe, I have been calling on Congress to protect Mueller’s investigation by passing the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act (H.R. 5476). This legislation, which I have cosponsored, is needed to prevent the President from inappropriately firing Mueller and sparking a constitutional crisis. 
Meeting with Memphis Area Transit Authority Officials 
￼ 
Left to right: Gary Rosenfeld, CEO, Memphis Area Transit Authority; Congressman Cohen; Nicole C. Lacey, Chief Communications Officer; Robert R. Clark, Chief Government Affairs Officer, Department of Government Affairs at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, a MATA Board member; and Tommy Pacello, President, Memphis Medical District Collaborative, a MATA Board Member. 
I had an engaging discussion Thursday with representatives of the Memphis Area Transit Authority (MATA) Board about the upcoming implementation of dedicated bus lanes for our Bus Rapid Transit project along Second and Third Streets, the first of their kind in the state of Tennessee. In addition, we discussed ways in which we can continue bringing new revenue streams that will lead to expanded transit access, reliability andfuture free Wi-Fion buses, as well as modernized onboard bus fare-box systems. 
Remembering Nashville Mayor and Congressman Richard Fulton 
￼ 
Richard Fulton was a great Tennessean, a great Nashville mayor and a great congressman. I was saddened to learn of his passing Wednesday night at 91. Fulton, a progressive leader who was one of just seven Southern Democrats to vote for the 1964 Civil Rights Act, set the political climate for Nashville to grow into a convention city open to doing business in the New South. A seven-term congressman, Fulton was the last of a group of powerful and effective Democratic leaders that included Tennessean editor John Seigenthaler, attorneys John J. Hooker Jr., George Barrett and Cecil Branstetter and Sheriff Fate Thomas. He will be missed. 
Learning More about German-American Relations 
￼ 
On Thursday night, I joined several colleagues for a dinner discussion at German Ambassador Emily Haber’s residence in Washington, arranged by the U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress.We talked about the implications of the retirement of longtime German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a source of stability in Europe, and the rise of  the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD). I noted that German parliamentarians from the Bundestag visited Chattanooga and Nashville this Fall. It was an enlightening evening.

Quote of the Week 

“You go through the gate. If the gate’s closed, you go over the fence. If the fence is too high, we’ll pole vault in. If that doesn’t work, we’ll parachute in. But we’re going to get health care reform passed for the American people.” – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California (Speaker 2007-2011) 
Good luck to all the runners in Saturday’s St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital Marathon. Half Marathon, 10K, 5K and kids’ run. I’ll be waving to you as you run through Overton Park. 
As always, I remain, 
Most sincerely.

The Opioid Crisis Remains the Most Devastating Public Health and Safety Challenge of Our Time
This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a new report that found that New Hampshire’s drug overdose death rate in 2017 remained about the same as the previous year, but the national rate grew by nearly 10 percent. The report also found a 45 percent increase from 2016 to 2017 in drug deaths involving synthetic opioids such as fentanyl.   
This report reaffirms what we have long known know to be true – the fentanyl, heroin, and opioid epidemic remains the most devastating public health and safety challenge of our time. 
While I am thankful that New Hampshire’s rate of drug overdose deaths did not increase significantly in 2017, the opioid crisis remains so severe that the CDC found that American life expectancy fell for the second straight year in part due to increasing drug overdose deaths. This stark data from the CDC underscores the urgent need for more federal resources to support those battling this crisis on the front lines, and I will keep working across party lines every day to help turn the tide of this deadly epidemic and save lives. 
With every good wish, 
￼ 
Senator Maggie Hassan 
What the Senator is Working On
Fighting for New Hampshire
Senators Hassan and Shaheen called on Senate leadership to act before the end of the year to protect small businesses from red tape resulting from the Supreme Court’s backward ruling that businesses will have to take on the burden of collecting internet sales tax for other states. The Senators’ letter requests Congress delay the implementation of the ruling so it has more time to enact protections for small businesses and also urges a ban on retroactive collection requirements. 
Senator Hassan also responded to the recently released federal climate change report. The report details the profound impact climate change is having, and will continue to have, on the region’s environment, economy, and public health. See Senator Hassan’s full statement below: 
“There is no question that climate change is having very real and very serious consequences for our economy, environment, and way of life – and we need action now,” said Hassan. “From our maple syrup and ski industries to our coastal infrastructure, this report details the negative impact that climate change is having in the Northeast region and makes it abundantly clear that the economic impacts will worsen dramatically if we fail to take urgent and meaningful action. New Hampshire and the Northeast have helped lead the way through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and I urge the President, his Administration, and Republicans in Congress to acknowledge the scientific facts and join us in addressing this massive challenge.” 
On Monday, Senator Hassan participated in a field hearing of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee in Lawrence where she questioned executives from Columbia Gas about the natural gas pipeline explosions that occurred in Lawrence, Andover, and North Andover, Massachusetts. Read more about the hearing here. 
￼
November Granite Stater of the Month 
Senator Hassan recognized Portsmouth Police Officer Thompson E. Potter III of Epping as the November 2018 Granite Stater of the Month for his work helping send students from traditionally underserved backgrounds to summer camp. His goal was to raise $5,000 to send five boys to the YMCA camp, but instead he raised $13,000, which was enough to send six boys to summer camp and outfit them with all the gear they needed.

11/30/18 16:00,Our progress to combat Alzheimer's disease,"￼
Dear friend,
My family, like nearly 150,000 families in Virginia, knows what it's like to have a loved one with Alzheimer's. And with those families in mind, I've been working in the Senate to combat Alzheimer's disease.   I've partnered with Senator Susan Collins to introduce the Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act, bipartisan legislation that would build out the systems necessary to create a public health infrastructure to combat Alzheimer's disease and promote brain health. As the number of people diagnosed and living with Alzheimer's disease continues to grow, we have to help alleviate the burden this disease has on our health care system and families across Virginia.  You can read more about the bill here >>   I'm happy that this week, the Senate health committee passed this bill, sending it to the full Senate. I'm going to keep working to pass it into law and address this pressing public health need.
Sincerely,   
￼

Congressman Costa Launches Annual Holiday Card Drive for Veterans and Military Servicemembers 
  
Fresno, CA – Congressman Jim Costa (CA-16) launched his annual holiday card drive for servicemembers and veterans today, continuing what has become a Valley holiday tradition. 
Each year, Rep. Costa invites residents of California’s San Joaquin Valley to drop off or mail holiday cards to his Fresno and Merced district offices to be delivered to servicemembers and veterans. Costa also partners with local schools in Fresno, Merced, and Madera counties, where students make cards to thank these Valley heroes and wish them a happy holiday season. 
“It is so important that we let our military servicemembers, veterans, and their families know how much we value them and everything they do,” said Congressman Costa. “Every year I hold the holiday card drive to encourage people across our Valley to join me in thanking our servicemembers and veterans, showing them just how much their service and sacrifice mean to us.”
Cards can be dropped off or mailed to Congressman Costa’s district offices through December 14th. All cards should be signed with first names only and a few lines of appreciation, and then placed in unsealed, unaddressed envelopes. Cards cannot contain glitter or images of guns, blood, war scenes, or death. 
If mailing cards to Rep. Costa’s office for collection, please place cards in a separate envelope and send to: 
Congressman Jim Costa 
“Holiday Cards for Veterans” 
855 M Street, Suite 940 
Fresno,  CA 93721 
For more information, please contact Rep. Costa’s office at 559-495-1620 or 209-384-1620.

News from Representative David Cicilline 
￼
SERVING YOU  |  MEDIA CENTER  |  LEGISLATIVE WORK  |  OUR DISTRICT
 
November 30, 2018
 
 
 Dear Friend,   On Thursday, I was honored to be elected to serve in the House Democratic Leadership next Congress as Chairman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee (DPCC). This committee is charged with developing the Democratic Caucus’ policy agenda and communications strategy in the U.S. House of Representatives.   For the past two years, I served as one of three co-chairs of this important committee alongside Congressman Hakeem Jeffries and Congresswoman Cheri Bustos. We worked together to develop an agenda to make the government work For the People of this country again.   In the new position as Chairman of DPCC, I will get to work in the new Congress fighting for middle class families by working to create good-paying jobs and rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, lower the skyrocketing costs of health care and prescription drugs, and remove corruption from our political system.  We are at a critical moment in history and the stakes are high for the people of this country. I look forward to working with each and every member of the Democratic caucus next year to ensure that we rise to this challenge and make a real difference in the lives of the American people.   PUBLIC TRUST ACT   Last week, along with my colleagues Congressman Ted Lieu, Congresswoman Linda Sanchez, Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, and Congressman Ruben Gallego, I introduced a bill aimed at strengthening ethical standards in the federal government, improving accountability, and preventing corruption.   Our bill, the Restoring the Public Trust Act, combines a number of pieces of legislation and would help restore the public’s faith in government.   Under the Trump Administration, we have seen unprecedented levels of corruption and a serious lack of ethical standards. Actions that would have once been unimaginable have now become commonplace among members of this administration, from misusing public funds to using government airplanes for personal trips, it is completely out of hand. The American people are sick of the corruption and we must put an end to it. House Democrats will prioritize ending corruption in our political system next Congress as part of our agenda to make government work For the People and restore their faith in our Democracy.  GENERAL MOTORS   From day one, Donald Trump claimed he was looking out for the working people of this country. But time and time again, he has shown that he is only working in the interests of the wealthy and well connected.   This week, we learned that General Motors (GM) is closing 3 major plants and laying off thousands of workers. This is unacceptable. GM was one of the many corporations that received a massive tax cut this year thanks to President Trump. He promised his tax cut would help working families when instead it has incentivized companies to ship jobs overseas and has only helped his friends on Wall Street.  What we saw at GM this week is going to keep happening in cities and towns across America. This administration is going to continue working for special interests and the wealthiest Americans.   The working families of our country deserve better - a permanent tax cut for the middle class, lower costs, and good-paying jobs. It’s time to prioritize workers over profits by investing in our workforce and putting an end to tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas.  SOUTHERN BORDER   Last weekend, President Trump’s Border Patrol agents fired tear gas at migrants on the border near Tijuana, Mexico. Many of these asylum seekers, which included children, are fleeing violence, persecution, and poverty in Central America.  This action was shameful and un-American. Individuals from all countries deserve the right to seek asylum. President Trump needs to put an end to his hateful rhetoric and actions.   I will continue to fight to protect the rights of asylees and look forward to working on comprehensive reform of our entire immigration system next Congress.   OPEN ENROLLMENT FOR HEALTH CARE   Health insurance is incredibly important and helps protect you from unexpected costs, like a trip to the hospital or an unforeseen accident. That’s why I want to make sure that all of my constituents are aware that November 1st marked the start of Health Source RI’s open enrollment period for 2019 coverage.    Until December 31, you can purchase a plan or renew your coverage through HealthSourceRI.com. Once you sign up, you will get coverage that starts on January 1, 2019.   Here are four facts you need to know about enrolling in coverage or renewing your coverage:  • The open enrollment period for HealthSource RI for 2019 began on November 1. December 23 is the deadline to pick and pay for a plan to ensure uninterrupted coverage in 2019. December 31 is the last day you can purchase health insurance for 2019.   • Coverage could be more affordable than you think. That’s because financial help is available for 8-in-10 HealthSource RI customers. In 2018, nearly half of HealthSource RI enrollees paid less than $100 a month for their health insurance.   • If you had coverage through HealthSource RI in 2018, make sure to head back to update your information and compare your options for 2019. Every year, plans and prices change. This year, it’s more important than ever to shop around! You may find a plan that fits you better, for cheaper.  • Free help is available. If you have questions about signing up or want to talk through your options with a trained professional, free help is just a click, call or click away. Explore your options and estimate your health insurance cost in under five minutes with HealthSource RI’s Plan Comparison & Savings Tool. Call HealthSource RI at 1-855-840-HSRI or visit the Walk-In Center at 401 Wampanoag Trail in East Providence. Want to save time? You can schedule an appointment with an enrollment specialist by clicking here. Or, check out one of the two dozen enrollment events across the state, or find a Navigator in your community by dialing 211. Take the time to learn about your options and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact my office.  As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns, please call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov.

11/30/18 15:13,Your credit card number,"￼ 

Dear Friend, 
Every single minute of every single day, hackers are trying to steal Americans' information.
From credit card numbers to social security numbers, our personal information is targeted by bad actors around the globe. 
Americans should be able to trust their government to keep their information safe. That's why I'm proud that my colleagues in Congress came together today to unanimously pass my bipartisan bill that will help keep the vast information stored by the federal government secure from hackers.
The Federal CIO Authorization Act of 2018 strengthens national cybersecurity by making clear that the role of the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) is to oversee the security of our digital infrastructure and keep Americans' personal data safe. You can learn more, here. 
Some might say that bipartisanship is dead, but today's vote showed that Congress can work in a bipartisan way to get things done and keep Americans safe. I'll continue to do all that I can to fight for the safety and security of South and West Texans. 
￼

Good afternoon. I would like to provide a few updates about recent developments in Congress and share some important information.  Aftermath of the Wildfires  We had good reason to be grateful this Thanksgiving. It finally rained, which put out the fire in Butte County and washed the smoke out of the air. The air quality above Silicon Valley is no longer hazardous, and this fire will no longer threaten California homes and lives. The multiple northern California fires last year and this year’s Camp Fire are examples of extreme weather events exacerbated by global warming and are becoming a recurring problem for our region.  Following the recent release of the federal government’s alarming climate change report, I support establishing a congressional select committee on a Green New Deal. The new majority in Congress, of which I will be proud to become a member in January, must respond to the climate crisis with smart and innovative environmental policies. Climate change is not a problem we can afford to put off for the future. We must address it now to save lives, homes and our planet.  Lowering Prescription Drug Prices for All Americans  Senator Sanders and I recently announced our bill that will take on Big Pharma’s price-gouging of sick and aging Americans. Big Pharma upcharges us because we don’t have any patient protections, but this bill changes that. If a drug company decides to sell their product for higher than the median price that they sell that same drug to our friends in Canada, Japan, and Europe, then the company loses their government-granted market monopoly, and generic drug producers can enter the market and bring the price down through competition.  One in four Americans reports difficulty paying for their prescription drugs and, overall, Americans pay 40 percent or more for pharmaceuticals than similar countries. That’s just not right. Medicine should not condemn a person to a lifetime of debt. Sick and elderly Americans should not be forced to choose between food and lifesaving prescriptions. It is past time for Congress to stand up to the powerful Pharma lobbyists, and Senator Sanders and I will be leading that fight.  Town hall  It was great to see so many of you and to answer your questions at my November town hall meeting in Sunnyvale.  I hope to see you at my next town hall starting at 2:00 PM on Sunday, December 16th in the Multipurpose Room at the Berryessa Community Center, 3050 Berryessa Road, in San Jose.  If you can’t make it, you can watch on Facebook Live. Please be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram @RepRoKhanna. 
Best,

Healing America’s Divisions with an Inclusive Economy  As our country moves forward, it’s crucial that we build an inclusive and geographically diverse 21st century economy. Prosperity should not be limited to a few powerful coastal regions and city centers. I joined The New York Times podcast “The Argument” with David Leonhardt to discuss how a polarized America can heal its divides and thrive under inclusive patriotism.  Secretary Clinton Discusses My Internet Bill of Rights  At the request of Leader Nancy Pelosi, I have spent the past seven months working with tech companies and experts including Tim Berners Lee, who is widely credited with inventing the internet, on crafting an Internet Bill of Rights. The recent data privacy scandals such as the Equifax breach and Cambridge Analytica have made clear that Americans need clearly defined online protections. During a speech at the University of Oxford last month, Secretary Clinton took a moment to discuss how the principles that I’ve developed are crucial to the future of our data privacy in the 21st century.   Democratic Priorities for the House Majority in 2019  Next year, my fellow Democrats and I will take the reins of the U.S. House of Representatives. We will work tirelessly to advance the issues that matter to everyday Americans, like raising the minimum wage, expanding health coverage, and protecting your privacy online. Read more from The Mercury News on what California Democrats have planned for the 116th Congress.  Reshaping American Foreign Policy  American military spending is near the highest it has ever been with U.S. troops deployed in combat operations in over a dozen countries across the globe. As a nation, we must consider the American lives we are risking and the allocation of our resources, such as our military aid to the Saudi coalition wreaking havoc on Yemeni civilians. Read more from Vox on Democratic priorities for American foreign policy in 2019.    Videos  House Republicans Denied Congress a Vote on the War in Yemen  Multi-Billion Dollar Corporations Must Pay At Least $15/hour

Women to Lead House Appropriations Committee Supporting the Critical Missions of NASA Academy Review Board Salute: Dr. James Billington, Librarian of Congress  
Women to Lead House Appropriations Committee
For the first time in American history, two women will likely lead the House Committee on Appropriations.
Earlier this week, Rep. Kay Granger (TX) was elected to become the next Ranking Member of this important committee. Kay has been an extremely valuable and hard-working Member of Congress for over 20 years. She understands the federal budget and Appropriations process – and the politics behind it – on a deep and comprehensive level gained by years of experience and dedication.
Further, the current Ranking Member Rep. Nita Lowey (NY) is expected to become the next Chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee. I have been privileged to work with Nita throughout my entire career on the all-important task of funding the nation’s government.
I am proud to be leaving the helm of the most important committee in Congress in their extremely capable hands, and wish Nita and Kay much success in the next Congress.
 
Supporting the Critical Missions of NASA 
This week, the nation was captivated by successful landing on Mars by NASA’s newest lander, the Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight).
InSight traveled six months and 300 million miles to reach the red planet and upon arrival, the spacecraft endured “seven minutes of terror” to successfully land and deploy on the planet. Now, InSight is studying Mars' interior structure to answers key questions about the formation of rocky planets in our inner solar system like Mercury, Venus, and Earth.
During my time in Congress, I have been a strong supporter of the men and women who execute NASA’s critical missions like the InSight lander. Through my role on the Appropriations Committee, I have ensured that NASA has the resources to continue vital space exploration and advanced scientific research programs.
The Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Omnibus, which I introduced and was approved in March, included $20.7 billion in funding for NASA, a $1 billion increase in spending over FY 2017 and a $1.6 billion increase over the President’s budget request. In fact, due to the leadership of the Appropriations Committee NASA’s budget has seen a 19 percent increase in funding over the last five years, which is close to $4 billion.
Specifically, included in the FY 2018 Omnibus was $4.8 billion for exploration, an increase of $466 million from FY 2017. This funding ensures our nation remains the world’s leader in space exploration by supporting the development of systems that will one day send astronauts to the moon and beyond.  The legislation also contained $6.2 billion for NASA Science program, $457 million above the FY 2017 enacted level. This targets funding to support planetary research and other sciences to ensure the continuation groundbreaking scientific missions like the InSight lander.
Further, a bold space exploration program that engages the nation will inspire our young people to be scientists and engineers and contribute to the economic success of the country.  That is why, in addition to supporting NASA through the appropriations process, I have always made it a priority to emphases the importance of NASA in New Jersey.  Annually, I bring a NASA Astronaut to schools in my Congressional District to engage with students who will someday lead research and development and innovation.
To learn more about InSight’s mission you can visit NASA’s website here and you can view images InSight has sent back to Earth here.
 
2018 Academy Nominations
One of the greatest privileges of being a member of Congress is having the opportunity to nominate students from New Jersey’s 11th Congressional District to our nation’s service academies.  Over the past twenty four years, I have had the honor of nominating over a thousand of our young men and women!
Early this week, I again, submitted the nominations of nearly 40 deserving students to the Naval Academy, West Point, the Merchant Marine Academy and the Air Force Academy.  I would like to congratulate to each of the young men and women from my Congressional District who earned nominations.
As these highly motivated and talented young people go through the academy nominating process, never let us forget the sacrifice they are preparing to make: to defend our country and protect our citizens. This holds especially true at a time when our nation is fighting the war against terrorism. Whether it is in the Middle East, Africa or other troubled spots around the world, no doubt we are constantly reminded that wars are fought by the young. And, while our military missions are both important and dangerous, it is reassuring to know that we continue to put America's best and brightest in command of others.
I would also like to give a heartfelt thanks to the members of my Academy Review Board who had the responsibility of reviewing applications and interviewing upwards of 50 outstanding young men and women for the past 24 years! The board is composed of local citizens who have shown exemplary service to New Jersey, to their communities, and to the continued excellence of education in our area; all are veterans.              
You can read my full statement in the Congressional Record honoring the 2019 Academy Nominees here.
 
Salute: Dr. James Billington, Librarian of Congress
I would like to wish a fond farewell to Dr. James Billington, the 13th Librarian of Congress who led the Library from 1987 to 2016, who passed away this past week. Dr. Billington was formally a professor at Princeton, a Russian scholar and incredibly intelligent.   
During his tenure, Dr. Billington doubled the size of the Library’s collections, from 85.5 million items to more than 160 million items. Simultaneously, he created a massive new Library of Congress online and launched a series of innovative programs to engage the nation and entire world.
I am personally thankful for Dr. Billington who would take time out of his busy schedule to meet with librarians from New Jersey’s 11th Congressional District when they visited Washington at my invitation.
You can read the current Librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden’s, full statement on Dr. Billington’s passing here.

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 11.30.18
Friday, November 30, 2018 –                                 
A Sad Subject
Legislation often begins with a concern or a question from a constituent. He or she draws on experiences or ideas to identify matters that need fixing: something the Federal Government does, something it could do better, or something it does not do that should be considered.
The following story, which inspired a bill I have introduced, is a sad one.
I attended the Washington County fair this year on several occasions, and at one point while there I was approached by a grieving grandmother named Fern Puckett. She pulled me aside and asked to speak with me privately for a moment. Ms. Puckett then related the details of a family tragedy, compounded by an unfair consequence of the laws currently on the books.
She spoke about her daughter, who went for a regular checkup when she was eight months pregnant. As the medical team started doing their tests, it was clear something was wrong, and the doctor soon informed her that her baby had died. The doctors induced labor, she went through active childbirth, and gave birth to her stillborn child. She spent hours cradling her baby. The family then made arrangements for the baby’s burial.
The loss of this baby was a tragedy. Unfortunately, this was one of about 24,000 stillbirths that occur annually in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Stillbirths constitute about 1% of all pregnancies, and when they occur, the reasons for them are frequently unclear.
The tragedy was made more difficult for the family by the different treatment of stillborn babies under the law compared to children who, even if dying tragically minutes after birth, were born alive. Parents of the latter are eligible for the Child Tax Credit for one year, but parents of the former are not.
As Ms. Puckett pointed out, this is unfair to the families of stillborn babies. The mother carries her baby for months, the family prepares for the baby’s arrival (room preparation, cribs, clothes, etc.), and even though the child has died, the families are subject to bills for their and their child’s care throughout the pregnancy. In addition, some families of stillborn babies pay for funerals, as Ms. Puckett’s family did. All told, the bills amount to a substantial financial expense. The emotional costs can’t be quantified but are high, and the financial costs are also difficult.
As she told her story, I teared up. The grandmother asked if I could do something about this situation. At the end, I told her that she was right and that I intended to see what could be done.
As a result of that conversation, I introduced a bill to extend the Child Tax Credit for the year of birth to the parents of an involuntarily stillborn baby. The legislation uses the Centers for Disease Control definition of stillbirth as the loss of a baby after 20 weeks of pregnancy. When a mother carries a baby for that length of time, she should be eligible for the same benefits as a mother whose child passed away shortly after birth. And when parents are eligible for the Child Tax Credit for a whole year if their child arrives at 11:59pm on December 31, the parents of a stillborn baby should benefit from the Child Tax Credit for a year as well.
The time to act in this Congress is growing short, so I intend to reintroduce this legislation at the beginning of the next Congress as well. It is important as a matter of fairness to address the different treatment for the parents of stillborn babies, so I am committed to pursuing this bill.
Hopefully, few parents will have to cite this reason to claim the child tax credit when my bill passes. The Centers for Disease Control notes that medical advances have sharply reduced late and term stillbirths over the past 30 years, but there are thousands of stillbirths that still occur without a clear medical explanation.
Fern Puckett said of the bill, “I recognize that this is not going to help us, but hopefully it will help someone in the future.” As long as stillbirths remain an unfortunate possible outcome of pregnancy, the parents should be treated fairly.

 A Month to Give Thanks



During the month of November, we often take time to reflect upon those things for which we are most appreciative—maybe those things easily taken for granted. Here are five of our favorite moments from November that capture what we’re thankful for:  1. Veterans—Sen. Cornyn, joined by Army veteran Spc. Nick Nelms, participates in Austin’s Veterans Day Parade to honor the men and women who have fought to protect our freedoms.  ￼   2. Law Enforcement—The Raul Jimenez Thanksgiving Day Dinner serves more than 25,000 seniors and San Antonians in need. Sen. Cornyn joins members of the San Antonio Police Department in preparing the 2018 meal.  ￼   3. Community Organizations—At the H-E-B Feast of Sharing, Sen. Cornyn participates in serving over 14,000 Thanksgiving meals to the Austin community.  ￼   4. Farmers—Agriculture is vital to the Texas economy. Sen. Cornyn meets with a group of young Texas farmers to discuss the status of the Farm Bill.  ￼   5. Judicial System—Sen. Cornyn participates in a ceremony to rename the Laredo Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in Laredo in honor of Judge George P. Kazen.  ￼

Hearing From You
Friend, 
In order to create a safe and effective immigration system, we must first fix our old, outdated system.  We need to secure the border and get back to an orderly legal immigration system in order to ensure a safe and prosperous future for America. My first priority in fixing our immigration system is stricter border security enforcement. I appreciate hearing from you and learning your views. 
Do you support stricter border security enforcement?

 ￼Yes, I support stricter border security enforcement.  
 ￼No, I do not support stricter border security enforcement 

Thanks for your participation. I hope you have a good week ahead.   
  
Mike

11/30/18 14:18,Blaine’s Bulletin: Full Steam Ahead,"￼ 
November 30, 2018

BLAINE'S BULLETIN

In 1927, the most lavish and expensive river steamboats of their time, the Delta King and Delta Queen entered service. After many years on the rivers in California, the Delta Queen was utilized to ferry troops in the waters around San Francisco during World War II. The Delta Queen even transported some of the wounded from the attack on Pearl Harbor to onshore hospitals in San Francisco. Following the war, the Delta Queen was a mainstay of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers for more than 60 years, enjoying immense popularity as it carried tourists throughout the Midwest.
As the oldest overnight passenger steamboat still fully intact and able to travel America’s inland waterways, the Delta Queen is a historical gem of Missouri’s rivers. Unfortunately, it was inadvertently caught in a technical provision of the Safety of Life at Seas Act (SOLAS) which was passed by Congress in 1966. Because the provision was originally intended for ocean-going ships, the Delta Queen was granted a Congressional exemption from SOLAS for more than 40 years due to her impeccable safety record and close proximity to land at all times. Unfortunately, in 2008 the exemption expired.
Since then, the Delta Queen’s new owners, management, and labor union have been united in an effort to save the ship. As a lifelong Missourian, I appreciate the importance of the Delta Queen’s historic contributions to Missouri and the economic impacts along the Mississippi, Ohio, and Missouri Rivers. Throughout my time in Congress I have worked with local officials, the great advocates in Missouri, and my colleagues in the House and Senate to get the ship back in the river. Fortunately, this week the hard work of so many paid off.
On Tuesday, the House passed the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018, bipartisan legislation to reauthorize, strengthen, and support the United States Coast Guard in its critical mission. Thanks to the advocacy of Senators and Representatives from Missouri, we secured the inclusion of language allowing the Delta Queen to finally return to the river.
I’m happy to see Congressional cooperation at work in passing this bipartisan, bicameral legislation. However, it’s important to note that while the exemption was ultimately accomplished in a bill, local leaders and Delta Queen supporters up and down the river played an enormous role in this long-awaited success. Along with the positive economic impacts of the Delta Queen’s return, I hope that future generations of Missourians will be able to enjoy the history of the Delta Queen as it traverses Missouri’s waterways for years to come!

STOP FUNDS FOR FETAL TISSUE RESEARCH
I recently joined a letter led by Representatives Vicky Hartzler (R-MO) and Chris Smith (R-NJ) asking the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue an agency-wide moratorium on funding research that uses aborted babies.  
In September, more than 85 Members of Congress, including myself, sent a letter to FDA requesting the agency cancel its contract with Advance Bioscience Resources (ABR) – a fetal tissue procurement company – and stop using fetal tissue for research, which contributes to the trafficking of baby body parts.  After receiving the letter, HHS announced cancellation of FDA’s contract with ABR and said it’s conducting a larger review of all fetal tissue research.  While I commend HHS for canceling its contract with ABR, it’s important that the department continue to address the use of funds for research utilizing aborted fetal tissue.  HHS spends millions of dollars every year on research that uses fetal tissue, much of which is obtained from abortion.  
The letter sent this month to HHS expresses concern that the bodies of aborted babies are being used at the taxpayer expense and without success in producing clinical treatments.  It also urges the agency to end all complicity in research that uses aborted fetal tissue, including its contract with the University of California at San Francisco that requires bone marrow, livers, and thymuses of unborn babies to create mice with humanized immune systems for testing.  Furthermore, the letter calls on HHS to create a timeline for reviewing all currently-funded research to ensure that it uses ethical research methods instead of fetal tissue.   
NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK
President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared the week of Thanksgiving the National Bible Week in 1941.  Every U.S. president since has honored this declaration recognizing the spiritual and historical significance of the Bible.  This year marked the 77th year commemorating the annual National Bible Week.  This is a great reminder of our Constitutional right to worship as we please and honor the Bible’s critical place in our nation’s history.  We are fortunate that our country allows us the freedom to read the Holy Book without fear of persecution.

In mid-November the Ohio House of Representatives voted to prohibit an abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detectable, which is as early as five to six weeks gestation.  The Human Heartbeat Protection Act, or better known as the Heartbeat Bill, would protect a significant number of unborn babies by making it a punishable crime for a doctor to perform an abortion if a fetal heartbeat is detected.  The bill allows exceptions in cases of medical emergencies or if the procedure will save the patient’s life or prevent irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.  This legislation, which was first passed in 2016 and ultimately vetoed by Governor Kasich, will next have to be voted on by the Ohio Senate.

News from Representative Rogers
￼
Dear Mrs.  , 
I wanted to share this exciting news with you today.  I cannot wait to get to work.  Please see the pree release below. 
Press Release: 
(WASHINGTON, DC) -- Congressman Mike Rogers made the following statement today after being chosen to serve as Ranking Member of the Committee on Homeland Security in the 116th Congress. 
“I am honored to be chosen by my colleagues to serve as Ranking Member of the Committee on Homeland Security. Having served on the Committee since its inception in 2005, I have the experience and expertise needed to lead conservative homeland security efforts in the House. Most importantly, I stand ready to fight for President Trump’s national security priorities including building the wall. I am proud to be the voice for Republicans’ principals on critical security issues facing our nation, and I’ll bring that to the Committee on the first day of the 116th Congress,” Rogers said. 
Congressman Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) who will serve as Minority Leader in the 116th Congress added, “I am looking forward to having Mike Rogers as the leading Republican on the House Committee on Homeland Security. Protecting America and the American people has been a top priority for every Republican in Congress and Mike has been a championing voice. I know Mike will keep that steadfast leadership as he approaches this new role.” 
Background:  Congressman Rogers will be Alabama’s only House member to serve as a Ranking Member in the 116th Congress.  He has served on the Committee on Homeland Security since 2005 and has served as a subcommittee chairman or ranking member on three separate occasions. Moving into the next Congress, Congressman Rogers will continue to focus on defending our borders, visa security and protecting our transportation systems across the nation.  Further, as the threat environment of tomorrow changes, Congressman Rogers will spend considerable time discussing cybersecurity, including the security of cloud computing, artificial intelligence and hardening our critical infrastructure.  Each of these issues presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities for the Committee and Congressman Rogers will be steadfast in examining them and their impacts on national security.                                                       -###-      Sincerely, ￼

Friends, 
  
I hope everyone had a Happy Thanksgiving! It's great to be back on Capitol Hill and happy to announce we are wrapping up the long-awaited 2018 Farm Bill.  
This week our office hosted four Teletown Halls. Each evening we did a live Q&A and addressed your questions surrounding immigration, health care, the VA, social security, and so much more. 
Over the course of the week, we had nearly 40,000 folks tune in.  
It was such a pleasure to speak with you all and discuss our efforts in Congress. If you did not get to participate in our Teletown Hall but have a question or concern about a particular policy area, please call our office at (202)225-2715.
On a trade front, today President Trump signed the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is an essential next step in securing a balanced and modernized trade deal. The USMCA will help Kansas producers and farmers across the country!  I look forward to Congress swiftly approving the agreement in the new year.  
Lastly, my eyes will be peeled on the G20 Summit this weekend, where we may see a breakthrough in trade, as President Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Serving our troops overseas:
￼ 
Over Thanksgiving, I had the privilege to serve dinner to our troops overseas. While I was in Kuwait, I had met with over 700 Kansas Guardsman from the 2-137 Combined Arms Battalion and Battery C, 161st Field Artillery, who were deployed in April as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, Spartan Shield (OEF-SS). The holidays are especially hard to be away from home, and I enjoyed hearing each soldier tell me about their families'

Farm Bill
Agreement Struck
I came to Washington with a mission to deliver a strong, 5-year Farm Bill that would restore certainty to our producers. Well, I'm proud to say that after years of debates and negotiations, the leaders of the Farm Bill Conference Committee came to a final agreement on the 2018 Farm Bill. 
I took our farmer’s feedback to Washington, and I’m glad to report that this bill fully protects and preserves crop insurance, the number one priority we heard from Kansans and has nearly everything Kansans asked for in Title One safety net programs. 
We have worked around the clock to produce a robust five-year bill, and I look forward to seeing the final version reach the President’s desk by Christmas

Driving the Cost of Health Care Down
￼
  
Yesterday I had the opportunity to meet with Secretary Alex Azar and Administrator Seema Verma. Together, with fellow GOP Doctors Caucus Members, we discussed one of the most pressing topics in health care: lowering drug costs. The Administration and Congress have made strides in bringing down the price of drugs, but there is still much work to do. After our conversation, I am hopeful that we will be able to work with Secretary Azar and the rest of his team to continue to find new ways to improve the cost of health care and prescription drugs.   
  
Prematurity Awareness Month 
￼ 
(Click the image above to watch the video) 
November is Prematurity Awareness Month, on Tuesday I had the opportunity to speak on the House Floor to discuss my experience as an obstetrician. I have seen firsthand the seriousness of early birth. Premature birth is still the number one cause of infant mortality in the United States and around the world. The premature birth rate in Kansas is right below the national average. Today the national average is 9.93, meaning that approximately one in every 10 babies are born prematurely. In the coming weeks, Congress has the opportunity to act and pass the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act of 2018 and help those that cannot help themselves.
￼
Lung Cancer
Awareness Month
November is Lung Cancer Awareness Month my wife Laina lost her father to this brutal disease 25 years ago. Lung Cancer remains the leading cause of death in the United States, mainly due to a lack of preventative treatment. Over 60 percent of patients are diagnosed after the cancer has spread, making remission highly unlikely. We must issue a call to action for improving preventative treatment, especially for high-risk patients such as adults ages 55 to 80 with a history of heavy smoking.

Hoosiers,

I hope you all had a happy Thanksgiving surrounded by friends and family. We have so much to be thankful for every day as Americans, much of which is because of the sacrifices that others make on our behalf. Because of their service, we can gather safely with friends and family this holiday season. I'm thankful for our service men and women and emergency personnel who put their lives on the line for us, our neighborhoods, and our county, every single day.

This month we also celebrated Veterans Day, to remember and thank every brave hero who has ever served this country and committed their lives to the freedom of others. Thank you for your service.

Be of good cheer,

￼

11/30/18 10:48,Why I want to end U.S. support for the war in Yemen,"￼
Dear friend,
Many of you know that I have fought for years to prohibit he U.S. from waging war without a vote of Congress. And the Senate is poised next week to take up a bill to cease U.S. support for a disastrous civil war in Yemen.
The U.S. has inserted itself in this civil war, without a vote of Congress, to support Saudi Arabia, whose military intervention has caused a massive humanitarian crisis killing thousands of civilians and pushing millions to the brink of starvation. Saudi journalist and Virginia resident Jamal Khashoggi wrote eloquently about the disastrous war and the Saudi government planned his murder in its consulate in Turkey.
The U.S. should not back up the Saudis in this war. And we have to make sure that there is accountability for Khashoggi's murder. We obtained a strong vote in the Senate on my bill to move it to debate next week. If the President won't stand up for the Constitution and human rights, Congress needs to. 
Sincerely,

11/30/18 10:11,New Bipartisan Legislation to Expand Broadband Access,"Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email


￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
We both know that reliable high-speed broadband is critical for growing small businesses, increasing access to health services, and helping our students learn. 
But many rural service providers who want to expand broadband access are facing disclosure and regulatory costs that could jeopardize their businesses, creating even more challenges to delivering this critical service. 
Providing the regulatory relief that rural service providers need to build-out high-speed broadband will save these companies from costly reporting requirements that were never intended for businesses of their size, helping to advance affordable broadband deployment in our rural communities. 
That is why I am taking bipartisan action in the Senate to encourage rural providers to invest in high-speed internet and support the expansion of reliable, affordable broadband access throughout Wisconsin. 
Working with Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), I introduced the Access to Capital Creates Economic Strength and Supports (ACCESS) Rural America Act, which will provide regulatory relief to rural telecommunications service providers by allowing them to submit streamlined financial reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This will save these small companies from costly SEC reporting requirements that were never intended for them. 
Supporters of the ACCESS Rural America Act agree our bipartisan legislation takes the right approach: 
“Small, rural broadband providers want to focus their energy, efforts and investment toward connecting more rural broadband customers. Unfortunately, the risk of expensive compliance associated with Sarbanes-Oxley regulations has forced some broadband providers to redirect their energy and resources to keeping shareholder counts below a certain threshold. These small, locally owned companies, many of which are more than 100 years old, are seeking reasonable relief from the threat of burdensome SOX regulations, which could cost their companies more than $1 million annually. We fully support the efforts of Senator Baldwin to provide the thoughtful, measured relief of the ACCESS Rural America Act,” said William C. Esbeck, Executive Director of the Wisconsin State Telecommunications Association. 
“We are extremely pleased to learn of Senator Baldwin’s effort to support a Sarbanes Oxley relief bill for Senate consideration. Resources expended on SEC registration compliance would directly reduce funds available for broadband expansion and slow or even halt expansion and endanger our business to continue. SEC compliance would be in addition to the rigorous reporting already in place. Resources are continually being spent to educate shareholders on the thresholds and to manage the effects of exceeding the thresholds. We look forward to seeing our Senate working in a bipartisan effort to help incent rural broadband providers deploy network to assist economic development and telemedicine in the rural portions of our great state of Wisconsin,” said John Klatt, President/CEO of Lakeland Communications in Milltown, Wisconsin. 
“Coon Valley Farmers Telephone Company is the sole provider of TV, phone, and internet services to 1,900 Wisconsinites. We trace our roots back to 1911, when members of our community used their own financial resources to form the company. In return for their investment, they were issued shares. Over generations, those shares have been split among children, to the point where the number of shares outstanding could require us to register with the SEC. These registration costs-which are estimates to be over one million dollars-would devastate our business. Without us, Wisconsinites in our rural community would lose access to high-speed broadband. Senator Baldwin’s bill is a common-sense measure to provide targeted regulatory relief for small businesses in Wisconsin, and it will ensure that we can continue to make investments necessary to provide our communities with broadband,” said Carol Ann Olson, General Manager of Coon Valley Farmers Telephone Company in Coon Valley, Wisconsin. 
I am proud to have introduced the bipartisan ACCESS Rural America Act, and look forward to continuing my work across party lines to bring reliable, affordable broadband access to all Wisconsinites. 
Sincerely, 
￼ 
U.S. Senator for Wisconsin

Stepping Up To The Challenge
A little under a year ago, I stepped up to a new challenge: serving Minnesota in the U.S. Senate. I'm so glad that I did, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to continue to do this important and meaningful work. Thank you to everyone who took part in our democracy by exercising the right to vote—Minnesota had the highest voter turnout this year in the midterms. 
I'm also honored to be in the latest issue of Elle Magazine—along with Michelle Obama and some other incredible women—none of whom should ever be underestimated. When you step up to a challenge, you can change your life and also help others find the freedom and opportunity to change theirs—for the better. 
As your Senator, I'm going to keep stepping up to challenges, especially finding common ground with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, so I can accomplish what you elected me to do. I'm in Washington to get things done for our communities, hard-working families, our farmers and businesses, and for all the women, men, and kids who call Minnesota home. It's an honor to work for you.

Pushing To Get The 2018 Farm Bill Over The Finish Line
When I talk with Minnesota's ag community about what really matters to them—expanding trade opportunities, investing in renewable energy, supporting beginning farmers—I remember why I fought to be on the Senate Agriculture Committee. Farming is a pillar of Minnesota's economy, and a way of life for many families.
This month I had the chance to talk with Minnesota farmers and ranchers at the Minnesota Farm Bureau 100th Annual Convention and the Minnesota Farmers Union 77th Annual Convention, as well as young and emerging farmers from Duluth, Litchfield, Minneapolis, and Watertown, who visited Washington with the National Young Farmers Coalition. The top issue that came up in every conversation was the urgent need to finalize the 2018 Farm Bill. Minnesotans are eager, and justifiably so, for a bipartisan bill that will help provide certainty for farmers, ranchers, and agribusinesses.
Beyond that, the Farm Bill also protects important food assistance programs that tens of thousands of rural and urban families rely upon, it bolsters Minnesota's important forestry industry, supports research, and it enhances conservation around the state. 
I'm pressing the House-Senate Farm Bill negotiators to come to an agreement as soon as possible. At the end of the day, Congress wants to get the same thing done that our farmers do too: passing a strong Farm Bill that will help our ag communities. We need to come together, and work across the aisle, and get the job done.

My Energy Storage Bill Considered in Committee 
Renewable energy, energy efficiency, and energy storage are things I'm focused on in the Senate because there's so much need and so much economic opportunity in growing clean energy. In fact, in a Senate Energy Committee meeting last month, I proudly called myself an ""energy nerd.""
But here's the thing: if we want to be able to count on the electric system in the future, we need to update it to reflect the 21st century. That's why I'm glad that we took up my ""Advancing Grid Storage"" bill to help modernize our energy systems in a Senate Energy Committee hearing this week.
My bill would help increase America's energy storage capabilities, which would help expand the role that renewable energies like wind and solar play in the nation's energy portfolio. It would boost energy storage research and spur the deployment of energy storage technologies, so we can keep moving forward. There's a lot happening in energy right now and we should be harnessing it.
More here. 
Fighting to Protect Our Climate   
I was very alarmed by the recent National Climate Assessment that painted a sobering picture of Minnesota's future unless we act now to address climate change. The report, which comes out every four years, serves as a foundation for our efforts to address this global threat to our way of life. 
Despite the fact that it was put together by 13 federal agencies and more than 300 climate scientists, President Trump repudiated the findings by saying he didn't believe them. Worse, he tried to hide the report from the public by releasing it during Thanksgiving week, when families were busy.
The report outlines what the future of Minnesota, and the Midwest, is going to look like if we don't act. It predicts that the largest increase in extreme temperature-related premature deaths will happen right here in the Midwest. What's more, it will severely hurt agriculture, raise health care costs, and slash our gross domestic product.
I trust the science contained in the report, and I hope you join me in speaking up for action to address climate change. There's no question that it's an urgent and serious threat, but there's also great economic opportunity if we rise to the challenge of responding to it. Minnesota is already a leader in clean, affordable renewables. We talk about working for a better future, and if we want our environment, our families, and the economy to flourish, then we need to act.

Thune, Rounds Urge President to Reopen U.S. Soybean Exports to China
 
Sens. Thune and Rounds today, ahead of President Trump’s trip to Buenos Aires, Argentina, for the G20 Summit, urged the president to prioritize the restoring of U.S. soybean market access in China when he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss trade and other issues.
 
“We appreciate your efforts to address China’s unfair trade practices, but our soybean producers cannot continue to bear the brunt of China’s retaliatory tariffs, especially considering the current weak agricultural economy,” the senators wrote. “As you continue working to reach a trade agreement with China, we respectfully request that you make restoring U.S. soybean market access in China a top priority.”

Dear ,

It is the people who live, work, and send their kids to school in the community with a nuclear power plant who truly understand the effects of its closure. As PG&E moves forward with their decision to decommission the Diablo Canyon Power Plant, they have requested the community's input related to economic, environmental, safety, labor, or any other concerns you may have related to the closure.

￼

PG&E established the Diablo Canyon Decommissioning Engagement Panel to provide a platform for all stakeholders to exchange information, perspectives, and ideas throughout the decommissioning process. I highly encourage you to view PG&E's proposed decommissioning strategy and submit your comment by the Monday, December 3rd deadline.

LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS
Last year, I invited the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and PG&E officials to San Luis Obispo for a public meeting to discuss the process of decommissioning with our community. You can watch our full discussion HERE.

￼

The NRC, a federal agency, is tasked with ensuring save removal of a nuclear facility from service and reducing residual radioactivity. Learn more about the agency's role in overseeing the Diablo Canyon Power Plant closure HERE. 

COMING TOGETHER TO BUILD BUSINESSES
As our community faces the economic challenges of Diablo Canyon’s closure, we have a new opportunity to turn the Central Coast into a renewable energy hub. This is going to have a large effect on our local economy. We must step outside of our political and regional silos and coordinate to create good jobs with family-sustaining wages and, ultimately, greater prosperity for all residents.  Read more about the recent community meeting in the San Luis Obispo Tribune. 
I’m thrilled to be working with the Hourglass Project on a coordinated economic strategy that will attract investments and jobs to our community, including renewable energy development.

SECURING RESOURCES FOR OUR COMMUNITY
With the impending Diablo Canyon Power Plant closure, I am working to secure all available federal resources to help offset the economic impact of this decommissioning.

Recently, Congress directed the Department of Energy (DOE) to study public and private funding sources available to assist communities with decommissioning nuclear powerplants, including the Diablo Canyon Power Plant. As potential funds are identified, I will work closely with our community to ensure we mitigate the economic impact to the Central Coast and help us thrive. 

You can always share your thoughts with me through e-mail, Facebook, or Twitter. As always, I welcome hearing from you on this and any other issues impacting you, and hope that you will stay in touch.

Best,
￼

Congressman Salud Carbajal

Weekly Newsletter  
Dear Friend, 
I wanted to take this opportunity to share more details about Tax Reform 2.0, important legislation that the House passed in September to lock in tax cuts for families and small businesses. It's in the Senate now, and I urge my Senate colleagues to pass this legislation. 
Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), our tax system is now more competitive and Coloradans can now keep more of their hard-earned paychecks. We've seen incredible economic growth in the last year, and we need to keep it that way.  
Tax Reform 2.0 would make permanent several of the important cuts from the TCJA. It locks in lower income tax rates, the doubled Child Tax Credit, the doubled Estate Tax Exemption, and the Paid Family Leave Tax Credit.  
For small business, the bill would lock in the 20% deduction on pass-through business income, ensuring small business owners of pass-through businesses like partnerships are paying equitable rates on their business-related income.  
But Tax Reform 2.0 went farther than just making permanent parts of the TCJA. We also passed important new laws that would make it easier for American families to save for important events and retirement. Our legislation enables small business to join together to more affordably create 401(k) plans for their employees. It also exempts small retirement accounts from mandatory payouts and eliminates the age limit on IRA contributions. Also, with new Universal Savings Accounts, expanded 529 education accounts, and parental access to retirement accounts when having or adopting a baby, we empower American families to save wisely and access their savings for integral steps in life.  
Last but not least, Tax Reform 2.0 would make changes to promote start-ups and entrepreneurs. We allow new businesses to write off more of their start-up costs while also enabling them to bring on additional investors without hitting the limits that would cut off key tax benefits that enable them to grow.  
￼
Our communities thrive when individuals, families, and small businesses can keep more of what they earn. 
We did a lot in this package. Like the TCJA, this second tax package focuses largely on individuals, families, small businesses, and entrepreneurs. By lowering rates, we empower Coloradans to save and spend more of their hard-earned income. We trust Coloradans to most efficiently spend those dollars, rather than the government. And in doing so, we get economic growth, new jobs, and happier families.  
The economy is complicated, and we can never attribute broad trends to just one policy area. But policies have consequences. I'm confident that our landmark tax reform package has something to do with the incredible economic success we're witnessing. And if we can pass Tax Reform 2.0, I'm confident we'll do even more to inspire confidence and grow our economy. 
I will continue fighting for free-market policies that limit government intervention in the economy.  A strong economy means better wages, more competitive prices, and more job creation. I promise to keep up the fight. 
Keep an eye on my website for more upcoming events. And as always, for more frequent updates on legislation and events, please follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. I look forward to hearing from you; please do not hesitate to contact my Greeley, Castle Rock, or Washington office should you need any assistance. If you'd like to send me a message, you can do so on my website. 
Sincerely,

Open Season Forum This Saturday

Dear Neighbor, 

I hope you will join me this Saturday, December 1, 2018, for our 10th annual Federal Employee and Retiree Open Season Workshop. This is a great opportunity for federal employees and retirees to review changes to Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) plans, and dental and vision insurance programs. We will have a panel of experts on hand to answer your questions, including representatives from the various health care plans.

Two major changes for 2019 directly affect active duty and retired service members. The Tricare Retiree Dental Program will be discontinued effective December 31, 2018, but those who were eligible under that plan will be able to enroll in one of the FEDVIP dental plans available to all federal employees and retirees. In addition, for the first time ever, the families of active-duty service members may be eligible to enroll in vision coverage through FEDVIP if those family members are currently enrolled in a TRICARE health plan. Those wishing to participate in either of these plans must enroll during open season. 

Our workshop will take place this Saturday at the Fairfax County Government Center, 12000 Government Center Pkwy, Fairfax, VA 22035, from 10 am to 1 pm. 

Open Season runs from November 12, 2018 through December 10, 2018. Federal employees seeking further information about FEHB plans can visit OPM’s website at https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/. Current TRICARE participants can obtain additional information on dental and vision plan options by visiting: TRICARE.benefeds.com.

There is still time left to get health coverage for 2019. Most Americans can find cheaper plans that work for them and their families by logging onto healthcare.gov.  
￼ 
Tear Gassing Aslyum Seekers
The decision to gas asylum seekers—including many women and children—was cruel, unnecessary, and inconsistent with who we are and who we aspire to be as a nation. President Trump should reestablish an orderly asylum process, and coordinate with Mexico and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to ensure families can petition for asylum in a fair and safe fashion while simultaneously receiving necessary resources while they wait. We must also work to stabilize the Northern Triangle countries to address the root causes of migration. My full statement on the border situation here. 
You can also watch my interview with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes on the issue here. 
I also spoke with Spectrum News on the issue here. 
Tornillo Update 
I am deeply disturbed by reports that nearly 2,000 workers on staff at Tornillo have not received federally mandated FBI fingerprint background checks. I have serious concerns about the health and wellbeing of these children, and call on HHS Secretary Alex Azar to give Congress an answer as to why these checks have not been completed and commit to completing them immediately. My full statement here.

Staff joined CPPP, Methodist Healthcare Ministries, and community advocates to discuss the statewide release of CPPP’s 2018 State of Texas Children report; attended the Big Brothers Big Sisters #WhoMentoredYou Speaker Series; and attended the 2nd Biennial Bexar Delegation Legislative Reception where Bexar County Health Coalition discussed their legislative priorities for this upcoming legislative session.
 ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ 
Team Castro also attended the final day of the US Commission on Civil Rights Conference - 50 Years Later; joined the SA Hispanic Chamber’s Texas Big 4 - A Mayoral Conversation to hear from the Mayors of Texas four largest cities on shared issues; and participated in the Luncheon General Session as part of Revisiting the 1968 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights Hearing in San Antonio Conference.

Protecting Robert Mueller
Today’s guilty plea from Michael Cohen for lying to Congress about Moscow Trump Tower shows that his plea arrangement struck in August has indeed turned into cooperation. Now more than ever, we need to protect Mueller from any potential firing. I urge House and Senate Republican leaders to bring legislation to protect Mueller to the floor immediately. We shouldn’t have to wait until January for Congress to protect U.S. national security, our democracy, and the rule of law. My full statement here.  
Foreign Affairs 
If the United States-China relationship is to be stable and productive for both countries over the next decade, we need to find a framework for cooperation and competition. We must find space for our two nations to compete fairly, frankly, and in a way that promotes well-being from Washington to Beijing. I drafted an op-ed for the Nikkei Asian Review making this case. 
￼
I was pleased to see the Protecting Diplomats from Surveillance Through Consumer Devices Act pass through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this week.

Standing with Ukraine
Dear Friend, 
On Sunday, I was horrified and angered to hear that Vladimir Putin once again escalated Russia’s illegal war with Ukraine. The Russian military open fired on and seized three Ukrainian naval ships, wounding six Ukrainian soldiers. 
During this critical time, I stand firmly with our ally, Ukraine, even as our President fails to do so. The United States must vigorously support Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity against these blatant moves of Russian aggression. Russian authorities must return the Ukrainian ships and sailors or face more sanctions from the U.S. and European Union. 
I have long supported our friends in Ukraine against Russian aggression. Most recently, my bill encouraging cybersecurity cooperation with Ukraine was signed into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. I’ve also pushed Congress to offer more humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and prevent President Trump from coordinating efforts with Russia that threaten Ukraine.
This time is no different. I stand staunchly by Ukraine’s side, and I will fight for the United States to do its part in helping Ukraine maintain its sovereignty against these attacks. 
Please let me know what you think about this issue:  

Should the United States stand with Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression?

Yes

No

11/29/18 13:48,Reforming Our Criminal Justice System,"The Durbin Report: A message from Senator Richard J. Durbin
￼ 


Fellow Illinoisan, 
Today, the United States of America holds more prisoners, by far, than any other country in the world.  Our overcrowded federal prisons consume one quarter of the Justice Department’s discretionary budget.  This undermines other important priorities, like preventing crime and treating drug addiction.
The largest increase in the federal prison population is nonviolent drug offenders, and this is largely because of inflexible mandatory minimum sentences.  These mandatory penalties don’t allow judges to distinguish between drug kingpins - who should be our focus - and lower-level offenders.  They also have a disproportionately negative impact on racial minorities. This isn’t fair, it isn’t smart, and it isn’t an effective way to protect public safety. 
In 2010, I authored the bipartisan Fair Sentencing Act to fix the unfair disparity in our crack and powder cocaine sentencing laws.  For the last several years I have been working with a bipartisan coalition of Republican and Democratic Senators to take the next step in reforming our federal drug sentencing laws. Our effort took a big step forward when President Donald Trump announced his support for our bipartisan criminal justice reform bill this month.  
￼ 
DURBIN DISCUSSES THE BIPARTISAN FIRST STEP ACT 
The revised First Step Act that I introduced with Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa includes reforms that would reduce federal mandatory minimum penalties in a targeted way. It does not repeal any mandatory minimum sentences, and we do not lower any maximum sentences. We would simply allow federal judges to determine, on a case-by-case basis, when the harshest penalties should apply.
Our bill is supported by the Fraternal Order of Police, the National District Attorneys Association, and the ACLU.  Congress should pass this bipartisan legislation to relieve our overcrowded prisons, redirect funding to our most pressing law enforcement efforts, help keep our communities safe, and ensure the integrity of our justice system.  This is the best chance in a generation to make meaningful changes in our federal drug sentencing laws.  We cannot waste it. 
Sincerely, 
U.S. Senator Dick Durbin

Holding the Administration Accountable in the Next Congress

￼ 
With a new Democratic Majority in the House next year, I believe the American people have made clear that they want to see a government that is being held accountable to our laws and our democratic principles. In my view, Americans are tired of watching the current Majority fail to address real emergencies such as the family separation crisis, gun violence, voter suppression, coverage for persons with pre-existing conditions, and the potential conflicts of interest and corruption at the highest levels of our government. In the next year, I will work to re-assert our nation’s core belief that we are a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.
 
Confronting the Rise of Hate Crimes & Domestic Terrorism 

In October, our nation witnessed three acts of terror including the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in American history, the largest attempted mass assassination of prominent political figures we have ever seen, and the gunning down of two African Americans at a Kentucky grocery store, each carried out by individuals who espoused white supremacist views. Whether it manifests itself as racism, anti-Semitism, or xenophobia, white supremacist-motivated violence must be stopped.
In the wake of these tragic events, I called for the House Judiciary Committee to hold an immediate, emergency hearing to address this wave of domestic terrorism. The Judiciary Committee is charged with confronting the causes of racial and religious violence, assessing the adequacy of federal hate crimes statutes and law enforcement’s ability to address such crimes, and protecting the civil liberties of all Americans. It is our responsibility to respond to this extraordinary threat without delay. To date, our calls remain unanswered by the Majority, but Congress must confront these issues head on, and next year Democrats will make this a priority.
To read my full letter demanding the Judiciary Committee hold hearings on the rise of hate crimes in our country, please click here. 
 Protecting the Mueller Investigation from Interference   
￼
 
VIDEO: Click here to watch Rep. Nadler discuss the appointment of Matthew Whitaker and Special Counsel Mueller's investigation. 
 The firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions fits what I believe is a pattern of interference by the President in the ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. This is a perilous moment for our country, and if the President abuses his office to interfere in the Mueller investigation, then there will be consequences. The President has appointed Matthew Whitaker as acting Attorney General, placing him in charge of supervising the Special Counsel Investigation and leading the Justice Department. Under these conditions, I believe this appointment is wholly inappropriate.  Mr. Whitaker has a history of opposition to the Special Counsel’s investigation, including writing an op-ed for CNN where he called the investigation a witch hunt. In addition, he was the subject of an investigation led by the Federal Trade Commission regarding his role with a company that allegedly bilked millions of dollars from consumers. I believe he is not just unqualified, but should be disqualified from serving as attorney general because he has not been confirmed by the Senate, and according to the Justice Department’s own succession guidelines, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would be the proper person to serve as acting attorney general. Instead, I believe the President appointed a hatchet man who would be willing to limit or weaken Special Counsel Mueller’s ability to conduct a fair and thorough investigation.  Following Mr. Whitaker’s appointment, I sent multiple letters to key officials demanding that they preserve all relevant documents related to the Special Counsel’s investigation to ensure all evidence remains safe, and I have called upon the DOJ’s Chief Ethics Official, Assistant Attorney General Lee J. Lofthus, to make a recommendation that Mr. Whitaker recuse himself from this vital investigation. The American people understand that no person is above the law and have demanded accountability from their government. Proper oversight of the Department of Justice must begin immediately, and if the Majority refuses to do so, a Democratic Congress will make this a priority in January.

Dear Lindsey,
For too long, “bipartisanship” has been a dirty word in the halls of Congress. Politicians have moved to the extreme fringes of their respective parties while leaving the vast majority of the American people in the center growing increasingly frustrated by Washington’s inability to address the real concerns our nation faces. There is no political will for lawmakers to put partisanship aside and do what is right for our constituents.
Going forward, the fact that the House, Senate, and the Executive Branch are divided between the two political parties means we must work together to solve health care, immigration, and infrastructure issues through bipartisan, commonsense legislating.
When I came to Washington, I joined the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group of more than 40 members of Congress who are willing to work together. As a group, we have introduced proposals to stabilize the health insurance marketplace to prevent skyrocketing premiums for families and reforms to our immigration system to encourage lawful immigration into our country. We also recently introduced a package of reforms that will give the American people a greater voice in Congress.
This is how Washington should work.
We cannot go to our separate corners and allow partisan gridlock to keep us from addressing the pressing issues of our communities.
Bipartisan legislating and commonsense problem-solving is making a comeback, and the American people will benefit from their lawmakers working together.
Read my full column on this issue here.
Sincerely,
￼
Tom O'Halleran

Dear Friend, 
Earlier this week, a caravan of Central American immigrants tried to storm the United States border after making their way across Mexico. The point all along was to demand asylum from the United States or simply try to cross the border illegally. They know our laws well enough to exploit the loopholes to gain entry. 
President Trump responded to caravan members rushing one of the busiest border crossings by threatening to close the border permanently. In fact, one of our border crossings was closed for a while after our Border Patrol Agents were reportedly hit by rocks thrown by caravan members. Sometimes drastic times call for drastic measures. 
As long as we don’t have a wall on the border and our immigration laws aren’t fixed, immigrants will continue to try to find ways to get across the border illegally and stay here. We are encouraging folks to break the law. It’s not sustainable. 
Certainly, these Central American countries have problems and I understand that our country offers a better life. However, that isn’t what this is about. If we are to maintain the sovereignty of our nation, we cannot just allow countless folks from other countries to enter our country without going through the legal process that we have in place. 
Because of the catch and release loopholes we currently have in place, more than 94,000 Central Americans were apprehended and released into the country last year. Many of them remain in the country today! This is de facto amnesty and it only makes our illegal immigration problem that much worse. 
Allowing these catch and release loopholes to remain in place is just another step towards open borders. It should come as no surprise that Nancy Pelosi and her friends are just itching to make these ridiculous loopholes even more generous when she gets power in January. This simply cannot happen and I will join my colleagues in blocking any attempt to loosen our immigration laws. Our immigration laws must strengthen the legal immigration process, not aid lawbreakers. 
In the meantime, I’ve got a simple solution. You may have heard of it. It’s known as “the WALL.” 
We need to build it right now. No more games, no more dragging our feet - let’s get it built. And while we’re building it, we need to fix the loopholes that force us to spend resources on catching illegals just so we can turn them loose, instead of sending them back to their country. 
In North Missouri, illegal still means illegal and I will continue fighting to make sure our broken immigration laws are fixed. 

Sincerely,
￼ 
Sam Graves

News from Representative Rogers
￼
Dear Mrs.  , 
Every year during the Christmas season, I like to highlight just a few of the things folks across East Alabama are doing for each other. 
Below is a small sample of ways our fellow Alabamians have cared for each other over the past year. 
In Talladega County, The Care House in Sylacauga helps provide food and clothing all year round for any individuals who need it in the area. 
In Clay County, the Modern Culture Club/Inter-Se Club hosted their annual soup luncheon mid-November to raise money for the local DHR so they could purchase Christmas gifts for local children. 
This year in Calhoun County, Brad Young with Insurance Planning of Anniston staged his disaster relief vehicle at K.L. Brown Funeral Home in Jacksonville.  He provided meals and a place for folks to charge their cell phones after the tornado and storms devastated the area in April. 
Also in Calhoun County, Piedmont High School students held their annual Seniors Helping Seniors program in March.  This program provides services of high school seniors in assisting local senior citizens with errands or chores relating to Spring cleaning. 
In Randolph County, Handley High School band director Matthew Goodman jogged over 400 miles from Roanoke to New Orleans to raise money.  The money raised will help cover the costs so all of his band students would have the opportunity to perform in the 2019 Allstate Sugar Bowl Marching Band Program. 
In Macon County, the Tri City Church/Macon County Food Bank- will supply food boxes, turkeys, clothing and toys for families in need throughout Macon County. 
In Cleburne County, the community came together and raised money to help the Willingham family pay for their child’s cancer treatments.  
In Cherokee County, a program called Jobs for Alabama’s Graduates (JAG) supports at-risk students and helps them graduate from high school. 
In Smiths Station in Lee County, “Love Touch Assisted Living” Veterans Home served a Thanksgiving meal to local Veterans and will be providing each of them with new gloves, hats and coats for Christmas. 
It always warms my heart to learn about these acts of kindness.  Let’s keep that spirit up throughout the year instead of just during the holidays.

Mike Rogers Alabama's Third District

Rep. Cuellar Helps Secure $85 Million to Prevent Child Abuse
Including $1.5 million to develop and expand national child abuse hotline 
WASHINGTON – Congressman Henry Cuellar (TX-28) helped secure $85 million in funding for child abuse prevention in a FY19 Appropriations bill containing the Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations bills. Specifically, these funds will provide states with the means for improving their child protective service systems (CPS) in order to stop child abuse and expand access to crisis resources. In addition, he secured $1.5 million to develop and expand a national child abuse hotline which will provide youth seeking assistance with much needed improved access to crisis resources.
This legislation passed both chambers and was signed into law by the President at the end of September.
The bill includes funding for the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), which provide small grants to states for maltreatment prevention and child protection services. The Child Abuse Prevention program, a statewide child abuse and neglect program, includes several requirements, such as:
•         Policies and procedures that address the needs of drug-exposed infants; 
•         Procedures for referral, in order of risk level, of children not at imminent risk of harm to community or preventative services;
•         Training for CPS workers on their legal duties and parents’ rights; and
•         Provisions to refer children under age three who are involved in a case to early intervention services.
This funding will assist states with meeting the expectation of the grants and also allow them to place a greater emphasis on the prevention-related activities to help strengthen and support families that are brought to the attention of CPS agencies across the country. The Children’s Bureau, a federal agency tasked with improving the lives of children and families, is also working with the country’s National Child Welfare Resource Centers to provide training and technical assistance to the states on best practices for CPS.
Additionally, the Congressman helped secure $1.5 million, a $500,000 increase from FY18, for an extramural grant to develop and expand a child abuse hotline to determine best practices in appropriate communication, identity verification, privacy protection, and resource sharing with victims seeking assistance.
“In FY2016, state and local child protection agencies carried out child protection responses involving 3.5 million children,” said Congressman Cuellar. “This is why I worked to secure funding for both child abuse prevention services and an improved child abuse hotline. No child deserves to be abused, and it is essential that we do everything in our power as lawmakers to ensure that child abuse victims have all the resources they need to recover and be safe.”
“I want to thank my fellow Appropriators and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Tom Cole and Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro for helping include these provisions that will benefit abused children who need help.”

Greg's Treasure State Update
Booming economy and increasing optimism 

Small businesses across the country are increasingly optimistic. In fact, small business optimism reached record levels earlier this year in response to efforts of President Trump and congressional Republicans to cut taxes and red tape, according to CNBC. 

Our Main Street businesses are the backbone of our economy and our communities. I will continue supporting them and advocating policies that help them grow and create jobs.

Working to make our communities safer 

I recently met with Montana Attorney General Tim Fox to discuss combating illegal drugs in Montana. Our ongoing cooperative approach aims to reduce drug addiction and improve community safety. 

Law enforcement must have the tools they need to get illegal drugs like meth and opioids off our streets and out of our communities, but we also need to ensure that addicts have access to treatment and recovery so they may turn their lives around. 

We discussed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, sweeping legislation to combat substance abuse that provides for prevention, interdiction, treatment, and recovery. President Trump recently signed the bill into law.

	•	include a strengthened safety net for Montana farmers and ranchers  
	•	maintain the sugar program to protect Montana sugar beet growers and processors  
	•	support the Agricultural Research Service which includes the Sheep Experiment Station in Montana and Idaho  
	•	preserve the Farm Credit system, and  
	•	reauthorize the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network to address farmer suicides.  
I also urged them to include forest management reforms, some of which I secured in the House version of the Farm Bill. Read the entire letter HERE. 


Recognized for supporting Montana’s agriculture industry 

I recently visited Arntzen Angus Ranch in Hilger to talk about the Farm Bill and other issues. While there, I received the Friend of Farm Bureau Award from the American Farm Bureau Federation for my legislative voting record in support of Montana’s agriculture industry. 

I’m honored to receive the Friend of Farm Bureau award, and I’m grateful for the confidence and nomination of the Montana Farm Bureau Federation. 

I will continue serving as a strong voice for Montana’s farmers – working to roll back and repeal burdensome regulations they face, passing a Farm Bill that works for them, and advocating fair trade deals that benefit them so they can get their products to foreign markets.

Spirit of Montana 

I had the honor of recognizing Joan Nye of Columbus in the U.S. House of Representatives for her selfless devotion to the survivors of suicide loss and her tireless efforts to prevent suicide in Montana. 

A survivor of suicide loss, Joan has worked with and led organizations dedicated to the prevention of suicide and the support of those impacted by suicide for more than 14 years. 

Anyone may nominate Montanans for the Spirit of Montana award by contacting my office at 202-225-3211 or by email at https://gianforte.house.gov/contact/email.

The wildfire has consumed more than 150,000 acres and left more than 13,000 families without homes. Last year, more than 1.2 million acres burned in Montana, leaving air quality dangerous with ash hanging in the air.

Visiting the Front Lines of Hurricane Recovery in Puerto Rico
Dear Friend,  
This month I joined FEMA agents for a tour of Hurricane Maria’s lingering damage in Puerto Rico, and an update on the island’s progress recovering from the storm now one year later.
￼   
As much as I appreciate the hard work of these dedicated public servants, I was reminded of the Trump Administration’s abysmal response to the disaster that threatened the lives and livelihoods of over 3 million Americans. The federal government’s response was a parade of errors, mismanagement, and careless indifference to the 2,975 lives and $90 billion of property lost. One month after the storm, 90 percent of Puerto Ricans still had no power. This was beyond unacceptable in the United States of America. 
￼   
As part of my trip, I met with workers at the Monacillo Power Plant who have been working tirelessly to restore and maintain power to northern Puerto Rico. I also met with a family whose home was repaired by the Sheltering and Temporary Essential Power Program, which works to make families’ homes livable as quickly as possible after disasters. Finally, I visited a Community Recovery Center – a one-stop shop where hurricane victims can access a variety of services to help them rebuild. 
￼   
Now that I’m back in Washington, I am focused on aiding Puerto Rico in its recovery and economic stability, and ensuring such a failed federal response to a natural disaster on American soil never occurs again. 
As always, it is an honor to represent and serve you. 
Sincerely,  
￼

Dear Texans, 
I hope all of you in Texas' 25th District had a wonderful Thanksgiving filled with family and loved ones. For those of you with family members in the Armed Forces who were unable to be together this year, please know that we are all grateful for their service, and will continue to pray for their safety.
Crisis at the Border  
As I’ve said all along, the security of this nation is absolutely paramount and it must be a top priority. In a time when immigrants are attempting to illegally enter our country and corrupt American ideals, the need for border security is greater than ever before. Unfortunately, Democrats want to allow dangerous immigrants into our homes and put our lives at risk. They want open borders, special pathways to citizenship, and funding for sanctuary cities. Ultimately, Democrats are choosing to prioritize illegal aliens over American citizens.
While President Trump is working hard to deter this type of illicit activity, Congress must do its job and fix our severely flawed immigration system. I have always been in favor of using any and all  means necessary to secure our nation's borders, and I will remain dedicated to working to ensure we take additional steps to combat threats to our nation and keep our citizens safe. I want everyone to have the opportunity to pursue the American Dream, but they must start by following our laws.   
Small Business Optimism 
The National Federation for Independent Business announced that small business optimism is at a record high, and ""has only been this high three times in the last 43 years."" As a business owner, I can tell you firsthand that we are in a better place than we were 10 years ago. I remember what it was like when our economy was being strangled by high taxes and overregulation. 
I am happy to report that under President Trump's leadership, America is getting back on track. People are reentering the work force and businesses are booming. This is in large part due to the extremely high number of job openings - approximately 7 million - as well as House Republicans delivering the largest corporate tax cut in history just last year. As we get closer to the end of this Congress, we must keep working to ensure American families and the economy continue to thrive. 
TX-25 Veterans  
My office is continuing to collect stories from our veterans in Texas' 25th District to highlight them on our website and Facebook page.

Poll: Transparency
Hoosiers,
 
The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the Settlement Agreement Information Database Act of 2018 this week. This bill would require the White House to create and maintain a public database of settlement agreements the government enters as a result of lawsuits or extra-regulatory activity brought by or against the government. 
 
Currently, records regarding the common practice of settlements negotiated by bureaucrats outside of the courtroom or the regular regulatory order are not easily accessible to the American public. The Settlement Agreement Information Database Act aims to lift the curtain of secrecy and allow the American public to hold its government accountable when it engages in settlements, and ensure they are best serving the American people. 
 
Question of the Week: Do you support increasing transparency of government settlements by passing the Settlement Agreement Information Database Act? 

[_] Yes.
[_] No.
[_] I don't know.
[_] Other (share your thoughts).

Take the poll here.

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
A number of key reforms championed by Senator Baldwin to support the nation’s Coast Guard, help Wisconsin’s coastal economy, and protect our Great Lakes from pollution and the spread of harmful invasive species were included in the bipartisan Coast Guard Reauthorization legislation which passed the Senate this month. 
“After working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make the final Coast Guard reauthorization better, I supported this bipartisan legislation because it helps protect our Great Lakes from the spread of harmful invasive species and supports our coastal economy in Wisconsin,” said Senator Baldwin. 
Senator Baldwin authored improvements to the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (VIDA), which was included in the final Coast Guard Reauthorization, in order to protect U.S. waters, businesses and communities from invasive species. Earlier versions of the legislation included provisions that would have rolled back progress made in the fight against invasive species in the Great Lakes, and protections for water quality. 
“The Alliance for the Great Lakes is grateful to Senator Baldwin who has fought tirelessly to protect the Great Lakes from aquatic invasive species,” said Alliance for the Great Lakes Vice President for Policy Molly Flanagan. “The version of VIDA passed by the Senate is dramatically improved from a bad version of the bill that Senate Democrats blocked in April 2018. As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator Baldwin played a pivotal role in negotiating a bill that includes strong protections for the Great Lakes.” 
“Once again, Senator Baldwin has made safeguarding the Great Lakes a top priority,” said Mary Jean Huston, State Director for The Nature Conservancy in Wisconsin. “What was once a very concerning proposal is now much improved by the Senator. The bill will ensure that science drives our response to invasive species threats, and that Wisconsin has tools to prevent invasive species from spreading in the Great Lakes.” 
As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator Baldwin worked to secure substantial updates and include key measures to protect the Great Lakes from the spread of invasive species in the legislation. Specifically, Senator Baldwin secured funding for harbor monitoring, the development of Laker ballast treatment technology and improved emergency response tools to protect the Great Lakes ecosystem in the case that new invasive species are detected. Notably, she also worked to ensure that ballast water and other pollutants that could threaten the health of the Great Lakes will continue to be regulated under the Clean Water Act, fighting earlier efforts to remove this entire set of pollutants from our nation’s bedrock water protection law. 
Read more about Senator Baldwin’s reforms included in the bipartisan Coast Guard Reauthorization and her continued leadership to help safeguard our Great Lakes here.

Dear  , 
Today, I will introduce the Diverse Small Businesses Empowerment Act to provide targeted economic growth to a diverse group of American entrepreneurs including minorities, women and veteran small-business owners. This bill will work to break down barriers that inhibit progress for minority-owned small businesses in the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex, and across the country.  
In the Metroplex, over 250 businesses owned by veterans, women and minorities have already benefited from a variety of Small Business Administration loan programs. This bill seeks to expand the successes of this program nationally, and commit to uplift and fortify our local business owners in communities across the country.
Also, I wanted to remind everyone that I have my annual job fair in Dallas on December 3rd at Mountain View College gymnasium. Join me and more than 80 actively hiring employers in DFW who are looking to hire local candidates. Whether you a veteran who needs help transitioning into the civilian workforce, or you want to bring your resume to the next level, come meet the employers and take part in our professional development workshops offered throughout the event. Hope to see many of you there! 
Sincerely, 
Marc

Reps. Cuellar and McCaul Pass Bipartisan Bill Promoting US-MX Economic Partnership and Cooperation
Promotes economic partnership with a focus on energy, health, entrepreneurship, and education sectors
WASHINGTON— Yesterday, Congressmen Henry Cuellar (TX-28) and Michael McCaul (TX-10) announced the passage of H.R. 1567, the United States-Mexico Economic Partnership Act, in the House of Representatives. This bipartisan legislation will bolster professional development and economic growth in both countries, including in the border region in Texas, with a focus on the energy, health, entrepreneurship, and education sectors.
The goal of the bill is to promote a bilingual workforce that can better serve both sides of the border and increase economic development in the region. Its co-sponsors include House Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Elliot Engel (NY-16), along with Reps. David Cicilline (RI-1), Vicente Gonzalez (TX-15), and Brad Sherman (CA-30). It will next be sent to the U.S. Senate for consideration. 
“The relationship between the United States and Mexico runs deep through commercial, cultural, and educational partnerships,” said Congressman Cuellar. “Mexico is the United States’ second-largest export market and third-largest trading partner, with an estimated $615 billion in two-way trade between the two countries in 2017. With this in mind, it is imperative that we strengthen these relations and foster economic growth for all partners involved.” 
According to the Institute of International Education, in the 2015-2016 academic year, more than 56,000 U.S. students studied in other countries in the Western Hemisphere, while more than 84,000 non-U.S. students from the region studied in the U.S., but only 5,000 of those United States students studied in Mexico and only 16,000 of those non-U.S. students were from Mexico.
Increasing Bilateral Economic Integration
Both countries have benefited from bilateral, mutually beneficial partnerships focused on advancing each country’s economic interests. Under the United States-Mexico Economic Partnership Act, the State Department would create a strategy to further support economic relations between the U.S. and Mexico through academic and professional programs to contribute to this goal. 
Expanding Professional and Educational Exchange Programs 
The State Department currently supports exchange programs with Mexico through grants from the 100,000 Strong in Americas initiative, which was founded in 2011. The program has provided more than 100 grants to 250 institutions in 25 countries. The measure will require the State Department to create a strategy that expands educational and professional exchange programs with Mexico through the initiative. Specifically, it will:
1.      Encourage more academic exchange programs at the secondary, post-secondary, and post-graduate levels, especially with communities and through academic institutions in the border region;
2.      Encourage academic institutions and businesses to collaborate to support entrepreneurs and joint business initiatives; 
3.      Promote energy infrastructure coordination through vocational-level education and internships, particularly in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; and
4.      Require the State Department to assess the feasibility of facilitating partnerships between universities and medical and nursing programs in both countries. 
Congressman Henry Cuellar said, “I introduced the United States-Mexico Economic Partnership Act so that we can continue to deepen our relationship with Mexico both through economic integration and educational programs. Increasing academic exchanges in the energy, business, education, and health sectors will increase economic prosperity in both nations and allow us to further capitalize on the strengths each country has to offer.”
He continued, “I would like to thank Congressman McCaul for co-sponsoring this bipartisan piece of legislation. I also thank House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce and Ranking Member Elliot Engel for taking up this bill and advancing it through committee. I look forward to seeing the bill through to passage.”
Congressman Michael McCaul said, “As the Chairman of the U.S.-Mexico Inter-Parliamentary Group, I have long advocated for enhancing and strengthening the close relationship with our southern neighbor. This legislation states our commitment to promoting the academic exchanges between our two countries in the fields of business, energy, and health care. I look forward to future opportunities to enhance our shared commitment to economic empowerment, and thank my friend and fellow Texan, Congressman Cuellar, for his leadership on this important issue.”

Wisconsin Deserves To Manage Its Gray Wolf Population 
The House of Representatives recently passed my legislation to delist the gray wolf and to put its population management in the control of states. Like most parts of our government, things work better when handled at a local level- not by Washington bureaucrats.  I'd like to thank my Republican and Democrat colleagues for supporting this important reform, because Wisconsin farmers deserve to protect their livestock.

Dear Friend,
I hope that you had a wonderful Thanksgiving.  I am thankful for the privilege of serving my hometown, representing you in the Congress and for the opportunity to stand up for our shared values.  The National Climate Assessment was released on Black Friday and is one of the most important reports I have ever read.  Thirteen federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, EPA and NASA, issued dire warnings regarding higher temperatures, more extreme weather events, coastal flooding, health impacts and agricultural declines.  Climate change poses a serious threat to our way of life – and our wallets.  I believe that working together we can reduce carbon pollution and unleash a wave of innovation to address the climate crisis.  I look forward to working with community leaders, citizens, businesses and scientists across the country to do all we can to prevent greater damage, deaths and escalating costs.  Read the report and share your ideas.  Congress must pass the remaining appropriations bills by December 7 to avert another Republican government shutdown.  President Trump is making reckless threats to shut down the government if Congress does not agree to spend $5 Billion on a border wall, rather than meaningful border security and immigration reform.  Republicans in Congress and President Trump should not hold the nation hostage.  The last time Republicans forced a major government shutdown, for 16 days in 2013, the GOP’s recklessness cost our economy 120,000 jobs and $24 billion.  This week, it appears that the Republicans intend to rush another fiscally irresponsible tax bill to the floor for a vote.  They introduced a tax bill late last night without a committee markup – or even a hearing – and intend to bring the bill to a vote without time to review the legislation.  Congress does not operate well when bills are drafted and rushed to the floor without the ability of the public or representatives to weigh in.  It is wrong, and a new Democratic majority will not operate this way.  In addition, the bill is not paid for and adds significantly to the debt and deficit that are at record levels already.  Senate Majority Leader McConnell has used the growing debt as justification for cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.  I cannot help but look ahead to a new Congress in the new year.  The American people voted to restore checks and balances to the Trump Administration.  Plus, we intend to work to lower health care costs, fight for bigger paychecks and restore integrity in government.  Americans across the country organized, mobilized and voted in historic, record numbers to deliver the largest House Democratic victory since Watergate.  Democrats will strive for bipartisanship and common ground where we can – and we will stand our ground where we must.  As we debate policy, we must work to unite, not divide our country further.  We will show on the first day of the 116th Congress that we are prepared to get the job done for the American people.

Sincerely, 

Kathy Castor

Marching Orders
Dear Friends,

As folks gathered around dinner tables with loved ones last week, Dee Dee and I hope that your Thanksgiving Thursday was filled with rest and gratitude for the many ways we have been blessed as a community and Nation. While celebrating one of America’s oldest traditions, we are also reminded that the freedoms we enjoy every day would not be possible without the sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform. Let us never take for granted those who are serving, or have served, our country. They are willing to lay their lives down for our freedoms, and we owe our military members a debt of gratitude for their service, sacrifice, and valor.

Yesterday, I was humbled to join and thank members of the Georgia Army National Guard’s 48th Infantry Brigade in Milledgeville as this new set of heroes embarks on a journey into active duty. Following three weeks of training at Fort Stewart, these Guardsmen will deploy to Afghanistan. I pray that God protects them and keeps them from harm. By His mercy and grace, may each member return home. Read more about the ceremony in the Union Recorder.

From the Homefront
One of the best parts of my job is talking to and hearing from constituents, families, businesses, students, and friends from across Georgia’s 10th Congressional District. I started this week in Putnam County, where I appreciated having the opportunity to speak with local audiologists about the services provided in their Milledgeville office. I value learning about the work of companies in our region, and I look forward to visiting more businesses, like the Atlanta Hearing Associates, in the future. Thanks for having me!

Academy Update 
Young people who attend our Nation’s Service Academies all exhibit the characteristics that will help them to succeed as leaders in our Armed Forces: academic excellence, demonstrated leadership, and a commitment to serving their community and Nation. In 2015, I was humbled to congratulate Greenbrier High School senior Logan Hughes on his appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy, and recently he shared his experience at the academy with NewsChannel6 in Augusta. I encourage you to watch the segment here.

Ground Work
In an effort to better represent the needs and interests of the area, Team Hice hosts monthly Mobile Office Hours to serve as an extension of my district offices. We all know how confusing navigating the federal government can be, and whether it is trouble with VA benefit claims, the IRS, or Social Security – we’re ready to step in on your behalf. 

I encourage anyone with questions or in need of assistance to attend these Mobile Office Hours in Greene County, and learn how my office can better serve you.

Spring Internship Deadline Extended
I’m happy to offer internship opportunities for students and recent graduates who would like to get an inside look at the workings of Capitol Hill or gain an understanding of constituent services in my district offices. As a member of Team Hice, interns have the opportunity to learn about the legislative process, interact with constituents, develop research skills, and assist with administrative responsibilities.

Due to the holiday, the 2019 Spring Deadline Application has been extended to Saturday, December 1, 2018. Learn more and apply today!

Dear Friend, 

Like most Americans, I have lost family members and friends to illness. When you or someone you love is sick, everything else in life pales in importance. You feel scared and vulnerable, and the last thing you want to worry about is not having insurance or having insurance that doesn’t cover the necessary treatment. That's why it is so important that you take the time to review your coverage options for 2019 before the December 15 open enrollment deadline.  

￼

From now until December 15, Floridians can purchase, change, or renew plans through HealthCare.gov for coverage starting January 1.

Here's what you need to know about signing up for health insurance coverage for 2019:
	•	Open enrollment is shorter than in past years. The open enrollment period – when you can sign yourself and your family up for health insurance – ends on December 15. That's just a few weeks away, so review your options as soon as possible and sign up!
	•	Coverage could be more affordable than you think. That’s because financial help is available. During last year’s enrollment period, over 90 percent of Florida enrollees were eligible for some form of financial assistance made available through the Affordable Care Act. 
	•	Existing enrollees may have new options. If you had coverage through HealthCare.gov for 2018, head back to update your information and compare your options for 2019 before the December 15th deadline. Every year, plans and prices change. So shop around; you may find a plan that better meets your needs for less!
	•	Free help is available. Healthcare is confusing for everyone. Professionals are available to help you find the right plan and get signed up. If you have questions about signing up or want to talk through your options with a trained professional, free help is just a call away! The Call Center is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (except holidays) – call (800) 318-2596.
	•	Need in-person help? No problem. Visit coveringflorida.org to find in-person assistance to help you find a plan, fill out an application, and enroll. You can also call (877) 813-9115 to schedule an appointment at one of the locations in Orange and Seminole counties.
Don't miss out and find yourself without coverage for 2019. More information on open enrollment can be found on our website and if you have any questions, feel free to call our office. Don't forget, the deadline to enroll is December 15. Get covered today!

Sincerely,

￼

Congresswoman Beatty Secures Support for Central Ohio Youth in Foster Care
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) recently awarded $30 million to public housing authorities, including more than $458,000 for the Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority, to assist young people at risk of homelessness and their families obtain affordable housing. The $30 million in federal funding was made available through HUD’s Family Unification Program (FUP), a national initiative to prevent family separation due to homelessness, as well as homelessness among foster care aging-out youth. 
U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) is a longtime champion of FUP and has led the coordinated, comprehensive effort to tackle youth homelessness in Congress. In fact, Beatty spearheaded a congressional letter urging her fellow lawmakers to provide $20 million federal funds for FUP, a request that was ultimately included in the government funding bill, H.R. 1625, which became law on March 28, 2018.
“Throughout my time in Congress, I have worked with Democrats and Republicans alike to shine a light on the countless young people and their families who do not know where they will sleep at night,” Beatty said. “This new funding will help the City of Columbus better address and meet the needs of countless Central Ohio families who simply need a helping hand to get off the streets. Going forward, I pledge to do everything in my power to ensure Congress continues to play a leading role in assisting our most vulnerable Americans.”  In addition to their FUP appropriations request, Beatty is the lead Democratic cosponsor of the Homeless Children and Youth Act, H.R. 1511, a bill to expand federal assistance eligibility to young people bouncing from house to house—commonly referred to as “couch surfing.” Further, she sent another letter in May 2017 to HUD urging them to allocate federal funds for the creation of a demonstration project in Ohio to fight youth homelessness. This strong advocacy proved crucial to securing a $6.07 million two-year funding agreement earlier this year for the City of Columbus’ Community Shelter Board to tackle area youth homelessness.

Dear Friend,  
I always appreciate time spent with family and friends during the holiday season. While we can all agree that this year has had its ups and downs, I am personally thankful for my family's health and the privilege of fighting for our community in Washington. 
That is why I want to take a moment to remind you that open enrollment, the primary window of time for signing up or changing your health insurance coverage, is currently taking place here in California. Through January 15, 2019, you can renew or switch your plan, or newly enroll in health insurance coverage for the upcoming year. 
In California, we have a robust health insurance marketplace ready to help you find the right plan – Covered California. If you haven't already, I encourage you to go to the Covered California website, where you can easily check on your existing plan and see any new plan options available to you. Please also note that if you are signing up though Covered California for the first time and want your coverage to begin on January 1, 2019, you will need to sign up for coverage by December 15, 2018.  
In additional to comparing plans, you can also determine if you are eligible for any federal assistance. 88 percent of those who get coverage through Covered California qualify for financial help to lower the cost of insurance. If you need help navigating the process, you can call Covered California at 1-800-787-6921 for free assistance. 
Take the time to get covered today, and urge your family and friends to do the same. As you shop around for health insurance, please know that I will continue to work with my colleagues to lower health care costs, improve our health care system, and fight for your access to quality, affordable health care. 
Sincerely, ￼  Linda T. Sánchez Member of Congress

Highlights from the District
￼ 
Earlier this month, I held an Emerging Career Pathways Expo at Artesia High School for students interested in exploring specialized career options after high school. Attendees were able to connect with representatives from our local community colleges, trade unions, and apprenticeship programs to ask questions and learn more about the important work they do. Many don't realize that career and technical training will be vital for those looking to pursue jobs in industries with growing demand such as advanced manufacturing.
￼ 
Recently, I also joined the Los Angeles County Food Bank's mobile pantry to give out food to students at Cerritos college as well as local families in our area. I appreciated the opportunity to help put food on the table for those in our community who needed a little help this Thanksgiving.

11/27/18 13:12,How to Avoid a Government Shutdown 101,"News from Representative Tom Emmer
￼
Dear Friend,  
With the December 7 funding deadline looming ahead, soon terms like omnibus, continuing resolution, minibus, debt ceiling, reconciliation and other budgeting jargon will be used by Members of Congress and the media. Passing a federal budget is the one essential duty of Congress, yet passing all the required appropriations legislation on time has only happened four times since 1977. 
Here is what should happen: Congress should pass 12 separate appropriations bills funding the federal government and its agencies by the end of the fiscal year, October 1.   
Here is where we stand today: Currently, only 5 of the 12 appropriations bills have been passed and signed by the President. The other 7 have been replaced by a continuing resolution (CR) that lasts through December 7. CRs are stopgap measures that temporarily maintain current funding levels from the previous appropriations bills until new appropriations bills have been passed and signed into law. 
Here is a list of the appropriation bills that have been passed, and signed by the President:   
	1.	Energy & Water
	2.	Legislative Branch
	3.	Military Construction & VA
	4.	Department of Defense
	5.	Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services & Education
By midnight on December 7, Congress must pass, and the President must sign, these 7 pending appropriations bills which are currently being funded through the CR:
	1.	Agriculture
	2.	Commerce, Justice & Science
	3.	Financial Services & General Government Appropriations
	4.	Homeland Security
	5.	Interior & Environment
	6.	State & Foreign Operations
	7.	Transportation & Housing and Urban Development
Budgeting is central to Congress’ role, but reform is necessary for this process to function successfully in the future. I am glad Congress took the step to institute the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform. This bicameral and bipartisan committee is considering important and necessary changes to the budget process, which are due November 30. I look forward to seeing what they come up with!  
Throughout my time in Congress, I have been committed to fulfilling the duties our Founding Fathers laid out for the Legislative Branch in our Constitution: “No money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law…” (Article I, Section 9). I have consistently  opposed spending bills that carelessly increase our national debt without the necessary reforms, and look forward to reviewing the upcoming spending agreement to avert a senseless government shutdown.   

Still have questions about the budget process? Send me a note or give our DC office a call at 202-225-2331

11/27/18 11:51,Ensuring veterans receive the benefits they were promised,"￼
Dear friend,  Some of our nation's veterans haven't been receiving timely payments from the VA for the housing stipends they were promised through the Post-9/11 GI Bill. This is unacceptable.   Last week, Mark Warner and I wrote to Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie to address this payment issue that's putting a financial burden on veterans and their families. The failure to ensure prompt payments could force some veterans out of their homes, hurt their ability to afford basic necessities, and prevent them from pursuing educational goals.  Veterans are one of our nation's greatest assets, and we owe them a great deal of gratitude for their service. They were promised these payments to ease the financial burden of higher education after their military service and they deserve to receive these benefits in a timely manner. I hope the VA will quickly resolve this issue.  
Sincerely,

Congressman Dan Lipinski Commentary November 26, 2018 Chicago Tribune
￼
“I'm just a bill. Yes, I'm only a bill. And I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill.”
Remember the 1975 Schoolhouse Rock! video, “I’m Just a Bill?” When I was teaching American government, I would show my students this video about how a bill becomes a law in Congress. The video shows the U.S. House of Representatives as it was intended to work, as a bottom-up process where a member writes a bill and gets a majority of colleagues to support it at every level before it is sent to the president to become a law. But today the rules are rigged in a way that makes lawmaking largely a top-down process.
Both parties are guilty of this, and it only adds to the constant gridlock we’ve come to expect from Washington. Recall that in the GOP-controlled 115th Congress, common-sense bipartisan proposals developed by the 40-plus member House Problem Solvers Caucus on health care, immigration reform and other vital issues were blocked from ever reaching the House floor. We can and must do better to restore the “People’s House” and return power to the people we represent. In July, long before we knew the outcome of the midterm elections, the Problem Solvers Caucus endorsed the “Break the Gridlock” reform package intended to change the House rules to ensure transparency in the legislative process and facilitate consideration of bipartisan solutions to our most pressing challenges.
The current process, by which the speaker has the power to decide what bills we vote on, what's in those bills and when we vote, needs to be opened up so that individual members are empowered to author bills, amend bills and have a say in what bills are going to be considered in committee and on the House floor. Let’s have the majority rule in the House, not the current process where the speaker makes the decisions and majority party members are told to vote “yes” and minority party members are told to vote “no.” This takes power away from the people and creates the gridlock that frustrates so many Americans.
Among the 10 rules changes in our Break the Gridlock proposal, I believe the most important are the ones that give every member the opportunity to have legislation they author considered in the House, as well as those that allow the majority of the House to rule instead of being held hostage to the extremes. For example, one rule change would grant every member the right to have one bill they introduced considered in a committee that they serve on as long as they have bipartisan support. Another proposal mandates that if 20 Democrats and 20 Republicans cosponsor an amendment, the amendment automatically gets to be debated and considered on the floor. A third requires that any bill that has 290 cosponsors — two-thirds of the House — be debated and voted on the House floor.
Over the past four months, the Problem Solvers Caucus has met with a number of current and potential future party leaders to discuss the Break the Gridlock reforms. After the election, a group of Democratic members in the caucus discussed these rules changes with Leader Nancy Pelosi as well as with Democratic staff members of the House Committee on Rules. My fellow caucus members and I are willing to make minor changes, but as we said in September, we need to see real reform put into the House rules from a speaker candidate in order for that member to get our votes. Republican members of the caucus have even said they’d support a Democratic member for speaker if these rules changes are made.
The gridlock in Washington needs to end. We have a very large class of first-term members coming into the House next year that ran on ending the gridlock. By putting the Problem Solvers Caucus reforms into the House rules, we’ll begin re-empowering members and give Congress the opportunity to work for the American people again.

Dear Friends,  
I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving and was able to spend time with family, friends, and loved ones. I took some time the last few days thinking about all of the things I am thankful for: like the continued opportunity to serve the people of Texas' 10th Congressional District and the brave men and women serving in harm's way to defend our God given liberties. Most of all, I am so thankful for my beautiful family and the quality time we spent together during this holiday.

ICYMI: A Proven Record on Foreign Affairs 
Just a few weeks ago, I announced my decision to pursue the Ranking Member position on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and serve as its leading Republican Member. Confronting the many foreign policy challenges facing our country will require strong and steady leadership, which I have demonstrated by running a productive and results oriented committee over the past six years. 
In case you missed it, you can click here or on the image below to read an op-ed supporting me for Ranking Member in The Daily Caller.  
""McCaul Has A Proven Record on Foreign Affairs"" 
￼  


#TaxCutsandJobsAct Update 
As you may know, last year I voted for the first comprehensive reform of our broken tax code in over thirty years. Since then, the American economy has been thriving. Middle-class Americans are seeing more money in their pockets. The average Texan in our district will see more than a 10% reduction in their tax burden and will save more than $25,000 over the next ten years. 
Just this past weekend, we saw Black Friday online sales hitting a record-setting $6.22 billion. This is a nearly 25% increase from last year and the latest example of the booming economy we have in America. You click here or on the image below to learn more.

Legislative Update 
Last week, Members were in their districts for the Thanksgiving holiday. For that reason, there were no votes held in the House. 
This Week, the House opens for legislative business on Tuesday and there are votes scheduled on a number of important bills. Here are few you may be interested in:
	•	H.R. 5273 – the Global Fragility and Violence Reduction Act of 2018. This is legislation that I introduced with Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), which promotes more effective development in fragile and unstable countries, addressing the conditions that create safe havens for terrorists, criminal networks, and war lords. It also develops a global initiative aimed at preventing the root causes of violence and instability in countries around the world.
	•	H.R. 1567 – the United States-Mexico Economic Partnership Act. This legislation seeks to promote economic partnership and cooperation between the United States and Mexico.
	•	H.R. 4254 – the Women in Aerospace Education Act. This legislation will encourage universities applying for grants to incorporate aerospace engineering experiences into their teacher training curriculum and direct NASA to strengthen the promotion of NASA internship and fellowship programs towards women.
As always, I encourage you to visit my website, mccaul.house.gov, for more information on constituent services and legislative updates. Also, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to get the latest updates on my work in Washington and the 10th District of Texas. It continues to be a great honor to represent you in the United States House of Representatives.

￼
Friends, 
I hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving celebrating with loved ones.  
￼  
While we have a lot to be thankful for, there are also people in our district and throughout the country who are in the midst of a very challenging recovery period in the wake of devastating hurricanes and wildfires. When Hurricane Michael made landfall just over a month ago, areas of Alabama, Florida, and Georgia were completely ravaged. Hundreds of people lost everything, and more than 30 people were killed. 
Here in our district, the agriculture community faces the most significant devastation. While the full scale of damages is still being assessed at this time, Hurricane Michael dealt a terrible blow to our cotton, timber, and peanut farmers. 
During the holiday season as you’re gathered with family and friends, I hope you will join me in prayerfully remembering our neighbors in the Wiregrass and throughout the country. While the challenge of rebuilding won’t be easy, I am confident that we will get through it together. 
NATIONAL ENTREPRENEURS' DAY 
￼ 
Last week, we celebrated National Entrepreneurs' Day. Our country's entrepreneurs are the engine of economic growth and job creation. In Congress, I will always work to ensure that these innovators in Alabama's Second District and across the nation have the resources they need to grow and succeed.
THIS WEEK'S GOOD NEWS 
￼ 
Earlier this year, Mr. Joey Holland, the Houston County Sheriff’s Office Chaplain, spearheaded the opening of the Houston County Jail library to provide inmates opportunities to read and self-improve. Mr. Holland says there are about 190 titles checked out every two weeks in an inmate population that stays between 300-400.
For those in the Dothan area, this week, there is a giving tree at Westgate Library with a wish list for books in high demand.  
Read more from the Dothan Eagle. 
CONGRESS RECONVENES 
The House is set to reconvene in Washington this week, and there's plenty of work to be done. Remember that you can follow along with the latest on Facebook and Twitter.  
It is an honor to serve you in Congress. Please never hesitate to let me know if there is a way my office can be of assistance.    Sincerely, 
￼  Martha Roby

11/26/18 20:16,We must continue to fight ,"￼ 
 
Dear Friends,  
I want to thank you for the privilege of serving as your voice in the United States Senate.
While things worked out a little differently than we had hoped this past election, we all must continue to fight for what's right.
We must continue to fight for the fundamental right of health care, and against any attempt to roll back protections for pre-existing conditions.
We must continue to fight to preserve the natural wonders of our state - from the Everglades, to the pine forests, to the sandy white beaches that line our coasts.
We need to continue launching rockets and exploring the heavens. And better protect the planet that our children and grandchildren will inherit.
We need to fight to strengthen Social Security and Medicare; and we need to end all forms of suppression and make it easier for people to vote.
We have to move beyond a politics that aims not just to beat our opponents, but to destroy them; where truth is treated as disposable, and the free press is assaulted as the enemy of the people.
We need to come together for the good of the country to get things done. 
￼
There's been a gathering darkness in our politics in recent years - but my hope for a better future can be found in the words of John F. Kennedy who said civility can guide us through that darkness to a safe and sane future.
Again, I want to say thank you for the privilege of a lifetime of public service.
God bless you and God bless our country. 
Sincerely, ￼

Kansas Common Sense  November 26, 2018
Hello,
 
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
 
Spending Thanksgiving Alongside Our Men and Women in Uniform 
Robba and I wish you a Happy Thanksigiving and hope you were able to spend the holiday with your friends, family and loved ones. On Thanksgiving Day, we had the privilege of visiting patients and healthcare professionals at Irwin Army Hospital on post. Following our time at Irwin, we had Thanksgiving lunch with soldiers and their families at Fort Riley, including Major General and Mrs. Kolasheski.

On Thanksgiving, and on every day, we are thankful for the sacrifices and selfless-service of Americans in uniform, across Kansas and the nation. I am reminded that many soldiers, including some stationed here at Fort Riley, are deployed across the globe and can’t make it home for holidays – and so much more. Robba and I ask you to join us in keeping them in our thoughts this season.
     
￼
Hosting my 13th Kansas Conservation Tour On Tuesday, I hosted my 13th Annual Kansas Conservation Tour with stops in Neosho, Labette, Cherokee and Crawford counties. The Conservation Tour is an opportunity for me to learn more about conservation efforts across the state, including water and soil conservation, river sustainability, and wetlands and grassland prairie preservation efforts, as well to discuss irrigation practices and other important agricultural issues for producers. Hosting this tour on the week of Thanksgiving is appropriate, as it embodies the values of the holiday: being thankful for the resources our state has been blessed with. Preserving and protecting what we have been given is critical to the future of Kansas. 
During the tour, I met with an impressive group of farmers, federal agricultural and natural resource agencies, associations, and private organizations, including: the Kansas Association of Conservation Kansas Wheat Growers Association, Kansas Corn Growers Association, and the Kansas Grain Sorghum Producers Association. This year, we highlighted the important conservation work being done by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Kansas Forest Service, Kansas Department of Health and Environment, Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism, the Nature Conservancy, Ducks Unlimited, and private landowners. 
We started the day at the Lil' Toledo Lodge, located on the Neosho River near Chanute, for a discussion about the Sustainable Rivers Program (SRP). The SRP is a nationwide partnership between The Nature Conservancy and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that focuses on preserving river flow while balancing the needs of water consumption with the ecological considerations of the river. We also discussed the Nature Conservancy's Healthy Streams Initiative and the work in the state related to that program. 
 ￼ 
The second stop of my Kansas Conservation Tour took us to the Parsons Arboretum. We were joined by the Kansas Forest Service to discuss community forestry efforts across the state that assist municipalities with tree planting and proper tree management in cities. We also received updates on their fire management programs that provide fire-fighting resources and equipment to fire departments in rural areas. With a number of devastating wildfires across the state in recent years, this program is of special importance to our Kansas farmers and ranchers. 
 ￼ 
Following our session in Parsons, the tour headed to a wetland and native tallgrass prairie area near Chetopa where the group was briefed on the Natural Resources Damages Assessment and Restoration (NRDAR) program. NRDAR is a partnership between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism aimed at restoring the wetland and grassland areas that were previously contaminated by decades of lead and zinc mining. We heard from project stakeholders, including Ducks Unlimited, who is a private partner of NRDAR. 
 ￼ 
Over lunch, we heard from the Kansas Soybean Association, Kansas Corn Growers Association, Kansas Wheat Growers Association, and Kansas Grain Sorghum Producers Association about conservation topics pertaining to their interest areas. During my remarks to the group, I discussed the history, purpose and importance of my Kansas Conservation Tour, and gave updates on work I’m doing in Washington pertinent to the group and their collective conservation efforts. 
 ￼ 
Our last two stops were both farms that had improvements with assistance from the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). At the Egbert’s farm near McCune, we saw an irrigation pond and terraces that were installed by these fifth-generation farmers with cost-sharing assistance provided by the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and technical assistance from the Natural Resources Conservation Service. 
 ￼ 
For the last stop on my Kansas Conservation Tour, we visited Misty Mornings Farm near Mulberry to hear from the farm owner, Misty, and her husband, Charlie. They showed the group their high tunnels that provide a unique opportunity to extend the growing seasons for their crops while using fewer resources. 
 ￼ 
One thing that was clear throughout the tour is that a strong Farm Bill conservation title is vital to Kansas farmers and ranchers. I would like to send a special thanks to State Conservationist Karen Woodrich, State FSA Director David Schemm, State Forester Larry Biles, and all those who participated by sharing their experiences, farms, land and best practices with one another.  
Moran in Moran On Monday, I held a townhall meeting in Moran as my Allen County stop on the Kansas Listening Tour. This townhall – the last of my 105 meetings this Congress – was well attended by folks from Allen County. During our discussion, we covered a number of topics, including the high cost of prescription drugs and the need to control those prices, tariffs and ongoing trade disputes, tax reform, immigration and the need for a skilled workforce in the Kansas economy, securing our borders and the status of the Farm Bill that is so important to our Kansas farmers and ranchers. I appreciated the many residents who took time to visit with me on Monday, and I also thank the Moran United Methodist Women for serving lunch prior to my townhall meeting. 
￼ 
Announcing New HRSA Grants at Pittsburg State University On Tuesday, I was at Pittsburg State University (PSU) to announce two new grants from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) awarded to the PSU Irene Ransom Bradley School of Nursing. These new grants will allow nurses at PSU to be specially trained in helping care for victims of sexual assault, will establish a comprehensive Rural Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners Program and will help train nurses who will work specifically in community health in our medically underserved areas. 
The PSU School of Nursing is a tremendous asset to our state and to the talented Kansans who aim to serve their community through medicine. The school’s ability to bring federal grant dollars back to Kansas is extremely valuable, and the grants announced this week will empower nurses to advance their education and place an emphasis on serving communities in need of their skills. Through my position on the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue working to help Kansas healthcare providers and the federal government establish partnerships that benefit our Kansas communities. To read more on the grants and Tuesday’s announcements, click here. 
 ￼
Visiting with Locals in Erie On Monday, following a day of events in southeast Kansas, I stopped in Erie to visit with residents and business owners. I enjoyed stopping by the office of Rick Hines, Attorney at Law, Richey’s Pharmacy and City Hall, as well as the Neosho County Courthouse to visit the Neosho County Clerk, Treasurer, and Clerk of the Court. During this stop, I heard about issues of relevance in Erie, received feedback on items important to locals and gave updates on the work I’m doing in Washington, D.C. Thank you to folks in Erie who took time out of their day to visit with me on Tuesday.

Honored to Serve You in Washington It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

NEWS FROM WASHINGTON AND ACROSS WEST TEXAS
Dear Friend, 
As we return from the Thanksgiving holiday, I have continued to reflect on the blessings that have been bestowed upon my family, this year and years past. I remain grateful for your continued trust to represent the people of West Texas. 
Our first President, George Washington, said that Thanksgiving should be ""devoted by the people of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be."" His words still ring true today. We live in a great country, and we have many things to be thankful for.
Immigration Loopholes 
Last week, as the migrant caravan approached the southernmost border, I joined Fox Business to discuss President Trump’s proclamation to limit fraud and abuse of our asylum policies. I support the President's move to shore up our immigration laws - it is justified and supported by the Immigration and Nationality Act. Section 212 states plainly that “whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation … suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants.” He has the lawful ability and duty to first-and-foremost protect the American people. 
It is shameful that Obama-era judges are legislating from the bench, inhibiting the President from doing his job. This situation highlights how critical it is for the Senate to fill the 11 court of appeals and 111 district court vacancies with constitutionalist judges. See a portion of our discussion here. 
￼ 
Better Budgeting 
As families across America traveled for the Thanksgiving holiday last week, Congress once again left town with seven of the twelve annual spending bills still outstanding. It has been over twenty years since Congress passed all twelve of these bills before the end of the new fiscal year. The failure of Congress to do its basic job of funding the government properly and on-time and instead rely on stopgap spending measures has created needless waste, disruption, and inefficiencies. 
That is why I am introducing a legislative fix with my colleagues, Representative Derek Kilmer and Senator Joni Ernst, to implement a “No Budget, No Recess” provision in our budgeting and appropriations process as a way to hold Congress accountable to the same standards as the American people. My amendment would prevent Congress from adjourning without successfully passing all of its annual spending bills before the July and August recess periods. I am hopeful that my colleagues on the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform will support my amendment this week. Read here for Abilene Reporter-News’ write up on the amendment. 
￼ 
The next step in reforming our budget and appropriations process is to encourage more fiscal responsibility by reducing deficit spending and our mountainous debt. Our nation’s borrowing and spending habits remain the challenge of the 21st Century and the greatest threat to the next generation.  
Broken and Unwieldy Bureaucracy 
Fifteen months after the Forever GI Bill was signed into law, expanding benefits for a new generation of veterans and their families, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is still experiencing IT problems resulting in underpaid and/or delayed payments to student veterans. Unfortunately, due to a patch work of outdated IT systems, our veterans are now paying the price, and too many aren’t receiving the benefits they were promised and rely on to make ends meet. 
The VA had a year to get this right, then – when they identified this IT issue – they committed it would be fixed before the semester started. Now, at my last Subcommittee hearing as Chairman, it is clear that the VA has no timeline by which to resolve the issue nor do they have the leadership and long-term plan in place to fix the root causes.
As I have said before, the broken and unwieldy bureaucracy at the VA is the biggest constraint to serving our veterans. Legislative reforms passed by Congress are only worth the paper they are written on if the VA isn’t able to implement them. We must do the following in order to resolve the systemic management dysfunction of the VA: demand the Senate expedite the confirmation of President Trump’s appointments to the VA, continue to create a culture of accountability among the VA employees, and keep pressure on the Department’s leadership to resolve the IT system issues that have wasted hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars and let our veterans down.
I know my colleagues in Congress on both sides of the aisle, along with President Trump, are committed to breaking through the bureaucracy and making the VA work for our veterans, but we have a long way to go and must be relentless in our pursuit of the same level of service and sacrifice given to us by our servicemen and women. We promised it; they earned it; and the American people expect us to deliver on it. Read more about the issue here.   
Common Sense VA Reforms 
The VA recently announced that it will be moving nearly 430 medical professionals from taxpayer-funded union work back to healthcare jobs – a common sense move for the Department. VA doctors should not be working on union duties when there are veterans waiting to be seen. Employees with the most expertise and responsibility should be doing the job they were hired to do - not union business.
My legislation, which has already passed the House Veterans Affairs’ Committee, would prevent VA employees from spending 100% of their time at the VA on union activity. Read the latest on the VA’s action here. 
Local Purple Heart Recognition 
Taylor County was recently recognized as a Purple Heart County! Cities and counties across the nation form the Purple Heart Trail, which “creates a symbolic and honorary system of roads, highways, bridges, and other monuments giving tribute to the men and women who have been awarded the Purple Heart medal.”
Purple Heart recipient and president of the local chapter of the Military Order of the Purple Heart, Technical Sergeant Jesus Soto, presented the recognition to Judge Downing Bolls and the County Commissioners Court. This distinction comes at no surprise – the good people of West Texas know how to take care of their own and cherish those that served our country with dignity and respect.

￼  Click on the screen above to hear my remarks on the floor of the House urging passage of my amendment to defund endless wars of choice and start reinvesting in America and our people. 
Dear Friend, 
Endless wars of choice are bankrupting our Nation, draining away money we desperately need here at home for education, medical research, human development, rebuilding our infrastructure, and so many other unmet needs. In my judgment, defunding these wars should be Job One for the incoming Congress in January. 
The simple truth is, our national priorities are totally out of whack. Military spending, when adjusted for inflation, has increased by nearly 50 percent since 9-11. By comparison, spending on non-military items – things like education, health care, public transit and science – grew by only 13.5 percent over that same period. 
The cost of these endless wars of choice, in both blood and treasury, is shocking. Over the past 17 years, our military involvement in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Syria alone has already cost us almost $6 trillion. And when the costs of borrowing that money and taking care of those who have lost arms and legs and, in many cases, their mental and physical health in combat, the cost jumps to nearly $16 trillion over the next 35 years. Meanwhile, according to a new Brown University study, 480,000 people have lost their lives in these conflicts, and some 10 million more have been displaced. 
As I have pointed out during meetings and conversations with incoming Members of Congress, the best way to put a stop to endless wars of choice that have cost us so much blood and treasury is to cut off their funding. In fact, that’s exactly what we tried to do last spring on the floor of the U.S House. During debate on the 2019 National Defense Authorization bill, I was able to introduce an amendment to de-fund the Overseas Contingency Operations account the Pentagon uses to pay for these wars, and save U.S. taxpayers $69 billion next fiscal year alone. 
The amendment did not succeed. However, the very fact that Republican leaders allowed the measure to be considered is evidence that Democrats and Republicans alike are growing increasingly fed up by the waste and carnage these wars produce.
During my speech on the floor of the House last May, I posed a question to my colleagues: Do we want to be having this same debate ten years from now, having spent another ten or eleven trillion dollars on these endless wars of choice and so-called nation building abroad? No one raised a hand to say yes. 
We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email. 
Sincerely,  ￼ 

The President's Thanksgiving Week - Pardoning Two Innocent Turkeys and a Gang of Saudi Murderers
￼  Candles and pictures of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi are placed outside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul,Turkey. According to the CIA, Khashoggi was killed inside the building by a Saudi assassination squad acting under orders from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.  
The President marked Thanksgiving week by upholding the traditional pardon of two innocent turkeys – and by abandoning our American tradition of moral leadership. He turned a blind eye to the conclusion of our own CIA and intelligence community that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the brutal murder of Washington Post columnist and Saudi regime critic Jamal Khashoggi.  
In doing so, the President chose to ignore audio recordings of Khashoggi’s murder, intercepted phone calls, and copious intelligence briefings by CIA Director Gina Haspel describing details of the crown prince’s involvement. 
Instead, he made it clear that personal relationships with the Saudi royal family, business as usual Saudi oil sales to the United States, and billions of dollars in U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia, were more important than holding thugs and murderers to account for their actions. What an outrage.
As established by our Founders, America’s leadership in the world has always been based on an unqualified commitment to the ideals of democracy, freedom of the press, and the rule of law. We cannot allow our great nation to lose the moral high ground and become just another country embracing thugs and murderers for profit and economic gain.  

With Loons an Endangered Species in the Lower 48 States, Funding Support Grows for National Loon Center in Crosslake MN
￼  These artists drawings show what the National Loon Center could look like on the outside and inside.  
With the iconic Minnesota Loon on the Audubon Society’s list of endangered species here in the lower 48 states, the National Loon Center Foundation is leading efforts to help save and protect our State Bird by establishing a National Loon Center in the city of Crosslake, Minnesota. 
Together with the Foundation, progress is being made toward assembling several million dollars for the Center from the state and federal governments, the University of Minnesota, foundations, citizens, and other private sources. 
Specifically, the National Loon Center would be devoted to restoring and protecting loon habitats, researching ways to advance the wellbeing of loons, repairing shoreline, enhancing water quality, boosting environmental recreation, and educating the public on best practices for preserving loon populations. 
The project and timing are critical because our loons are being threatened as never before by climate change, the BP oil spill, water pollution, and diseases spread by invasive zebra mussels.    
On the federal level, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has entered into a memorandum of agreement to provide $2.6 million worth of land on the White Fish chain of lakes. The Gulf Spill Restoration Fund – provided by BP Oil Company to help alleviate the terrible damages caused by the 2010 BP oil spill – will add $450,000 dollars for the Center as part of a $7.52 million package awarded to the State of Minnesota and designated to help the loons recover from damage suffered while migrating in the Gulf of Mexico. 
On the state level, the Center is on track to receive $4 million dollars from the Legislature via the Environmental and Natural Resources Trust Fund, which is paid for through proceeds from the Minnesota Lottery. In addition to private money from supporters, the University of Minnesota also contributed $55,000 dollars for the now complete project engineering feasibility study. 
Meanwhile, as I have pointed out before, invasive zebra mussels spread deadly infections to our Minnesota loons and destroy sport and commercial fishing habitat. My amendment to the Water Resources Development Act, signed into law earlier this fall, directs the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to accelerate the battle against these invaders, along with Asian carp and hundreds of other species attacking our lakes, rivers, waterways and wildlife. 

Wrong Mr. President – Boosting the Federal Minimum Wage to $15 Dollars an Hour Is Sensible – Not “Silly”
￼  Editorial cartoonist Monte Wolverton nails it. Corporate profits are at an all time high while minimum wage workers struggle to make ends meet.  
The President and his top economic advisor, millionaire Wall Street financier Larry Kudlow, ought to spend less time bragging about newly created jobs, and more time connecting with the real world, where it often takes two or three of those jobs just to make a living.
Demonstrating cluelessness about how millions of low-income Americans struggle every day just to put food on the table, Kudlow recently told the Washington Post that in his view, the federal minimum wage – enacted by President Franklin Roosevelt and Congressional Democrats in 1938 – is “a terrible idea,” and that increasing it would be “silly.” 
What nonsense. It is a moral imperative that anyone willing to go to work eight hours a day, 40 hours a week, be entitled to a living wage and a secure and comfortable life. No one should have to hold two or three jobs in order to live in a nice home, pay the bills, put some money away for retirement, and have a little left over at the end of the week for a movie, a meal out, or a trip to the lake to wet a fishing line.  
That's why, earlier this year, I joined as an original cosponsor of the Raise the Wage Act to boost the minimum wage to $15.00 an hour by 2024 – and index it to gradually increase starting in 2025. 
The simple fact is, the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour has millions stuck in poverty. This is especially true for the working women who make up 70 percent of minimum wage earners – in many cases young mothers who barely break even after child care expenses. 
In fact, the University of California’s Center for Poverty Research reports that a single parent with one child working 40 hours a week at a minimum wage job will earn below the federal poverty line of $16,070. 
That must end.  
Beyond the fact that raising the minimum wage is the fair and decent thing to do, it’s also commonsense economics. Minimum wage earners spend the money they make locally, on groceries, fuel, and other necessities of life. That’s good for business, good for jobs, good for communities and good for everyone.  

Our Week in St. Paul 
￼  My Field Representative Rick Olseen attended the promotion of Lieutenant Colonel Joe Sharkey of the Minnesota National Guard to Colonel. Rick Olseen has worked with the Colonel for the last six years with my offices work with the National Guard. The ceremony was in the Veterans Service Building overlooking the State Capital in St. Paul.
Our Week in Lindstrom
￼  Our Vietnam Soldiers Remembered, is a display open right now at the Chisago County Historical Society in Lindstrom. With the photos and items on display it highlights how horrible war is, what’s really moving is the stories from men and women who served in Vietnam. My Field Representative Rick Olseen visited recently. The hours are on their website. 
Our Week in Nisswa
￼  The City of Nisswa held their annual City of Lights celebration last week, and crowds gathered to meet the live reindeer that helped make the day special. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein was on hand taking pictures. 

Coming Up in Washington
This week:
	•	The House is expected to pass a Coast Guard reauthorization bill and send it to the President. 

Finally...
On This Day in History, November 26, 1941  From ""Franksgiving"" back to ""Thanksgiving""
￼  President Roosevelt carves the turkey after signing legislation officially designating Thanksgiving to be on the last Thursday of November. 
Undoing the change that became known as “Franksgiving,” on November 26, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed legislation forever designating the last Thursday in November as America’s official Thanksgiving Day. Now here’s the rest of the story as explained on the website historyextra.com. 
In 1939, with the last Thursday in November falling on the last day of the month, President Roosevelt became concerned that the shortened Christmas shopping season might dampen economic recovery. He therefore issued a Presidential Proclamation moving Thanksgiving to the second to last Thursday of November. 
Some 32 states consequently issued similar proclamations, but 16 states refused to accept the change. As a result, for two years two days were celebrated as Thanksgiving. 
To end the confusion, on October 6, 1941 Congress set a fixed date for the holiday: it passed a joint resolution declaring the last Thursday in November to be the legal Thanksgiving Day.

Dear Lindsey, 
I hope you all had a Happy Thanksgiving with family and friends! I’m thankful for the many opportunities I had to visit with folks across the district before the holiday last week. I enjoyed visiting the Surdex Corporation, which conducts hundreds of mapping projects across the United States. This family-owned business began as an aerial photography startup and over the span of 60 years has evolved into one of the most technologically advanced digital mapping firms in the photogrammetric industry. I witnessed demonstrations of its state-of-the-art mapping technology and saw its aircraft at the Spirit of St. Louis airport in Chesterfield!
On Tuesday, I visited Ross & Baruzzini, a business that provides consulting and design expertise to diverse industries. They recently won a huge multi-million dollar contract for a new airport in Mexico City. It was a pleasure to visit them in Webster Groves and discuss the project’s progress!

Our community is still shaken from the shooting last Monday at the Catholic Supply Store on Manchester Road. Located just a street over from my district office, the senseless actions of a coward hit very close to home. My deepest condolences to Jamie Schmidt’s family and all those impacted. These acts of violence have no place in our society.

Just a few weeks ago, the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh was targeted and eleven lives were lost. I along with hundreds of other community members attended a prayer vigil at the Jewish Community Center that week, and last Tuesday I had the chance to meet with leaders from the Jewish Community Relations Council to discuss my work to fight senseless gun crime, human trafficking, and genocide. I am especially proud to have supported the Fix NICS Act, which fixes our broken background check system and keeps guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals. I am also proud to champion the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Mass Atrocities Prevention Act to improve the United States’ efforts to prevent mass atrocity crimes. Anti-semitism is unacceptable, and this legislation will fight evil around the world.

￼  Ann Wagner Member of Congress

￼ 


  
Last week during Thanksgiving, we gave thanks for the many blessings we enjoy as Americans as we work to help those who do not know where they will find their next meal. I am thankful to live in the United States, where we enjoy unprecedented freedom, security, and prosperity, and where our Constitution enshrines our God-given rights, including the freedom to worship as we see fit. I’m also particularly thankful for our men and women in the armed services, especially those deployed into harm’s way and away from their families this holiday. We would not enjoy such security and freedom if it weren’t for the sacrifices of our troops and their families. My wife Jenny and I hope Hoosiers and all Americans, both at home and abroad, had a safe and happy Thanksgiving.
National Republican Senatorial Committee 
This month, my colleagues elected me to serve as chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the organization charged with supporting Republican Senators and Senate candidates nationwide. I look forward to bringing Indiana’s voice to the leadership table as we work to strengthen and protect our Majority and continue building on the Republican-led accomplishments of the last two years.
￼ 
Comprehensive Yemen and Saudi Arabia Legislation 
Earlier this month, I introduced bipartisan legislation to ensure effective Congressional oversight of U.S. policy on Yemen. We must use the leverage we have to steer all parties toward a peaceful end to the civil war in Yemen and the humanitarian crisis it has caused. Additionally, this legislation demands meaningful accountability for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Our national security interests and our humanitarian principles demand swift action. 
Hoosiers Deserve a Career, Not Just a Job 
To mark National Apprenticeship Week, I released a new video touting different career paths available to Hoosiers. During a visit to Gaylor Electric with U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta, we met with employees to discuss the important role of apprenticeships in addressing the skills gap and preparing Americans for jobs of the future. Apprenticeships allow our hardworking Hoosiers the opportunity of a career, not just a job.

Stomach Cancer Awareness Month Resolution in Honor of Matthew Tully 
Stomach cancer is the fifth most common type of cancer worldwide and one of the most difficult to detect in its early stages. The entire Indiana Congressional delegation this month came together to introduce a Stomach Cancer Awareness Month resolution in memory of Indy Star reporter and columnist Matthew Tully. Matt’s death was an enormous loss for Central Indiana. He used his column to shine a light on local problems and the people working to solve them. The least we can do is honor his memory by shining a light on this devastating disease.
The complete text of the bill can be found here. 
New Investments in Cleaner and More Efficient Coal Technology
Indiana’s coal producers provide affordable, reliable energy to homes and businesses throughout the Midwest. Last week, I announced new legislation to help ensure that this vital energy source is competing on a level playing field while also keeping up with advances in technology that can lead to cleaner and more efficient coal-fired power plants. My bill would expand eligibility for the Department of Energy’s (DOE) existing loan guarantee program to high efficiency, low emission generating coal plants, also known as HELE units. By broadening the eligibility for DOE’s loan program, the legislation aims to encourage reinvestment in coal technology.

Friend-  Over the past two years, the 115th Congress advanced a bold agenda that breathed life into our economy, made critical investments in restoring military readiness, strengthened career and technical education,  and directed resources to combat the opioid epidemic.  When the 116th Congress begins next year, it is critical that we not lose the progress we’ve made, especially when it comes to our military and economy. Until then, the 115th has a few weeks left in Washington to address outstanding legislative business.
In the remainder of the 115th Congress, which legislative proposals should Congress consider?

Dear Friend,  Comprehensive health coverage, and the peace of mind it brings, is fundamental. So I’m reaching out to ask – are you prepared to get covered for 2019?  If you’re one of the millions of Californians who doesn’t obtain coverage through your employer, Medi-Cal, or Medicare, Covered California offers a competitive range of plans from 11 different health insurance carriers. Whether you want to renew your current policy or sign up for a new health plan, Covered California empowers consumers to compare plans and find the one that best serves you and your family’s needs.  Open enrollment has already started and lasts until January 15. If you need coverage but aren’t sure how to sign up, you can visit www.coveredca.com/find-help/ or call 1-800-300-1506 to speak with a representative who can answer your questions. For health care starting on January 1, make sure you enroll by December 15 to prevent any lapse in coverage.  When you visit CoveredCA.com, you will be asked a series of questions to determine whether you qualify for financial aid or Medi-Cal coverage. Last year, 80% of Americans who purchased health insurance on the state exchanges qualified for financial assistance in the form of tax credits, and those tax credits are still available. Additionally, roughly 1.2 million Californians qualified for subsidies to help pay for their coverage, leading to an out of pocket cost that averages just $125 a month.  When the Affordable Care Act was enacted, California chose to develop and operate its own state exchange – Covered California – to ensure that as many Californians as possible could have access to affordable health care. Its mission was simple – to reduce the number of uninsured Californians, improve the quality of care, lower costs and reduce health disparities through a competitive marketplace that empowers consumers to choose the plan that is of best value to them.  Although health care costs continue to rise, Covered California has taken steps to protect consumers from the worst impacts and ensure costs rise more slowly. Additional steps will be needed to control costs in the future, but our state exchange is stable, and Californians will continue to have access to a range of good health care options.  Now’s the time to make sure you’re covered, and talk to your family and friends to make sure they know they have options too. Don’t miss out on your chance to get the care you and your family need, and let’s continue to work to make sure every American has access to quality, affordable health care.  Sincerely,
￼
Congressman Adam Schiff

Dear fellow South Carolinians,  Thank you for subscribing to my weekly e-newsletter, and please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.   Charleston Port Last week, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) announced $41.4 million for the Charleston Harbor Deepening Project in the Fiscal Year 19 Work Plan, which will allow for continued progress and further deepening of the harbor. This is great news! The Port of Charleston supports thousands of businesses and jobs across our great state — in fact, 1 out of every 11 jobs in the Palmetto State is port-related. I look forward to continuing to advocate for one of our most integral job producers in South Carolina. You can read more about the announcement here.   SCARC Annual Conference A week ago, I had the pleasure of attending the South Carolina Association of Regional Councils' annual conference. It was great to join other elected officials from across South Carolina & talk about being a public servant and building our communities through Opportunity Zones. ￼   SC Highway Patrol Graduation On Wednesday I Spoke to Classes 105 & 106 at the South Carolina Highway Patrol graduation. It was an honor to be among a group of public servants who are eager to defend and protect our communities in the Palmetto State. Congrats to all the graduates and their families, and I look forward to hearing of the great work you will do for our state! ￼   Small Business Saturday After a wonderful Thanksgiving shared with family and friends, I was happy to also celebrate Small Business Saturday this past weekend. Small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy- so I hope you shopped small as well! I was happy to stop by local Stack’s Nursery in Summerville to buy a Christmas wreath. Check out my final pick below!  ￼  ￼                                          ￼ 
Sincerely, ￼

11/26/18 16:18,Army Corps Announces Major Funding to Address Stamp Sands in Keweenaw Peninsula,"  
￼

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  Nov 26, 2018
CONTACT: James Hogge 231-640-9158


Army Corps Announces Major Funding to Continue Stamp Sand Project in Michigan's First District

Keweenaw County – The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers recently announced an additional $1 million in Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) funding for stamp sands dredging in the Keweenaw Peninsula. Congressman Bergman released the following statement:  ""This is another example of the positive impact the GLRI has in the First District of Michigan. I've worked with my colleagues in Congress and the Administration to ensure the GLRI remains fully funded, and this is a great instance of those dollars being used wisely. Focusing on stamp sand clean up around the Keweenaw Peninsula is critically important to the long term health of the Great Lakes,"" said Bergman.  In an earlier press release, the Army Corps stated, ""The award of these options will permit Petersen Companies, Inc. to dredge an additional 50,000 cubic yards of stamp sands from the ancient riverbed area north of Buffalo Reef known as the ‘trough’ in order to delay further sedimentation by the littoral drift of the stamp sands into the reef and the juvenile whitefish recruitment area south of the harbor. This brings the total estimated cubic yards to 157,500. This total is comprised of 27,500 cubic yards in and around the Grand Traverse Harbor area, and an additional 130,000 cubic yards of stamp sands from the trough. 
""Dredging is scheduled to begin during spring 2019 and complete during summer 2019.""

Good afternoon,   As health care enrollment is underway, I wanted to let you know about two ways Virginians can sign up right now for insurance for 2019:  
	1.	HealthCare.gov: From now until December 15th, you can compare plans and sign up for insurance through the Affordable Care Act at www.healthcare.gov. 
	2.	CoverVA.org: Nearly 400,000 Virginians who became eligible for health care coverage as a result of Medicaid expansion can enroll now. Visit www.coverva.org/expansion to see if you are eligible. 
Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, millions of people now have insurance, including hundreds of thousands of Virginians. I'm working in the Senate to protect that progress and also make improvements that increase your options for affordable coverage.  I hope you'll take the opportunity to make sure you and your loved ones are covered today.
Sincerely,

Dear Friend, 
With Fort Bliss to the West, Joint Base San Antonio to the East and Laughlin Air Force Base in between, our congressional district has a uniquely special relationship with our servicemembers, veterans and their families.  
It is a continuous source of pride to represent in Congress over 4,600 active-duty military and 45,000 military veterans across 29 counties and two time zones of TX-23.
November marks Military Family Appreciation Month, a time to honor the tremendous sacrifices made by the men and  women who choose to serve in our nation's military.
From the moment our men and women in uniform head off to train, they put their lives on the line to protect our nation's freedoms. 
No one bears the weight of this sacrifice more than their loved ones back home. 
Read more in this week's Hurd on the Hill column.

11/26/18 12:54,Update: USACE Includes $32 Million To Build NEW Lock In Sault Ste Marie,"  
￼

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  Nov 26, 2018
CONTACT: James Hogge 231-640-9158

UPDATE: Army Corps Work Plan Includes $32 Million To Build NEW Lock 

Last week Rep. Jack Bergman announced the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers FY19 work plan would include funding to begin construction on a new Poe-sized Lock in Sault Ste. Marie. This $32 Million allocation for FY19 will be used to complete design work and begin construction in Sault Ste. Marie after over 30 years of delay. 

The Army Corps has posted the work plan online and the Locks project can be found on page five. Additionally, the Army Corps issued a press release today highlighting the new funding for the Lock, which can be found HERE.

Rep. Bergman applauded the Trump Administration, his colleagues in the House and Senate, as well as the Army Corps of Engineers for working together to make a new Lock a reality. The full release from Wednesday can be found below.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Washington -Today, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers submitted to Congress its updated FY19 work plan, which includes funding for construction of a new Poe-sized lock at the Soo Locks complex. Congressman Jack Bergman released the following statement in response: 

""This is great news for Michigan’s First District, the Great Lakes region, and the entire U.S. economy, which relies on the Soo Locks. I'm proud of the progress we’ve made to finally break ground on a project that’s been delayed for decades. I also applaud the Trump Administration for acknowledging the importance of a new Lock, and for working with the House, Senate, and Great Lakes industries to make construction of a new Lock in Sault Ste. Marie a reality. This new construction funding, coupled with the $57 million allocated in FY18 for modernization of the Poe, is a great next step. I’m looking forward to working with my colleagues to continue getting the job done for northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula.""

Earlier this year, Congressman Jack Bergman joined Rep. John Moolenaar, and Rep. Paul Mitchell, leading a letter requesting new money be allocated towards the construction of a new lock. The text of that letter can be found here.

Wicker Touts the Value of Apprenticeships
On-the-Job Training Opportunities Are a Win-Win for Employees, Employers
An apprenticeship offers professional experience that can have a lasting impact on an individual’s career.  It is no wonder that more than half a million Americans today are beginning their careers – or starting new ones – in these hands-on, earn-as-you-learn programs.
Consider these encouraging statistics reported by the Department of Labor: Nine out of 10 apprentices are hired after finishing their programs. The starting salaries for former apprentices average $60,000, and these workers will bring in an estimated $300,000 more in earnings throughout their careers than workers who did not complete an apprenticeship program.
Employers also stand to benefit from putting valuable time and resources toward programs that train workers in specialized skills.  A 2016 report by the Department of Commerce and Case Western Reserve University revealed how apprenticeships were good for the company’s bottom line.  In some of the companies studied, the authors found 40 and 50 percent returns on funds invested in apprentice programs.  In the end, companies not only had employees ready and capable of meeting the demands of the job but also better productivity and employee retention.
A Solution for the Skills Gap
President Trump continues to praise the value of on-the-job training, issuing a proclamation for National Apprenticeship Week earlier this month.  Last year, he created the Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion, bringing together business executives, educators, public officials, and association leaders to identify ways to increase the training opportunities available to Americans.
I agree with the President that we need to do more to address the skills gap that continues to persist in America’s labor market.  Although the number of apprenticeship programs has grown significantly in recent years, there are still not enough workers properly trained for millions of unfilled U.S. jobs – many in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.
I am hopeful that the “Apprenticeship Enhancement Act” I introduced in the Senate last year will help change this situation.  If passed, it would expedite the process that companies go through when registering or updating their apprenticeship program with the Department of Labor.  By easing current regulatory hurdles, the bill would also fulfill one of the policy directives in the President’s executive order to add more apprenticeships across U.S. industries.
ARC Grant Will Help Put Mississippians in Technical Careers
Mississippians are already working to make sure our state’s students and young adults have the education and training needed for a technical job.  At Itawamba Community College in October, I helped announce an Appalachian Regional Commission grant that will be used for this purpose. 
The grant will help support a public-private initiative led by the Skills Foundation known as “Get on the Grid.”  Its goal is to raise awareness among prospective workers about the technical career paths that are right for them.  Sometimes the training for these skilled jobs does not require a four-year degree.  Sometimes this training is best attained through a two-year community college program or an apprenticeship.  “Get on the Grid” offers a virtual guidance counselor that can help with these decisions and meet the workforce demands of our state’s leading industries. 
Our state’s workforce has helped make Mississippi a desirable place for business investment.  This reputation should continue as the labor market evolves with the needs of a 21st-century economy.  Apprenticeships will ensure Mississippians have the skills to stay competitive.

Friends, 
 
Christmas season officially kicked off in our nation’s capital last week when President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump received the 2018 White House Christmas tree. This year’s tree, standing nearly 20 feet tall, comes from right outside our backyard in Newland, North Carolina! The tree was handpicked from Larry Smith's Mountain Top Fraser Fir, making it the thirteenth tree from the Tar Heel state to be displayed in the White House. 

I am excited for everyone to see a beautiful tree from the Old North State in the People’s House for Christmas. With the kids out of school and our nation’s capital decorated for Christmas, now would be a great time to plan a trip. If you are planning to travel to D.C. for the holidays, my office can help set you up with tours of Washington’s must see attractions.

You can visit my website at https://hudson.house.gov/washington-dc-visitors/ or call my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-3715 for more information. Take a look at the list below to see how we can help make your trip memorable and assist you with tour requests.
 





















	•	The U.S. Capitol  – The U.S. Capitol is a monument, a working office building, and one of the most recognizable symbols of representative democracy in the world. My office has guided thousands of North Carolinians on tours of the U.S. Capitol. These congressional staff led tours are available for Eighth District constituents. 
	•	The White House – Requests for White House tours must be submitted through your Representative or Senator. Because the White House is a popular tour destination and it receives more requests than any other location in D.C., White House tour requests typically need to be submitted 3-6 months in advance, with 3 weeks being the minimum requirement. I’d suggest you submit the necessary security information as soon as you know you’re interested. 
	•	The Bureau of Engraving and Printing – At the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, you’ll learn all about U.S. paper currency and see money being printed! 
	•	The Library of Congress – The Library of Congress is the world’s largest and most open research library. The architecture and art are incredible, and there is a lot to learn. 
	•	The Kennedy Center – Take a tour of the Kennedy Center to learn why this national cultural center was established, as well as see the Hall of Nations, the main theaters, and dozens of works of art given to the center. 
These are great locations for children and families to learn more about our nation’s heritage, free of charge. With museums on every corner, there are many which don’t require tickets. The Smithsonian Institution – which is made up of 17 museums, galleries and a zoo - offers a unique look at history, science and culture throughout the world. Arlington National Cemetery and the changing of the guard ceremony is a humbling experience to see the sacrifice our soldiers have made to keep us safe.

No matter where you go this holiday season to be with loved ones, I hope you will join me in remembering our fellow Americans who are serving in uniform, our veterans and their families. We thank you and are keeping you in our prayers.
 
 
Until next week,
￼
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)

Happy Thanksgiving
￼  
On Thanksgiving Day, I joined local residents in Puerto Rico along with volunteers at the Salvation Army to serve Thanksgiving dinner to local residents in need, who are still struggling as a result of the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria. We then visited an Adult Rehabilitation Center, a Homeless Shelter, and La Casa de Todos, “The House of All” orphanage and battered women shelter to spend time with those in need. 
From our family to yours, we send you our warm wishes from home to home and from heart to heart. I hope the day served as a beautiful reminder of the wonderful things in life, a time to remember and to embrace all those who enrich our lives. God bless each and every one of you in our community.  
Reconstruction in Puerto Rico
￼  
During my return visit to Puerto Rico, one year after Hurricane Maria, I met with FEMA Federal Emergency Management Agency officials at the Caribbean Area Division facility, which is responsible for emergency management in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This facility serves as a permanent FEMA presence in an area vulnerable for hurricanes and flooding and at risk for earthquakes/tsunamis. 
While in Dorado, I visited a VALOR home, which was a rebuilt house after the storm. Through the Voluntary Agencies Leading and Organizing Repair (VALOR) program, FEMA provides supplies and materials to different voluntary organizations to support essential, temporary repairs that allows survivors to move back to their homes. After the hurricane, more than 166,000 homes needed repair or reconstruction. 
Learn more about the actions I've taken to assist Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria HERE. 
Remembering Holodomor
￼  
This month, we remember the victims of Holodomor, the famine-genocide of the Ukrainian People in 1932-1933. Millions of people were starved to death and ruthlessly tortured by the former Soviet Union to break the nation’s resistance to communist occupation. The lessons of the Ukrainian Famine remain poignant as we continue to confront human rights abuses and support the self-determination of people around the world. We reaffirm that truth will prevail over those who seek to deny the genocide and the horrors of the Holodomor. 
As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I’ve supported and cosponsored H.Res.931, to honor the 85th anniversary of the Ukrainian Famine as a reminder of repressive Soviet policies against the people of Ukraine. Watch my remarks HERE.

Completing My 105-County Kansas Listening Tour This Congress 
Throughout this Congress, I have crisscrossed the 82,000+ square miles of our state, holding townhall meetings in all 105 Kansas counties as part of my Kansas Listening Tour. These meetings take me to every county in Kansas every two years. On Monday, I brought this listening tour to a close with an Allen County townhall meeting in Moran, Kansas.

 ￼ 

One of the highlights of visiting every county in our state, is meeting people in every corner and getting to witness the beauty that is Kansas. In almost all of those places, I often find myself thinking, “I could live here.” Everywhere I’ve been, I’ve experienced Kansas kindness.
 
But in almost every meeting throughout this listening tour, Kansans have also acknowledged the contentious nature of politics today, and I felt this tension during many of my Listening Tour stops. From nationally syndicated townhalls in Palco and Lenexa where Kansans were debating issues for a national audience to smaller meetings all across the state, I met Kansans in every county who both agreed and disagreed with me about the issues most important to them. However, over these 105 townhall meetings – and the 1,312 townhall meetings I’ve held throughout my time in Congress – one thing always remains the same: the Kansans I meet with care deeply about our state and the future of our nation.
 
I want to thank the thousands of Kansans who took the time to attend my Kansas Listening Tours and share their thoughts, concerns and ideas with me this Congress. These important townhall meetings and the many conversations we have during them continue to shape the work I am privileged do in Washington, D.C.
 
To watch a recap of my Kansas Listening Tour and my townhall meeting in Moran, click here.
    

Honored to Serve You in Washington
It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard. 
Please let me know how I can be of assistance. You can contact me by email by clicking here. You can also click here to contact me through one of my Kansas offices or my Washington, D.C., office.
Very truly yours, Jerry

I hope each of you had a wonderful, blessed Thanksgiving Day filled with friends, family, and food!
I am very blessed that I was able to be home in Kansas with my family to celebrate and give thanks. As we enter into the holiday season, let us keep in mind those who are unable to be with their families, especially our servicemen and women who work each day to keep Americans and our freedoms safe.

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend,

Leah and I hope you had a Happy Thanksgiving. As a tradition in our home, when we gather with family and friends before celebrating, we each say what we are thankful for. In sharing this tradition with all of you, this Thanksgiving we are thankful for our soldiers, first responders, and citizens who work tirelessly to serve our communities. I am very thankful for all of those who are away from their families this holiday season and fighting for our freedom. May God bless them and may God bless each of you and your families.

Dredging Port Panama City
This week, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE) announced the inclusion of the Port Panama City dredging project in their 2019 Work Plan. The dredging will deepen the East Channel to 36 feet and expand the opportunities for larger vessels to unload large amounts of cargo in Panama City. Ensuring our waterways are accessible to ships and bulk vessels is critical to local infrastructure and the economy in Bay County. In the wake of Hurricane Michael it is even more important that we send the message that Panama City is open for business. By deepening the East Channel, we are investing in the future of the area for decades to come.

Dear Friends, 
On Tuesday, November 27th and Thursday, November 29th, I’ll be holding Tele-Town Hall Meetings at 6:45 p.m. PST for my constituents in San Mateo County and Santa Cruz County, respectively. These meetings provide the opportunity for constituents to talk to me directly about any issue and ask any question. Constituents have consistently told me how valuable they think these Tele-Town Hall Meetings are, and I certainly draw a great deal from each one as well. 
In the past you’ve received a call from me inviting you to participate and I will continue to do this. We’ve added a new feature which enables constituents to listen and submit written questions via live webstream.  
The live webstream will be available at all future Tele-Town Hall Meetings and I’m inviting you to subscribe to my webstream channel so you’ll know in advance when they’re scheduled. 
By following the link below, you will be brought to my webstream channel. Scheduled Tele-Town Hall Meetings, including the meetings scheduled for November 27th and 29th, will be posted there to tune in live. And should you miss the live broadcast, recordings are posted to the webstream channel after they occur.

Thanksgiving in SC-07 
 
 
I hope y'all had a great Thanksgiving! I want to highlight a few of the ways our community came together to give thanks over the past week. Local churches providing Thanksgiving meals to those in need, the Myrtle Beach Inn hosting families who are not yet back in their homes after Hurricane Florence, and a local couple working overtime to put on the Bucksport Thanksgiving Parade are just a few examples of people helping their neighbors and uplifting our community. I am so proud to represent you and thankful to be a part of our wonderful community!

South Carolina's Economic Boom
 
 
The unemployment rate is at a record low in ten states across the country, including in South Carolina! The unemployment rate in South Carolina held at 3.3% last month with a record 2.2 million people working! This didn't happen by accident. It is the result of conservative policies: lower taxes, less regulation, and less government intrusion. I will continue working at both the federal and local level to grow our economy and create opportunity!

FEMA Application Deadline Approaching
 
 
As our community continues to recover from Hurricane Florence, I will keep you updated with information from FEMA that may be helpful to you and your family during this process. 

Deadline Approaching: The FEMA deadline to apply for disaster assistance for damage and losses from Hurricane Florence has been extended to Wednesday, December 5th.You won't know if you are eligible for funds unless you apply, so I encourage you to do so! Please share this information with anyone you think may need assistance.

Disaster Recovery Center Closures and Hours: As traffic at Disaster Recovery Centers slows down, some of the centers are closing. There are still DRCs open across the Seventh District where you can receive help filling out your disaster assistance application until December 5th. Find the closest center to you here.

Friends,
I hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving. This year, I am thankful for my family and for the brave men and women serving our country around the world. I am also thankful for the opportunity to serve the great people of Northeast Ohio in Congress. I hope you were able to enjoy a great meal surrounded by family and friends.

Great Lakes Restoration Initiative 
This week, along with my colleague Representative Sandy Levin, I led a bipartisan letter signed by over forty other Members of Congress urging the Administration to request robust funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) in the Fiscal Year 2020 budget proposal.
As I have said many times, the Great Lakes are a national treasure. Our nation depends on the lakes as a mode of transportation and shipping and a source of drinking water for the region, not to mention the recreational benefits that draw millions of visitors annually. We must protect this critical resource. The GLRI projects combat invasive species like Asian carp, reduce harmful algal blooms and protect natural habitats. 
The President's 2018 budget proposal would have eliminated funding for the program and the President proposed cutting the program's 2019 budget by ninety percent. This is unacceptable. After leading a bipartisan effort to secure the necessary funding, the House approved GLRI funding at the full, $300 million level. I am proud to lead yet another effort to secure full funding for the GLRI. 
￼
￼
 
A great example of a GLRI project underway in Northeast Ohio is in our very own Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Through funding from the GLRI, the Army Corps of Engineers is cleaning up the clogged Stanford Run tributary in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Cleaning this tributary will improve the overall health of the Cuyahoga River, which feeds into Lake Erie.
These restoration projects in Northeast Ohio that help us protect and preserve the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie and would not be possible without the GLRI. This is another reason why I will continue to lead the fight in Congress to ensure the program is fully funded at $300 million annually. 
Protecting Our Drinking Water
I am pleased to share that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Buffalo District awarded a $3.4 million contract to Huffman Equipment Rental in Eastlake. This funding will be used to create a 600-foot revetment along the Lake Erie shoreline that will protect the Lake County Raw Water Pump Station. Without this structure, the station would soon be in danger of failure due to the severe erosion of the shoreline.
I was proud to support this critical infrastructure project and push for the necessary funds to get it across the finish line. This contract demonstrates the ability for federal and local agencies to come together and accomplish important work that will benefit our communities in Northeast Ohio that depend on the Raw Water Pump Station for their drinking water. I appreciate the Army Corps for working with me to get this project done.
Dave

A Thankful Reflection
This week, many of us were able to join with our family and friends to remember memories and give thanks for the many blessings God has bestowed upon each of us. As a nation, we are truly blessed. While we certainly face many challenges and difficulties, we must always recognize and appreciate the freedoms, liberties, and opportunities we have because we live in America. 
￼
As your representative, I am committed to working with President Trump to advance our Texas values that we all hold so dear, and I am forever grateful for the opportunity to serve you in Congress and help make America a stronger, more secure, and prosperous place. 
I-69 Alliance Annual Meeting
￼
The I-69 Alliance is a wonderful partnership doing great things to support commerce and the economy in Texas. I appreciate the opportunity to address their annual meeting on Monday as keynote speaker. Serving on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee provides me a great opportunity to make policy decisions that strengthen Texas’s infrastructure, and I look forward to helping write our next highway bill in 2019.

A Thankful Reflection (cont'd)

We were blessed to have the entire family home this week as we celebrated Thanksgiving. I was especially happy to see my brothers Doug (left) and Philip (middle).

Welcome to Congress
I am proud that two of my new Congressional colleagues from Texas are also veterans. Van Taylor and Dan Crenshaw served our nation with honor, and their military experience will benefit them and their constituents greatly in Washington.

Walker Weekly Report
I wish this week you found rest and reflection in the many ways we have been blessed as a community and as a nation. In his original Thanksgiving proclamation in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln said that our blessings should be “solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American People.”  Celebrating America’s oldest tradition, my hope is that we kept the men and women of our Armed Forces around the world in your thoughts for their sacrifice and valor.
This week, we honored our Community Hero of the Month and shared updates on FEMA recovery in North Carolina.
Keep reading for the full update. Have a blessed week.

HIGHLIGHTS
￼
Honoring Rockingham County’s Amy Sparks-Martin as Community Hero of the Month for Hurricane Relief Service
I am proud to name Amy Sparks-Martin as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for November 2018.
Amy is a native of Stoneville and owns Debbie’s Restaurant along with her father, Dennis Sparks. She has demonstrated a lifelong commitment to serving others, most recently assisting the Red Cross and providing over 20,000 meals to hurricane evacuees in Winston-Salem. Whenever there is a natural disaster in the region, Amy and her restaurant are there to cater meals for energy crews, DOT personnel, and emergency personnel as they work through the difficult weather. This is in addition to community service such as serving as President of the PTA at both local elementary and middle schools, and always finding a way to help family, friends, and the community when there is a need.     
When I learned about Amy and her immediate response to those in need, I realized that this is just the type of person that we want to honor with this award. Amy is an unsung hero who is there with a helping hand, a hot meal, and an encouraging smile when individuals are facing adversity.  She embodies the ideal that one person can truly make a difference in their community and beyond.

“We must find time to stop and thank the people who make a difference in our lives.”             ― John F. Kennedy 
  
Dear Friend, 
I hope you had the opportunity over this holiday weekend to enjoy quality time with those in your life for whom you are most grateful.  I had the pleasure of having all four of my sons home with my wife and I last week, and we took full advantage of the rare opportunity to make new memories together as a family.   As we spent time reflecting upon all the many blessings in our lives, the continued ability to serve others emerged as a common theme.  I’d like to offer each of you my heartfelt thanks for entrusting me with the privilege of serving as your voice in Washington, DC for another term.  I promise I will do everything within my power to make you proud of my service to you and our community.  Additionally, I am extremely thankful for the men and women who are currently serving our country, and whose deployment causes them to be separated from their friends and family during this holiday season.  Their service and sacrifice enables us to freely enjoy this special time of year. 
I also spent some time contemplating the people who have truly made a positive impact in my life, and my gratitude for their influence.  I must say that while I have had the good fortune to be surrounded by many people who have helped mold me into who I am today including family, teachers, friends, religious leaders and other public servants, there has been no greater influence (professional or personal) than the mentorship I received from my parents.  Their unique bond and unwavering commitment to serving others taught me about the kind of husband, father and leader I would strive to become.  They continue to serve as an example as they support one another through the challenges that accompany the process of aging.  I appreciated the opportunity to celebrate the gift they have shared with me and so many others while expressing my gratitude to them over the holiday weekend.  
Honoring and Advocating for Those Who Have Served Our Nation 
While I did spend a good portion of last week enjoying family time, I had the opportunity to meet with a local Veteran who has encountered difficulty with the VA.  This local news story outlines disturbing reports about the quality of care that was delivered, and my efforts to advocate on his behalf.  I am glad that the new administrator of the hospital has called for an independent investigation into this matter, and I will continue to carefully monitor this case in order to ensure that this Veteran receives the care he deserves.  If you or someone you know is having difficulty with the VA or any federal agency, please contact my office at 727-232-2921 to speak with one of our excellent case workers.  We are here to help and look forward to working on your behalf.  
￼ 
Creating an Economy that is Working for All Americans 
We have been working very hard over the past two years to foster an economic environment in which all Americans can achieve financial prosperity.   This has been accomplished through historic tax cuts for middle class Americans and small businesses while removing unnecessary and duplicative regulation.  New reports continue to demonstrate that our efforts are yielding tremendous success, especially for Floridians.  For example, the Department of Commerce  recently announced that in 17 states, the economy grew at an annual rate of 4 percent or better in the second quarter of this year.  Florida’s GDP grew by 4.5% during this period.  Our state also has an impressive unemployment rate of 3.4%.   More people are engaged in the workforce, and wages are starting to rise due to the compression within the job market that accompanies low unemployment.  Businesses are having to compete for quality employees, which typically translates into more competitive compensation.  We must remain committed to the policies that are enabling this economic success.
Serving Constituents 
The coming weeks will be busy as we wrap up this term of Congress; however, I want to remind you that my staff and I are always here to serve you.  If your family is planning a visit to Washington, D.C., please let us know so that we can arrange tours and offer guidance on how your trip can be optimized.  We are also accepting invitations for Coffee with your Congressman.  During these events, I provide a legislative update to residents throughout the district.  I’m bring the coffee and sit with you and your neighbors to discuss ideas you may have for legislation or answer questions about the issues that matter most to you. Additionally, as noted above, our casework team is available to assist with anyone having a problem with a federal agency.  We look forward to hearing from you!
Thank you for reading this week’s update. Feel free to share this e-newsletter with friends and encourage them to sign up! Remember, you can always stay in touch with me via email, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 

Sincerely,
￼

Congressman Smith's E-news: November 24, 2018 
￼  I recently recognized trusted journalist Kevin Mooney of Scottsbluff on the House floor for his 34 years of service to western Nebraska and congratulated him on his retirement from KNEB. 
 National Family Week 
Each November, we celebrate National Family Week to reflect on the importance of strong families in our communities. Whether through biological child birth, adoption, or foster care, children need families to provide the care and support necessary to become healthy and productive adults. It has been a cornerstone of my tenure in office to support federal policies which encourage the development of strong families.   One such measure is the Family First Prevention Services Act, which was advanced by the Human Resources Subcommittee, which I chair, and signed into law by President Trump earlier this year. Its purpose is to keep children in their homes at every possible opportunity and to provide the support foster families need to step in when they cannot. Whether through mental health and substance abuse treatment or transition assistance for children leaving foster care and becoming self-sufficient, this bill enjoyed broad, bipartisan support and I was happy to help pass it.   During the month of June, the House passed more than 70 bills to combat the growing opioid epidemic in our country, many of which were advanced by the Ways and Means Committee of which I am a member. Substance abuse is a major cause in the weakening and dissolution of healthy families, and this legislative package seeks to stem these break-ups through better doctor-patient educational practices, expanded access to opioid alternatives, and steps to interrupt the supply of elicit opioids.   On the local level, my office participates in a program known as Angels in Adoption to recognize the sacrifices of great Americans across our country to the healthy development of our children. This year, we recognized Linda Shepard and Charles Walker of Burwell who have welcomed more than 50 children into their home over the years through foster care and adoption.   Their story is one that warms my heart and serves as a constant reminder of the endless generosity and love our fellow Americans provide each and every day to children in need. Nominations for the 2019 Angels in Adoption program have not yet opened, but applications are typically due in June and honorees announced in August. If you know of someone in your local community who is deserving of this recognition, please reach out to my office for details.   Finally, strong families need jobs to provide economic support and encourage self-sufficiency. Nearly a year has passed since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, which has helped to stimulate economic growth through lower taxes and provide a boost to families by doubling the child tax credit. Beginning in 2018, families with children will receive a substantial increase in take-home pay. Americans know better how to spend their hard-earned dollars than bureaucrats in Washington and they should be empowered to do so at every opportunity.   Whether through enhanced support for biological, adoptive, or foster families, renewed efforts at substance abuse prevention, or increased economic growth and job creation, I’m proud to have supported these initiatives to strengthen our communities. National Family week is a great reminder of the all-important role of strong and stable families in the development of our children and the long-term health of our nation.

November 24, 2018 
Dear Friends,   As we celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday this weekend, it's important that we take some time to reflect on the things that we're most grateful for and that deserve our attention in an increasingly hectic and confusing world.
That is why I am sharing with you my reading picks for this week. When we empower ourselves to seek out the truth with verified, factual reporting, we are better equipped to make thoughtful decisions and take meaningful action. Whether that action is dedicated to establishing a better, healthier environment for our planet; providing those who have served our country with the support they need and deserve; or working to create a stronger, more representative government that values and respects facts and justice -- as long as we work together we have the power to effect positive change.   
Happy reading and all the best,   ￼

‘Nothing on this page is real’: How lies become truth in online America
By Eli Saslow, The Washington Post
￼
NORTH WATERBORO, Maine — The only light in the house came from the glow of three computer monitors, and Christopher Blair, 46, sat down at a keyboard and started to type. His wife had left for work and his children were on their way to school, but waiting online was his other community, an unreality where nothing was exactly as it seemed. He logged onto his website and began to invent his first news story of the day.
“BREAKING,” he wrote, pecking out each letter with his index fingers as he considered the possibilities. Maybe he would announce that Hillary Clinton had died during a secret overseas mission to smuggle more refugees into America. Maybe he would award President Trump the Nobel Peace Prize for his courage in denying climate change.
A new message popped onto Blair’s screen from a friend who helped with his website. “What viral insanity should we spread this morning?” the friend asked. 
“The more extreme we become, the more people believe it,” Blair replied.

Love’s Road Home
￼
Ashley Volk waited for Sam Siatta to return from Afghanistan. She couldn’t have seen the detours ahead. But “she kept on fighting, for him and for them.”
By C. J. Chivers, The New York Times
The engagement began as notification more than proposal. 
Samuel J. Siatta was an inmate in the Shawnee Correctional Center, a state penitentiary in southern Illinois, serving a six-year sentence for a home invasion in which he had struck another man with a frying pan. Ashley Volk was his off-again, on-again girlfriend since the sixth grade. It was early 2016. She had driven six hours to visit him between bartending shifts. 
The two faced each other across a cafeteria table. He rested his tattooed arms on top. She noticed something unusual: a loop of blue prison-safe dental floss on the ring finger of his left hand. She had not seen this before. 
“What’s that?” she asked. 
That, he answered, was his hope. “It’s a reminder that when I get out of here we’re going to have a future, and I’m going to marry you, and we’ll have a real life,” he said. 
Joy flashed through her, followed by dread.

How Extreme Weather Is Shrinking the Planet
With wildfires, heat waves, and rising sea levels, large tracts of the earth are at risk of becoming uninhabitable. But the fossil-fuel industry continues its assault on the facts.
By Bill McKibben, The New Yorker
Thirty years ago, this magazine published “The End of Nature,” a long article about what we then called the greenhouse effect. I was in my twenties when I wrote it, and out on an intellectual limb: climate science was still young. But the data were persuasive, and freighted with sadness. We were spewing so much carbon into the atmosphere that nature was no longer a force beyond our influence—and humanity, with its capacity for industry and heedlessness, had come to affect every cubic metre of the planet’s air, every inch of its surface, every drop of its water. Scientists underlined this notion a decade later when they began referring to our era as the Anthropocene, the world made by man.
I was frightened by my reporting, but, at the time, it seemed likely that we’d try as a society to prevent the worst from happening. In 1988, George H. W. Bush, running for President, promised that he would fight “the greenhouse effect with the White House effect.” He did not, nor did his successors, nor did their peers in seats of power around the world, and so in the intervening decades what was a theoretical threat has become a fierce daily reality.   To read the complete New Yorker article, please click here.

Starting something new can be challenging and intimidating, but when it’s a small business the stakes are high with your entire livelihood on the line. With this Saturday being Small Business Saturday and November being National Entrepreneurship Month, I want to take the opportunity to celebrate these job creators. The entrepreneurs who take the risk to start a business or a farm, armed only with fresh ideas and hard work, drive the economy and embody the best of the American spirit...KEEP READING HERE 


WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH

￼
I hope you and your family had a wonderful Thanksgiving! My favorite part of Thanksgiving is the opportunity to reflect and count our blessings - and as Americans we have much to be thankful for.
￼

It was great to see Midshipman 2nd Class Albert Femmer speak to students in Farmington on his Thanksgiving break from the U.S. Naval Academy. I had the pleasure of nominating him for the Academy in 2016. It's one of the great honors of my job to nominate our area's best and brightest students to attend the service academies. If you know a student interested in learning more about the process, you can find out more here.

￼
Good luck to the Hayti High School football team, who is taking on Westran today in the Class 1 semifinals! The winner will advance to the Class 1 state championship game on December 1st. We're rooting for you, Indians!
￼
Can you let me know what priorities you'd like to see Congress focus on moving forward?

Weekly Review




November 19

Birthright Citizenship: Our political system was built on educated debate, yet today certain topics are so sensitive that they can hardly be touched in polite company. Verbal walls go up (probably not the right analogy), people become dismissive, and there’s little middle ground to be found in the debate whether in Washington or at home.
Immigration is one of those topics. During the midterm elections, the issue of birthright citizenship came up, and I want to offer a bit of background on the subject given the fact that this issue is bound to be further debated in the next Congress.
When people discuss birthright citizenship, it often comes based on disputed meanings of our Constitution’s 14th Amendment. It reads, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.”
The key difference between the two sides is based on how one interprets “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.”
The so-called “inclusive” interpretation of this clause is that to be “subject to jurisdiction” simply means to be subject to US laws. Everyone on U.S. soil, including both legal and illegal immigrants, is required to follow the law. Some do not, of course, but that doesn’t mean they can’t be held accountable. This reading would only exclude two minor groups from automatically obtaining citizenship upon birth: the children of foreign diplomats and some Native Americans, although the latter have had citizenship rights since 1924.
On the other hand, there is also what some describe as the “narrow” interpretation. Click here to read more.

Passenger Drones & Supersonic Travel: I’ll have thoughts on Black Friday on Black Friday, but for now, I wanted to show below what I think would be a beyond cool Christmas present! 

The image and video below were shown in last week’s USA Today and highlight the fact that the Dubai Police Department is scheduled to patrol on hoverbikes by 2020. That’s incredible…little more than a year away, people riding on vehicles that would have seemed science fiction just a few years ago. 

They highlight how fast drone technology will be changing our lives and underscore how fast technology will change travel. As you might know, I had an amendment that would end the ban on supersonic flight testing and travel that was adopted as part of the 2018 FAA Bill and was signed into law in September. 

Supersonic travel will change the way that we think about time and distance around the world. Things like the hoverbike will change the way that we think about a whole host of more local travel requirements and lead to amazing technological jumps over the years ahead. 

I’ll have more thoughts on this, but for now, we can all keep it on our Christmas wish list!

Happy Thanksgiving: Happy Thanksgiving!
...and remember the ways in which we indeed should…
The pilgrims, so many years ago, began this tradition of Thanksgiving for the blessings they enjoyed…and it’s a remarkably special holiday for the way it’s just about giving thanks.
That means to God above. It means to family and friends. It means to those who’ve sacrificed on our behalf so that we can enjoy the fruits of their labors given the country that we live in. It means thanks for the First Amendment and the ability to speak our minds as we can for both the things that we like and those that we don’t. And I could go on with a thousand other things that I should be thankful for and each one of us can be thankful for.
It’s also a time of tradition. I don’t know yours, but I know for me and our family, it’s always revolved around the farm and the different outdoor activities that come with it. So on this day, know that my prayer is with you as you hopefully are able to make it a point to enjoy Thanksgiving and will, for just a second, on life’s blessings.

Black Friday: One of the interesting things about the inflection point I’m now at in life is that you find yourself packing a lot. I’m moving boxes of things from Washington back to Charleston, and I’m moving boxes, desks, and more from Charleston back to the farm. It’s amazing how things accumulate, and as a consequence, you find yourself loading up yesterday’s purchases and heading to Goodwill.
For me, it’s been yet another poignant reminder of how little things matter. Indeed, the only things that have lasting meaning in this life are the things we can’t see, touch, or feel…love, kindness, generosity. What the Bible calls the Fruits of the Spirit is indeed a chronology that can’t be touched or felt but have real meaning.
Which brings me to today, which kicks off the shopping madness that is Black Friday. In fact, it started yesterday! During this weekend period, an astounding 174 million Americans will head to retailers across the country. That’s last year’s number, so expect it to be north of 174 million, and to put this number into context, that’s more than half of our nation’s entire population.
Online shopping has brought the mall into our home, where people can now spend the holidays chasing deals on their computer. Last year on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday, a combined total of $7.9 billion worth of online sales were made...that’s up 17.9 % from 2016. Of all this shopping, $5.03 billion was spent on Thanksgiving Day itself and $2.87 billion on Black Friday.
Under the category of really strange Black Friday trivia, since 2006 alone, 10 people have died and 109 have been injured from fighting over coveted deals.
The long and short of what I’m saying here is that Thanksgiving is a day that, I think, brings out the best in all of us, given the way that it’s a day typically built around family and friends and the larger ideal of thankfulness.
If we don’t watch out, Black Friday can represent some very different things. No matter our good intentions in getting gifts for others, the purchase of goods can never equal the giving of time to those that we love and care about. In any case, I was just struck by the numbers on Black Friday, as I’ve been struck by the things that I’ve been giving away here lately as I try and consolidate a number of offices and living spaces to one.

Congressional Report

Dear Friends, 
This week I attended various meetings and events with different individuals and organizations, including the renaming of the George P. Kazen Federal Building and United States Courthouse in Laredo and a grant announcement for the La Salle County Fire Station in Cotulla. 

In the district, my staff attended a presentation of Library of Congress books to the Lamar Bruni Vergara Library in El Cenizo and the Hidalgo County Courthouse Groundbreaking Ceremony in Edinburg. 

I have also included a video from the U.S. Small Business Administration in honor of Small Business Saturday being this weekend. 

As always, please contact one of my offices if you need assistance with any federal agency.



American Humane Thanksgiving Table Event
￼

On Thursday, November 15, I attended the Humane Bond Caucus and American Humane Thanksgiving Table Hill event where I joined other congressional leaders, top figures in farm animal welfare, individual farmers, and leaders of major organizations in food production to outline the importance of demonstrably humane agriculture.


Renaming of Federal Courthouse in Laredo
￼

On Monday, November 19, Senator John Cornyn and I, along with the Laredo community, recognized Judge George P. Kazen for his commitment to the justice system and his service to our country, as we officially announced the renaming of the George P. Kazen Federal Building and United States Courthouse in Laredo. Judge Kazen was nominated in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter to serve as a U.S. District Court Judge for the Southern District of Texas, a position he held for 39 years. 


La Salle County FEMA-SAFER Grant Award Ceremony
￼

On Monday, November 19,  I visited the La Salle County Fire Rescue Department alongside U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) and U.S. Representative Will Hurd (TX-23), to announce a $1.6 million federal grant to increase staffing at the fire department. La Salle Fire Rescue is among our nation’s finest first responders. These are brave men and women are trained professionals who deserve adequate assistance in their hiring and recruitment processes. This funding will have a significant impact on our community and help keep our residents protected from fire-related emergencies.


El Cenizo Library of Congress Book Drop 
￼

On Wednesday, November 14, my Outreach Coordinator for La Salle, Webb, and Zapata Counties, Francis Atwell, delivered 63 Library of Congress books to the Lamar Bruni Vergara El Cenizo Library in El Cenizo, TX. The books provided are children’s and educational books that will be added to the library’s collection. Pictured are Library Coordinator Judy Varela and Outreach Coordinator Francis Atwell.

￼

On Thursday November 15, my Outreach Coordinator for Atascosa, Bexar, McMullen and Wilson counties Gilbert Lafuente met with Jimsi Kuborn, the new Excecutive Director of the Converse Economic Development Corporation (CEDC), to get briefed on the services offered by our office, and discussed continued partnerships to assist the city’s economic development plan. Pictured from left are Outreach Coordinator Gilbert Lafuente and CEDC Executive Director Jimsi Kuborn. 


Hidalgo County Courthouse Ground Breaking Ceremony 
￼

On Friday, November 16, my Outreach Coordinator for Hidalgo and Starr counties Nichole Hernandez attended the Groundbreaking Ceremony for the new Hidalgo County Courthouse, which is set to open in 2021 in Edinburg.

On my weekly ""Capitol Hill Report,"" I spoke with Nikki Thunder of KCHE Radio in Cherokee and Ty Rushing of the N'West Iowa Review about trade, small business and the Senate Finance Committee chairmanship.
Q&A: First Step Act
Q. Why do you support the First Step Act? Q. Will this Congress pass the First Step Act before it adjourns in December? 
Quick Links
November is National Adoption Month. It’s important to recognize and celebrate adoption as a pathway to a safe, loving and permanent place to call home for youth in foster care. Congress must work with states and child welfare organizations to support programs and services that help place and keep foster youth with permanent, loving families. Because that’s what adoption should mean — love, stability and a place to call home forever. 
The National Federation of Independent Business presented me with its “Guardian of Small Business” award for my work in Congress advocating for America's small businesses. Small business is the backbone of America’s economy, making up nearly 50 percent of our nation’s workforce. Last year, my Republican colleagues and I passed comprehensive tax reform. I'm glad to hear from the small business community that those commonsense changes continue to produce real, positive results in Iowa and nationwide, such as lower unemployment, wage increases and tax savings. It’s an honor to serve as Iowa’s senior senator and support pro-growth policies that enable Iowans to succeed.
￼ 
Thx to Juanita Duggan for presenting me w the NFIB Guardian of Small Business Award on behalf of her members 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma sent a letter to me outlining new initiatives the agency has implemented to increase quality care standards at nursing homes in Iowa and throughout the country. These changes include a monitor system to track staffing levels at nursing homes and a publicly available website that lists rates of hospitalization for long-stay residents. Both of these factors play a role in a nursing home’s quality care rating and will help families determine the best facility for their loved ones. 
I met with Secretary of the Air Force Dr. Heather Wilson to discuss overspending at the Air Force and what steps the department is taking to reduce costs and encourage innovation. I appreciate Secretary Wilson coming to speak with me to address some of the questions I’ve raised about wasteful spending in her department. I also want to applaud her efforts, and those of many in her department, who are determined to reduce costs and put a greater focus on innovation. I look forward to continued communication with Secretary Wilson and her staff to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being well-spent.
Iowan Douglas J. Strike, President Trump's nominee to serve as the United States Marshal for the Northern District of Iowa, was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by a unanimous voice vote. He was nominated by the President after Senator Ernst and I made a joint recommendation. Mr. Strike served as a law enforcement officer in Iowa for over 30 years, equipping him with the knowledge and skills required to successfully carry out this position. I look forward to his full Senate confirmation to be our next U.S. marshal.

11/24/18 7:10,Celebrating small businesses,"￼ 


Hoosiers,

Below is the piece I penned for the News and Tribune (covering Floyd and Clark counties) celebrating all Hoosier small businesses: 

On Main Street in New Washington sits the 1894 Lodge, a community staple where families and friends gather on basketball game night and local firefighters meet between shifts. A Clark County institution, 1894 and the Hoosiers who run it are constantly giving back and donating to the community they serve. On Silver Street in New Albany sits Aebersold Florist, a third-generation, family-owned flower shop that, for over 100-years, has provided flowers for local weddings, ceremonies, birthdays, and special-occasions. Adrienne and Co. is a true family business that grew from one location in Jeffersonville to several around the area. Bright and early each morning, they start serving up breakfast, baked goods, and cakes that are almost too beautiful to eat.

Across Indiana, small businesses like these make up who we are. They give us success stories that fill us with pride when telling friends about shops and businesses from back home. They define where we work, where we sip coffee, and where we gather for dinner with family on Sunday evenings.

But, our local businesses do more than make up the beloved storefronts of Main Streets across the country. The strength of America’s small businesses is this: There are 29 million small businesses in the United States; two-thirds of all new jobs are created by them; 47 percent of private sector employees work for them; and 46 percent of private sector output comes from them. They’re a powerful force in our economy, providing jobs to our neighbors, investment in our communities, and excitement for our future as they grow and innovate.

Over the past almost two years, ensuring our Hoosier small businesses have the resources they need to thrive has been a top priority of mine. Many small businesses face significant challenges in raising adequate capital to expand, hire workers, and achieve their goals. I introduced the Expanding Investment Opportunities Act (H.R. 4279) to provide small businesses greater access to the money they need to hire Hoosiers, the Fostering Innovation Act (H.R. 1645) to empower Hoosier biopharmaceutical companies on the cutting edge of scientific and medical research, and the Improving Access to Capital Act (H.R. 2864) to open up additional options for entrepreneurs to grow their business.

These bills all address different challenges that growing companies face but have a common goal of allowing anyone — from a start-up in a garage to your local coffee shop expanding to a second location — to achieve the goals they have set for themselves and reach success they could have never imagined.

The heart and soul of America has never been our gigantic industries or massive multi-national corporations, but rather businesses like those you find around the corner or down the street; small businesses, family businesses. Stores where the owners, managers, and employees know your name, and you ask about their grandkids. Companies that care about our community because they’re a part of the community. The owners, the employees, the customers, and the suppliers are what made our economy what it is today. And today on Small Business Saturday, let’s remember to stop by, say thank you, and shop small.

Be of good cheer,
￼

Dear Friend, 
The hustle and bustle of the holidays are officially upon us. Whether you're spending time with family this weekend or recovering from your marathon Black Friday shopping spree, I wanted to take this opportunity to remind you to think about a great opportunity to support businesses in the community by ""shopping small"" when you are looking for some of this years’ gifts.                                  
￼
Since 2010, Small Business Saturday has taken place on the Saturday following Thanksgiving, right in the middle of a weekend that is seemingly dedicated to shopping for Christmas. This year is no different. 
Communities around North Missouri will have special events and sales designed to encourage you to get out and visit your local, independently-owned merchants. Last year, an estimated 108 million people visited their local retailers during Small Business Saturday and this year looks to be even bigger due to a booming economy! 
Your friends and neighbors have put a tremendous amount of blood, sweat and tears into creating a business that is needed in your community. From antique shops, jewelry stores or clockmakers to home décor, kitchen supplies and wood workers; there are so many different unique options out there. If you’ve never taken a moment to see what businesses are hidden in plain sight, Small Business Saturday is a great opportunity to do so. 
There are 30 million small businesses across the country creating 2 out of every 3 net new jobs. That’s about 1.9 million net new jobs! Undoubtedly, these businesses are the backbone of our communities. Rural America thrives when our small businesses thrive which is why it’s so critical that we support them. 
Whether you do your shopping in St. Joe, Maryville, Kirksville, Hannibal or anywhere in between, make plans to visit your local small businesses this Saturday and ""shop small."" You’ll be amazed at what you might find and you’ll be supporting your community and the American Dream in the process. 
 Sincerely, ￼  Sam Graves

Dear  , 
Wishing the families across eastern Connecticut a safe and Happy Thanksgiving! As always, I am immensely grateful to represent and work for the people of Connecticut’s second district. Now as much as ever, I look forward to fighting hard for our region, and feel great about the opportunities ahead. 

Grateful for all who serve our community 
This week I had the pleasure of joining some of the many dedicated individuals from across our region who spent this holiday week volunteering at food shelters and food drives. These folks dedicate hours and days to ensuring everyone in our community can enjoy this special day, and each year I’m grateful to witness their generous spirit.

Bringing telehealth to eastern Connecticut  
The devastating reality of the opioid crisis has hit home in our state as Connecticut continues to see a rise in fatal drug overdoses. What has become clear over the years as we learn more about this epidemic that has touched the lives of millions of American families is that a comprehensive and multifaceted approach is required to tackle this tremendous public health challenge. 
Among the variety of obstacles that families facing the opioid crisis are presented with is the lack of access to care. For Americans living in more rural parts of the country, including parts of eastern Connecticut, access to treatment can be limited for several reasons, among them geography, immobility, lack of transportation, and stigma. 
Tele-medicine has the potential to bridge the gap for patients who need care but have difficulty gaining access to it. Unfortunately, Connecticut is the only state in the country where Medicaid recipients cannot access telehealth services, which is why I led a letter to Commissioner Bremby at the Department of Social Services alongside my colleagues in the Connecticut delegation urging the department’s pursuance of waivers to begin reimbursing health providers for telemedicine services provided to HUSKY recipients. This would open the door for thousands of Medicaid recipients in our state to gain access to these services. It cannot be ignored that communities in our state are experiencing staggering rates of fatalities and overdoses, and failing to provide a proven tool to improve access to treatment is unacceptable.

An urgent call on our Navy to utilize private shipyards  
This week’s GAO report demonstrating that the Navy lost 1,891 days of submarine operations waiting for repairs is a sobering assessment of the challenges facing our undersea forces. While demand for our undersea fleet and its unique capabilities is on the rise, delays in submarine maintenance are exacerbating the growing shortfall in our submarine force structure.  
This report makes clear that the Navy must do more to fully utilize the capacity of our private shipyards like Electric Boat to reduce the backlog in submarine repair work – something I have repeatedly urged the Navy to act on. It is long past time for a return to a “one shipyard” approach to meeting the challenge of maintaining and repairing our submarines so that they can get back to sea. Looking ahead to the new Congress, I am prepared make this issue a top priority for our work on the Seapower subcommittee. 
￼ 

I hope you enjoyed this snapshot of my work, and as always thank you for taking a moment to read my weekly update. If you have any questions or concerns about the information in this newsletter, you can contact me through my website or by calling my Norwich district office at 860-886-0139.

Long’s Short Report – Protecting religious freedom
By Rep. Billy Long
As we kick off the holiday season, it’s easy to take for granted the many things we are thankful for in a country as great as ours. One that is often overlooked is religious freedom. President Trump’s administration has implemented many policies to defend this freedom and protect religious institutions from being forced to do things against their moral code. However, that hasn’t always been the case.
In 2011, the Obama administration’s Department of Health and Human Services mandated that all employers must provide contraceptive services through their insurance plans. Organizations such as Little Sisters of the Poor, a religious non-profit, were outraged at the Obama administration’s disregard for religious values and asked for an exemption from the mandate. Fearing excessive fines that would come along with not complying, Little Sisters of the Poor asked the courts for protection. In 2016, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Little Sisters of the Poor, allowing religious institutions to follow their moral code when offering health care services.
More recently, President Trump issued a formal rule protecting organizations with deeply held moral or religious objections to the Obama-era contraceptive mandate. This rule finally allowed organizations like Little Sisters of the Poor the protections they are guaranteed under the First Amendment.
Instead of mandating rules and regulations that harm religious freedom, President Trump has spent his time working to enhance religious freedom and protect religious institutions. Seeing a double standard in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, President Trump reversed an Obama-era rule that denied houses of worship disaster aid that they rightly deserved. Unlike non-religious organizations, churches were not allowed to apply for disaster grants, even though they spent just as much time and money helping those affected by the hurricane.
While defending religious freedom in the U.S. has been a top priority for President Trump, he has also worked hard to protect it abroad. In January of this year, President Trump placed Pakistan on a “Special Watch List” for its violations of religious freedom while also placing 10 other countries on a list of particular concern. These lists were created under the International Religious Freedom Act and serve as a tool to hold countries accountable for their religious intolerances.
Our country was founded on the principle of religious freedom. President Trump has worked tirelessly to ensure that our country continues to be a place where all can come and worship. America must always strive to protect those who wish to exercise their First Amendment right to religious expression.

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 11.23.18
Friday, November 23, 2018 –                                 
Job Growth in the Ninth District
Southwest Virginia is open for business. That’s the message I heard in November, as several companies announced expansions or new operations around the Ninth District.
In Montgomery County, the tech company 1901 Group, founded by a Virginia Tech alumnus, plans to add 580 jobs at its Blacksburg operations center over the next three years. The company provides cloud-based information technology (IT) services, and federal contracts make up much of its business. According to the Roanoke Times, 1901 Group’s CEO Sonu Singh advocates for bringing the tech industry to rural areas.
In Bluefield, AMRPEMCO, which produces electrical and power distribution equipment, will expand its manufacturing operation, purchase new equipment, and add 75 new jobs.
In Lebanon, the Maryland-based TDEC opened a data entry service office, hiring twelve people and planning to hire more.
These announcements are only the latest economic expansions in the Ninth District. Other major investments revealed earlier this year included 212 new jobs in Henry County with the arrival of Press Glass and a $248 million manufacturing upgrade by WestRock in Covington and Alleghany County.
Employers recognize the assets we have: a low cost of living, a high quality of life, institutions of higher learning, and transportation accessibility, among others. As a result, they want to stay here and base their operations in our area.
Recent job expansions here also reflect what is taking place at the national level, with unemployment across the country at historic lows and businesses feeling confident about their prospects.
These positive economic trends were stimulated at least in part by tax cuts and regulatory restraint by the Federal Government. As I travel across the Ninth District, I have heard business owners attribute some of their success to these policy choices.
How do we keep the good news on jobs coming?
One answer is to prepare for the future. While people need the right jobs, jobs also need the right people. The economy of our era increasingly depends upon technology, so prospective employees need the skills suitable for them to thrive. These skills primarily come through education, which brings us to the Southwest Virginia link to a national news story.
When the tech giant Amazon announced locations for new headquarters facilities, it opted for New York City and Arlington County’s Crystal City. But as part of the agreement for Amazon to set up shop in Crystal City, Virginia Tech will launch an Innovation Campus nearby to promote technology education and research.
As part of its orientation in this direction, Virginia Tech will also increase enrollment at the Blacksburg campus by 2,000 students in fields such as computer science and software engineering. More students, and more staff to support them, will drive economic growth.
More importantly in the long term, as these students graduate, Southwest Virginia will have a pool of jobseekers prepared for the emerging economy.
The earlier items in this column showed that employers are ready to invest in our communities. When more of our people have the job skills they seek, the pull to our area becomes that much greater.
I hope that many of these students will stay in our area to build the economy of the future. Virginia Tech is leading the way forward, and its example shows how our institutions of higher learning contribute to our economy.
Technology jobs will not be the only jobs, of course, and four-year degrees are not the only way to gain job training. To that end, Congress passed earlier this year the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act to improve these educational opportunities.
As I noted in a column earlier this year, and as AMRPEMCO’s expansion in Bluefield affirms, the manufacturing sector is enjoying a resurgence nationally and in our area. But manufacturing jobs have evolved over the years, and better career and technical education will help applicants for these jobs be prepared.
Positive jobs news benefits more than the employees and employers of those businesses. It means new jobs for suppliers and small businesses serving the community. And of course, it means more money for lots of families, and more that can be spent in our community. I hope the latest spate of good news will continue.

From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:
Good Afternoon,
This week in Congress,I spent the last few days in Halifax, Nova Scotia for the 64th annual session of NATO Parliamentary Assembly.
￼
Strengthening the Transatlantic Alliance
For decades, the NATO Parliamentary Assembly has brought together politicians and delegates from 29 NATO member countries to discuss key issues affecting the security of the Euro-Atlantic area. I am proud to have been a part of this summit and participate in a wide-range of discussions focused on strengthening the Transatlantic Alliance. This event helps build our relationships with our allies as we pursue common interests around the globe. It was also great to have some home-grown expertise on the trip with us as Dr. Laura Barrett, a native of Bradford County, was the attending physician for the U.S. delegation.
Wishing You a Happy Thanksgiving
I hope that you and your loved ones had a happy and safe Thanksgiving.
￼
This is a wonderful time of year to reconnect with family and friends and to remember all that we are grateful for. I am especially thankful for the men and women of our armed services and first responders who are spending the holiday away from their families to keep us safe.
Black Friday Safety Tips
For many, shopping during this holiday season is way to spend time with loved ones and save money during Black Friday. Whether you are traveling to a store or browsing online, this weekend is the busiest shopping period of the year and it is important that you take the necessary steps to protect yourself, your purchases, and your personal information.
Celebrating Small Business Saturday
Saturday, November 24, 2018 is Small Business Saturday, a day to celebrate and support small businesses and all they do for our communities. Before my education, legal career, and service to the people of Pennsylvania’s 10th District, I spent decades in small business. I worked alongside the kind of people I believe to be the backbone of America’s economy. I am proud of the work we have done to promote economic stability and job growth throughout the United States and PA-10 and look forward to championing measures to provide real relief for our local entrepreneurs. Make sure to support your local businesses this weekend!
Plan a Visit to Our Nation’s Capital
As we move into the Holiday season, it is a beautiful time of year to take a trip to Washington, D.C.
￼
Every week, I have the pleasure of having families from PA-10 visit and receive a personalized tour by one of my dedicated staff members. Any constituents planning to visit D.C. should contact my office hereto arrange a tour for you and your family. We look forward to having you!

Tomorrow is your chance to shop small and support the many small businesses in our district that provide goods and services to our community and the world. I encourage you to check out some of the incredible and diverse local businesses that we have across North Carolina’s 12th Congressional District. 
Small businesses, especially women and veteran-owned businesses, drive the American economy and create two out of every three new jobs in our community. It is important that we all do our part to support them.
I hope you will join me in shopping small on Saturday, November 24 and every day! Find out which small businesses in our area you want to visit here.

To Everyone Across Big Sky Country:
I hope you’re all enjoying a good meal with your family and friends today. There’s a lot to give thanks for this holiday season, so I wanted to share some of the things Sharla and I are particularly grateful for this year.   LIFE  Today and every day, Sharla and I give thanks for the life we’re blessed to lead. Together, we’ve been able to raise a beautiful family, continue working our farm, and form lifelong friendships with folks across our great state.   LAND  Our public lands are what make Montana the Treasure State. They’re the heart of our outdoor way of life and the backbone of our economy. And the best way to give thanks for the beauty and bounty of Montana’s great outdoors is by making sure they’re protected for generations to come.   LIBERTY  We live in the best state in the best country on earth—because thousands of men and women have fought to keep it that way. So, I want to send a special thanks to our veterans and service members who have and continue to spend the holidays away from home and apart from loved ones so that we can live free and chase the American dream.   Finally, I’m thankful for the opportunity to keep serving you and fighting for these values in the United States Senate.   Please stay and touch and have a Happy Thanksgiving!

Dear Friends,

Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family. As I reflect on the many blessings God has given me, I'm especially thankful for my wife, Martha, my daughter, Liza, my son, Payne, and my father, Jay. They are the most important people in my life. I'm also grateful for the opportunity you've given me to represent you in Congress; it is truly a privilege to be your voice, bringing your policy ideas from Arkansas to Washington. 

Happy Thanksgiving 
￼
From my family to yours, Martha, Liza, Payne and I wish you a very Happy Thanksgiving.

Keeping Agriculture Strong in the Natural State 
￼
I thank the Arkansas Farm Bureau, particularly Randy Veach (far left), and Stanley Hill (far right), for naming me a ‘Friend of the Farm Bureau,’ which is presented to Members of Congress for their exemplary voting records in support of agriculture and Arkansas Farm Bureau priority issues. 

Farming is an integral part of Arkansas’s economy and heritage, and it’s an honor to support policies in Congress that help our hardworking farmers like the Jana and Damon Helton thrive. I was fortunate to visit the Helton's beautiful place near Crows this week. Jana and Damon Helton (pictured to my right) produce sustainable poultry, beef and pork. I am proud of their hard work to establish this great farm. Damon served honorably in Iraq and Afghanistan. When he returned to Arkansas, the Farm Bureau's Patriot Program for veterans paired Damon with a mentor to help him kickstart his successful operation. To learn more about the Farm Bureau's Patriot program, click here.   

I look forward to continuing to support our farm families who work tirelessly to clothe and feed Arkansans and Americans across the country.

Enjoying Arkansas's Natural Beauty 
￼
I enjoyed a hike through a beautiful section of the Ouachita National Forest that is soon to be Bethune Woods, named for a tireless conservationist and advocate for Arkansas wilderness, my good friend, former Arkansas Congressman Ed Bethune. My bill to expand the Flatside Wilderness passed the House last week with a unanimous vote on the floor It is now one step closer to the finish line on the President’s desk. I'm excited that future generations will be able to explore and have access to more of the natural beauty our state has to offer.

Forever Thankful
By Sen. John Thune 
 
There’s a lot of truth to the old saying that the days are long, but the years are short. It seems like just yesterday we were celebrating the last holiday season and time spent with family and friends. For me, as we approach this Thanksgiving – and, yes, Christmas is right around the corner – it’s a good reminder that the list of things I’m thankful for gets longer each and every year, which is a blessing to be sure. 
 
I’ve said it before, but I’ve always considered myself to be a lottery winner in that I was born in the greatest country on earth and that I’ve been able to raise my family in the land of the free and home of the brave. Family is everything to me, and the one Kimberley and I have built over the years has continued to grow. “Dad” will always be a title I’m proud of, but the joy of being a grandparent is hard to fully explain unless you are one yourself. If you are, you know exactly what I mean.

Happy Thanksgiving!

Dear Friends, 

Thanksgiving is a time to pause and reflect on the blessings, freedoms, and opportunities we have been given.  Today, and throughout the holiday season, we give thanks for everything and everyone that has enriched our lives, and we are especially grateful for our friends, families, and our safety. 

As we remember the true meaning of this holiday, we are grateful and vow to never to take for granted the many blessings that have been bestowed upon each of us. 

￼

￼

Happy Thanksgiving from my family to yours.  May God bless each of you, and may He continue to bless the United States of America.

Sincerely,

 Fellow Texan,  This Thanksgiving, I am thankful for the local organizations around Texas that volunteer their time and donate resources to help ensure their fellow Texans don't go hungry on this holiday, and throughout the year.  Take, for example, the Raul Jimenez Thanksgiving Day Dinner. More than 50 area companies and 4,000 volunteers partner to prepare a meal that will serve more than 25,000 seniors and San Antonians in need. There are many more groups just like this around Texas.  ￼  From my family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving!  Sincerely,

Dear Friend,  Today is a celebration and reminder of the spirit of community and generosity that defines us. Ventura County has weathered significant challenges recently, but through this adversity, our community has shown incredible generosity and caring, which exemplifies what this holiday is all about.  I am thankful for the dedication of our brave first responders, and federal, state and local officials who have exhibited exceptional teamwork and perseverance in helping save lives and keeping our community safe. I am also thankful for all the public safety officials who came from other counties and states to help us during these difficult times. Their sacrifices and heroism will never be forgotten. If you were impacted by the recent fires, visit my website to find resources available to you. I will continue to update this page.  Our servicemembers and veterans have sacrificed so much so that we can safely spend this holiday with our families, and for that we remain grateful. I know that supporting our servicemembers and veterans is extremely important to all of us in Ventura County, and you can be assured that I will continue to focus on legislation that keeps our promise to those in uniform and the millions of veterans who have put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms. This year, I was pleased to support a well-earned pay raise for military personnel, and to support legislation that should make it easier for veterans to access the care they have earned.  This Thanksgiving, whether it is helping our neighbors during a natural disaster, lending aid to families who have suffered unthinkable loss, or volunteering at a local soup kitchen, we are strongest when we come together and support each other. If you or someone you know needs assistance with a federal agency, please contact me at (805) 379-1779. I am here to help.  Best wishes to all of you this holiday season!
 Sincerely,
￼

Dear Neighbor,
 
Happy Thanksgiving! I hope you are able to spend the day with family and friends. I am home with my 77 year-old mom and family with so much to be thankful for, including the opportunity to represent you in Congress for a second term. 

Serving our families, children, and seniors in California's 44th Congressional District is the privilege of a lifetime. 
 
I am committed as ever to protecting your rights, improving your quality of life, and ensuring that our government works for all of us, not just the rich and powerful.
 
I also want to express my deepest appreciation to our first responders and firefighters who have been working on the front lines and battling the destructive California fires. Their selflessness and bravery is inspirational - a true example of dedication to public service. I will continue to pray for the families who have suffered and are impacted. During this time of uncertainty, we must come together as a community to put the pieces back together for the families who have suffered tremendous loss to their livelihoods.
 
On this Thanksgiving, let's remember all of the reasons we have to be thankful, and all of the people that we are thankful for! I look forward to the work ahead and the lasting friendships and partnerships we will continue to create in the years ahead.

In Community,

Dear Friend, 

On this Thanksgiving Day, Mississippians and all Americans have much to be thankful for.  We live in a nation where we are free to express our thoughts and choose leaders who represent our shared values.  We are also fortunate to have men and women in uniform who have pledged to protect the freedoms we hold dear.  At home and across the world, scores of service members are watching over us as we gather at the family table, including more than 4,000 Mississippi Army National Guard soldiers who deployed to the Middle East this summer in support of Operation Spartan Shield.  Today, it was my honor to spend Thanksgiving Day helping to serve lunch to members of the 155th Armored Brigade Combat Team.

￼
   
Specialist (SPC) Justin Tharpe, an Oxford native, is among those who are spending this holiday with their second family - their family in uniform.  Addison Tharpe, SPC Tharpe's wife, married her high school sweetheart just prior to his deployment.  She is managing the family business while SPC Tharpe is away.  Addison is proud of her husband's service.  ""I'm super, super proud,"" Addison said.  ""It is true that we serve as much as they do.  I am so proud to be an Army wife.""  

￼

As we celebrate the holidays, take the time to remember all those who have made a commitment to protect America.  Happy Thanksgiving!

Dear Friends,
 
On this final Thanksgiving as your Congressman, I’d like to begin by thanking the people of the First District for bestowing on me the privilege of service. Your trust has driven me to keep my promises, be a forceful advocate for constituents dealing with the government and to fight for Idaho values in Congress. I am humbled and grateful for the honor of representing you.
 
We come together today as a nation to celebrate the conviction of the Pilgrims who fled religious persecution, the success of the American Revolution, and the constitutional rights we cherish. We also give thanks for family and friends and the many blessings bestowed by our Creator.
 
Thanks to the Founders’ vision, courage and divinely inspired belief that all men are created equal, we enjoy freedom of religion, speech, assembly and the right to self-governance. The origin of those liberties dates to the first Thanksgiving.
 
For my family, Thanksgiving is a time to reflect on our many blessings. We usually gather with my wife’s family for a traditional Thanksgiving meal. We have a large and bountiful Thanksgiving table. This Thanksgiving I am so grateful for my beautiful wife. She has stood by my side over the last eight years and has provided the support I needed to represent you in Washington, DC. 
 
On behalf of my family, I wish you and yours the happiest of Thanksgivings, and I hope you'll join me in praying for Idaho and our nation.

Dear Friend,  
Happy Thanksgiving! As we gather with family and friends, in our unique American tradition, we stop to give thanks for the liberties given to us through the sacrifice of patriotic military men and women – past and present. It’s also a chance to focus more on what unites us and less on what divides us. While we face important issues, we are still blessed to live in the greatest country in the world. 
In 1789, the first Federal Congress passed a resolution asking the President to recommend a day of national thanksgiving. A few days later, President George Washington issued a proclamation naming Thursday, November 26, 1789 as the first official Thanksgiving in our nation. 
Since that first Thanksgiving, it has become a national tradition to pause with loved ones and remember what we are grateful for. It is also an opportunity to help others and share our blessings with those in need. By answering the call to love our neighbors, our nation becomes a more hopeful and caring place. 
As we give thanks, let us also say a prayer for the men and women of our military who defend our liberty overseas. We also thank their families who sit at tables with an empty chair waiting for their safe return.  
This Thanksgiving, may we reflect upon the past year with gratefulness and look toward the future with hope. Let us give thanks for the liberties we continue to fight to protect and ask God to continue to bless our families, Texas and the United States of America.
Wishing you a Happy Thanksgiving, Pete Olson

Dear Lindsey, 
This is the time of year when friends and family come together to celebrate and give thanks for all that we have. I can think of no better time to express our gratitude for our troops than on this day of thanks. While we enjoy the company of our loved ones, let us remember the men and women fighting overseas, who sacrifice their holidays to ensure our safety. It is because of their service that we are able to celebrate today. Out of my endless appreciation for our troops, I pledge to continue to advocate for service members, veterans, and military families and make their needs a top priority.

Coming Together For A Better Future 
Thanksgiving is the time of year when we come together to celebrate friends, family, and everything we are grateful for. As the son of working-class Americans, I’m grateful for all the people who helped me become who I am today. Growing up I learned the path to the middle class depends on a strong education, a good job, and a robust infrastructure. This coming year, I will focus on these issues for all our families:
	1.	Infrastructure & Jobs — America's robust and world-leading economy is a product of generations of infrastructure investment; however, our infrastructure is crumbling. I know that America's economic future depends on a robust infrastructure. 
	2.	Affordable Healthcare & Protecting Preexisting Conditions Coverage — I will work to ensure every American has access to affordable health care.  
	3.	Affordable Education — Everything starts with a good education. I will work to ensure every American has access to the high quality and affordable education we deserve, including higher education and trade training.
	4.	Comprehensive Immigration Reform & DREAMers — Across America, countless hardworking immigrant families contribute to our great nation. Just as our families came to work hard and build this great nation, today’s immigrants are part of our economic prosperity. They deserve a pathway to citizenship. We must enact immigration reform.

Happy Thanksgiving



From our home to yours, Giulia and I wish everyone a Happy Thanksgiving! As we enjoy this holiday with friends and family we are reminded of how blessed we are to call western North Carolina home. Please join us in giving thanks for the families and communities that are the cornerstones of our country, the men and women serving in our armed forces fighting to protect our freedoms, and our law enforcement who work so hard to keep us safe here at home. I am thankful for everything that makes our country the best in the world. May God continue to bless America.

Small Business Saturday



This Saturday, we celebrate small businesses and the important role they play in the Tenth District and all across the country. In the United States small businesses are responsible for two out of every three new jobs created and in North Carolina alone small businesses employ 1.6 million people. I am grateful for everything they do to serve the western North Carolina community. Asheville, has been named the the second best location to shop locally in the United States. Gastonia is celebrating its small businesses with an event at Loray Mill, which you can learn more about by clicking here courtesy of the Gaston Gazette.

What I Have Been Reading



Meet this year's presidential pardon turkeys: Peas and Carrots

USA Today 

On Tuesday, President Trump invited two turkeys to the White House, Peas and Carrots, continuing the tradition to pardon a turkey each Thanksgiving. Before their pardon Peas and Carrots enjoyed a ""spa day"" at a Washington D.C. hotel. Peas and Carrots will now enjoy a retirement at Virginia Tech's Gobbler Rest where they will join last year's pardoned turkeys, Drumstick and Wishbone.

HAPPY THANKSGIVING 
Dear Friends,  
Thanksgiving is such a meaningful holiday. It’s a time for all of us to pause and reflect on our blessings and freedoms. As we gather with family and loved ones, let us take a moment to remember the spirit of thanks and gratitude that this day is about. 
We live in the greatest country in the world. One where freedom and liberty are enjoyed each day, where we are blessed with unparalleled opportunity and the ability to build a better life, and where our flag remains an unyielding symbol of democracy – a government for the people, by the people. 
We are reminded that all of these things would not be possible without the sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform. Let us never take for granted those who are serving, or have served, our nation. They are willing to lay their lives down so that we can be free. To our active service members – especially those away from home today – veterans, and their families: Thank you. 
While we prepare to enjoy our feasts, let us also share what we are grateful for with others. As your Congressman, I’m thankful to you – the people of Arkansas’s Third Congressional District. It’s a privilege to serve our community, and I am humbled to represent you in Congress. I will continue to fight for Arkansas values and policies that build a stronger and more prosperous America.
I am forever grateful to God, my family, our country, and for every blessing I have received. We have so much to be thankful for today, and every day. May God bless you and your family with health, peace, and joy. 
Happy Thanksgiving! 

From the front...

Wishing you a joyous Thanksgiving
￼ 
Dear Friend, 
It's that time of year again -- we trade our fall fleeces for winter jackets, gather with our family and friends near and far, and spend a day reflecting on what we're thankful for.  
For my part, I have much to be grateful for this year. I have a loving and supportive family, my health, and I've had the honor of a lifetime to serve my community in Congress.    
It’s also an important time to consider many of our neighbors who often go without many of these comforts. I thank the many Philadelphia and Montgomery County-area organizations that help these families, and hope you’ll think about how we all can do a bit more to lend a hand this holiday season. 
I hope you're able to find some time today to reflect on the past year, enjoy a delicious meal, and spend some quality time with your loved ones. I wish you a joyous Thanksgiving and a wonderful year of blessings to come.    
Sincerely, 
￼  Brendan F. Boyle Member of Congress

11/22/18 10:37,"Happy Thanksgiving, From Our Family to Yours"," 

￼
In his original Thanksgiving proclamation in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln said that our blessings should be “solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American People.”  On this special day, we celebrate the blessings bestowed by our Creator. As a nation and as a community, we have much to be thankful and much to share. As you gather with family and friends to celebrate America’s oldest tradition, please keep the men and women of our Armed Forces around the world in your thoughts for their sacrifice and valor.   God bless and happy Thanksgiving to all. 
Sincerely, ￼ Mark Walker

Dear Friend, 
From my family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving. 
Today, I think of my family, especially my Mom and Dad. My friends. My country. My freedom. What are you thankful for today? 
It is a tremendous privilege to represent the 23rd District of Texas, and I hope each of you across South and West Texas is able to spend some time today with loved ones. 
￼ 
During my nine and a half years in the CIA, I spent many Thanksgivings overseas away from loved ones. To those who are stationed away from home this year, and to the families of those stationed away from home, I hope you know that we are thankful for your dedicated service and sacrifice.  
Thank you for letting me serve you in Congress. As always, please don't hesitate to reach out to my office with any questions or concerns. For further updates on my work for you, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube at @HurdontheHill.  
Sincerely,  Will

Good morning, 
As we enter the season of thanks giving, I would like to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to the men and women who serve in our United States Military. Every day, these selfless service members, and their families, make invaluable contributions and countless sacrifices to protect us and all that we hold dear.
As we join our family, friends, and fellow Americans this Thanksgiving, let us not forget the men and women serving abroad who cannot be in the comfort of their own homes this season. Please join me in thanking these heroes for allowing us the ability to gather to give thanks and enjoy the freedoms they fight each day to secure. 
North Texas is home to many military heroes, and I have been privileged to meet and thank many of them while serving in Congress. Today, I want to provide an update on four of our service members from right here in North Texas who continue to make us proud to be Americans, and Texans.

  Dear Lindsey,  
Each year, Americans from all walks of life gather together on the fourth Thursday of November to celebrate what we are thankful for. Thanksgiving marks the beginning of the of the holiday season, in which, we gather our family, friends, and loved ones together to share in our collective thanks for the opportunities and relationships that we have been blessed with.
As our family gathers around the table for turkey and stuffing, I am thankful for my three sons, McKay, Lucas, and Teddy, my loving wife Kristen, and the wonderful community we call home in central and west-central Illinois. Like many of you, we have been blessed with healthy lives and a loving family, but it is important that during this season of thanks we not forget those who are less fortunate and do what we can to give back to the those in need. 
Yesterday, and over the last six years, I have had the opportunity of taking my sons to serve lunch at the annual Community Workshop & Training Center thanksgiving luncheon, in Peoria. CWTC is an incredible organization that assists developmentally disabled adults in our community. They strive each day to improve the quality of life for these adults and we were grateful for the chance to lend a helping hand during the holiday season. 
Whether you are headed out to meet friends and family to play some football, you are making the last minute run to the grocery store, or are putting the finishing touches on your turkey dinner, take a moment to stop and reflect on what you are thankful for today. We are all blessed to live in a country with the freedoms we have which give each of us the opportunity to live out the American dream, and while we may sometimes disagree on policy, we are thankful to live in the greatest country in the world. 
I hope you all have a blessed Thanksgiving with family and loved ones! Please continue on for an update on what we have done in the 18th District over the past week.

A Change in Command
  
￼  ￼
Within our military, the change of command ceremony is a time-honored tradition. This weekend, I had the privilege of witnessing the change of command ceremony at the Naval Operational Support Center as Lt. Commander Siler transitions command to Lt. Commander Kemmitz.   Lt. Commander Siler has exemplified his patriotism over an outstanding career and I wish him the best on his next assignment at Navy’s Personnel Headquarters in Tennessee.

Roundtable Discussion with Local Mayors on Issues Affecting our Community
￼ 
I had the chance to sit down with mayors of multiple towns in eastern McLean County to discuss issues facing the area, such as trade, transportation, and other local projects.   Special thanks to Saybrook mayor Danny Huestis, Arrowsmith mayor Chad Walden, Cooksville mayor Cathy Weber, and Illinois Farm Bureau's Ryan Whitehouse for joining me!
""Four Score and Seven Years Ago...""
￼ 
On Monday, we celebrated the 155th Anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address to honor the Union soldiers buried at Gettysburg National Cemetery. Lincoln's concise speech still rings loud over 150 years later. As Lincoln famously put it, ""The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here."" May we never forget. Image via the Library of Congress.
Specific Solutions for Dialysis Patients
￼ 
This week, I meet with Dr. Tim Pflederer, Dr. Samer Sader and Jennifer Close of the Renal Intervention Center in Morton, as well as Chris Mason from OSF Saint Francis Medical Center, and Jeanine Spain of UnityPoint Health - Peoria to learn more about the unique practice at the Renal Intervention Center which offers specific solutions to assist dialysis patients from across the Midwest.
A Future Leader
￼  ￼ 
It was a pleasure to have Melissa and her son come by the office this week to discuss the importance of civic engagement and my job as their Representative in Congress. I have no doubt that he has a bright future ahead of him and will one day be a leader in the central Illinois community.

HAPPY THANKSGIVING

I want to wish you and your family a happy and peaceful Thanksgiving.
As Americans, we are thankful for the freedom and opportunity which God has given us, and which many brave men and women have fought to preserve.
As we reflect on our many blessings and share our gratitude with loved ones, let us take a moment to give thanks for our servicemembers who sacrifice so much so America’s promise can endure.
We pray for the safety of our troops, especially those who are serving far from home today, and for the strength of their families.
As always, I am grateful to represent you in Congress and to spend each day fighting for Hoosiers.

Happy Thanksgiving!

Happy Thanksgiving to you and your families! 

Thanksgiving is a time to reflect on everything for which we are grateful. It is a time to enjoy the presence of your family and friends, and cherish the moments you have together. Giving thanks for the blessings we have in life allows us to take a moment each year to express the gratitude we owe to our relatives, loved ones, and all that care for us.

In 2018, we can be thankful for record-low unemployment and a strong and robust economy. We can be thankful to live in a country that allows us to worship whenever, wherever, and however we choose. And we can be especially thankful for the men and women in the Armed Services who serve our nation proudly, putting on the uniform every day, including many who are away from their families this holiday season.

I wish all the best to you and your families on this joyous & delicious holiday!

               ""Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever"" -- Psalm 107:1

As your congressman, I’m here to serve you. If you have any questions please don’t hesitate to reach out to my offices in Fond du Lac and Washington.

Happy Thanksgiving
This Thanksgiving, I encourage you to give thanks for all the many blessings you have in your life no matter how big or small. As Americans we have so much to be grateful for. We have freedom that many around the world do not have, and it is all because of the men and women who selflessly serve in our armed forces. Many of our soldiers cannot be with their friends and families this holiday, but they should always hold a special place in our thoughts and prayers. 
Since its official proclamation in 1789 by President George Washington, Thanksgiving has always been a time to give thanks for the harvest, spend time with loved ones, give back to the community, and show gratitude for all our blessings. This year I am thankful for the many blessings from our Creator, our brave servicemembers, my loving family and the opportunity to represent you in Congress.   From my family to yours, we wish you a very happy Thanksgiving!
Feel free to contact my office if I can be of assistance to you or your family.

Dear Friend,
Thanksgiving is a time to come together with our friends and family to celebrate and give thanks for our many blessings. The holiday is uniquely American and dates to the Pilgrims and their expression of gratitude to all who helped them and to God. George Washington proclaimed a national thanksgiving celebration in 1789. At the advice of poet and magazine editor Sarah Josepha Hale, President Lincoln turned Thanksgiving into a national holiday in 1863.
As Americans, we have much to be thankful for.
I am thankful first and foremost for my family. My wife, Kathy, is an inspiration and a wonderful mother to our two boys Teddy and Ryan. She leads the charge as only a mother could, standing up for Teddy and other children with Angelman Syndrome. Angelman is a rare neurogenetic disorder and I am extremely thankful for everyone who is working on fighting it by developing cures and treatments. Ryan is doing well in school, his teachers tell Kathy and me that he doesn't need to socialize so much, and he is really coming into his own in baseball.
I am thankful to the members of our armed services and our first responders. Because of them we have our freedoms and safety to cherish as we sit around our tables with our loved ones. As we do so, let us not forget about the men and women who are away from their loved ones and are risking their lives to preserve our country and protect us.
I am thankful for the economy which is helping more Americans succeed than ever before. 2018 has been a great year for economic prosperity. Nationwide, unemployment is at the lowest rate since 1969. For Hoosiers, our unemployment rate is 3.5% and remains consistently below the national average. We owe thanks to the working men and women of our state and to those that support them with common-sense policies focused on economic growth. President Donald Trump has been leading the charge with pro-growth policies.
I am thankful that we are putting more faith into Hoosiers than Washington. With the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, in Indiana’s 4th Congressional District, a family of four can expect to save an average of $2,424 on their taxes. That is money for them, not Washington, to spend.
I am thankful to have the honor of serving Hoosiers and fighting for all people so that they can build better lives for themselves and their families.
I am thankful to God for the many blessings bestowed on me, my family, and my country.
With gratitude, Happy Thanksgiving!

Happy Thanksgiving
 

Now, our God, we give you thanks, and praise your glorious name
1 Chronicles 29:13

With so many problems and negative news stories filling the news cycle these days, it's hard to take a moment to reflect on how we are thankful. Today, as you gather with loved ones, I hope you can lay all the world's problems and differences aside and give thanks for life's many blessings. 

I am praying for our troops stationed overseas that have sacrificed spending this holiday with their friends and family in order to serve our country. I am also thankful to be the dad of three beautiful and healthy children who have blessed my life. Lastly, I am thankful to live in and serve south Mississippi. 

I would like to wish you and your family a blessed and safe Thanksgiving holiday. 

￼

In your service, 
￼
Steven

Dear Friend,  
Happy Thanksgiving! 
I hope you’re getting to spend today with family and friends counting your blessings, eating yummy food, and maybe watching a little football.
Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays. It usually starts off cooking with Tiffany in the kitchen while watching the Macy’s Day Thanksgiving Parade, and sometimes we catch the Purina National Dog Show on TV afterward. (Who knew there were so many unusual-looking dog breeds?!) It ends surrounded by family, sitting around a table enjoying turkey with all the trimmings accompanied by one of our family’s delicious pies. However, the best part is taking time at some point to reflect on the blessings I have been blessed with and to thank the One who sent them.
I am thankful the Pilgrims started this tradition almost 400 years ago. In 1621, they had endured much since coming to America—a tough winter with no food and ravaging disease cost them over half their colony. They weren’t sure if any would survive and then the spring came, along with help from Native Americans who taught them how to plant, hunt, and survive. After harvest the next fall, the Pilgrims decided to invite their new friends to celebrate their abundant crop and to give thanks to God for His provision. We carry on this tradition today.
It seems that gratitude often comes out of hard times. The Pilgrims appreciated life, each other, and the blessings of God more after suffering tremendous loss. As we commemorate this Thanksgiving Day, let us pause to think of those who have lost much - by fire, hurricane, or tragedy - and say a prayer for them. In the same breath, let us be thankful anew for a warm place to live, a safe homeland, and the love of family and friends. I’m thankful for all these things, the good people of the 4th District of Missouri I have the honor of representing, our men and women in uniform who sacrifice so much to defend and protect us, and for the blessing of living in the greatest country in the world. Thank you to each of you for reading this email. May God bless you and your family this Thanksgiving Day and may He continue to bless the United States of America.
 
Yours in service,
￼

Dear fellow South Carolinians,
It’s been quite a year, and too often we get lost in the highs and lows of everyday life that we forget to take time to stop and give thanks for all the good things in our lives. But today, we are reminded to stop and reflect on the blessings that we have as Americans. 
On this Thanksgiving, I wanted to pause and let you know that I am grateful for you and the chance to serve you, represent you, and fight for you in the United States Senate. 
Too many of us, myself included, can get overwhelmed with the hustle and bustle of life that we overlook the freedoms we cherish in this country. So today, as you gather together with family and loved ones, I hope you will say a prayer of thanksgiving and safety for our military men and women who are away from home this holiday season. Without their devotion and bravery, we could not enjoy the blessings of liberty. 
My family taught me from an early age that gratitude is the best attitude. My mother—my rock and biggest supporter—reminds me every so often the importance of staying grounded and humble, and for that, I am eternally thankful. 
I hope that this holiday season brings you joy, lots of laughter, and the warmth of family and friends. 
Happy Thanksgiving, and may God continue to bless this great nation we call home. 
  
Sincerely, 
￼
Tim

Weekly Update: So Much to be Thankful For  By Rob Wittman November 22, 2018  We have a tradition in my family on Thanksgiving. We all sit down at the table, and before we start eating the beautifully prepared feast, we go around and say what we are thankful for. Well this year, I wanted to do the same thing for work as I do for family - look back through 2018 to think about what I am most thankful for.  As I reflected on this year, I thought about all that we have accomplished. From the outset of 2018, I made it a priority to work on the issues that matter most to you and I believe the House took meaningful steps to promote workforce development, sustain a booming economy, achieve federal recognition for six Virginia tribes, increase access to high-speed internet, and support our men and women in uniform.    Workforce development is crucial to improving education. Congress passed, and the President signed, a bi-partisan bill to modernize and reauthorize the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. The Perkins CTE program controls over $1 billion in grants for federal, state, and local CTE programs. As just part of my work on this issue, I visited every CTE/ STEM center in VA-01 and held three symposiums to connect education institutions with local businesses and the private sector to help ensure the curriculum for our students reflects the needs of the workforce.  We promised you a better economy. Data released from the Bureau of Labor Statistic on November 2, 2018 told us three important things: hiring is up, wages are up, and the number of workers and job searchers is up. We learned that payrolls increased by 250,000 in October, well ahead of estimates, average hourly earnings increased by 3.1% - the best pace since 2009, and the unemployment rate stayed at 3.7%, which is the lowest since 1969.  Earlier this year, the president signed my bill granting long-deserved federal recognition to the Chickahominy, Eastern Chickahominy, Monacan, Nansemond, Rappahannock, and Upper Mattaponi tribes into law. The effort in Congress to gain federal recognition for these six ‘first contact’ tribes dates back nearly 20 years and this year we were able to cross the finish line. I am humbled to have played a role in securing this moment decades in the making for our Virginia tribes. I will forever consider this one of my major achievements as a legislator.  This year, we took steps towards bridging the digital divide by making progress towards increasing access to high-speed internet. From $600 million in funding for a new, USDA broadband pilot program to collaborating with local service providers and legislators, we are making concrete progress towards connecting the unserved areas in Virginia to broadband.  For the first time in a decade, Congress passed defense funding on-time – meaning we have finally provided the resources our warfighters need to be successful. In addition to funding going to continuing the rebuilding of our military readiness, the bill fully funded a 2.6% pay raise to our men and women in uniform. Also included was a provision I have long championed – allowing the Navy to proceed with a dual buy of aircraft carriers, saving taxpayers billions and supporting our strong shipbuilding industrial base. On top of that, the final bill included the 13 ships I fought for to allow us to rebuild to Navy of 355 ships.  Most of all, I am thankful for the men and women serving our nation overseas who do not get to be home this Thanksgiving holiday. This week, I had the privilege of visiting Afghanistan to meet with the outstanding men and women who are currently serving. Their patriotism is immeasurable and unwavering. We have so much to be thankful for here in the United States, and today we join together with friends and family in quiet acknowledgment of those blessings.  I hope that you and your family have a happy and blessing-filled Thanksgiving. God bless you, God bless this great Commonwealth of Virginia, and God bless these United States of America.

Bring Civility to the Thanksgiving Table
￼
Reps. Stivers and Beatty at rollout of the Civility and Respect Caucus at the Columbus Metropolitan Club.Photo courtesy of the Columbus Dispatch.
One year ago, I joined Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (D-OH) and former Congressman Pat Tiberi (R-OH) to participate in the “Setting the Table for Civility” program, organized by the Faith and Politics Institute and the National Institute for Civil Discourse.   During the conversation, we talked about how we were able to work together as Representatives for Central Ohio, despite coming from different backgrounds and not agreeing on every issue. We talked about how the rise of social media and the anonymity it allows has led to a breakdown in civil discourse. And we talked about the importance of bringing civility to the forefront of discussion for our colleagues on Capitol Hill.  This conversation led to Congresswoman Beatty and me taking on a bold new initiative to show our communities and colleagues that we can disagree without being disagreeable: The Congressional Civility and Respect Caucus. Our vision for this Caucus, which we rolled out in January, was to bring together our colleagues from both sides of the aisle to spread the message of civility in our districts and in Washington. We didn’t want to avoid disagreements. Instead, we wanted to encourage having civil conversations and listening to each other, because often the conversations alone makes us better.   In that spirit, as we gather with our friends and families this Thanksgiving, I am calling on everyone to bring civility to their Thanksgiving table. We have so much to be thankful for and celebrate in America – especially our freedoms and opportunity – and we need to focus on these values that unite us as we engage in tough conversations about issues in our country.  From my family to yours, I want to wish all of the constituents of Ohio’s 15th Congressional District a Happy Thanksgiving.

Conaway Chronicle: Happy Thanksgiving
__________________________________________

Thanksgiving is one of my favorite days, because it marks the official start of the holiday season with a reminder that we have so much to be grateful for. 

Earlier in the week, I stopped by the Midland Soup Kitchen Ministry to lend a hand for the afternoon. Their continuous show of love and support for our neighbors was wonderful to witness. It also reminded me that the incredible people who make up our community is just one of the many reasons I'm so grateful to call TX-11 my home. 

We enjoy more freedoms than any other nation in the world, and it is because of the men and women who put their lives on the line to protect us today and everyday. To our service members, and the families of our service members, thank you for all that you do to keep us safe. 

Suzanne and I are blessed to spend today with our children and grandchildren, surrounded by their love and laughter. I couldn't ask for anything more. From our family to yours, have a very happy Thanksgiving. 


Sincerely, 
￼
Rep. Mike Conaway, 11th District

Dear Friend,   

Thanksgiving is a time to reflect on the many blessings bestowed upon our great nation and with a grateful heart give thanks to God. As we spend time with family and friends it is important to honor the men and women in uniform who defend our freedoms and sacrifice so much for this country who will not be home with their families this Thanksgiving. 
We are all fortunate to live in a democratic nation where we are free and have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I am grateful to serve the incredible people of Colorado and my family and I wish everyone across the state and the country a happy Thanksgiving.”

So much to be thankful for. As I do every year at Thanksgiving, I have written to each member of the U.S. House of Representatives to say thank you for their support and for the generosity of their constituents to the people of the Northern Mariana Islands. The American taxpayer sends tens of millions of dollars each year to our islands to pay for roads, schools, airports, health care, food assistance, water systems, the operation of Commonwealth government offices, and a myriad of other services that otherwise we would have to do without or pay for ourselves. Particularly now, when so many federal dollars are coming to our islands to help with the recovery from typhoons Mangkhut and Yutu, is a good time to say thank you. 
￼
￼

Typhoon Yutu relief updates
￼

￼

Individual and Household Assistance
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved $2.7 million in individual and household disaster assistance. Of the 7,224 registrants, 1,748 have had their applications approved. About 74 percent are still awaiting inspections. 

Disaster Loans
The U.S. Small Business Administration has approved more than $1.5 million in disaster loans for Northern Marianas businesses and residents affected by typhoons Mangkhut and Yutu, the federal agency announced on Monday. SBA has approved $25,100 for businesses and $927,300 for residents for Typhoon Mangkhut; and $587,200 for residents for Super Typhoon Yutu. Click here for more information on where to get one-on-one assistance from SBA representatives.

Power
The Department of Energy estimates 15 to 25 percent of Saipan customers have grid power. All Tinian customers remain without grid power. Crews and equipment have arrived and have started the power restoration mission on Tinian.
 
Water
78 of 131 wells have been restored on Saipan. The Reverse Osmosis water station at Garapan Fishing Base is now closed. Drinkable water is available at the new RO station at Pak Pak Beach in San Antonio. The Pak Pak station is open daily from 7:30 am to 6 pm. Residents must bring their own clean water containers. Tinian has all of its water service restored.

Tents
503 emergency tents have been installed on Saipan as of Sunday, November 18. The Temporary Emergency Tent and Roofing Installation Support (TETRIS) program has a new hotline: 664-9083. And a TETRIS representative is now available to meet in person at the Disaster Recovery Center in the Multi-Purpose Center on Saipan.

Theodore Roosevelt first used the Antiquities Act to designate the Devil’s Tower in Wyoming as a National Monument. Today the Act is under assault by those who would single-handedly take away the protection these unique and priceless areas of our nation have under the Act.
￼

Protecting our heritage

This week I joined 26 Senators and 91 House Members in submitting an amicus brief in a series of cases before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the President’s attempt to shrink two national monuments in Utah. Besides the policy objection—over 1.8 million acres of public land would no longer be protected—the cases represent an important separation of powers issue. In 1906, Congress enacted the Antiquities Act and gave the President the authority to designate national monuments, of which there are now 158. In the view of those of us who filed the amicus, however, only Congress can reduce or re-designate the lands in a national monument once it is created. This is an important congressional authority that must be defended, just as our natural heritage must be defended for the use and enjoyment of those who come after us.
￼

$335k to Homeland Security

The Commonwealth’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Office has been awarded $335,000 from the State and Local Implementation Grant Program. The funds are intended to support states and territories plan for the deployment of the nationwide public safety broadband network, a wireless broadband network created to help police, firefighters, emergency medical services personnel and other public safety entities stay safe and do their jobs. The program was authorized in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. This is the second increment of funding for the Commonwealth under the SLIGP 2.0 grant award. The Commonwealth received the first award of $200,000 in May of this year.

Dear Friend,  I wish you a blessed and happy Thanksgiving with your family.  As I was thinking about this Fort Report, I thought it would be nice to just list some of the good things, good trends happening in our world: 
	•	U.S. unemployment is at its lowest rate in almost 50 years, as millions of Americans find meaningful work.  
	•	Worldwide rates of extreme poverty are at an all-time low.   
	•	In 1969, the river that flows through Cleveland caught fire.  Now it is safe for fishing.
	•	There are more trees across the earth today than there were 36 years ago.   
	•	There has been some slight recovery of bee populations.   
	•	Once near the point of total extinction, mountain gorillas are making a comeback.   
	•	Transitions of power in America still happen through elections.   
	•	Chief Standing Bear was arrested for leaving his reservation to bury his son.  Now his statue will represent Nebraska in the United States Capitol.   
	•	A statue of Willa Cather, whose imagination and vivid portrait of Nebraska prairie life earned her a Pulitzer Prize, will also hold pride of place in the U.S. Capitol.   
	•	Americans give more to charity than anyone else in the world.   
	•	A Muslim-founded crowdfunding site, LaunchGood, raised over $240,000 for Tree of Life Synagogue victims.   
	•	Americans are among the most likely to help a stranger.   
	•	Russians spend 31% of their money on groceries.  Americans spend 6%, the lowest in the world.   
	•	Saturday Night Live actually apologized to new Congressman Dan Crenshaw, a soldier blinded in one eye from the wounds he received in Afghanistan.   
	•	Order being restored: The Nebraska Cornhuskers were victorious in four of their last five football games.  By the time you read this, one more?!
 Sincerely, 
￼  Congressman Jeff Fortenberry

A Purposeful Thanksgiving 


￼
  
Thanksgiving is an all-American holiday, when our country recognizes the great blessings that have been bestowed upon our nation.Our new Democratic House Majority must now honor that spirit of hope by showing that we can govern. We must ensure that the Congress is run with great openness, in the same spirit of transparency as a national town hall meeting.  
￼ 
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi participated in the 21st Annual Interfaith Thanksgiving Prayer Breakfast in San Francisco.  
We must also intensify this springing of hope by demonstrating that Democrats can govern in a bipartisan way, with great conviction in our values and our views, but with the confidence to be unifying and bring peace to the national debate.
As we move forward to deliver our positive, ambitious agenda For The People, we need the best thinking from all our Members. Our new majority will be transformative, invigorated by the fresh vision of our new Members, informed by the diverse voices brought to the table and by our shared desire for progress for our children and for the future.
Turkey Tips from the USDA 
Are you interested in brining a turkey, but aren’t quite sure how to do it safely? The USDA has posted some helpful safety tips in anticipation of Thanksgiving this year. 
Brining simply means to soak your turkey in a water and salt solution (the brine). Often, other ingredients are added to the brine, such as sugar, molasses, honey or corn syrup. The purpose of a brine is to produce a more tender and flavorful turkey. 
According to research published in the Journal of Food Science, the salt in the brine dissolves a bit of the protein in the muscle fibers, and allows the meat to absorb the brine and retain moisture during cooking. This makes the poultry juicier, more tender and improves the flavor. There is no shortage of brine recipes, but to reap the benefits of brining, you must use the following safe steps.  
For the specific steps, see the USDA’s website.

My office recently assisted a Section 8 Project-Based Voucher recipient who was experiencing an issue in her apartment operated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). She had contacted our office because her housing unit had very serious habitability issues that included mold, raw sewage, asbestos, dust, and debris, which had caused her to become sick. She had requested to move to another unit, without any response from her landlord or property management. Therefore, our office contacted HUD on her behalf and conveyed the details of her situation. As a result, the property owner and management were notified, and she was offered relocation to two available units.

Rep. Cuellar Addresses Military Pilot Shortages through FY19 Appropriations Bill
Increasing engagement with HSIs in the 28th District
WASHINGTON— Congressman Henry Cuellar (TX-28) included language addressing military pilot shortages in military bases across the nation and in Texas in a FY19 Appropriations package containing the Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations bills. This language encourages the Department of Defense (DoD) to partner with higher education institutions, including Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and other Minority Serving Institutions to develop programs to better prepare students to meet eligibility requirements of pilot training.
The legislation passed the House and Senate and was signed into law by the President in late September.
Currently, in the Air Force alone, there is a shortage of over 1,800 pilots. This shortage is partly due to a lack of prepared candidates graduating from civilian colleges and universities. This lack of qualified aviator pool leaves the Services scrambling for recruits. Increasing partnerships with educational institutions will develop programs that will prepare more students to meet military eligibility requirements, increasing the aviator pipeline for all branches of the military and helping reduce the DoD’s critical pilot shortage.   
“In an increasingly complex world with diverse threats at home and abroad, military pilots are a vital component to our national security,” said Congressman Cuellar. “This funding will directly address the current pilot shortage, allowing the DoD to compete with the growing demand for our military capabilities. I want to make sure that our military has the necessary resources to augment and reinforce active duty forces as a front line of defense at home and abroad. By encouraging partnerships with DoD, Hispanic Serving Institutions will have what they need to prepare students to meet eligibility requirements of pilot training. Doing so will take steps to improve our military readiness and ensure our national security objectives are achieved.”
Congressman Cuellar continued, “I would like to thank my fellow Appropriators and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman Granger and Ranking Member Visclosky for helping me secure these funds. I would also thank my fellow Texas Representatives for their leadership on this issue.”
Watch Congressman Cuellar speak on the House Floor here. 
Sincerely,
￼
Henry Cuellar

￼ 
  
 
Dear Lindsey, 
I want to wish you and your family a peaceful and joyous start to the holiday season. Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays. It is a time for gratitude, reflection and service. 
This year, I am particularly grateful for our East Bay community.  We have so much to be thankful for, from the diversity of our community to our resilience. California and our nation have endured so much in the last two years, but we persevered and supported one another through the darkest times. As I look forward to the work that lies ahead, thinking of our community gives me strength. I would not be here without you.
On a personal note, I am also deeply grateful for the opportunities I’ve had throughout my life, that have brought me to public service. As the daughter of a veteran, someone who relied on food stamps and public assistance to feed my sons, and climbed out of poverty, I am honored to serve you in Congress and fight for your family. 
I hope you have a restorative and happy Thanksgiving, filled with joy, laughter, and hope. 
As always, my office is here to help you and your family. If you need help with a federal issue, please call my Oakland office at (510) 763-0370. You can also connect with me via email, facebook, twitter, and Instagram. 
Take care, 
￼

Friends, 
As we approach the end of the year and the Thanksgiving holiday, I want to express my thanks to the folks of Iowa’s Third Congressional District. I’m thankful I have had the great honor of representing you in the United States Congress. It has been the most humbling experience of my life. There is nothing I enjoy more than traveling to each of the 16 counties in the Third District every month and speaking with you, your friends, and neighbors from all walks of life.
I’m thankful for our veterans who donned the uniform and served in defense of our liberties, and our service members who continue to bravely wear our nation’s uniform and put themselves in harm’s way often far away from their own family. Last year, I was able to travel to the Middle East to thank our women and men serving far from home in Afghanistan and Kuwait.
It is also a time to pay tribute to the members of our law enforcement who protect our families and neighbors in our communities, ready to respond and help when they need us most. 
I’m thankful we have the right to free speech and to practice the religion of our choosing without government persecution. We have the right to assemble, to petition our government, to private property, and to defend ourselves. These are only some of the freedoms which make up the fabric of this nation, and no one can take them away.
I am thankful for all of the folks who reach out to me by phone, email, letters, and fax. I’m thankful to those who come by my town halls and open office hours. The folks of the Third District are my bosses and I listen to what you are saying, and I take those values and principles and fight for them in Congress. Sometimes we don’t always agree, but whether you are a Democrat, a Republican, or you don’t choose to identify with a party, I value our dialogue and conversations. I value you.
As you gather with loved ones this Thanksgiving, I hope your time is filled with joy. Have a safe and enjoyable Thanksgiving this year. May God bless you and your family, and may God bless Iowa and the United States of America. 
Take care, 
￼

Celebrating 100 Years of Minnesota Farm Organizations
￼
 
The Minnesota Farmers Union and the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation hosted their annual gatherings last weekend. The Minnesota Farm Bureau hosted their 100th Annual Meeting and the Minnesota Farmers Union celebrated their 100th year of serving Minnesota at their 77th Annual Convention. I attended both events on Saturday to speak to members about my work on the House Agriculture Committee, the Farm Bill, and my expectations for the 116th Congress. Both annual events are a great opportunity for members to gather and meet others from around the state. Regional and national experts came to address the members about a range of issues affecting farmers and rural communities. Members of both organizations took this chance to collectively discuss ideas and set priorities for 2019.

On Saturday, a dear friend, Lorraine Cecil, celebrated her 90th birthday and I was pleased to be able to join family and friends at her party in Bemidji. Lorraine retired from her position at Bemidji State University back in 1993, but she has remained active in her community since then and has served as a mentor to many young men and women who have spent time studying and working in Bemidji. Lorraine has also been one of the few people I can count on to give me advice and set me straight when I need it. It was an honor to celebrate her 90 years and I wish her much happiness and good health in the years ahead.

Global Regulatory Director Chloe Pavely
 
Chloe Pavely of Calyxt met with my staff aide Rebekah Solem last week to talk about the work of this technologically innovative, Minnesota-based company that went public last year. The company’s mission is to produce nutritious food and ingredients while putting people first, seeking to use modern technologies as solutions to address today’s challenges in a transparent way. For example, the company is working on a high oleic soybean that has unique nutritional properties. Calyxt is working with local soybean growers and crushers on this product.
 
Mental Health Care Grants Awarded
Congratulations to Greater Minnesota Family Services, in partnership with Southwest West Central Service Coop in Marshall, on receiving $421,992 through a School Innovation Grant. “With many kids coping with trauma, these grants will be a big help to Minnesota families,” said Minnesota Human Services Commissioner Emily Piper. These grants are for intermediate school districts and will provide more access to mental health care for the children that need it most.
 
Thanksgiving Food Safety
￼
 
Last Thanksgiving, Americans consumed an estimated 46 million turkeys. As you celebrate the holiday season, be sure to always follow safe food handling and preparation guidelines to protect your family from foodborne illness. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has prepared Let’s Talk Turkey – A Consumer Guide to Safely Roasting a Turkey that can assist you in safely preparing your Thanksgiving bird. USDA also operates their Meat & Poultry Hotline (1-888-674-6854) that you can call for any last-minute cooking advice.
 
This Week in American History
￼
Minnesota Governor Stephen Miller, 1865
 
On November 24, 1864, Governor Stephen Miller declared a Thanksgiving holiday. This proclamation was in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln's recommendation that the last Thursday in November be used for this purpose. Minnesota had Thanksgiving Day before this declaration, but the holiday was usually celebrated in December. The nation would later debate when to host the holiday until President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an Act of Congress in 1942, making the 4th Thursday in November the national Thanksgiving Day.
 
What’s the Story?
￼
 
Minnesota’s 7th District is home to more than 30,000 farms of different shapes, sizes and specialties. According to USDA’s Census of Agriculture, the 7th District is the number 1 producer of turkeys and sugarbeets in the United States and the number 4 producer of agricultural products overall. Agriculture is vital to Minnesota’s economy and culture, and it is important to remember the hard work that goes into providing an abundant food supply for Americans.

November 21, 2018

BLAINE'S BULLETIN

From Memorial Day barbecues to Fourth of July Fireworks to Thanksgiving meals, Americans across the nation cherish the tradition of togetherness. With 2018 winding down and the holiday season upon us, I hope Americans from coast to coast will focus on the tremendous good in the world and the true blessings in our lives.

This time of year always seems to bring out the best in folks. It is always so encouraging for me to hear stories from my friends, neighbors, and constituents who stand together to support those in need. With many of our fellow Americans facing devastating fires in California or still rebuilding from the disastrous hurricanes in the southeastern U.S., this Thanksgiving is a time to put the little things in perspective and be grateful for what we have.

Growing up in St. Elizabeth, I always looked forward to my big family holidays. And, each year I am reminded of how thankful I am for my growing family. For us, Thanksgiving is a time for turkey, stuffing, pumpkin pie and gathering around to watch football with our children and grandchildren. Over the years, our Thanksgiving table has grown, but many of our traditions have stayed the same. I always look forward to a house full of grandchildren, turkey in the oven, and my wife Jackie’s sweet potato casserole.

As a lifelong Missourian, I often think of my constituents as part of my extended family. In that spirit, I have shared my favorite thanksgiving recipe with all of you, and I hope you and yours will enjoy it as much as the Luetkemeyer family does!

￼

During this season of reflection, I ask you to join me in giving thanks for the many blessings and freedoms that we enjoy as Americans. I hope we will all take this time to keep our brave military members and their families in our thoughts and prayers and do what we can to help others during this holiday season. On behalf of myself, my family, and my staff, I hope everyone has a safe, joyous, and blessed Thanksgiving.

As Majority Whip, I worked hard to bring our Conference together and build coalitions that advanced our pro-growth agenda, and I will bring that same fighting spirit and determination to this new role. Republicans must now sharpen our focus on reestablishing the conservative principles that are proven to help hard-working families have better opportunities to achieve the American Dream.  It is an honor to represent you in Congress.

Dear Friend, 
As we gather this week with family and friends for the Thanksgiving holiday, our thoughts turn to what truly blesses our lives. 
This holiday, I am grateful for the continued opportunity to serve our community, state and nation in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Moving forward I will continue to work with my colleagues on an agenda that works for the people of this country. I look forward to the opportunity the new Congress presents in addressing an agenda that focuses on truly affordable healthcare, good paying jobs that support middle-class families, and assistance for those struggling to cover their basic needs.
As always, it is an honor to represent you. Visit my website, follow me on social media or contact my Indianapolis office at 317-283-6516 if we can be of service in any way.  
Thank you for the honor of continuing to represent you in Congress. Best wishes for a safe, enjoyable Thanksgiving. 

Your friend, ￼  André

Congressman Bruce Westerman’s eNewsletter Wednesday, November 21, 2018
￼
￼
On Friday, I voted to pass H.R. 6784 – the Manage Our Wolves Act.
This bipartisan bill would accomplish what multiple administrations have been attempting to do for over a decade by delisting a species that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has deemed recovered under the Endangered Species Act. The gray wolf has been protected by the Endangered Species Act in its original habitat in the Western Great Lakes region since 1974. The ESA is a form of management that has allowed us to consciously protect this species by relocating and reintroducing the wolves to the western U.S. Now that the population has reached an acceptable level, delisting the gray wolf makes it possible to manage the species population at a constant level. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service attempted to delist the gray wolf in 2009 and 2014 but was challenged by serial litigants. Rather than spend its limited resources protecting vulnerable species, litigation activists have forced the agency to continuously defend every action. This bill will prevent the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from wasting further resources responding to legal action environmental activists. It will also empower states to manage their individual wolf population and provide needed certainty to species management plans. For these reasons, I was glad to cast my vote for H.R. 6784.
Watch my testimony in the House Rules Committee…

What Thanksgiving Means to Me as a Father, Husband, and Congressman (op-ed reposted from the Daily Signal, 2017)
Each year, I love to celebrate Thanksgiving. It’s a time for family, fellowship, and reflection. It’s a time of thanks. 
I’m especially grateful for the holiday this year. It has been a long, divisive year—not only in Washington, D.C., but across the nation. 
At times, it can be difficult to watch, read, or hear the news. We often find stories that fail to unite us, when our immediate need is to rally around our commonalities that bind us as fellow Americans. 
For a moment, even for just a meal, Thanksgiving can alter much of this. Thanksgiving brings family and friends together and puts a pause on the news cycle. Thanksgiving gives us time to think about the blessings in our lives. 
What are you thankful for? 
I’m thankful for my family. I’ve spent most of the year apart from my wife and youngest daughter while in Washington, D.C. The time away from them has reminded me about how blessed I am to have them in my life. 
On the other hand, I have enjoyed the opportunity to spend more time in our nation’s capital with several of my older children, who live and work there. 
I’m thankful for my faith, which strengthens and comforts me. It has helped to establish the principles I stand for in Congress. It gives me clarity when much of life seems muddled. 
I’m thankful for my friends. Their texts, letters, and face-to-face interactions mean so much. They brighten my outlook after a hard day. They keep my focus on doing the right thing for my district, knowing that my votes and actions affect them and their grandchildren’s futures. 
I’m thankful for my country and for all the men and women who have served to keep us free. We live in the greatest country in the world. People from around the globe look at our freedoms and long to experience even a portion of our liberties. 
However, as so many have said, freedom is not free. Many men and women have paid the ultimate price to secure the blessings of freedom for the next generation. 
Let us stay vigilant in our commitment to defend our freedoms. Let us always remember the soldiers who fight for us and their families who sacrifice with them. 
I’m thankful for my constituents. I believe that I represent the greatest district in the greatest state in the union. I understand that many don’t always agree with me. No one ever will. But I respect the right of everyone to bring their ideas, comments, opinions, and critiques to my attention. 
No one person is more important than another, and I’m grateful for all of the passion expressed by my constituents. 
I’m thankful for our Constitution and the founding generation. They created the longest-standing written Constitution in the history of the world. Our structure of government has lasted for over 200 years. This Constitution charted the course for the most powerful country in human history to become a tremendous beacon of freedom. 
I’m thankful for my colleagues in Congress and for our president. We don’t always agree—even within our party. Yet, our discussions and debates have the potential of making our nation stronger. I’m grateful for the privilege of being a member of Congress. 
So, as you celebrate this week, I hope you are surrounded by those you love. May the spirit of thanksgiving lift you, your family, and your friends. I pray that we all will appreciate each other a little more this upcoming year. May we always give thanks for what we have been given. 
Happy Thanksgiving.

News from Representative Gary Palmer
￼
Dear Friend,  As we prepare to give thanks for the many blessings we have as a nation on Thanksgiving, I wanted to provide you a brief update on my activities in Washington and in the District, as well as look ahead to the next Congress. I value staying connected with you and hearing your feedback on the issues important to you. As usual, if my office can assist you, please don’t hesitate to contact us.     Thanks for reading, Gary Palmer 

WHAT YOU’VE BEEN ASKING ABOUT 
Each week, my office receives hundreds of letters, emails, and phone calls from all of you. Thank you for expressing your opinions and taking the time to tell us about the issues that are important to you. I want to highlight one popular subject from the past few weeks here. 
Migrant Caravan: Many of you have recently expressed various concerns and opinions about the caravan of migrants traveling through Mexico and towards the United States. The attention to this issue is heightened because in the last month, the organization Pueblo Sin Fronteras, or, People Without Borders, organized a group of about 5,000 Central Americans to travel to the southern U.S. Border to raise awareness to the thousands of Central Americans that flee to the U.S. each year due to gang violence and political unrest. The stated purpose of the caravan is to raise this awareness and then return home, but some within the caravan plan to seek asylum at the border, even though under international law, those who are truly seeking asylum could have petitioned for asylum in Mexico. I strongly believe that one of the highest priorities of Congress must be to ensure the safety of the American people. We cannot take risks with our national security by allowing people who have not been vetted to enter our country without going through the procedures established by law. Overall, I also believe our immigration system needs serious repair, including a strengthening of interior enforcement and securing of the border. 
  
IN THE DISTRICT 
Town Halls: Throughout October, I hosted town halls in Blountsville, Wilsonville, and Maplesville. It was great to connect with local residents to hear about the issues that are important to you.  
Subcommittee Staff Visit to the Sixth District: As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Affairs, Committee on Oversight & Government Reform, I brought members of the committee staff to Alabama to meet with local government officials to discuss high-priority issues that are affected by onerous federal regulations. We had several meetings with representatives from the Alabama Department of Transportation, county engineers, elected officials, and representatives of the regional planning commissions. We discussed ways to streamline funding for infrastructure improvements, dealing with EPA and federal permits, and the costs associated with binding consent decrees. We also met with school superintendents from a section of Central Alabama to discuss school safety and unfunded federal mandates that are a drain on local school budgets. The staff at the National Association of School Resource Officers also contributed to the discussion on school safety. Additionally, we held several meetings on cyber security, including a tour of the work from Dr. Gary Warner at the UAB Center for Cyber Security, as well as with state officials to discuss Alabama's compliance with federal cyber security and general federal-state information sharing. It was a busy week for committee staffers who will be able to continue this conversation around the country to seek ways to improve and streamline federal-state-local cooperation.
School Visits: 
	•	I recently had the opportunity to speak to Oak Mountain High School’s AP government and politics students. I always appreciate the chance to talk with young people about preparing themselves for leadership and making a positive difference. This visit to Oak Mountain High School has become an annual event that I always look forward to.
￼ 
 
	•	I was also able to speak to the Tarrant High School senior class this month. It was great to discuss making a difference in their families and communities and to encourage them to not be afraid to take chances in life. I was pleased to hear that they are pursuing many different career paths, including vocational technical training and college. 
￼ 
Local Events and Businesses: It’s always great to visit local businesses and attend events in various places around the district. I was able to do many of these throughout October, including: 
	•	Amazon Center Groundbreaking: A new Amazon fulfillment center is now under construction in Bessemer. It is expected to employ 1500 people and to contribute $203 million annually to Jefferson County’s economic output. I’m excited that Amazon has brought their commitment to developing a high-tech job work force to Alabama.
	•	Lakeshore Hospital: I was very encouraged by my visit to the Encompass Health Lakeshore Rehabilitation Hospital. They offer specialized care in a wide variety of therapy fields and many across the Sixth District are reaping the benefits. 
	•	NASRO Headquarters: The National Association of School Resource Officers (NASRO) operates in Hoover and I enjoyed a visit there during this work period. NASRO trains school-based law enforcement officers and offers classes throughout the world. I was glad to tour their facility and to spend time with their Training Director and Director of Operations.
Mayor Meetings: I always appreciate the time I can spend with mayors around the Sixth District and was fortunate to meet with several of them during this work period, including Vestavia Hills Mayor Ashley Curry at the Vestavia Hills Chamber of Commerce luncheon, Locust Fork Mayor Joe Hughes at a Town Council meeting in Locust Fork, Wilsonville Mayor Lee McCarty during our town hall in Wilsonville, and Hoover Mayor Frank Brocato on the NASRO tour. I’m grateful to each of these mayors for their commitment to helping cities across the Sixth District grow and thrive.
  
LOOKING AHEAD 
As we prepare for the 116th Congress, I’m looking forward to serving as chairman for the Republican Policy Committee. I appreciate the faith that my colleagues have placed in me and am grateful for their support. Throughout my career, I have focused on being a problem solver and developing and promoting sound policies, so I feel like I’m uniquely prepared for this role. I look forward to working with my colleagues as we continue advancing and promoting ideas supported by the American people. 
  
HAPPY THANKSGIVING 
When most people think of Thanksgiving, they think of the Pilgrims, Plymouth Colony, and the Wampanoag Indians celebrated the first harvest of the Colonists after a brutal winter. While many arbitrary feasts were celebrated in the years following, in 1863, President Lincoln issued a proclamation during the Civil War that really established Thanksgiving as an American holiday. In his proclamation, Lincoln asked God to “commend to his tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners, or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife” and to “heal the wounds of the nation.” Thanksgiving was then made an official celebration. In the fall of 1941, both house of Congress passed a joint resolution establishing the fourth Thursday of November as Thanksgiving Day. As a nation, we have much to give thanks for and I hope that you enjoy this time with your family and commend care to those in need. Happy Thanksgiving.

Dear Friend, 
During the holiday season, we celebrate the many things we are grateful for, including our family, friends, and Valley neighbors. 
While we can sometimes take our blessings for granted, I invite you to join me in appreciating the many things we do have. As we gather with our loved ones during the holidays, let us give thanks for our countless blessings but also remember those who may be struggling.
There are many opportunities in our Valley to give back around this time of year. 
You can help those who wonder where their next meal will come from by working with one of our local food banks. For more information, visit http://www.cdss.ca.gov/Food-Banks. 
It is also important to keep in mind our current military servicemembers, veterans, and their families, whether they are spending the holiday here or abroad. For more information and helpful resources on how you can help military families and veterans, please visit https://www.fresno.va.gov/giving/index.asp.

Dear Friend,  
This week, I wish everyone a Happy Thanksgiving and safe travels. I also reminded my constituents that open enrollment for health insurance policies through HealthCare.gov is now underway, hailed Senate passage of my bill to name the Autumn Avenue post office for Judge Russell B. Sugarmon, met with a West Point Cadet from Memphis, noted that my next “Congress On Your Corner” is set for Monday evening, offered U.S. Capitol Historical Society 2019 calendars and provided a health tip about healthy eating during the holidays. Keep reading to learn more about my week and follow me on Twitter and Facebook to see more updates as they happen.   
Celebrating Thanksgiving  Flagging Open Enrollment Now Available at HealthCare.gov    Praising Senate Passage of Judge Russell Sugarmon Post Office Bill  Meeting with a West Point Cadet from Memphis  Holding My Next “Congress On Your Corner”    Offering U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars    Signing Up for “Congress On Your Corner” and this e-Newsletter    Weekly Health Tip    Quote of the Week 

Celebrating Thanksgiving 
￼ 
I want to wish all my friends, neighbors and constituents a very Happy Thanksgiving. If you’re traveling “over the river and through the woods” this week, I hope you will drive safely and have a nice time with family and friends. Americans have officially celebrated Thanksgiving as a national holiday since November 1863, when President Abraham Lincoln first proclaimed it, but many Americans already had family traditions of a Thanksgiving meal in November for generations – dating from the Jamestown, Virginia, settlement in 1610 and the Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts in 1621 -- and George Washington had proclaimed November 26, 1789 a day of “public thanksgiving” for the new U.S. Constitution. The traditions around this most American of holidays are simple but profound.  
Flagging Open Enrollment Now Available at HealthCare.gov 
￼ 
Open enrollment for 2019 HealthCare.gov insurance plans is now under way. This year, open enrollment runs only through December 15. I will be making use of every possible means to make my constituents aware that the time available to sign up has been limited again this year compared to the enrollment periods during the Obama Administration -- six weeks shorter than it was in 2016. Listen for my public service radio announcement encouraging signing up. For more information on signing up for health care, see Healthcare.gov.      
Praising Senate Passage of My Judge Russell Sugarmon Post Office Bill 
I am pleased to report that the U.S. Senate has passed my bill, H.R. 5349, to rename the post office at 1320 Autumn Avenue in Memphis for Judge Russell B. Sugarmon Jr., the Civil Rights leader, attorney and judge. I look forward to a future dedication ceremony.  
Meeting with West Point Cadet Trevor Powers 
￼ 
I’m invariably impressed when I meet with young people who have accepted admission to one of our great service academies. On Monday, I met in my Memphis office with my 9th District U.S. Military Academy at West Point Cadet Trevor Powers, in town for an early Thanksgiving break to do some recruiting at local Shelby County high schools. No longer a first-year ""plebe,"" but a cadet, he said the West Point experience is all that he wished for and exceeds his expectations. He is a fine young man and has a very promising future. Earlier this fall, I traveled to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, to meet with my constituents who are serving as undergraduate Midshipmen there. These young patriots continue to make us proud.  
Holding My Next “Congress On Your Corner”   
My Memphis staff and I will hold an evening “Congress On Your Corner” for those who can’t make our daytime events, on Monday, November 26, at the Benjamin Hooks Central Library, 3030 Poplar, in Memphis, from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m.As your representative in Congress, part of my job is making sure your concerns and issues with federal agencies and federal benefits are dealt with fairly and expeditiously. We can help with Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits and military service issues, Small Business Administration (SBA) loans and services, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) home loans, federal grant applications, visas and passports, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issues and more.    
Offering U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars   

￼ 
My office will soon have a limited number of 2019 U.S. Capitol Historical Society calendars available. If you would like to receive a calendar, please complete this form on my website. Due to the rules of the House, I can mail calendars only to residents of Tennessee’s 9th Congressional District. Please feel free to share this email with other residents of the 9th District who may be interested in receiving one but who do not receive my e-Newsletter.   
Signing Up for “Congress On Your Corner” and this e-Newsletter   

￼   
I enjoy meeting regularly with constituents in the district and helping get answers for them to questions about dealing with federal agencies. If you are interested in attending one of my “Congress on Your Corner” events, you can sign up here to receive notification as soon as the next event is scheduled.   
For those who haven’t participated in a telephone town hall, it’s easy to sign up for them by using this form.     
If you would like to receive this weekly e-Newsletter, or share it with others, you can do that with this form.   
Weekly Health Tip

￼
Each week, I share a health tip in the hope of promoting a healthy lifestyle for residents of the 9th Congressional District. As always, it is best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine or lifestyle.   

You may not think of the Thanksgiving spread of turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing and gravy as a particularly healthful dining experience, but some traditional Thanksgiving side dishes, like squash and cranberries, add a special something to our diets that we don’t indulge in often enough. For example, a cup of cooked squash has plenty of Vitamin A, an essential vitamin associated with vision health. Similarly, cranberries are an excellent source of Vitamins A, C and K and are known to improve immune response and lower blood pressure. The Centers of the Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has healthy eating tips for the holidays here, including eating from small plates and bringing a healthy dish to a pot luck party. FoodSafety.gov, a partnership of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration, has useful tips for preparing a holiday turkey. See them here. Happy Thanksgiving.  

Quote of the Week  
“The year that is drawing towards its close, has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God.” – Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Thanksgiving Proclamation.
I'm looking forward to the Tigers-Houston Cougars football game Friday and will be rooting for a win and another chance to meet up with UCF. It's been a great sports week for the Tigers welcoming James Wiseman to our basketball family. Lots of games this weekend. Go Tigers!   
As always, I remain

Dear Friends, 
 
I want to wish you and your family a Happy Thanksgiving. I’ve been in town this week meeting with constituents, and I’m looking forward to spending Thanksgiving with my family as well. 
 
I thoroughly enjoyed participating in events recently honoring our veterans throughout the district and had the distinct honor of recognizing Vietnam veterans at the Art Institute of Atlanta’s Veterans Day Program and attending a veterans job fair in Tucker.  
 
As we move toward the close of 2018 and prepare for 2019, I want to reflect on all the things we are thankful for in Georgia's Fourth Congressional District. 
 
I look forward to giving Thanksgiving blessings on Thursday with my family, and I want to wish a Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family during this 2018 holiday season. 
 
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to represent you in Congress.

Friend-
As I look back on the last year, I’m impressed with the all work this Congress has to done improve the lives of folks all across our nation. From job creation to rising wages, I’ve seen how our booming economy has improved people’s lives. I’ve had service members share how grateful they are for restored, on-time funding. I’ve celebrated long-overdue federal recognition with our Virginia Indian Tribes. I’ve watched our students benefit from an emphasis on STEM and career and technical education. That’s just a few examples of the countless ways I’ve seen the work of this Congress impact the First District, and that is a lot to be thankful for.
That being said, I’d love to hear what Congressional accomplishment you’re most thankful for this year.
Restored military readiness Strengthened  career and technical education programs Regulatory rollback Tax reform Resources to combat the opioid epidemic Virginia Tribal Recognition Improved access to veterans benefits and care I don't know Other 
￼
I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with me. Your opinion helps me shape my thinking as I represent you in Washington.
Sincerely,
Rob

Dear friends,
It is during this time of year Americans tend to feel one common sentiment: thankful. Thanksgiving, and the role it plays in marking the beginning of the Christmas season, reminds us of the many ways in which we have been blessed.
It is a time for Americans to put aside our differences and break bread together. It will always be a chance for all of us to take a step back, acknowledge how blessed we truly are, and thank God for the grace and goodness He has shown us. 
From the bottom of my heart and from all of my family, thank you for giving us the opportunity to serve the great state of Oklahoma in Congress. I will continue to serve you to the best of my ability as your Member of Congress. If ever I or my team can do anything to assist you, please don’t hesitate to let me know.  
￼
From the Mullin family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving. May you find plenty of reasons to give thanks today, tomorrow, and every day after.

Thank you, ￼
Markwayne Mullin
Member of Congress

 Happy Thanksgiving
This week as a nation we celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday. It's a time for us to all take a moment to pause and think about what we are truly thankful for. I think this holiday is always so fitting, especially during a time when it's so easy to complain about what we don't have or feel weighed down by the negativity we see on the news. So I think in this newsletter I would like to talk a little bit about what I am thankful for. 

I am thankful for my wife Stacy and my children, Will and Delaney. I am thankful to be able to serve the wonderful folks of Arkansas' 1st District. I am thankful for our freedom that is defended by our military everyday. I am thankful to be an Arkansan- there is nowhere else I'd rather be raising a family and representing everyday in Washington DC. 

I hope you all have a wonderful and blessed Thanksgiving!

FAQ (What folks have been calling/texting my office about this week)
Q: I have been hearing continued talks of border wall funding possibly being voted on. Where do you stand on this?  A: I have long been a supporter of funding a wall along our southern border. True immigration reform cannot begin until we have secured our borders. If we don't, we will continue to face these problems down the line. Rep. McCarthy recently introduced a border wall funding bill that I plan on supporting when it comes to the Floor for a vote. I actually wrote a newsletter a few weeks ago on this very topic.

On Capitol Hill, Crawford works to highlight the importance of those who serve in that capacity.
On Wednesday, the Republican from Jonesboro was on hand for EOD Day on the Hill, an event that drew young service members and silver-haired military brass.

Poll: FDA E-Cigarette Regulations
Hoosiers,

On Thursday, November 15th, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced new regulatory guidance aimed at reducing minors’ use of e-cigarettes. According to the FDA, e-cigarette use, from 2017-2018, increased 78 percent among high school students and 48 percent among middle school students. 

In his announcement, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. said these new policies strive to “strike a careful public health balance between our imperative to enable the opportunities to transition to non-combustible products to be available for adults and our solemn mandate to make nicotine products less accessible and less appealing to children.”

Question of the Week: Do you support the FDA's efforts to prevent minors from becoming addicted to nicotine?

[_] Yes.
[_] No.
[_] I don't know.
[_] Other (share your thoughts).

Dear Friend,
 
As you probably know, earlier this month the Labor Department announced two pieces of spectacular news for our already-booming economy!
 
First, it was reported that wages and salaries for Americans rose by 3.1% over the past 12 months. That marks the highest level of growth for worker pay in 10 years!  
 
Then, two days later, we learned that 250,000 jobs were created in October -- 60,000 more than expected -- and that our nation's unemployment level remains at a historic 49-year low. Since the enactment of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act nearly 11 months ago, more than 2.1 million new jobs have been created!
 
Each of these impressive reports smashed expectations and confirmed the fact that conservative leadership and policies in Washington are working and that America is truly winning again!

Here's what some others had to say:
 
Jason Furman, former chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers: ""I'm not seeing anything bad in this jobs report. Strong hourly wage growth, even stronger weekly wage growth, higher labor force participation, lower broader underemployment, while job growth bounced back from last month and the unemployment rate remained low.""
 
Neil Irwin, New York Times correspondent: ""Man, this is a really great jobs report. The job market is firing on all cylinders: Strong job growth (especially for this stage of expansion), wages rising faster, more people in labor force."" 
 
James Freeman, Wall Street Journal columnist: ""As Republicans prepare to make their closing arguments to U.S. voters, GOP candidates can justly say that their policies have yielded exceptional results. The economic revival they promised in 2016 has come to pass.""   
 
Let's keep America rolling in the right direction! 
 
Sincerely,
 
 

PS: Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family!
 
  
 
  

SPECIAL NOTE FROM REP. KELLY

I am incredibly thankful to have had the honor of serving as Western Pennsylvania's voice in Congress for the past eight years. I look forward to continuing that role as Representative of the new 16th District next year! The future is bright! God bless!
 
  

Rep. Kelly's Bipartisan
GAIIN Act Gains Momentum
  
Innovative infrastructure bill endorsed by House Majority Leader
 
Attracts co-sponsors from conservative and progressive caucuses 
    
Bipartisan legislation introduced by U.S. Representative Mike Kelly (R-PA) known as the Generating American Income and Infrastructure Now (GAIIN) Act (H.R. 6104) has gained impressive traction over the last few months in the U.S. Congress.
 
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) endorses the GAIIN Act
 
Leader McCarthy: ""Rebuilding America's infrastructure is an intense national priority that persistently lacks a sufficient response. To help solve these stubborn challenges we should debate big, bold ideas. We are in a time of disruption to the old ways of Washington that centered policy debates on old ideas with a new coat of paint. The great promise of the Trump Administration is that we can break through stalemate and stale ideas to build an economy that works for all Americans, especially Americans facing hardship. The GAIIN Act is an example of an alternative solution that deserves consideration to achieve our shared goal for a better American infrastructure in our communities most in need.""
 
Uncommon lawmakers find common ground
 
In addition to Rep. Kelly, co-sponsors of the GAIIN Act now include...
 
Members of the Congressional Black Caucus and Progressive Caucus: Rep. Lacy Clay (D-MO), Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), and Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-FL)
 
Members of the House Freedom Caucus and Financial Services Committee: Rep. Ted Budd (R-NC), Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH), Rep. Alex Mooney (R-WV)
 
Reps. Kelly and Clay co-author bipartisan op-ed for RealClearPolitics.com
 
Excerpts from ""Bipartisan Bill Would Boost Infrastructure, Trim Debt"":
 
As members of the Democratic and Republican parties, we disagree on most issues, but we share the common belief that more can and must be done to help lift up the most impoverished communities in our country. While many of the problems in these areas cannot be cured by government alone, Washington policymakers can take certain actions to begin directing resources to the places that need them most.
 
For this purpose, we (along with Rep. Ted Budd of North Carolina) introduced a bipartisan bill (HR 6104) in June known as the Generating American Income and Infrastructure Now (GAIIN) Act to help fund critical infrastructure projects in the poorest areas of the nation. It would do so without any new taxes or spending and would simultaneously help pay down our record-high national debt.
 
...
 
Reviving America's poorest cities and towns is a moral, fiscal, and economic imperative. It is rare than one piece of legislation can meet this objective on its own, let alone bring together conservative Republicans and progressive Democrats from minority communities. Even rarer is a bill that attracts the co-sponsorship of lawmakers in the House Freedom Caucus, the Black Congressional Caucus, and the Progressive Caucus just a few months before an election. But the GAIIN Act is that kind of bill.
 
Reps. Kelly and Clay appear on A&E's ""Matter of Fact with Soledad O'Brien""
 
O'Brien: ""Collapsing roads and bridges, unsafe drinking water, and run-down schools are all problems that both parties say we need to fix, but like many problems facing Republicans and Democrats, they usually don't agree on the solution. Now, conservatives and liberals have reached common ground on an infrastructure bill that would invest in America's poorest communities. Democratic Congressman Lacy Clay of Missouri and Republican Congressman Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, nice to have you both. Very rarely does a liberal member of Congress and a conservative member of Congress sit down and come up with bills together.""
 
WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW HERE 
 
BACKGROUND
 
The GAIIN Act (H.R. 6104) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on June 14, 2018, by Reps. Mike Kelly (R-PA), Lacy Clay (D-MO), and Ted Budd (R-NC).
 
Federal agencies currently hold more than $2 trillion in debt and lease assets that, if sold, could raise a significant amount of money. The sale of these fixed-rated debt assets at this time would maximize asset value, considering that interest rates are on the rise and the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening program is on the horizon. As interest rates rise, the value of the agency assets will decline-perhaps substantially. Importantly, the sales would not alter the terms of the loans. The consumer protection obligations associated with eligible Department of Agriculture loans and guarantees would convey with the sale, thereby minimizing impact on borrowers.
 
Additionally, borrowers would be given 30-days' notice of any sale and offered the opportunity to refinance at the same price of a potential sale. The GAIIN Act's authors believe that there are sufficient private sector programs available for borrowers to refinance their loans at the discounted value. Any loans that remain outstanding would be eligible for sale to investors, which, under the GAIIN Act, would occur without recourse and create no liability for the U.S. government. Servicing would be provided by private entities with the demonstrated capacity to effectively service such loans.
 
During the Reagan administration, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-509) required specified federal agencies to sell certain outstanding loans. For example, the program required the Secretary of Agriculture to sell debt assets held in the Farmers Home Administration Rural Development Insurance Fund over a three-year period. The proposal outlined within the GAIIN Act is modeled on the earlier program and incorporates its various provisions. 
 
 
  

Kelly-Backed Opioid Package Signed into Law  
by President Trump  

Includes Kelly bills to block synthetic opioid shipments into US, protect at-risk seniors from opioid abuse 
   
 
Rep. Kelly with fellow co-sponsors of H.R. 6 at the official White House signing ceremony  
 
On October 24th, Rep. Kelly issued the following statement after H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, was signed into law by President Donald J. Trump. The comprehensive legislation included two bills originally sponsored by Rep. Kelly: the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention (STOP) Act (H.R. 5788) and the Protecting Seniors from Opioid Abuse Act (H.R. 5684), which was added to H.R. 6 as part of the Preventing Addiction for Susceptible Seniors (PASS) Act (H.R. 5773).
 
""The opioid crisis is a national crisis. It is devastating families and communities in Western Pennsylvania and all over our country. I have witnessed its awful impact up close and personally. In an era of intense political polarization, I am so grateful that we were able to come together as a unified Congress to deliver such a powerful blow against this deadly epidemic on so many fronts. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act is the most far-reaching congressional action against a single drug crisis in American history. I'm proud to have contributed specific measures that will protect vulnerable seniors from dangerous addiction and stop synthetic drugs from being trafficked into our communities from overseas. This is about nothing less than saving lives. It was a true honor to be at the White House with President Trump as he enacted this historic law and made every American family safer.""

Rep. Kelly Hosts Public Forum with U.S. Secret Service on Preventing School Violence

 100+ schools represented as security professionals share expert guidance to help prevent on-campus attacks 
   
 
Rep. Kelly with U.S. Attorney Scott W. Brady, U.S. Secret Service NTAC Research Specialist Ashley Blair, U.S. Secret Service NTAC Lead Social Research Specialist Steven Driscoll, and U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Timothy Burke 
 
On October 16th, Rep. Kelly hosted a public forum with U.S. Attorney Scott Brady and personnel from the U.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC) for local school administrators to learn the latest expertly-developed best practices for increasing school safety and implementing targeted violence prevention plans. The event was held at the Passavant Center at Thiel College in Greenville, Pennsylvania, and was attended by administrators from numerous school districts in (and outside of) the Third Congressional District, as well as many local law enforcement officials.
 
Statement by Rep. Kelly:
 
""There is nothing more important the safety of our children. This forum was about making sure we are doing everything in our power - as teachers, police officers, and public officials - to guarantee that students can be completely free from danger when they go to school. I was very proud to host this event and thank every person who attended from both near and very far.""

Rep. Kelly Applauds New Trade Deal to Repeal NAFTA 
  
Kelly serves on Ways & Means
Trade Subcommittee and 
President's Export Council
   
On October 1st, Rep. Kelly issued the following statement regarding the successful completion of negotiations to replace the North-American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with a new deal known as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
 
""I strongly congratulate President Trump and Ambassador Lighthizer on securing a new and far better trade agreement with our neighbors to the north and south. This is a major win for American workers, jobs, consumers, and small businesses in Western Pennsylvania and all over our country. By effectively beginning the repeal and replacement of NAFTA, this administration has once again made history by defying the expectations of many and doing what others only pledged to do. As my staff and I continue to review the details of the agreement, we will make certain that it supports our industries, such as dairy and manufacturing, and that it meets the rigorous standards set by Trade Promotion Authority. The role of Congress in ratifying trade deals is one that I take very seriously and will perform with the upmost care. It is good news like today's trade announcement that has already sent our economy skyrocketing and will continue to inspire confidence in the future.""
 
IMPORTANT: Since last year, in meetings and letters, Rep. Kelly has personally advocated for a provision in the USMCA to permit home shopping channels to distribute into Canada to allow Pennsylvania companies access to the Canadian retail consumer market. This provision was successfully included in the text of USMCA released last month (chapter 15, page, 21). It will directly benefit every small business in Pennsylvania that sells its products via QVC (a PA-based company) and similar shopping platforms. A copy of the Kelly-led letter to the Ambassador of Canada from November 2017 can be viewed here.

House Passes Tax Reform 2.0 w/Kelly Bill to Promote  
Family Savings
  
 Package makes recent tax cuts for middle-income Americans & small businesses permanent 
 
 
 
WATCH HERE  
  
On September 28th, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a legislative package known as ""Tax Reform 2.0"" including the Family Savings Act of 2018 (H.R. 6757), which U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA) -- a member of the House Ways and Means Committee -- introduced earlier in the month. The House-passed package also includes the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018 (H.R. 6760) and the American Innovation Act of 2018 (H.R. 6756), each of which Rep. Kelly is an original co-sponsor. 
 
Statement by Rep. Kelly on final passage of Tax Reform 2.0:
 
""I am thrilled to see the People's House pass all three pillars of Tax Reform 2.0 with bipartisan support. After the undeniable success of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for every American, passing a sequel to make its best parts permanent is just plain common sense. When my colleagues and I crafted and enacted tax reform last year, our goal was clear: lower taxes for middle-income families and workers, more jobs, and a stronger economy. With millions of households now enjoying more take-home pay and a skyrocketing economy producing more job openings than ever before, our goal wasn't just met-it was surpassed. 
 
""With Tax Reform 2.0, Americans don't just get to keep more of their hard-earned money-they'll have all-new ways to save it for the future. Real financial security is measured not by how much one makes but how much one saves, and currently, we're a nation of spenders and not savers. My Family Savings Act contains numerous provisions to change that trend and help Americans better prepare for retirement and whatever life may throw their way. Simply put: just as tax reform was about putting more money in every hardworking taxpayer's pocket, Tax Reform 2.0 is about helping them save that money earlier and easier.""
 
Excerpt of Rep. Kelly's floor speech on the Family Savings Act (H.R. 6757):
 
""I rise in support of H.R. 6757, the Family Savings Act, which will make it easier for families and individuals to save for their future, whether it's retirement, education, or healthcare, helping them to make sure they're keeping more of their hard-earned money and planning for the future. This bill will also help local businesses provide retirement plans to their workers and help workers participate more in those plans.
 
...
 
""One of the things I remember so clearly from growing up is my parents saying to me and my siblings, 'We never want to be a burden to you kids.' And I thought as a young person that I could never think of my parents as a burden to me - not for everything they did for me. But just think about that for a minute. That generation - the 'Greatest Generation' - was telling us they never wanted to be a burden to the next generation. And what we're talking about today is relieving the burden on the next generation by making it easier for people to go into retirement feeling that they have enough income to enjoy their golden years.""
 
Statement by Ways & Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) on H.R. 6760:
 
""Middle-class families and our small businesses deserve to keep more of what they earn each and every year. This is an important step forward to keep the economic momentum of America rolling. It's encouraging to receive 44 Democratic votes in support of elements of Tax Reform 2.0. I'm confident that working with the Senate we can advance these bipartisan bills to the President's desk.""
 
Chairman Brady on H.R. 6756 and 6757:
 
""House Republicans showed the American people today that we're committed to changing the culture in Washington where we used to do tax reform only once a generation. These two bills ensure American families have the resources they need to save more and earlier and give future entrepreneurs the tools to move from the kitchen table to Main Street and beyond. Tax Policy Chairman Vern Buchanan and Rep. Mike Kelly led the charge on these efforts, and this legislation is going to make a real difference for families, new businesses, and communities across the country.""
 
 
  
Following the passage of the third and final piece of Tax Reform 2.0, Rep. Kelly joined Ways & Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady in the Capitol to discuss the bills with press
 
One-page summaries of each pillar of Tax Reform 2.0 can be found at the links below:
 
	1.	Promoting financial security by helping families save more money for retirement & more(Rep. Kelly's bill)
	2.	Protecting tax cuts for individuals, families, & small businesses by making them permanent 
	3.	Supporting innovation by helping entrepreneurs turn their ideas into enterprises 
NOTE: The Family Savings Act (H.R. 6757) is supported by numerous major organizations, including AARP, the American Securities Association, Associated Builders and Contractors, the American Council of Life Insurers, Americans for Tax Reform, the Heritage Foundation, the National Electrical Contractors Association, and many others. A larger list of supporters of Tax Reform 2.0 can be viewed here and here. A letter from the Family Research Council specifically praising the bill's pro-life provision recognizing ""unborn children"" can be read here.
 
BACKGROUND: The Family Savings Act contains many provisions of a bipartisan bill previously introduced by Rep. Kelly known as the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act (RESA) of 2018(H.R. 5282). Rep. Kelly is the founder and co-chairman of the bipartisan House Retirement Security Caucus.

As a member of the President's Export Council, Rep.

Rep. Kelly recently visited several breweries throughout Butler County, including Butler Brew Works, Missing Links Brewery, and Recon Brewing.
 
Each owner of these small businesses described how they are already befitting from the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act's lower tax rates. As co-chairman of the House Small Brewers Caucus, Rep. Kelly made sure the new law also included an extra provision that specifically lowers the federal excise tax on breweries, wineries and distilled spirits producers.
 
With Pennsylvania being ranked the largest craft beer producer of all 50 states, the inclusion of this provision is a victory for the hundreds of Keystone manufacturers and entrepreneurs in this industry and especially the thousands of workers and livelihoods they're able to support-with more jobs to come!

NEWS FROM WASHINGTON AND ACROSS WEST TEXAS
Dear Friend, 
Midterm elections may have come and gone, but we’ve got work to finish up before the end of the year. As we head into the home stretch, my focus remains the same: delivering conservative policies that improve the lives of the good people of West Texas - included in that is passing a strong Farm Bill that supports producers in West Texas.   
Conference Leadership 
Last week, my colleagues and I held leadership elections for the 116th Congress that will begin in January. As Republicans head into the minority, I believe Representative Kevin McCarthy is the best choice to lead our Conference, and I am proud to have supported his election for Minority Leader for the 116th Congress. Kevin has fostered a strong relationship with President Trump as Majority Leader, and in his previous roles, he has shown true grit and commitment to the American people and the future of our party. I am confident, he will lead our team in the House well and will work with our Republican colleagues in the Senate to counter the progressive policies driven by the Democrat Speaker, whoever it may be. 
I am also proud to have supported Representative Steve Scalise for Whip. Steve is a principled conservative with a strong voice for traditional American values and has a record of advancing our pro-growth, pro-American agenda. These two, alongside Representative Liz Cheney, an expert communicator and soon to be Conference Chair, will power our Conference to victory over the next two years. 
Better Budgeting 
At the heart of our country’s debt crisis is a fundamentally broken budget and appropriations process that time and again has failed to cure Washington’s addiction to spend more money than we take in. 
That is why over the past eight months my colleagues and I on the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform have been working in a bipartisan manner to develop meaningful reforms to improve the federal budget process so we can better steward the American people’s hard-earned tax dollars. Last week, our Committee met to share and debate some of our recommendations. See here for the first part of our discussion. The remaining debate will resume November 27th.  
￼ 
Our nation’s debilitating debt is a problem that cannot continue to go unsolved, and I am hopeful the House will take up the Committee’s proposals so we can put our country on a more fiscally sustainable course going forward and create a brighter future for our children and grandchildren.
National Rural Health Day 
Texas is home to the most critical access hospitals - many of those located right here in West Texas. With 90 rural hospitals nationwide closing since 2010 and nearly 700 at risk of doing the same, it is important we find ways to bridge the gap between urban and rural healthcare systems.    Throughout the 115th Congress, I have supported and sponsored efforts to revitalize our healthcare system and to ensure rural hospitals have the resources they need. To keep our economy thriving and our local communities strong, the American people need access to care.
￼ 
Higher Education Accessibility 
Big news for Texas Tech University and our region with the ""Powered by Publics: Scaling Student Success"" initiative. Texas Tech is a hub for education, and this initiative will enable even more students to pursue higher education. Proud of Texas Tech and proud to be a Red Raider! See here for Fox 34’s write-up on the initiative. 
New Plainview Chief
Congrats, Timothy Gibson, on being appointed Plainview’s new Fire Chief. Thank you and all of our first responders for keeping our communities safe. See here for the Plainview Daily Herald’s article on Fire Chief Gibson. 
Please know, it is an honor to be your Representative. Feel free to reach out to my office and let me know how I can best serve you. I hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving!

￼

November 20, 2018 
Dear Friend,  
It continues to be a great honor to serve and represent you in the U.S. Senate. The following is a brief update on just some of the issues I’ve been working on.  
￼ 
Honoring Those We Lost Aboard the USS Thresher 
￼ 
The legacy of the USS Thresher submarine holds an important place in our hearts in New Hampshire, having been built at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. Fifty-five years after it sank and took the lives of the 129 men aboard, I’m urging the Army Secretary to establish a monument at the Arlington National Cemetery to honor the sacrifice of the 129 Americans who died aboard. New Hampshire families lost loved ones on that fateful morning of April 10, 1963, as did communities across New England and the country. I'm working with Senators on both sides of the aisle to advocate for this memorial. The memorial would be a fitting tribute to these heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice.     
Small Business Saturday 
￼  
Small businesses are the foundation of our economy in New Hampshire, and this afternoon, I stopped by a few great ones in Rochester, ahead of Small Business Saturday this weekend. It was great to be joined by Mayor McCarley, Greta Johansson from the New Hampshire SBA, and others as we visited Sweet Peach's Candy and Confections, The Artisans' Gallery, and the Rochester Opera House Performance and Arts Center. I would encourage every Granite Stater to visit a local small business during Small Business Saturday. I know I will!  
My Morning In Manchester 
￼￼ 
It was wonderful to join the Families in Transition New Horizons Thanksgiving breakfast this morning to discuss two critical issues impacting our community: homelessness and food insecurity. The affordable housing shortage in New Hampshire leaves far too many families without a place to call home, and often goes hand-in-hand with issues of food insecurity. Organizations like Families in Transition play an important role in addressing both homelessness and food insecurity in New Hampshire, and are vital resources to our families in need. Later, I spoke at the 33rd Annual Toys for Tots Campaign Kickoff at the Mall of New Hampshire. The U.S. Military Corps Reserve Toys for Tots program collects and distributes gifts for less fortunate children during the holiday season. I applaud their efforts and I was pleased to join them for the kickoff this morning.
Strengthening America's International Leadership 
￼ 
This past weekend, I led a bipartisan delegation to the 10th annual Halifax International Security Forum in Halifax, Nova Scotia. As a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, I believe it’s critically important that the United States maintains strong alliances to maintain national security and promote global stability. I was honored to receive the Halifax Forum's Builder Award for my efforts to strengthen our alliances and our cooperation with other democracies. This forum had 300 delegates from around the world and led to very productive discussions on strategic cooperation on common security goals. In the past, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) and I would lead the U.S. delegation. He was dearly missed at this year’s forum. It was wonderful to have his wife, Mrs. Cindy McCain in attendance.
￼ 
Holding Saudi Arabia Accountable for its Crimes 
Regarding foreign policy, I wanted to provide a brief update on my bipartisan efforts in the Senate to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for their actions, specifically the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Much of the world watched on in horror after Khashoggi's barbaric murder, and I have been clear since the beginning that this, as well as Saudi Arabia's continued detention of activists and indiscriminate bombing campaign in Yemen, deserves a strong, bipartisan response. I was pleased to see the administration introduce preliminary sanctions last week, but it was clear that their list was not comprehensive. Last week I joined Senators on both sides of the aisle in introducing strong, bipartisan legislation to hold Saudi Arabia accountable. America’s response to Khashoggi’s murder has significant implications for our credibility around the globe, and there must be further sanctions on Saudi leadership who ordered this assassination. We must send a clear message that the United States stands unequivocally on the side of human rights and democratic values.  
One of the Greatest Red Sox Teams of All Time 
￼  
I was very excited to join New England Senators in releasing a resolution last week honoring the Red Sox World Series Championship. This Red Sox team will go down in history, not just for winning the World Series, but for being one of the greatest Red Sox teams of all time. Baseball in New England is more than a sport - it's a part of our culture. I'm thrilled to join with other Senators throughout the region to celebrate the Red Sox's exceptional season, and to pay tribute to the players and management who've made us all so proud.

11/20/18 17:29,Bergman Announces Soo Lock Funding Added to Army Corps FY19 Work Plan,"  
￼

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  Nov 20, 2018
CONTACT: James Hogge 231-640-9158

Bergman Announces Soo Lock Funding Added to Army Corps FY19 Work Plan

Washington -Today, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers submitted to Congress its updated FY19 work plan, which includes funding for construction of a new Poe-sized lock at the Soo Locks complex. Congressman Jack Bergman released the following statement in response:
“This is great news for Michigan’s First District, the Great Lakes region, and the entire U.S. economy, which relies on the Soo Locks. I'm proud of the progress we’ve made to finally break ground on a project that’s been delayed for decades. I also applaud the Trump Administration for acknowledging the importance of a new Lock, and for working with the House, Senate, and Great Lakes industries to make construction of a new Lock in Sault Ste. Marie a reality. This new construction funding, coupled with the $57 million allocated in FY18 for modernization of the Poe, is a great next step. I’m looking forward to working with my colleagues to continue getting the job done for northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula.
Earlier this year, Congressman Jack Bergman joined Rep. John Moolenaar, and Rep. Paul Mitchell, leading a letter requesting new money be allocated towards the construction of a new lock. The text of that letter can be found here.

Wishing You a Happy Thanksgiving, from Our Family to Yours 
As we gather around the dinner table this Thanksgiving, it is important for all of us to reflect on the blessings we share as West Virginians and Americans. In the Manchin household, we were always taught that if you can count your blessings, you can share your blessings. This lesson has stuck with me throughout my adult life and I have tried to pass it along to my children and grandchildren. One of the blessings I always count is my family and loved ones. With this in mind, I introduced a resolution in the Senate that designates the week of Thanksgiving as ‘National Family Week.’ 
This Thanksgiving, let us give thanks for our Service Members who sacrifice so much, including seeing their own families during the holidays, so that we may enjoy the comfort and safety of this great country. Their courage and strength shine as an example of what it means to be devoted to one’s country. 
Each day presents its own unique struggles and anxieties, but it is always important to remember the blessing of living in the greatest country on Earth. I thank all of the wonderful people of West Virginia who have given me the opportunity to represent them. Gayle and I wish you and your family a happy and healthy Thanksgiving. May God continue to bless America and the great state of West Virginia.

Fifty years after the Farmington No. 9 mine tragedy, we continue to grieve, remember those we lost, and to pray for their families. I personally lost many individuals who I knew well, including my dear Uncle John and several classmates. I truly appreciate everyone who attended the memorial this weekend to honor the memory of those who lost their lives that fateful day - they will live forever in our hearts.

How May We Help You?
I truly appreciate the opportunity to hear from my fellow West Virginians. As your U.S. Senator, I am proud to be your voice with government agencies during your time of need. My goal is to provide top-notch customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me, or who may need help.  I have a team of caseworkers in each of my four offices to help you with matters of concern. While I have no direct jurisdiction in the administrative matters of any federal, state, or local agency, I welcome the opportunity to assist you with whatever problem you may be experiencing and ask that full consideration be given to your case.
Recently, Angie Walsh, a caseworker in my Martinsburg office was able to assist Ms. Viola Usak, with her benefits from the Social Security Administration.  After a long delay in processing her monthly benefits, Ms. Usak visited my Martinsburg office to discuss her case.  Angie immediately reached out to the Social Security Administration to request that her benefit review be completed. Within two weeks of the inquiry, Ms. Usak received her monthly benefits as well as the retroactive award for the time that she waited for her case to be processed.

U.S. Marine Corps 243rd Birthday
￼
Last week, I had the honor to participate in the 243rd U.S. Marine Corps Birthday Cake Cutting Ceremony. Each year on November 10, we gather to remember the commitment, accomplishments, and sacrifices of all Marines.

The cake cutting ceremony is a part of our tradition in celebrating the birth of the Corps. The youngest and oldest Marines in Congress at the time are asked to take part in this occasion, so Congressman Lamb (PA-18) and I stood together during this meaningful tradition. Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. Robert Neller cut the cake and presented me with a piece to pass on to Congressman Lamb. The passing of cake from the oldest Marine to the youngest Marine demonstrates passing on the honor, experiences, and values of the Corps to the next generation of Marines to carry on. 

Thanksgiving Message
￼
Thanksgiving is a time to gather with family and loved ones who you might not get to spend enough time with during the year. It’s also a time to reflect on the blessings we have and on all that we have to be thankful for.

I know that I’m grateful for my wonderful family and grateful for all those who serve everyday, putting themselves in harm’s way to ensure we can have future Thanksgivings. 

I hope you’ll take a moment to think of those who can’t be with their families this Thanksgiving, but instead are stationed around the world protecting our freedoms and our way of life. 

Lastly, I’m very thankful and humbled to serve as your representative in Congress. It’s a great responsibility and I’m honored to have the opportunity.

I wish you and your family a safe and Happy Thanksgiving!

Grand Opening: Dogs Help Heal Center
￼
This past weekend was the Grand Opening & Dedication of the Beagles & Buddies new 2-acre Dogs Help Heal Center. My district staff attended the event and our Field Representative, Christopher Porter, had the honor of presenting a Congressional certificate to this new center in Apple Valley.

The grand opening included a remembrance of an incredible 25-year volunteer, officer, director, and major benefactor Lauren Fox and a dedication in her memory. 

Beagles & Buddies also wanted to honor our past and current military men and women for their service and sacrifice. Veteran Service Dog (VSD) Trainers demonstrated with their dogs and talked about the training program that they are leading at the DHH Center.

For more information, please visit their website www.beaglesandbuddies.com.

""Food for Fines"" at Victorville City Library
￼
You can make a difference by participating in the “Food for Fines” community food drive hosted by the City of Victorville and the Friends of the Victorville Library. Now and through Friday, Nov. 30, patrons who owe fines to the Victorville City Library will have one late fee waived if they bring non-perishable food items to the library.

In the spirit of the holidays, many libraries across the country hold such programs during this time of year to promote good will and to serve an important need in the community. “This is a wonderful opportunity to support those who are struggling to put food on the table and to get library accounts back in good standing before the close of the 2018 year,” said Victorville City Librarian, George Carter.

Food donations must be in store-sealed cans, boxes, or plastic containers that include the expiration date. Glass containers, perishable food, opened containers, homemade or home-canned items will not be accepted.

Donations will be given to the Victor Valley Rescue Mission. “Whether or not you owe fines, join us for this successful program and help make a difference in our City,” Carter added. 

For more information about the “Food for Fines” program call the Victorville City Library at (760) 245-4222. The Victorville Library, located at 15011 Circle Dr., is open Monday through Thursday 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., Friday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The Serrano Report -November 20 , 2018
￼ 
In Washington, DC 

 
Congressman Serrano Responds to Reports that President Trump is Calling for Termination of Federal Relief Funding for Puerto Rico 
Congressman Serrano responded to reports that President Trump is calling on Congress to cut off federal relief funding for Puerto Rico for its recovery after Hurricane Maria.
“President Trump’s calls to further limit the resources available to Puerto Rico in the aftermath Hurricane Maria are completely tone deaf. This is just the latest example of how little the Trump Administration knows and cares about the situation on the island, its successful recovery and ultimately, its people. President Trump has hit a new low asking the federal government to cut all aid while thousands still lack access to reliable electricity, secure shelter, and good health care. The President’s characterization of the local government’s use of federal funds is not only inaccurate, it omits the fact that Puerto Rico, as a colony, is forced to undergo several layers of additional scrutiny in terms of its plans and use of disaster funding. Puerto Rico is still in the midst of an economic crisis, and in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria local economic activity has taken a hard hit. This is funding the island desperately needs.  As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I intend to work with my Democratic and Republican colleagues to prevent this horrifying attempt to starve the local government from taking place. Puerto Rico needs more help, not less. Our federal government, particularly the Appropriations Committee on both sides of the aisle, knows that cutting relief funding for the island will create more local economic instability and prevent the islands successful recovery. At this point, we shouldn’t be surprised by the President’s lack of compassion, but his ignorance will not go unanswered,” said Congressman Serrano. 
Serrano Leads NY Delegation Letter Urging Dept. of Veteran Affairs to Address Student Veteran GI Bill Benefit Delays 
Congressman Serrano led a letter from 19 members of the New York Congressional Delegation calling on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie to immediately address the unnecessary delays that student veterans at Fordham University and other universities across New York State are facing in receiving educational benefits promised to them under the Forever GI Bill.
With last year’s passage of the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act, more commonly known as the Forever GI Bill, Congress ordered changes to enhance and expand veterans educational benefits. These changes required the VA Office of Information and Technology (OIT) to update IT systems by August 1, 2018. Nearly three months after this deadline, and two months into the academic school year, these updates remain incomplete and have led to long delays in processing benefits. Without book stipends and monthly housing allowances, student veterans cannot continue their studies properly and, worse, face the risk of eviction and homelessness.
“We call on you to address these issues immediately by using whatever means possible to efficiently and accurately process claims, and ensure benefits quickly make their way to the student veterans they serve. We urge the VA to provide better communication with student veterans and their families, as well as schools and universities, to keep them informed of the progress or delays made in processing their claims. The VA must also work to prevent any student veterans from incurring any late fees or any other fines due to a delay in receiving their benefits. While we understand the VA continues to face many significant challenges, no student veteran should bear any financial burden at the hands of the VA,” the members wrote.

Congressman Serrano Opposes President Trump's Plan to End Birthright Citizenship with Executive Order 
Congressman Serrano responded to President Trump’s claims during an Axios interview that he can get rid of birthright citizenship on his own through Executive Action:
“Once again, President Trump is distorting facts and misleading the public by claiming he has discovered he can end birthright citizenship through Executive Action. Birthright Citizenship is protected by the U.S. Constitution, which means that the President cannot end it on his own. This is the President’s latest effort to fuel anti-immigrant attitudes and stoke racial divisions. We witnessed this past weekend what hate speech and hate violence leads to. Instead of proposing empty policy ideas that only further divide the American people, he should be talking about the issues all Americans care about,"" said Congressman Serrano. 
Congressman Serrano on Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooting 
Last month, Congressman Serrano joined Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. to show support for the Jewish Community and to denounce all hate in all of its forms. They were joined by religious leaders from all areas of The Bronx as well as elected officials.
“It is beyond distressing that eleven people were killed simply for practicing their faith. This act of senseless hatred and violence has no place in America. My thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims and their loved ones,” said Congressman José E. Serrano. “As we mourn their loss, we need to rededicate ourselves to action in order to stamp out hatred and bigotry in our nation. We must have serious conversations about the normalization of hate speech over the past two years, and finally vote in Congress to keep dangerous weapons out of dangerous hands.  No one of any religion, race, or creed should fear for their lives simply because of who they are,” said Congressman Serrano.

Congressman Serrano Advocates for Food Security 
This week Congressman Serrano joined the Food Bank for NYC for their legislative breakfast to discuss how public charge regulations affect our community. Congressman Serrano has been a long time advocate of food security measures through his continued support of robust funding for SNAP,WIC, and other programs that aim to prevent hunger in our nation. Later that day Congressman Serrano joined other elected officials at the La Central Thanksgiving Luncheon and food voucher raffle.

Congressman Serrano Announces Nearly $1 Million in DOJ Funding for Opioid Abuse Treatment
Congressman Serrano announced that the U.S. Department of Justice has awarded the Bronx’s District Attorney office a total of $900,000 in funding.  Awarded through the DOJ’s Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Site-Based Program, this funding will ensure the Bronx DA can expand comprehensive opioid abuse treatment through the Overdose Avoidance Recovery (OAR) program, which allows low-level, non-violent offenders to access treatment instead of facing jail time. 
“Opioid use and abuse has been a long term problem in the Bronx, and more resources are desperately needed. This funding allows our borough to invest in treatment and recovery instead of jails by expanding local initiatives to reduce opioid use through prevention and addiction treatment services. I’m glad this important program initiated by Bronx DA Darcel Clark will be able to do more good work with this federal funding. This is an investment in our communities and ultimately our public safety,” said Congressman Serrano.
This program is a newly created part of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), which was the first major substance abuse treatment and recovery legislation in 40 years. 
The funding will be distributed by as follows: 
$900,000 for the Overdose Avoidance Recovery (OAR) program awarded through the DOJ’sComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) program.  
Congressman Serrano, Postal Union Workers and Other Elected Officials Lead Effort to Reinitiate Postal Banking Services in the Bronx 
Bronx Representatives Serrano, Engel, Crowley, and Espaillat sent a letter to the United States Postmaster General, Megan J. Brennan, to encourage the U.S. Postal Office (USPS) to renew the offering of affordable banking services inside postal banks. According to the USPS Office of Inspector General, under existing regulatory authority, post offices can still provide these services. 
The effort was unveiled by Rep. Serrano, Crowley, postal union workers and community advocates at the Hunts Point Post Office in the Bronx, where participants called for the immediate reinstatement of banking services and explained why this is a win-win proposal for all stakeholders: the U.S. Postal Service and the government, consumers, and postal workers. 
Currently, 21.8% of households in the Bronx have no bank account, and 30.5% use cheaper alternative financial institutions even though they have a bank account. This unbanked and underbanked population (52.3% of the Bronx population) would benefit from having access to affordable banking services in postal stations. Meanwhile, providing banking services would help increase postal offices' and the U.S. Postal Service's revenue as there is increasing demand for their services. With over 40 post offices in the South Bronx, this is a proposal that would significantly expand access to affordable banking services in the Bronx. 
""Postal banking is good for the community and the Postal Service. A majority of working families in the Bronx are either unbanked or underbanked, and providing a postal banking option will help them avoid high-cost alternatives like checks cashier and pay-day lenders. It also allows the Postal Service to engage in new revenue raising activities. I thank my colleagues in joining me in this important effort to help Bronxite, and I thank the New York Metro Area Postal Union for leading this effort"" Said Congressman Serrano. 
￼
Representatives Serrano; Representative Crowley; Jonathan Smith, President of the New York Metro Area Postal Union; and Vincent Alvarez, President of NYC Central Labor Council stand at the Hunts Point Post Office and call on the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to offer affordable banking services inside postal stations again. (10/16/18)
Congressman Serrano Announces $300,000 in Funding to Help Parents Attend College in the Bronx  
Congressman Serrano announced that the U.S. Department of Education awarded $348,911 to Bronx Community College through the Child Care Access Means Parents in School (CCAMPIS) Program. The CCAMPIS Program provides funding for child care on campus so low-income students with children do not have to miss class and can successfully complete their schooling.
“College students who are parents shouldn’t have to choose between getting a college education and having child care. Far too often, students, in particular low-income students, with children end up opting to drop out of school because they don’t have access to affordable, reliable child care while they go to school. This funding will help Bronx Community College provide child care on campus so low-income students with children can continue studying and obtain the credentials that they need to start a career and provide for their children. This is an investment in the future of our children and our college students,” More than half of all BCC students work while attending classes, and 55% have children under the age of 5,” said BCC president Thomas Isekenegbe. “Their ability to access high-quality child care gives them peace of mind and the support they need to pursue their studies.” said Congressman Serrano.
Congressman Serrano Meets with J Street 
Congressman Serrano also met with representatives from J Street, in his Bronx office. They discussed a joint support for a two state solution, continued aid for Palestinians and Israel’s security. 
￼ 
Congressman Serrano Meets with Bronx Museum Executives 
Last month Congressman Serrano met with Deborah Cullen, New Executive Director of the Bronx Museum and Shirley Solomon, Director of Government and Institutional Giving. He welcomed the new director and discussed his involvement with the museum throughout the years and reiterated his continued support.

November 20, 2018 
  


As we head into Thanksgiving, I’m reminded of all the reasons we have to be thankful. At a time when our country faces challenges on many fronts, it is important to also remember the progress we’ve made and all the good that can be done. For example, I recently visited Baltimore Corps – a local nonprofit that seeks to connect talented young individuals trying to make a difference with great organizations around Baltimore. I had the opportunity to listen to some of the participants and hear their passion and ideas for improving our community. Also, just last week, I attended Montgomery County’s Adoption Day Ceremony and joined eight families in celebrating the joy of providing a child with a loving and stable home. I was also honored to meet with a young woman that my team was able to help during her adoption process. In our office, we advocate non-stop for Maryland families – whether that’s helping them navigate federal agencies or fighting for access to affordable health care and important patient protections. I am grateful for all of you who have stood with us in this important work, and I hope you’ll continue to speak out and fight to make our nation a more perfect union. 
This week is also a chance to take some time with family and friends. I’m fortunate to have the opportunity to spend my Thanksgiving at home with my family, and I hope you’re able to spend this time with your loved ones as well. From our family to yours – Happy Thanksgiving!

Chris Van Hollen 
What’s Next

Every two years, Americans head to the polls to exercise their right to vote. I salute everyone who made their voice heard and participated in our great democratic process – it’s something we should never take for granted. As elections come and go, my commitment to you and to Maryland remains the same. Together, we will continue to fight for a better future for our children, an economy that works for everyone, a system that truly produces liberty and justice for all, and a healthy environment and planet.  
The main order of business for Congress before the end of the year is to ensure that federal agencies have the resources they need to continue providing vital services to the American people. While the President has threatened to trigger a government shutdown, I believe there is bipartisan opposition to allowing that to happen. The good news is that we’ve already secured important Maryland and national priorities, including investments to continue major water infrastructure projects, address the maintenance backlog at Veterans’ hospitals and clinics, further life-saving medical research, and provide more resources to fight the opioid epidemic. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will keep fighting for programs that are crucial to our state and our country – whether that’s to protect the Chesapeake Bay, strengthen our transportation systems, or invest in law enforcement and implement criminal justice reforms. I’m also committed to protecting the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Any efforts to undermine these vital programs – especially under the guise of deficit reduction after Washington Republicans passed $2 trillion in tax breaks that disproportionately help the very wealthy – will be met with fierce opposition. 
Protecting the Integrity of the Department of Justice

The Attorney General must be a champion for the people – but it's clear the President wants someone who pledges loyalty to him, not the Constitution. That’s why President Trump fired Jeff Sessions and tapped Matthew Whitaker, who has repeatedly demonstrated his bias against the independent Mueller investigation, to temporarily fill the spot. To date, despite his obvious conflicts, Whitaker has refused to recuse himself from overseeing that investigation. 
While the legal challenges to the constitutionality of Whitaker’s appointment proceed, it is essential that the Senate pass bipartisan legislation to protect the integrity of the Special Counsel’s investigation into Russian interference and obstruction of justice. But last week, Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell took to the Senate floor and blocked a vote on this bill – a shameful decision. We must come together as patriots, not partisans, to protect our democracy – and I’ll keep fighting for this legislation. 
Advanced Manufacturing in Maryland

Recently, I participated in the launch of an exciting new program that has huge potential for Maryland and the country. The Advanced Manufacturing, Materials, and Processes (AMMP) project – based in Harford County –  is a new program to advance and build breakthrough, innovative manufacturing technologies. From upgrading 3-D printing to creating entirely new technologies, this program will work with the Army Research Laboratory, local businesses, and Maryland’s universities to revolutionize our manufacturing industry. AMMP will create jobs here in Maryland and drive new economic growth. What’s more, the research and technology developed here will have limitless possibilities – from modernizing American manufacturing to better preparing our troops on the frontlines. I was proud to help secure significant funding for this crucial project through my role on the Senate Appropriations Committee, and I will continue working to bring good-paying jobs and new opportunities to Maryland.

When a species becomes extinct, it is lost forever. That’s why I have consistently voted to uphold protections for the gray wolf. 
￼ 
Against my strong objections, the U.S. House voted last week to take the gray wolf off the endangered species list. I was one of only 12 Republicans to vote against the bill. Scientists and conservation experts should manage wildlife recovery, not Washington politicians. Fortunately, the bill is not expected to be approved by the Senate. 
In 1973, wolves had all but disappeared from the continental United States when Congress enacted the landmark Endangered Species Act (ESA). Since then, the wolf population has grown from near extinction to about 15,000 — one of the law’s biggest success stories.  
The last thing we should do is remove the protections for this magnificent creature, which plays an important role in keeping our eco-system healthy. The ESA has prevented the extinction of hundreds of species, including the American alligator, grizzly bear, as well as the gray wolf. Had the ESA not been passed in 1973, scientists estimate that at least 227 species would now be extinct.  
The ESA is one of the most successful government initiatives in the past half century and it should not be weakened!  
My record of protecting wildlife and preventing animal cruelty is why I received the U.S. Humane Society’s Legislator of the Year award. I will continue to protect vulnerable wildlife as the co-chair of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus. 
Let me know if you agree with my strong support for the gray wolf and the ESA.

11/20/18 13:46,News from Nita: $246K for NYMC — 🚭FDA’s E-Cig Announcement — Tree of Life Resolution — Women’s Health At Risk,"￼
ABOUT NITA           CONSTITUENT SERVICES           NEWSROOM           LEGISLATIVE ISSUES           17th DISTRICT           CONTACT ME 
Dear Friend:
Here are some of the ways in which I'm fighting hard to keep Lower Hudson Valley communities safe, healthy, and secure:
	•	Announcing $246K in Federal Funding for New York Medical College  
	•	Calling for a Ban on Flavored E-Cigarettes  
	•	Securing Passage of a Resolution Condemning Tree of Life Attack, Anti-Semitism  
	•	Condemning Attacks on Women's Health 
Announcing $246K in Federal Funding for New York Medical College
￼
New York Medical College (NYMC) has been awarded $246,000 in federal funding to conduct research with the goal of developing a new cure for the tick-borne disease babesiosis.
	•	I'm very pleased to have helped secure this vital federal funding for New York Medical College, a leading biomedical research institution advancing groundbreaking research.
	•	This grant will enable NYMC to tackle an emerging public health threat in our region and help keep our communities safe.
As the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, I am a committed supporter of medical research and increased National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding.
	•	I helped secure a $2 billion increase in federal funding for NIH in the Fiscal Year 2019 spending bill for the Department of Health and Human Services enacted earlier this fall.
	•	Earlier this year, I secured a $3 billion increase for NIH as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2018. The $3 billion, or 8.8%, increase from the FY2017 enacted level is the largest increase in NIH funding in 15 years.
Calling for a Ban on Flavored E-Cigarettes 
￼ 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced last week its decision to pursue restrictions on sales of flavored e-cigarettes. 
	•	I am encouraged by the FDA's proposal to ban flavored cigars and menthol in cigarettes, and I urge the agency to move quickly to implement these rules. This action could significantly prevent more young people from getting hooked on nicotine and would save lives.
	•	But sadly, the FDA's effort will not fully stem the growing epidemic of teenage e-cigarette use. I remain concerned that the agency has refused to follow through on its threat to ban flavored e-cigarettes. We know that these devices are marketed to children, with flavors like Fruit Loops and Gummy Bears, and that without an outright ban, young people will continue to access them.
	•	Despite the proposed rules announced last week, the window of opportunity for younger generations to get hooked on nicotine remains open. I urge the FDA to recognize that flavored e-cigarettes have no place in the market and to use their regulatory authority to pursue a full ban. 
Securing Passage of a Resolution Condemning Tree of Life Attack, Anti-Semitism  
The U.S. House last week passed H.Res.1138, a House resolution I introduced with Rep. Mike Doyle (D-PA) and my fellow Co-Chairs of the House Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism, to condemn the anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue building on October 27, 2018.  
	•	""We are glad to see this resolution pass the House unanimously, which reaffirms the House's commitment to fighting anti-Semitism in all its forms here at home and around the world,"" we wrote in a statement upon passage of the resolution. Read the full statement here. 
Condemning Attacks on Women's Health

Along with Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus Co-Chairs Diana DeGette (D-CO) and Barbara Lee (D-CA), I spoke out against the Trump Administration's latest attempts to push through anti-choice actions that will further limit women's access to abortion and birth control. 
	•	The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) earlier this month finalized two rules that would allow employers to opt out of the Affordable Care Act's birth control mandate. In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a rule that would result in burdensome regulations designed to push abortion coverage out of reach for at least 1.3 million women.
	•	""One day after voters resoundingly showed their support for women and protecting access to health care, this latest attack by the Trump administration is particularly tone-deaf and vindictive,"" we said. ""Women have made it clear that they will not stand for shameless efforts to roll back their hard-fought and constitutionally-protected reproductive rights. In the 116th Congress, the Democratic majority will work to block this extreme, ideological, and overwhelmingly unpopular agenda."" 
	•	When these changes were first proposed in October 2017, DeGette, former Pro-Choice Caucus Co-Chair Louise Slaughter, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, and I led more than 180 of our colleagues in a letter to Trump administration officials opposing the rules, warning that these changes would restrict access to birth control for millions of women covered under the Affordable Care Act.

Dear Friend,  I wanted to alert you that we are now in the open enrollment period for Medicare. It began on October 15th and goes through December 7th. Open enrollment provides an important opportunity for you to compare plans to save money and improve your health coverage. Below, you will find details about the open enrollment period as well as other resources that may be helpful if you have questions about Medicare. As always, please contact my office if you need assistance with this or any other federal issue.    2018 MEDICARE OPEN ENROLLMENT DATES:  October 15 – December 7, 2018   Medicare’s Annual Open Enrollment Period is October 15th - December 7th. Below are some optional changes to your coverage you may take advantage of during this period:  1. Change to or from a Medicare Advantage Plan, or select a different plan that better meets your needs  2. Join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan  3. Switch from one Medicare Prescription Drug Plan to another Medicare Prescription Drug Plan  Medicare employees can provide information, counseling and assistance in regards to plans and benefits. Seniors, family members and caregivers can ask questions and learn more about Medicare by calling 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) or by visiting Medicare’s website at: www.medicare.gov.   New Medicare Cards  To help protect your identity, Medicare is mailing new Medicare cards between April 2018 and April 2019. Your new card will have a new Medicare Number that’s unique to you, instead of your Social Security Number. Here are 8 things you should know about your new Medicare card.   1. Your new card will be automatically mailed to you between April 2018 and April 2019. You don’t need to do anything as long as your address is up to date. To update your address, visit your mySocial Security account.  2. Your new card will be made of paper and will have a new Medicare Number that’s unique to you, instead of your Social Security Number. This will help to protect your identity.   3. Your Medicare coverage and benefits will stay the same.  4. Once you get your new Medicare card, destroy your old Medicare card and start using your new card right away.  5.If you’re in a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO), your Medicare Advantage Plan ID card is your main card for Medicare—you should still keep and use it whenever you need care. And, if you have a Medicare drug plan, be sure to keep that card as well.  Even if you use one of these other cards, you also may be asked to show your new Medicare card, so keep it with you.  6. Doctors, other health care providers and facilities will ask for your new Medicare card when you need care, so carry it with you.  7. Only give your new Medicare Number to doctors, pharmacists, other health care providers, your insurers, or people you trust to work with Medicare on your behalf.  8. If you forget your new card, you, your doctor or other health care provider may be able to look up your Medicare Number online.  Protect Yourself From Medicare Scams   Although these new Medicare cards will help keep your identity safe, make sure you stay on the lookout for folks trying to scam you and steal your identity. You may get a phone call — or sometimes an email or knock on the door — from a con artist pretending to be an employee of Medicare, a state agency or an official-sounding (but nonexistent) organization, such as the National Medical Office.  This is a scam! Do not provide any personal information!   Providing your information to these people is a set-up for possible identity theft. Medicare will not call you asking for your information. Medicare will only ask for it when you contact the agency yourself. And there are no legitimate Medicare agents who visit your home or send unsolicited emails. Click here for more tips on how to protect yourself against identity theft.   If you need additional assistance with any Medicare concerns, please contact my Sugar Land office at 281-494-2690. My staff will be more than happy to help however they can. I’m honored to represent you in Congress. For more information on constituent services, current legislation or to sign up for my E-newsletter, please visit my website, www.olson.house.gov.   Very respectfully, Pete Olson

Dear Lindsey,
President Trump hit the nail on the head with his recent Presidential Proclamation Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of the United States and the Department of Homeland Security’s newly released asylum rule is the kind of immigration policy reform America desperately needs.
Each year, hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens furtively thumb their noses at America’s sovereignty by clandestinely violating our borders and laws. Now, Central American caravans openly and brazenly seek to do the same. This outrageous conduct cannot be, and should not be, tolerated by America. As a sovereign nation, the American people have every right to expect their government to secure our borders.
Illegal immigration hurts American workers and taxpayers. According to the Federation for Immigration Reform, illegal aliens are a net $116 billion annual cost to American taxpayers.[1] That’s $300 in additional taxes each man, woman and child in America is forced to pay for people whose first act on American soil is to violate American law.
Fraud and abuse plague America’s asylum system. Let me make this clear: no one has a right to demand asylum from any nation.  Asylum and sanctuary is a discretionary benefit given by nations to those with clear justification.[2] Too often, illegal aliens are coached by attorneys to say ‘magic words’ that help them take advantage of America’s generosity. Their exploitation of America’s already generous immigration laws must stop! As such, I support President Trump’s steps to close asylum loopholes and stop the damage to America caused by illegal aliens’ wrongful conduct.
Did you know?
	•	In Fiscal Year 2018, half a million people have been apprehended attempting to cross the border, about 100,000 at checkpoints and 400,000 in the interior.[3]
	•	According to the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice, “[i]n recent weeks, United States officials have each day encountered an average of approximately 2,000 inadmissible aliens at the southern border.”[4]
	•	According to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice, “[o]ver the past decade, the overall percentage of aliens subject to expedited removal and referred, as part of the initial screening process, for a credible-fear interview jumped from approximately 5% to above 40%, and the total number of credible-fear referrals for interviews increased from about 5,000 a year in Fiscal Year (“FY”) 2008 to about 97,000 in FY 2018.”[5]
	•	Last year, nearly half of the completed cases that involved aliens who claimed credible fear resulted in the alien failing to show up at a hearing or even to file an application for asylum.[6]
Do you support President Trump’s crackdown on asylum fraud and illegal immigration? 
Yes, I do
No, I don't

Happy Thanksgiving November 20, 2018 
This Thanksgiving, I would like to share with all South Dakotans my gratitude for the opportunity to work for you in the United States Senate. It is a privilege that I will never take for granted. I continue to work every day to make decisions that will improve the lives of everyone in South Dakota. Jean and I send our warmest wishes to you this holiday season. 
Thanksgiving is a good time to look back on the year and thank the Lord for the blessings that we have received. This year, we welcomed our 10th grandchild, Maverick Michael Rounds, born to my son John and his wife Ashlee. Our kids and grandkids are our greatest gifts and we’re so thankful for the time we get to spend with them. 
I truly believe the pilgrims intended the first Thanksgiving to be a celebration of the harvest, and most importantly to thank the good Lord for the blessings he gave them in the new world. It is compelling they shared this first Thanksgiving with the Native Americans who had welcomed them.
None of us would be able to enjoy the freedom to celebrate this holiday if not for the service of our military members. We are incredibly thankful to them for the sacrifices they make to protect our way of life in the United States. We are also thankful to their families and friends who support them. Parents, spouses and children of military men and women make great sacrifices too. We pray for those who may not be able to spend the holiday season with their loved ones. We also pray for our first responders who put their lives in danger to protect their neighbors and communities. 
We are thankful for our farmers and ranchers who work tirelessly to put food on the tables of families all across the country. South Dakota’s farmers and ranchers are some of the hardest working people I know. With trade instability and farm income down, I continue calling for the administration to quickly finalize trade deals that benefit our producers. I also continue calling for a strong farm bill that will provide more stability for the ag industry. 
This year for Thanksgiving, we look forward to hosting around 40 of our family members. We’ll have two or three turkeys, depending on how many show up, but one is never enough to feed our whole crew. Of course we’ll have all the trimmings like potatoes, gravy, dressing and my two favorites—homemade cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie with lots of whipped cream! We also try to fit in some time for pheasant hunting on Thanksgiving Day—one of the many traditions we look forward to each year. 
One national tradition that South Dakota has a special role in this year is the president’s pardoning of a Thanksgiving turkey. Each year, two live turkeys are sent to Washington, D.C., where they will be pardoned by the president. This year’s turkeys come from the Riverside Colony near Huron. After they are pardoned they will be transported to Virginia Tech to live out the rest of their days at Gobbler’s Rest. 
I hope you enjoy spending time with your loved ones, partaking in your own Thanksgiving traditions this year, whatever they may be. The people of South Dakota are what make our state the best place in the world, and I am grateful for the opportunity to work for you in the Senate. Happy Thanksgiving!

11/20/18 10:29,National Entrepreneurs' Day,"News from Representative Tom Emmer
￼
Dear Friend, 
Today, I want to take a moment to acknowledge our nation’s entrepreneurs. The ones who take a risk, blaze a trail, and create a new path forward for all of us. Without notable Minnesota entrepreneurs and innovators, we wouldn't have new breakthroughs and industries that improve American's way of life.  
Minnesotans are known for blazing trails: without Earl Bakken, the world would not have the pacemaker or Medtronic, which continues to create life-saving devices to this day. Our world would not be as bright and hopeful without the innovators and risk-takers, who commit to adding something they think will make their community, and the world, a better place. Without those Minnesotans, we would not have Target, Sears, Honeywell, General Mills, or even Milky Way candy bars! The list continues and the legacy of Minnesota's entrepreneurial spirit carries on today.   
I always have the people of Minnesota in mind: the recent college graduate applying for his first car loan to get to and from his new job; the young couple looking for the credit they needed to purchase their first home; the entrepreneur applying for a loan to start her own business. These people, unburdened by regulation, should be able to financially prosper and become the entrepreneurs that change the world. Sometimes, all they need to start is a loan.   
Congress has been working hard to create a framework that sets us on a pathway to a healthier economy. For the young entrepreneur to the single mother working two jobs to put food on the table, we have to seize this moment and empower our greatest asset: the American citizen. I am honored to serve you all in Congress representing Minnesota's Sixth District for that very reason.    
My mission on the Financial Services Committee has been to empower the individuals in our nation that want to invest in their dreams. They make America better, and I have done my best to support them. I was honored to attend the White House Signing Ceremony for the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act when it was signed into law. This legislation included my Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act (HMDAA) which eliminates burdensome compliance regulations imposed on small financial institutions by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), who in 2015 issued a rule requiring lenders to report more than double the data previously required. 
Americans want the opportunity to achieve the American dream - to own a home, buy a car, or start a business. The passage of my Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act provided relief for these institutions to help make that happen. On National Entrepreneurs’ Day, I want to thank all of the risk-takers, innovators, and trailblazers, big and small, for doing what you can to push our nation forward.    

Sincerely,  ￼

Dear Friends, 
Today is the 155th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address, remarks delivered by President Lincoln for the dedication of a cemetery for the soldiers killed at the Battle of Gettysburg. In these brief remarks, Lincoln explained that those brave men who died gave the, ""last full measure of devotion,""  to ensure, ""that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.""
It is a beautiful reminder ahead of Thanksgiving of how blessed we are to live in the greatest country on earth, thanks to the sacrifice of many. A nation that was ""conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."" 155 years later we continue to answer that great question Lincoln posed on the battlefield in Gettysburg: of whether or not a ""nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure.""
I'm wishing you all safe travels this week and hope you are able to spend this Thanksgiving with your family, friends, and loved ones. 
Below are some highlights from last week: 
CISA: Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency 
Last week, I joined President Trump in the Oval Office as he signed my Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2017, or CISA, into law. This historic, bipartisan legislation is a significant step forward to safeguard the continued success of the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) cyber mission and improve our collective defenses. This streamlining and elevation will improve the security of our federal networks and critical infrastructure by bolstering DHS’s capabilities to better match the structure with its current authorities and improve information sharing with the private sector.
I look forward to CISA’s implementation and I want to specifically thank President Trump, Secretary Nielsen, Undersecretary Krebs, and our partners at DHS for their overwhelming support in making this longstanding goal a reality.

Earlier in the week, I joined Speaker Ryan as he signed my CISA bill, affirming the House's vote, before sending the bill to the White House. 
￼ 

Bloomberg Next.2018 
I joined Kevin Cirilli for a discussion at Bloomberg's Next.2018 about the importance of strengthening our cybersecurity. During my tenure as Chairman on the House Homeland Security Committee, I have worked tirlessly on legislation, like my CISA bill, to improve the Department of Homeland Security's cyber capabilities. Specifically, we have to ensure that our critical infrastructure, like the power grid in the Northeast, is fully secure. The Russians and the Chinese already have their fingerprints in these areas and a successful cyber attack against that grid would have dire economic consequences. We must do more to ensure that type of attack cannot and does not happen.

Top Republican on Foreign Affairs

""Opinion: Michael McCaul is the Leader Republicans Need on Foreign Affairs""

Championing American Businesses Abroad 
I introduced the Championing American Businesses Through Diplomacy Act of 2018 with Congressman David Schweikert (AZ-06). This bill prioritizes economic and commercial diplomacy at the Department of State and U.S. missions throughout the world, allowing U.S. businesses better access to markets abroad. 
With the emergence of China’s Belt and Road Initiative and their coercive lending practices, we must make it easier for our businesses to have access to foreign markets. Our diplomatic personnel are on the ground in these countries and have unique insights on their political and economic complexities. We must do more to use this information to help the private-sector do business abroad and support U.S. foreign policy in upholding global stability. You can click here to learn more about this legislation. 
I wrote an op-ed back in April of this year, talking about how the United States can’t sit back and watch as China quietly colonizes the West. You can click here or on the image below to read my op-ed.

MD Anderson 
It was great to meet with leaders from MD Anderson about the important work that we do together in the battle against childhood cancer and the incredible breakthroughs we have seen with immunotherapy treatments. 
￼ 

Legislative Update
Last week, the House voted on a number of important piece of legislation. Below are two I wanted to highlight for you: 
	•	H.R. 6018 – the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership Act of 2018. This is legislation I introduced to authorize for the first time a program called the Trans-Sahara Counter Terrorism Partnership, which works with countries such as Chad, Mali, and Nigeria, to build their capacity to conduct counterterrorism operations, and strengthen the rule of law. 
	•	H.R. 2740 – the Rabbi Michoel Ber Weissmandl Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2017. I am a cosponsor of this legislation to require the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate to arrange for the posthumous award of a Congressional Gold Medal to Rabbi Michoel Ber Weissmandl in recognition of his acts of valor during World War II.
This Week, Members will be in their districts for the Thanksgiving holiday. There are no votes scheduled in the House.  
As always, I encourage you to visit my website, mccaul.house.gov, for more information on constituent services and legislative updates. Also, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to get the latest updates on my work in Washington and the 10th District of Texas. It continues to be a great honor to represent you in the United States House of Representatives.

Friends,  
Just over a month ago, Hurricane Michael, the third most powerful hurricane to ever make landfall on the U.S. mainland, ravaged areas of Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. Alabama’s Second District was badly impacted in several counties in the Wiregrass region, and our farmers face severe devastation.   Last Friday morning, I visited the McAllister family farm in Houston County with USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue and Alabama Ag Commissioner John McMillan to assess Hurricane Michael damage and discuss recovery efforts with local farmers in Alabama’s Second District. 
￼ 
Secretary Perdue is a friend to Alabama, and I am deeply grateful that he made this visit happen and participated in this important dialogue with Alabama farmers. He understands that our state’s farmers need help in the recovery and rebuilding efforts ahead. 
I will work alongside Secretary Perdue and my colleagues in Congress to provide the proper resources and assistance to these hardworking men and women. My job is to be on the front line fighting for Alabama, and we’re making the push to get this done quickly and correctly.   ￼   Additionally, last week, I spoke on the House floor to discuss the devastation to the counties in our district that were impacted last month. You can watch the full speech here.   Agriculture is the backbone of our economy. Throughout my time in Congress, I have made it a priority to fight for our farmers of all commodities. I will continue to advocate for them, especially during this time of uncertainty. We must get this right, and we must ensure Alabama’s farmers are included in all recovery efforts.   FIVE ALABAMA COUNTIES DECLARED PRIMARY NATURAL DISASTER AREAS 
￼ 
Last week it was announced that USDA Secretary Perdue designated five Alabama counties (Barbour, Geneva, Henry, Houston, and Pike) as Primary Natural Disaster Areas. This designation will allow for opportunities with disaster assistance to these communities. 
I appreciate Secretary Perdue's action to make available the proper resources and assistance for these hardworking men and women who have suffered tremendous loss to their livelihoods. We are committed to getting this done quickly and correctly. 
COL. RENNER HONORED FOR HEROIC ACTIONS 
I’d like to share with you some exciting news about a hero right here in AL-02: Last month, Air University professor Col. Stephen Renner was awarded the French Médaille de la Défense Nationale for his heroic actions during his deployment in 2017. Congratulations on this prestigious honor, Col. Renner, and thank you for your service to our country.   HAPPY THANKSGIVING! 
Thanksgiving is a uniquely special holiday because it provides us an entire day each year to pause as a country and give thanks to God for the countless ways He has blessed us. The stress and craziness of everyday life often make it easy to lose sight of just how much we have to be thankful for, so as we all have the opportunity to gather with loved ones this Thanksgiving, I hope we all take time to count our numerous blessings. 
While we have a lot to be thankful for in our state and country right now, there are also people in our district and throughout the Southeast who are in the midst of a very challenging recovery period in the wake of Hurricane Michael. During this season of Thanksgiving as you’re gathered with family and friends, I hope you will join me in prayerfully remembering our neighbors in the Wiregrass and throughout the Southeast. While the challenge of rebuilding won’t be easy, I am confident that we will get through it together. 
In the spirit of the holiday, I want to take this opportunity to tell you that I am thankful for the responsibility to serve our state and country in the United States Congress. It is a true honor to be in a position to make a difference on behalf of Alabama’s Second District, so thank you for allowing me to serve you. From my family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving.   Sincerely,  
￼  Martha Roby

Kansas Common Sense  November 19, 2018
Hello,
 
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
 
Wishing Kansans a Happy Thanksgiving Holiday
With the Thanksgiving Holiday approaching, Robba and I would like to wish everyone across Kansas safe travels and a Happy Thanksgiving. During this time of gratitude and reflection, we recognize the wonderful things about the state we get to call home. I am grateful for the many Kansans who I’ve had the honor of visiting with and meeting over the course of the last year. I’m especially grateful for the men and women at home and abroad who will spend their Thanksgiving away from their families and loved ones. Thank you to our servicemembers, past and present, who continue to make countless sacrifices on behalf of us and this great nation.
Sponsoring Bipartisan Prison, Sentencing Reform Legislation This week, I joined Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle in sponsoring S. 3649, the First Step Act. This sensible legislation – that’s backed by the President – provides an opportunity for Congress to set aside our differences and make historic progress on bipartisan criminal justice reform. The First Step Act increases fairness in crime and drug sentencing, helps curb the devastating opioid epidemic and helps make our communities safer. This bill also promotes proven recidivism reduction and professional development programs which will create better opportunities for inmates to succeed after they serve time. Under this legislation, any savings generated by the reforms would automatically be reinvested into law enforcement programs to further reduce crime and improve community safety. 
The First Step Act combines prison reform proposals that overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives earlier this year with sentencing reform provisions from the bipartisan Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, which was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in February. Additionally, the legislation is supported by a wide range of stakeholders from key law enforcement organizations to reform advocates. 
To read more on this legislation and its wide-ranging support, click here. 
Confirming a Kansan to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors On Thursday, the Senate confirmed Kansan, Michelle ‘Miki’ Bowman for the seat reserved for a community banker or a community bank regulator. Miki’s experience as Kansas State Bank Commissioner, her time at Farmers and Drovers Bank in her hometown of Council Grove, and many other positions in both public service and the private sector make her the perfect addition to the Federal Reserve Board. Miki understands the importance of the relationship between the community and the local banker. 
Community banks are an important part of rural communities and small cities across the country, from lending for homes, small businesses and farms, to sponsoring little league baseball teams and the school band. In Kansas and across rural America, these banks are an economic engine, leveraging relationships with local community members that rely on trust and honesty to benefit the individuals they see every day. Miki will bring this approach to the Federal Reserve Board and I am proud to have a fellow Kansan hold such an important positon. 
Watch my full remarks urging support for Miki prior to the vote on her nomination here. 
 ￼
Speaking on Digital Infrastructure at the Bloomberg Next.2018 Event On Wednesday, I keynoted a Bloomberg’s Next.2018 discussion, an event bringing together policymakers, innovators, entrepreneurs, executives and regulators in the digital realm. I discussed how I am leading the charge in Congress to help bridge the digital divide, and highlighted the need to modernize America’s networks and expand digital infrastructure. Additionally, I shared perspectives from Kansas and how the digital divide has affected our state and the ability of communities to innovate and grow. My colleagues and I, the FCC, and a group of government and private sector organizations are working together to help deploy and expand broadband across the nation, specifically in rural areas. A significant challenge in this effort is the coverage maps being utilized by the FCC. I provided an update on our efforts to correct those maps, and the importance of getting these maps right due to the foundational nature they play in our work to expand 5G coverage. 
One of the biggest issues facing Kansas is the widening digital divide and the lack of resources available to our rural communities and businesses. Technology is the most significant driver of innovation and economic development in Kansas and across the nation. Our rural communities in Kansas will be better served in their efforts to grow their economy and recruit new individuals and families if they have access to this needed technology and digital infrastructure. These issues are not of passing interest to me, and I’m committed to continuing this work in close partnership with private sector stakeholders, federal entities and state and local organizations. 
 ￼ 
Attending the Senate’s Veterans Appreciation Event On Tuesday, the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee honored our nation’s heroes in the nation’s capital with a special Veterans Day event, attended by leaders in the Department of Defense and Veterans Administration who are charged with caring for those who serve our country. I had the pleasure of visiting with Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army General Mark Milley, former Big Red One Commander and now Director of the Army Staff Lieutenant General Joseph Martin, Secretary of the Army Mark Esper, Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson and Secretary of the VA Robert Wilkie.  
I always appreciate time spent with each of these senior leaders to discuss ways in which we can improve and advance our military and provide our servicemembers, past and present, with the kind of support and resources they need and deserve through their dedicated service to our nation. 
 ￼
Introducing Legislation to Expand Access to Chiropractic Healthcare for Current and Former Military Personnel This week, I joined Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin in introducing bipartisan legislation to expand chiropractic health services for military retirees and members of the National Guard and Reserve. The Chiropractic Health Parity for Military Beneficiaries Act would require TRICARE to cover chiropractic services for all military servicemembers, both active and retired, and non-activated reservists. Currently, healthcare programs through the U.S. Department of Defense, including TRICARE, do not cover chiropractic care for military retirees and non-activated reservists. 
Many of the retired servicemembers and Reservists who served our country have sustained back and other neuromusculoskeletal injuries that can be treated through chiropractic care. However, the Department of Defense offers limited access to chiropractic care for Active duty and certain members of the Reserve Component – leaving many in need at a disadvantage. I’ve long advocated for increased access to chiropractic care in the VA, and this legislation will similarly increase access to chiropractic care for all military enrollees by expanding TRICARE coverage for retirees and all reservists. The men and women who have served our nation deserve access to the same care they received while on active duty, and I’m pleased to introduce legislation that makes certain they do. Click here to read more. 
Making Certain the VA MISSION Act Meets the Needs of Our Veterans
Americans of all ages, from all backgrounds and walks of life, have bravely stepped up to defend our nation, and I remain committed to fostering a world in which they return home and have ample career and educational opportunities, the ability to pursue the American dream, and, most importantly, access to timely, quality healthcare. If implemented correctly in the best interest of veterans, the VA MISSION Act will be a significant leap forward in accomplishing that goal.
As we recognize Veterans’ Month this November, it is timely to again call attention to this important legislation and the impact it ought to have on our veterans. Click here to read my op-ed in The Hill on the need for a successful implementation. 
Visiting with Students and Staff at Concordia Junior-Senior High School On Friday, I joined student leaders at Concordia Junior-Senior High School to tour their facility, visit classrooms and talk with students, faculty and staff. I heard an update on their fall semester, various student body activities and fall athletic teams. I was also lucky enough to hear the middle school choir perform during a stop into their music classroom. Thank you to the many students and teachers who took time to visit with me during my tour, and thank you to Principal Troy Keiswetter for arranging my visit to the school.
  ￼ 
Making a Community Visit to Belleville After my time in Concordia, I stopped in Belleville to visit with community members, business owners and local leaders. I appreciated the chance to hear firsthand the issues residents care about, and the opportunity to offer an update on the work I’m doing in Kansas and in Washington, D.C. In Belleville, I was able to stop by various businesses and organizations including Gottschalk & Company, CPAs, the Belleville Public Library, the USDA Service Center. Republic County Treasurer, Register of Deeds, and County Clerk, Astra Bank and Casey’s General Store. Thank you to the many Republic County residents who took time to visit with me during my stop in town. 
 ￼ 

Speaking at the Kansas Association of Conservation Districts Annual Convention
It was great to be with members of the Kansas Association of Conservation Districts (KACD) in Wichita for their annual conference. This group is committed to conserving our natural resources, efforts that are critical to preserving Kansas for the next generation. Water conservation and natural resource management is particularly important to our economy and quality of life. Water is the lifeblood of our municipalities, the foundation for statewide recreation, and will direct the future of manufacturing and production agriculture.
During my remarks to the group, I discussed the conservation issues across the state, the 2018 Farm Bill and the conservation title program, trade and the new United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. I was also able to echo the importance of production agriculture in rural Kansas and the need for sustainable conservation practices that will make certain these farms and our communities can thrive for generations to come. Thank you to KACD Executive Director Dan Meyeroff for inviting me to speak, and thanks also to the many members of KACD who I was able to visit with.
 ￼
Watching Fort Hays State University Football in Hays
On Saturday, I was in Hays where I watched Fort Hays State University (FHSU) play the University of Indianapolis in the opening round of the 2018 NCAA Division II playoffs. The game remained close until Indianapolis was able to pull away in the final quarter of the game. Congratulations to FHSU’s football players, coaches and staff on a great season. Thank you to members of the Hays community and FHSU leadership for inviting me to attend Saturday’s watch party on campus at the Robbins Center. I always appreciate the chance to be back in Hays. 

Honored to Serve You in Washington
It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

The Webster Wire
Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends:  
Happy Thanksgiving! This is a wonderful time for us to reflect on the abundance we enjoy in Florida and across the United States. I hope you are able to spend this holiday with your friends and family. I am thankful for my wife, children, grandchildren, friends, and the opportunity to serve the people of Florida’s 11th district. 
￼ 
_______________ 
Last week, we welcomed the newly elected members of the 116th Congress to Washington D.C. They will begin their terms in January. I look forward to working with them over the next two years and building on the great accomplishments from the last two years: historic tax reform, restoring our military, cutting unnecessary regulation, and fighting the opioid epidemic and human trafficking. 
￼ 
_______________ 
On  Tuesday, the House passed the Strengthening Coastal Communities Act, introduced by my Florida colleague and friend Rep. Neal Dunn. In the past, some homeowners in coastal communities were not able to buy flood insurance due to maps created by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This bill will revise existing maps to allow these individuals to purchase flood insurance, restoring confidence in our many coastal communities in Florida and around the nation. It will also allow qualifying property owners in affected areas to receive grants and assistance from the National Flood Insurance Program and Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
￼ 
_______________ 
On Friday, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 6784, the Manage Our Wolves Act. This bill updates the endangered species list by delisting gray wolves as endangered – a move that the Obama Administration attempted but had blocked by activist litigation in 2009 and 2014. The gray wolf is an Endangered Species Act success story. This program has successfully protected some of our nation’s most vulnerable wildlife. Gray wolves were listed as endangered under the authority of the Endangered Species Act in 1974. Since their endangered classification, gray wolves have thrived and the population has grown to sizes that are no longer considered vulnerable. The Species Survival Commission Wolf Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation Nature (IUCN) have since classified gray wolves as being of “least concern” for global extinction. Without the Endangered Species Act, it is possible that these incredible creatures would be extinct. Instead, they can now join the ranks of success stories alongside Florida panthers, bald eagles, grizzly bears, and others.
The Manage Our Wolves Act does not remove state and local protections for gray wolves. Instead of a federally-mandated, one-size fits all system, each state will have full authority over existing recovery and management plans for their local gray wolves. This also allows the U.S. Fish & Wildlife to dedicate their money and resources to species that are more vulnerable and at risk, such as the West Indian Manatee and Florida Scrub-jay to ensure that they, too, can be safeguarded. State wildlife services are more than equipped to aid gray wolves in their continued recovery where necessary, and H.R. 6784 is a good step forward in that process. 
_______________ 
November is National Veterans and Military Families Month, a time when we take a moment to recognize the great sacrifices and contributions our service members and their families have made for our country. Last week, President Trump released a statement highlighting some of the moves Congress and the Trump Administration have partnered on to better serve our nation’s heroes. Together, we have brought more accountability and transparency in the VA, given our military the largest pay raise in 9 years, and given veterans more choice in where they receive the healthcare they deserve.  
￼ 
_______________ 
This weekend, we will mark Small Business Saturday. This is a holiday to celebrate the small businesses and all they do to contribute to local communities. To find small businesses participating click here. 
￼ 
_______________ 
Tomorrow, the White House will host its annual Turkey Pardoning Ceremony, a tradition started under President Lincoln when his son Tad asked his father to spare their turkey. President Trump will officially pardon this year’s National Thanksgiving Turkey. This year’s Presidential Turkeys will stay in the historic The Willard Hotel tonight. The winner will arrive at the White House tomorrow where President Trump will announce its pardon. If you want to follow the Presidential Turkeys’ journey, sign up with your email at www.whitehouse.gov/gobble/.

Constituent Corner
A constituent from The Villages recently contacted our office because he was planning to travel to South Africa on a mission trip but had not received his passport. The constituent received a letter requesting additional documents and overnighted the documents but an additional letter requesting the same information was requested. We submitted an inquiry to the passport center and a supervisor reviewed the documents and was able to process the application without any additional documents. The passport mailed overnight, and the constituent was thankful for our fast action.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.   
Legislative Update
Last week, the House passed H.R. 2740, a bill that will posthumously award Rabbi Michoel Ber Weissmandl a Congressional Gold Medal for his acts of valor during WWII. I was a cosponsor of this legislation and am pleased to see it move forward in Congress. Rabbi Weissmandl helped establish an underground organization that raised funds to negotiate ransom with German and Slovakian officials to delay mass deportations during the Holocaust. An activist, he also sent telegrams explaining the plight Jewish citizens were facing and helped destroy railroad tunnels to prevent transportation to concentration camps. He also translated the “Auschwitz Protocols” from German to Hebrew and pleaded for action to help those suffering. Rabbi Weissmandl wrote the first known appeal for use of Allied Forces to secure their rescue. He came to America in 1945 where he worked to establish a home and Yeshiva for Holocaust survivors, the first campus in America that later institutions were modeled after, and became an influential figure in Brooklyn, NY, and around the country.

November 19, 2018
Hello everyone, 
Thanksgiving is so close, I can almost taste the pie!  I always spend some time during this part of the year reflecting on what I’m thankful for, and I wanted to spend this week’s newsletter focused on that.  I’m Thankful For...   First and foremost, I am thankful for the opportunity to represent you.   Thank you for the chance to serve our community.   I take my responsibilities to you very seriously, and I will continue working hard to try to keep Congress focused on its most important job: creating more economic opportunities for more people in more places.   There’s a reason millions of people visit our neck of the woods each year. I’m thankful for the chance to do this job and interact with all of the awesome people who make it so unique (I’m even secretly thankful that the Lutefisk festival is just a couple of months away). 
￼
You may not know it, but last Friday was Dutch-American Heritage Day. That may not seem like a huge deal to you if you didn’t grow up putting sprinkles on your toast or eating stroopwaffles.   But it is a big deal to me. I’m the son and grandson of Dutch immigrants. And in that regard, I am thankful that we live in a country that welcomed my Oma to America after World War II and helped make this a home for her. I’m thankful I got to celebrate her 108th birthday this year!   My experiences growing up with her have shaped how I think about things now. As your representative, I’m conscious that - for a large portion of my Oma’s life - she has been able to live with dignity and financial security because of Social Security and Medicare. I’m thankful for that! That’s something that makes this country special, and it’s something I’m working to make sure every American has access to, for generations.   I’m thankful for my family’s immigrant experience. In fact, my mom recently shared some photos from when they got on that boat to New York over 70 years ago. And I’m hopeful that in the next year, Congress will do more to fix our broken immigration system and foster more civility in the debate about these issues. It’s long past time for Congress to pass the bipartisan USA Act, a policy that protects our borders and our values - the ones my Oma and my mom saw when they came here after World War II. 
￼ 
I’m thankful for my family.    Perhaps the most common question I get from folks is this: “Why would you want to serve in Congress when it is so messed up and you have two little kids?”   I always say back: “Because it is so messed up and I have two little kids.”   I care about what kind of country my kids - and all kids - grow up in. And I don’t want their future dictated by a dysfunctional federal government.  I am doing this job so that all kids can grow up in a country with an economy that works for everyone, where there are great jobs, and great schools that prepare folks for success and where every person who works hard has the shot to pursue the American dream. Where families can afford to send their kids to college without also sending them into debt. I’m thankful for the opportunity to continue working on those issues.  I’m thankful for good health - and for the health of my family. That’s why I’m pushing for a health care system that works for everyone. I believe that in the greatest country on the planet, you shouldn’t go broke if you get sick or have an accident. I’m hopeful Congress will make some progress on that front too! 
￼ 
I’m thankful to live in one of the most beautiful parts of the world. And whether it’s working to protect Puget Sound or deal with the maintenance backlog in our national parks, I’m committed to keeping it that way.  Perhaps most importantly, I’m thankful for the folks protecting our freedoms, many of whom live in our neck of the woods. To all who serve, we are thankful for your service.   Last week for Veterans Day, I joined with community members to honor U.S. Navy SeaBee Marvin Shields. It was a privilege to spend time with his family, and to honor his important story of uncommon selflessness and sacrifice for our nation. I’m thankful to have had that opportunity.  I also had the chance to spend time with veterans throughout our community. To all who serve and have served, and to your families: thank you. 
￼ 
There’s so much work to do to support our veterans. In this regard, the government should follow a few basic principles. First - if you served our country, the government ought to have your back. You shouldn’t have to fight for the benefits you’ve earned and deserve. And, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, every brave veteran ought to have a home...and it shouldn’t be under a highway overpass. I’ll keep working toward those ends.  I’m thankful to have two terrific veterans on my team who are serving our community. Check out their stories here.   There’s a lot of work to do, and I could go on for a while about the ideas I have to create an even stronger country, but I know the last thing people want as they prepare to host guests and spend time together is a wonky discussion about things like the future of work, high-speed broadband internet for rural areas, our state’s outdoor economy, tax reform and economic development. We have every other week of the year for that. But I will say this: there are some exciting times ahead on these issues as we head into the new year. Stay tuned! 
One Final Thought on Thanksgiving 
A lot of folks have said they are dreading talking politics with their relatives this Thanksgiving. (Note: You don’t have to!) 
As I’ve mentioned in past newsletters, I’m a member of the Bipartisan Civility Caucus in the Congress. We’re working to try to turn down the toxicity in our politics and to try to foster more civil dialogue. With that in mind, let me just encourage folks to be kind to each other. Work to find common ground and, if that’s not possible, keep in mind that it’s possible to disagree without being disagreeable. And finally...when all else fails, remember: If you don’t have anything nice to say, just keep eating!  (On to the pie!!!)  That’s all for this week folks. Have a great Thanksgiving!    As always, it is an honor to represent you.  Derek

Come and Read It Report
Dear Texans, 
As we begin to approach the holiday season, it is important to remember the men and women who selflessly serve this nation and cannot be home with family and loved ones. Our troops give up so much so that we can enjoy the freedoms we often take for granted. Please join me in praying for the safety of our soldiers who cannot be home this Thanksgiving. I hope each of you in our district have happy Thanksgiving, from my family to yours.

Dear Lindsey:
Please join me in taking a moment to reflect on the devastation caused by the wildfires raging across our state and sending our sincere thanks to the firefighters, first responders, volunteers, and good samaritans helping with the recovery. Our deepest condolences are with our fellow Californians who have been impacted by the wildfires.

We hope this new section of our weekly updates will provide you with a streamlined view of what is included in each edition. In the coming weeks, we will be rolling out other features that will help make our newsletter more interactive, including a weekly question where you can share your opinions on key issues.  In this week's edition of the DeSaulnier Digest you will find updates on:

LEGISATIVE UPDATE 
Mark Announced the Suicide Prevention Assistance Act (H.R. 7116) This week, Mark announced the introduction of his bill to establish a new grant program to expand suicide prevention efforts for adults in doctor's offices and other primary care settings. Mark shared his personal story with suicide and why introducing the Suicide Prevention Assistance Act (H.R. 7116) is so important to him. Click the image below to watch.  
￼ 
Mark Voted No on the Manage Our Wolves Act (H.R. 6784) This week, the House took a vote on the Manage Our Wolves Act (H.R. 6784). This bill would undermine the Endangered Species Act, go around the scientific review, and prematurely delist the gray wolf as an endangered species. Despite my opposition, H.R. 6784 passed on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives by a vote of 196-to-180. 
MARK AROUND TOWN
Mark Recieves Humanitarian Award for Cancer Work: After successfully completing treatment for leukemia, Mark shared his story publically to add his voice to the growing number of people and families fighting cancer. Since his treatment, he has worked to grow federal investment in cancer research at the National Institutes of Health, foster a bipartisan conversation in Congress on ways to improve outcomes for cancer patients, and introduce legislation that would improve doctor-patient communication and help patients better navigate the unknowns of a diagnosis. This week Mark was presented the same award given to the late John McCain by Cancer Research & Treatment Fund, Inc. in New York City recognizing his work to better the lives of those living with and battling cancer.

                                      Pete’s Top Tweets RepPeteOlson  Last month, the unemployment rate in Texas was the lowest EVER! Our economy is booming & Texans are #BetterOffNow. http://bit.ly/2Kg9Eez   RepPeteOlson  Wow! By 2025, America's #LiquidFreedom will account for more than HALF of the world's oil & gas production! #Energy4Jobs https://on.wsj.com/2DvoP2c   RepPeteOlson  Great to welcome some of my #TX22 bosses from @BAPS in DC this morning! We had a good discussion on immigration & the importance of religion & charity in our community. Thanks for stopping by! ￼ 
Dear Friend,  Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to read about some of last week’s highlights in Washington, D.C.   Thanking Harvey Heroes  It was an honor to help recognize some amazing Harvey heroes. Many fantastic U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officers were deployed and did some incredible work during Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. More than 1,460 Commissioned Corps officers deployed during the 2017 hurricane season, with many deploying more than once. These heroes received the Humanitarian Service Medal for their efforts.  ￼  Rep. Pete Olson thanks U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officers for their response during Hurricane Harvey   Remembering Those Lost At Pearl Harbor  Almost 77 years after 2,300 soldiers, sailors and civilians were killed when Japanese aircraft attacked Pearl Harbor, we still remember their service and sacrifice. The House passed and I was proud to support the World War II Pacific Sites Establishment Act, which removes Pearl Harbor from the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument and establishes the Pearl Harbor National Memorial. Creating a new designation for Pearl Harbor will give the site and the service members the special recognition and honor they deserve. The bill also establishes the Honouliuli National Historic Site. Opened in March 1943, the Honouliuli Internment camp was the largest and longest used confinement site in Hawaii and during the course of the war over 2,000 Hawaiians with Japanese ancestry were interned. However, information regarding Honouliuli was kept secret for decades after the camp closed. Establishing the camp as a National Historic Site will help bring this chapter of history into the light so that future generations can learn about our past and prevent future mistakes. The bill passed the House by a bipartisan voice vote and now heads to the Senate for consideration.
Protecting Houses of Worship from Violence  The attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh is further evidence of an escalation of attacks on places of worship. Hatred and violence have no place in our country and we must work together to protect innocent Americans from these atrocities. That’s why I joined several House colleagues in sending a letter to the chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees urging them to fund a critical program to improve security at nonprofit organizations that are at a higher risk of being a target for terrorist attacks. We must make every effort to stop these attacks before they happen. 
I'm honored to represent you in Congress. For more information or to sign up for my E-newsletter, please visit my website, www.olson.house.gov.     Very respectfully, Pete Olson

News from Congresswoman Rosen
￼
Dear Friend, 
Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to attend a Veterans Day ceremony in Boulder City to honor the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. I'm honored to fight for Nevada families and I’ll continue working hard for our veterans and military families starting with protecting access to their health care.    
HONORING NEVADA’S VETERANS 
I’m forever grateful to the brave men and women who have courageously served in our military and sacrificed so much to defend our freedoms and values. 
￼ 
Rep. Jacky Rosen (NV-03) addresses Nevada veterans at Boulder City’s Veterans Day ceremony. 
I’m honored to represent the more than 200,000 veterans who call Nevada home and I will continue to work tirelessly on their behalf in Washington to ensure we support them and their families in every possible way.
Read more about my visit to Boulder City’s Veterans Day ceremony here. 
CONTINUING THE FIGHT TO PROTECT COVERAGE FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS 
Last month, my colleagues and I sent a letter urging the President to end his crusade to undermine our health care and drop his support for a lawsuit that would nullify protections for pre-existing conditions.  No issue is more personal or more important than protecting our health care. That’s why I will continue to fight back against the assaults on our health care system by working to defend protections for Americans across the country who are living with a pre-existing medical condition. Refusing to defend the existing law could take us back to the days when insurance companies could discriminate against people for everything from battling cancer to being pregnant and could put millions of American lives at risk.   To read the full text of the letter click here.  Read more about my House resolution to defend the constitutionality of pre-existing conditions protections here and about its momentum in Congress here. 
REMEMBERING TO GIVE THANKS
As we begin the holiday season, let us remember to give thanks to our servicemembers, law enforcement, and first responders who put their lives on the line each day to keep our families and loved ones safe. 
￼ 
It’s an absolute honor to represent you in Congress.

Dear Lindsey, 
As the holiday season approaches, constituents from all across Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District are traveling to Washington, D.C., with their families and loved ones. If you are planning a trip, don’t hesitate to reach out to my staff to schedule a U.S. Capitol tour. To submit your request, please give my Washington, D.C., office a call at (202) 225-1621 or fill out the tour request form on my website.

Last week on Capitol Hill, the Financial Services Committee heard testimony from the Honorable Randal Quarles, Vice Chairman for Supervision and Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. It is crucial to hold our financial services regulators accountable. This has been one of my top priorities as the Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. I was pleased to hear that Chairman Quarles holds transparency and accountability in the highest regard. I look forward to seeing the Federal Reserve reliably support economic opportunities for Americans and continue to roll back cumbersome mandates that stifle the commercial banking sector.

Heading into the final weeks of the year, Congress continues to work on important pieces of legislation and I am meeting with key members of our community. As always, I look forward to fighting for Missouri’s Second District in Washington. On Tuesday, I met with the Missouri Broadcasters Association about how local television stations are “repacking” their broadcast channels. This project was necessary to accommodate the change in broadcast frequency that was the result of last year's FCC spectrum auction to improve and expand wireless services. To learn more about the project, check out their website.

Every year for Pancreatic Cancer Day, we wear purple to demand better care for patients suffering from the world’s deadliest major cancer. Only 9% of Americans with pancreatic cancer survive over five years. By 2020, pancreatic cancer is expected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. Together we stand with those impacted by this disease and support research for new cures and treatments.

This week I look forward to giving thanks for the gift of family, friends, and the many blessings God has given us. I wish you and your loved ones a very Happy Thanksgiving, and good luck to anyone running in a Turkey Trot or playing holiday football!

Sincerely,
￼  Ann Wagner Member of Congress

Dear Neighbor, 
￼
Last week, we took the time from our everyday lives to commemorate our fellow Americans and Central Floridians who have all worn the uniforms that represent sacrifice and duty in the name of protecting the values of democracy.
From storming the beaches of Normandy to scaling the desert terrain in Afghanistan, Veterans Day marks the true testament to the fact that freedom does not come free. 
It's been a distinct privilege to have met and worked with many of our local veterans throughout different occasions this past year. From our Borinqueneers Post Office renaming, to opening the first Congressional office at the VA Hospital in Central Florida, to enacting legislation to protect veterans who are victims of sexual assault, to our participation in the Veterans History Project, and many other events in between. 
I've also been honored to have visited our troops abroad in Kuwait, Iraq, South Korea and the DMZ, the Syria-Lebanon border, and have an upcoming visit to the base in Afghanistan. These trips provide valuable conversations with our troops, to ensure we help provide all the resources they need, both abroad and at home. 
While these servants have gone above and beyond to exercise their commitment to country, we must also reiterate our commitment to ensuring that veterans continue to have access to their rightfully earned benefits. During this Congress, our district office has worked on resolving close to 520 veteran cases in our community. As the new Congress is upon us, I will continue working on legislative efforts that provide our veterans with the highest quality of care and services. 
Serving the people of Florida is one of my most important duties as a Member of Congress. In order to better serve veterans, I'd like to receive your feedback. Please take a moment to take the survey below. I look forward to hearing from you.   
Sincerely,

Dear fellow South Carolinians,  Thank you for subscribing to my weekly e-newsletter, and please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.   Hurricane Florence Update At the end of last week, I partnered with Lindsey Graham, Senator Richard Burr and Senator Thom Tillis to request additional disaster relief for areas still struggling in the wake Hurricane Florence. It will take many years to rebuild the Carolinas, requiring the combined efforts of state and federal agencies. It is our hope and request that emergency appropriations for states effected by Hurricane Florence be included in the next appropriations bill the Senate considers. You can read more here.   Criminal Justice Reform Last Wednesday, the White House announced its support behind a bipartisan criminal justice reform package that included the First Step Act, which I was proud to co-sponsor.  The First Step Act takes concrete measures to reduce recidivism, improve the reentry process for prisoners as they transition back into society, lower costs, and a variety of other steps that will both keep our streets safer and help ensure former inmates have a path to success after serving their debt to society. I am thrilled to see the President throw his support behind meaningful criminal justice reform. You can read my full statement here and watch the announcement here.   Coast Guard Reauthorization Act For years, I’ve worked to ensure that the Coast Guard Air Facility in Charleston stays open and fully functional. That’s why, last week, I was happy to see the passage of the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act which will ensure the security of the Coast Guard Air Facility.  Our state is blessed to have not only a beautiful coastline—but a useful one. Countless industries depend on safe and navigable waters off the coast of South Carolina to do their business, and as a proud military state, we know that the Coast Guard needs to have a presence in the Lowcountry to perform this critical mission every day.   Sincerely, ￼  Tim

Hice in the House 
Dear Friends,
With Congress back in session following the midterm elections, I was ready to roll up my sleeves and get back to work. Before the end of the year, those of us in the House hope to pass critical legislation that will bring opportunity to thousands of Americans across the country. Whether it’s funding for government agencies, reauthorizing the Farm Bill, or making progress on the border wall, we still have votes on the docket and goals to complete. I’m hopeful that my friends and colleagues from both sides of the aisle will engage in productive and civil conversations about how to make our government work better, and I promise to continue advocating for the best interests of Georgia's 10th Congressional District.
On Wednesday, we got back in the swing of things in committee with a hearing examining current cybersecurity strategies and interagency cooperation. During the joint hearing of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities and the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection, I spoke with officials from the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security to learn about the strides being made in building our cyber capabilities over the last few years. As work progresses enhancing these defenses, it is imperative that these two agencies effectively communicate and implement strategies that are complementary – without being redundant – to best protect our Nation and its interests. Click here to watch me speak with Assistant Secretary Jeanette Manfra, from the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications in the DHS, and Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense & Global Security Kenneth Rapuano, from the DOD.

Safe Holiday Travels
 As we head into one of the busiest travel times of the year, I want to remind Georgians to slow down, be alert, and use extra caution when driving to visit loved ones. In light of the heightened traffic during the holiday week, let’s keep in mind the law enforcement officers, first responders, and members of the military who are working around the clock to keep all of us safe. Click here to learn more holiday safety tips and preparedness strategies.

Academy Days
On Saturday morning, I proudly hosted interviews with prospective candidates for our Nation’s Service Academies. It’s one of my greatest privileges to nominate America’s future military leaders, and I want to recognize and thank my Academy Review Board for their exemplary service. Although from diverse backgrounds and professions, they all share a common vision – that only the most qualified and motivated young people should attend our prestigious academies. And, as is true for most volunteer panels, their service goes largely unnoticed. Being on the board requires hard work and an objective mind, and I very much appreciate each of you for taking on the responsibility of interviewing our state’s outstanding young men and women this year during the academy review process.

The Week Ahead
Thanksgiving is the time of year when we come together with family and give thanks for our many blessings. This year, I’m most thankful for my wife, Dee Dee, and our loving family and community members who support us at every turn.
As always, I’m here to serve you. Please contact my office with any questions, comments, or concerns. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to keep track of upcoming legislation and events!

Welcoming Newly-Elected Members of Congress to Washington    
￼  It was great seeing all the new faces in Washington last week. Here I am with (left to right) Congresswoman-elect Ilhan Omar, Congressman-elect Dean Phillips, and Congresswoman-elect Angie Craig. With leadership like this, I am confident that Minnesota's best days are ahead.  
Dear Friend, 
Preparing to retire from Congress at age 75, I could not be more excited or optimistic about the freshmen class of newly-elected Members who arrived in Washington last week for their orientation. At 90 strong, they are the most new faces since the “Watergate Congress” of 1975 – when at age 33, I joined 49 other newly-elected Democrats to begin my first period of Congressional service. 
Today’s new Members are also young – the new Congress will be ten years younger on average – smart, aggressive and diverse. On the Democratic side, the 116th Congress will include 28 new women, including two who are Muslim, 12 new people of color, two new Native Americans, one new LGBTQ Member, and six new military Veterans. 
Meeting with them, it’s clear that they are determined to make a difference, change the way we do politics, and address long-neglected issues including reducing the cost of health care, passing real tax relief for the middle class, reforming immigration, and putting a stop to endless wars of choice that are projected to cost nearly $20 trillion over the next two decades. 
Having just come off a campaign season during which more than $5.2 billion was spent – much of it by outside groups buying negative and false TV ads – many are eager to pass a Constitutional Amendment overturning the U.S Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision. Citizens United has allowed countless billions of dollars from special interest groups to poison our campaigns and erode public confidence in our leaders and our public policymaking process. 
Moreover, new and returning Members of both sides of the aisle are already demanding that Congress become a much more democratic institution, with a return to the traditional system of Regular Order. Under Regular Order, every bill and amendment must be considered under an open rule and given an up or down vote. That is how we embrace bipartisanship, find common ground, solve problems, and get things done. 
As these new Members of Congress will soon realize, our Nation’s founders gave us a system in which change is possible, but rarely quick or easy. We wish them well in their efforts to advance America’s highest ideals. 
We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email. 
Sincerely,  ￼ 

Major Boost in Federal Cancer Research Funding Set for 2019   We are making progress in funding for research into lung cancer, the deadliest of all cancers 
￼  Click on the screen above to hear me address the “Life and Breath” rally in front of the U.S. Capitol. Hundreds of lung cancer survivors, family members and supporters joined our daughter Katherine and me and other members of our Congressional Lung Cancer Caucus for this event to point out that lung cancer is a national emergency. 
November is Lung Cancer Awareness Month. Over the years, I’ve made it a mission to help accelerate the war on cancer – and specifically boost federal funding for urgently needed research into lung cancer, the deadliest of all cancers. Last year, I passed two bipartisan amendments that added $5.8 million for lung cancer research. 
This year, we added another $6 million originally intended for the Pentagon’s lung cancer research program. While this funding increase was ultimately rejected by the Republicans in final budget negotiations, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) saw a much bigger boost for cancer research. 
Specifically, the FY 2019 Defense Appropriations Act included $5.74 billion for NCI, a $79 million increase over FY 2018. NCI also received $400 million in FY 2019 for the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot, which was authorized in the 21st Century Cures Act I strongly supported in 2016. 
The entire budget for cancer research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) next year is projected to be about $5.74 billion, with about $282 million targeted specifically for lung cancer. 
Meeting earlier this year with NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins, I urged him to prioritize lung cancer research at the National Cancer Institute.
(In September, Congress increased funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by $2 billion to $39.1 billion – $4.3 billion more than the President’s initial request.) 
Hopefully, the incoming Congress will continue our efforts to boost lung cancer research at the Pentagon from the current $14 million to at least $20 million – its original level when the program was initiated several years ago. Beyond what’s being accomplished at NIH, these funds are targeted to special lung cancer research linked to the unique exposures to cancer-causing substances our military experience in and out of combat. 
In fact, an extensive study conducted by the prestigious Walter Reed Medical Center has concluded that our military Veterans are up to 75 percent more likely to develop lung cancer than people who do not serve in the military. We know that is largely due to high rates of exposure to carcinogens like asbestos, diesel fuel, depleted uranium, and, of course, Agent Orange from the Vietnam era. 

Why Are So Many Young Women Who Don't Smoke Getting Lung Cancer?
￼  Our youngest daughter, Katherine, and I have made it our mission to help boost federal funding for research to better prevent, diagnose, treat, and ultimately find a cure for lung cancer – and to spread awareness of this disease. Katherine is a four-year survivor of Stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer, with no known risk factors.
We need to find out why lung cancer – the deadliest of all cancers – has become epidemic among young women, the great majority of whom don’t smoke. Here in the United States, an average of 193 women die each day of lung cancer – one every 7 minutes. Our own youngest daughter, Katherine, is a four-year survivor of Stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer, with no known risk factors. 
Knowledge and funding are the keys to winning the battle against lung cancer.  So as co-chairs and co-founders of the Congressional Lung Cancer Caucus, New Jersey Republican Congressman Frank LoBiondo and I have reintroduced our bipartisan “Women and Lung Cancer Research and Preventive Services Act.” 
This legislation requires the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a comprehensive study on women and lung cancer in order to answer the question: Why it is that women, many of whom have never smoked in their lives, are being diagnosed with lung cancer at such an extreme rate? 
More specifically, the study would evaluate and recommend the best ways to accelerate research on women and lung cancer, boost access to preventative services, and develop strong and effective public awareness and education campaigns. 
Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California have teamed to introduce the bipartisan Senate companion bill to our House measure.  

Hard-Earned Worker Pensions Must be Protected
￼  It’s easy to get worked up for a good cause, as I clearly did at this press conference announcing introduction of the Butch Lewis Act to ensure that no retiree’s hard-earned pension would ever be cut – not by one dime!  
Hats off to all the Minnesota Teamsters, and so many other Union members and supporters who came to Washington last week to demand that Congress take action to protect their hard-earned pensions. As a Teamster, I was proud to help lead the successful effort to stop drastic cuts by the Central States Pension Fund that would have left hundreds of thousands of Teamsters with only a fraction of the pensions they have earned and paid into over a lifetime of work. 
The workers kept their part of the bargain. They faithfully contributed every dollar they had contracted for. However, some 13,000 companies did NOT pay their pension obligations into the Central States Pension Fund. It is simply preposterous to suggest that the working Americans who honored their contracts should be the ones to suffer for this corporate irresponsibility. Had those companies fulfilled their obligations, Central States would be in good shape today.
And as I have pointed out many times before, Central States is only the tip of the iceberg. Whether by mergers and bankruptcies, or mismanagement or malfeasance, thousands of employers have failed to meet their contractual obligations. And as a result, more than 500 multi-employer pension funds are in serious trouble. 
That’s why I’m championing “The Butch Lewis Act” in the House. The measure, named after an Ohio Teamster, would establish a mechanism through the U.S. Treasury to ensure that no retiree’s hard-earned pension would ever be cut – not by one dime!  
As a co-founder and co-chair of the new Pension Protection for Working Americans Caucus in House, I’ve also taken the lead on a complementary bill to prevent companies that merge or go bankrupt from reneging on their obligations to millions of workers and retirees. 
Among other things, the“Keep Our Pension Promises Act” ensures that when a company merges or goes bankrupt, their pension obligations to their workers are put at the top of the list of things to be paid – not the bottom of the list.  
Make no mistake about it. We will not rest until every single worker is assured of receiving every single dime and dollar of their hard-earned pensions.  

Building Support to Rescue the Common Loon Before They Become Extinct in North America
￼  Challenged by the effects of climate change, the BP oil spill, pollution, and diseases spread by invasive zebra mussels, the Minnesota Common Loon is on the Audubon Society’s list of species whose existence is endangered in North America.  
With that in mind, our daughter Leah Nolan-Heggerston - representing the National Loon Center Foundation - and I spent part of last week meeting with officials from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, the Department of Interior, Environmental Pollution Control Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the United States Department of Agriculture to discuss our mission to construct a research and education center for the Common Loon in Crosslake, Minnesota.   
We also met with several Members of Congress to discuss this important effort, including Minnesota Congresswoman Betty McCollum (D) and California Congressman Ken Calvert (R). The center would be devoted to restoring and protecting loon habitats, repairing shoreline, infrastructure, enhancing water quality, boosting environmental recreation, and educating the public on best practices for preserving loon populations. 

Our Week in DC
￼  Last week, I met with several representatives of the University of Minnesota Leadership Education in Neurodevelopment Disabilities (LEAP) to discuss the Reauthorization of the Autism Cares Act, which was last reauthorized in 2014. Reauthorizing the Autism Cares Act would increase the federal government's response to the growing number of individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders - ultimately improving quality of life and reducing human and financial costs associated with this disorder.  
Our Week in Duluth
￼  My District Director Jeff Anderson spoke to the Duluth Chamber of Commerce 2019 Leadership Duluth class about the role of Congress and the legislative process. Jeff highlighted my successful legislative efforts to stop logging trucks from using downtown Duluth streets and to instead use the federal interstate.
Our Week in North Branch  
￼  Susan Taylor from Family Pathways spoke at the Chisago County Senior Center in North Branch about recognizing Dementia symptoms. My Field Representative Rick Olseen also spoke on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and Senior Scams.
Our Week in Brainerd 
￼  Brainerd area residents gathered to honor veterans and celebrate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. In this photo, the Honor Guard from the American Legion, VFW, and DAV post the colors and give a 21-gun salute. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein attended the ceremony on my behalf. 
￼  Brainerd’s Comprehensive Plan Steering Committee hosted a community design session. Attendees moved through several stations and weighed in on different ideas for the city, including expanding the public library, installing more planters downtown, and increasing housing. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein attended the meeting and took this picture. 
Our Week in Chisholm 
￼  Chisholm’s Broadband Coalition met this week to discuss new project initiatives. Members include representatives from the Chisholm School District, the Chisholm Economic Development Authority, the Minnesota Discovery Center, the Blandin Foundation, and surrounding businesses and residents. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tom Whiteside attended the meeting on my behalf.

Finally...
Minnesota ranks #2 in the Nation for volunteering.
￼  Did you know Minnesota was ranked #2 according to a recent study done by the Corporation for National and Community Service? The Volunteering in America data shows that Minnesota loves to volunteer - paying it forward to those who need it most! Minnesotans gave back to their communities last year, providing millions of dollars worth of economic value to the state. Are you ready to give back to your community? You can visit serve.gov to go volunteer now!

Dear Friend:  
Greetings.   
As families gather later this week to celebrate Thanksgiving, let us all remember our veterans and active duty military and their families. On behalf of the people of Oregon’s 2nd District, I want to personally thank them for their service and sacrifice so that we can enjoy the fruits of liberty and freedom.   
Greg Walden Invites Air Force Secretary to Kingsley Field for Historic Visit
For the first time since the base’s construction in 1928, the Secretary of the United States Air Force visited Kingsley Field earlier this month at my invitation. I invited Secretary Wilson to Klamath Falls to tour Kingsley Field, hear about the broad community support for the base and the troops stationed there, and meet with local veterans. 
￼ 
Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson and I examine an F-15 fighter jet at Kingsley Field Air National Guard Base in Klamath Falls. 
During our tour of Kingsley Field, Secretary Wilson got a firsthand look at the expansive air space, state-of-the-art military infrastructure, and tireless work ethic of Kingsley’s leaders and the troops stationed at the base. Secretary Wilson also heard about the challenge of replacing aging aircraft at the base, and why Kingsley Field is uniquely positioned to become a future home of a next generation fighter jet, like the F-35. 
￼ 
Following our tour of Kingsley Field, I convened a roundtable discussion with Secretary Wilson, local officials, and community leaders to discuss the broad support in the Klamath Basin for Kingsley. Kingsley plays a vital role in our national defense strategy, as well as job creation and the local economy in the Basin. Leaders in the higher education, medical, and business community in Klamath Falls told Secretary Wilson about the positive relationship they have with the base, and about how Kingsley Field is a true keystone in the community. 
￼ 
Air Force secretary pays historic visit to Kingsley 
The Secretary of the Air Force paid a visit this weekend to Kingsley Field Air National Guard Base for the first time in history.
Rep. Greg Walden invited Heather Wilson, the 24th Secretary of the Air Force, to Kingsley to meet troops and commanders and scope it out as a potential site for a new fighter jet like the F-35.

Walden and Secretary Wilson Meet with Local Veterans 
￼ 
Secretary Wilson and I gather for a breakfast with local veterans in Klamath Falls. Secretary Wilson joined the breakfast fully suited in a custom “173rd Fighter Wing” fighter pilot suit, which she wore in preparation for her flight in one of Kingsley’s iconic F-15’s later that morning. 
Before Secretary Wilson departed Kingsley Field, we concluded her visit with a breakfast with local veterans in Klamath Falls. Secretary Wilson was part of the first graduating class at the U.S. Air Force Academy that began accepting women, and served our country in the Air Force following graduation. Secretary Wilson is a third generation pilot, and her grandfather flew for the Royal Flying Corps during World War I. This breakfast was an excellent opportunity for Secretary Wilson and local veterans to share their experiences in the service, and to discuss the challenges facing those who have served our country in uniform. 
Secretary Wilson and I served together in the House of Representatives, and we worked together over several months with Colonel Jeff Smith and the Oregon Air National Guard to make this historic visit a success. I appreciate Secretary Wilson’s willingness to come here on the ground to see why Kingsley Field is such an integral part of our national security strategy and local community in Klamath Falls. And thank you to Colonel Smith and the troops stationed at Kingsley for your service to our country and your tremendous efforts to make Secretary Wilson’s visit to Klamath Falls one for the history books.

Rep. Walden, Air Force Secretary eat with local veterans 
Local veterans sat down with Air Force secretary Heather Wilson in Klamath Falls Sunday morning. Hosted by Congressman Greg Walden (R-OR, 2nd District), a group of about 20 veterans gathered for an intimate breakfast discussion.
""This community is really important to the support of the base and it's great to have veteran leaders in the community,"" Wilson said.

Greg Walden Thanks Local Veterans in Grants Pass for Their Service 
￼ 
One of the greatest privileges I have as a member of Congress is meeting with the brave men and women who have served our country in uniform, like the veterans with Grants Pass Veteran's Breakfast. The monthly Grants Pass Veteran's Breakfast is a great opportunity for camaraderie and friendship for veterans in the area. Recently, I had the honor of joining the veterans at their breakfast to give an update on my efforts to make sure they are receiving the care and support they deserve at the VA. 
With my strong support, Congress has passed into law historic funding for the VA to ensure the VA has the needed resources to give veterans access to the best care possible. We’ve also directed resources specifically aimed at serving veterans in rural areas and strengthening mental health and suicide prevention programs. In addition, we’ve also passed into law the VA Mission Act to bolster the VA, fully fund the VA Choice Program, and give veterans timelier access to quality care through my legislation -- the VA Medical Scribe Pilot Act. 
Thank you to the veterans with Grants Pass Veterans Breakfast for inviting me to your monthly meeting, and for your service to our country. 
Greg Walden Honors Local Family Member of WWII OSS Officer 
￼ 
Earlier this month in Medford, State Representative Sal Esquivel and I had the honor to present Ashland resident Sherry Smilo the Congressional Gold Medal in in recognition of her father, SGT Sidney Smilo. SGT Sidney Smilo served our country during WWII as a member of the 801st/492nd Bombardment group (Carpet baggers), the air arm of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the predecessor of the modern Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). 
The men and women who comprised America’s first spy agency were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, collectively, in recognition of their superior service and major contributions during WWII. These women and men -- who performed some of the bravest acts of the war -- had never before been collectively recognized for their heroic and pioneering service. 
It was a privilege to present Sherry with this much deserved recognition of her father’s service to our country, especially during Military Family Appreciation Month. America’s military is strong in part because of the family, friends, and loved ones who support those who serve our country in uniform. 
As we recognize Military Family Appreciation Month this November, please join me in thanking the families of our service members for their unwavering commitment to the brave Americans who defend our freedoms. Military families serve too, and we are forever in their debt. 
Greg Walden Names Two Oregon Students as Congressional App Challenge Winners
￼ 
From left, Rogelio Lemus and Ethan Orozco, juniors at Hermiston High School in Pendleton, created the winning app for the 2018 Congressional App Challenge. 
Recently, I was proud to announce that Rogelio Lemus and Ethan Orozco, juniors at Hermiston High School, are the 2018 winners of the Congressional App Challenge for our district. The Congressional App Challenge is a competition to encourage students across the country to learn how to code by creating their own applications. The App Challenge highlights the value of computer science and STEM education (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). 
Rogelio and Ethan created an app -- called B.A.N.A.N.A -- using facial recognition technology to help find missing people. The app allows people to upload a photo of a missing person to compare the photo against a national database. 
I applaud Rogelio and Ethan for their coding skills, their goal of helping people and their ability to communicate the usefulness of their app. Rogelio and Ethan chose a worthy project that has the potential to help local law enforcement. 
The Congressional App Challenge is an avenue for encouraging students to pursue careers in coding, math or science fields and I hope Rogelio and Ethan will do so. If you or someone you know is interested in learning more about the Congressional App Challenge, you can find more information on my website here. 
￼ 
Hermiston students win app challenge 
Two Hermiston students have created an app that may help locate missing people, and have been recognized by Congressman Greg Walden for their work.
Hermiston High School juniors Rogelio Lemus and Ethan Orozco created the “B.A.N.A.N.A” app, which stands for “Basic App to Notify Authorities of Non-Authorized Abductions.”

Connolly Plans Defense of Federal Employees as Incoming Subcommittee Chair

By: Joe Davidson
Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) is clear on what a Democratic majority in the House next year will mean for the federal workforce:
“First of all, I think the hostility to federal employees and their … unions will end.” 
Connolly is in position to do something about that. He’s prepped to be chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on government operations, after serving as its ranking Democrat.
In addition to the workforce, the subcommittee’s jurisdiction includes federal contractors, the U.S. Postal Service, federal IT management, Metro and more — issues of prime importance to the DMV. While that could change, Connolly will continue to have a strong hand in issues affecting federal employees. His Northern Virginia district has many, and lots of contractors, too.
We spoke with Connolly about the House Democratic takeover in the 116th Congress and his priorities as the subcommittee-chairman-in-waiting. His comment about hostility toward federal workers and their unions was right on time.
Three federal unions sued the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) last week over its “Notice of Repudiation.” The day after Election Day, VA unilaterally repudiated parts of collective bargaining agreements that allowed medical professionals to use “official time,” claiming it “negatively impacts direct patient care.” 
Federal law allows individuals to participate in defined workplace activities in their capacity as union leaders while being paid by the government. They are prohibited from internal union business while on official time and must represent the entire bargaining unit, not just union members. Republicans have long sought to cut official time, which is a target of President Trump’s aggression toward federal labor organizations.
But Connolly has reminded him that “this administration cannot eviscerate United States law by fiat.” 
As chairman of the subcommittee, he would have more authority to ensure that doesn’t happen.
“We believe strongly that federal employees need to be respected and their rights in the workplace upheld and strengthened,” Connolly said. “So, we’ll take a very different approach than that which has characterized the Republican leadership … I think you’ll see a reversal on a lot of fronts,” including GOP hits on federal workplace rights and compensation. “I think that will have practical consequences that are good for federal employees. I think that’s a big change.” 
VA’s action attempts to skirt Trump’s May 25 executive orders seeking to eviscerate union influence. The directives have largely been blocked by a federal court order, which the administration is appealing.
“Legislation to overturn President Trump’s three executive orders aimed at making it impossible for federal unions to represent their members, and essentially rendering the federal government an at-will employer” is at the top of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers federal workforce agenda.
When the orders were issued, the administration said they made it “easier for agencies to remove poor-performing employees and ensure that taxpayer dollars are more efficiently used."" 
Connolly is wary of the administration’s goal and doubtful about its method.
“I think the Congress can certainly assert itself” and oppose Trump’s workforce actions, Connolly said. “We’re not at all convinced that all of this can be done by executive order. And I think we’re prepared to challenge that, including in court if we have to.” 
He also challenges the administration’s right to reorganize federal agencies, including the suggested privatization of the Postal Service, without congressional approval.
“If you want to reorganize the federal government. You come to Congress with a proposal for its consideration,” he said. “That is the regular order of things.” 
His focus on civil service protections, compensation and labor organizations is supported by union leaders.
“We expect the House to demonstrate its respect for the apolitical civil service and the union rights of federal employees,” said American Federation of Government Employees President J. David Cox Sr. “We are also counting on the House and the Senate to resist the administration’s efforts to undermine federal pay, retirement, and health insurance benefits.” 
Among other issues, Connolly expects the committee to probe the administration’s decision to add a citizenship question on the next census. “Oh, absolutely,” there will be hearings on that, he said with emphasis. “And I would expect subpoenas to flow” to determine how that decision was made, he added.
On the civil service reform front, Teresa W. Gerton, president and chief executive of the National Academy of Public Administration, wants Congress to fund training and encourage agencies to be more flexible in the use of personnel management tools “so that they can manage their workforce in a way that supports their mission while still upholding merit principles.” 
Democrats, Connolly said, are “certainly willing to consider meaningful reforms that make government more efficient and make it take the hiring process a little easier.” 
But they won’t support efforts that are “simply designed to shrink the federal workforce and further constrain the rights of federal employees in the workplace. If that’s the agenda under the guise of reform, we’re not going to cooperate, we’re going to resist.” 
“We’ve seen nothing but attempts to rein in the rights of the workers …” he added, “and that makes us obviously quite suspicious as to motives.”

Dear Friends, 
Let me start this week by wishing you and yours a Happy Thanksgiving. This is a special time of year for family and friends, and an opportunity to pause and take stock of all we have to be grateful for – both as individuals and as Americans. I was glad to join Thanksgiving celebrations over the weekend and this morning in Wheeling, Buffalo Grove, and Waukegan, and look forward to joining other neighbors at events throughout the district this week. 
￼ 
  
Serving meals at the Wheeling Park District Thanksgiving Community Feast, talking with neighbors at the Community Interfaith Thanksgiving Celebration in Buffalo Grove, and volunteering at Catholic Charities’ Community Center in Waukegan 
Last week, Congress returned to Washington for the first time since the election. It was a busy week filled with conversations about the priorities we want to set for the coming session – including putting working families first, improving the quality and lower the cost of health care, and getting Congress working again for our communities and nation.
Please continue reading for more information about how our office can help veterans affected by GI Bill issues, an update on our meeting with the EPA Administrator on ethylene oxide emissions, and other details from the previous week. 
  
HELP AVAILABLE FOR VETERANS WITH GI BILL ISSUES 
Last week, media outlets reported that some veterans have experienced serious delays receiving the benefits they have earned under the GI Bill. This is an unacceptable breakdown of the commitments we’ve made to veterans that must be fixed as soon as possible. 
Until this problem is corrected, constituent service representatives in our office are here to help. If you are a veteran of the Tenth District who has been affected by GI Bill payment issues, please get in touch at (847) 383-4870.
  
MEETING WITH EPA ADMINISTRATOR ON ETHYLENE OXIDE 
￼ 
  
Every family should have safe breathing air. Last week, I joined Sens. Durbin and Duckworth, as well as Rep. Foster and Rep.-Elect Caten to meet with Acting EPA Director Wheeler to ensure the EPA implements and enforces high, science-based standards on ethylene oxide to protect our public health. The residents of Waukegan, Gurnee, and Park City also deserve to know their communities are safe, which is why I communicated that it is critical the EPA embraces transparency by making all test data publicly available and holding a public meeting.
This weekend, I also joined Mayor Kristina Kovarik in Gurnee to hear from residents on this issue. I will continue to fight for our communities until the EPA takes all necessary action. 
  
BRAD’S BOOKWORMS ELEMENTARY READING PROGRAM STILL ENROLLING! 
There’s still time for Tenth District elementary students to enroll and complete the Brad’s Bookworms reading challenge! 
Children participating in the program are asked to read at least 10 books with help from parents, grandparents, older siblings, or other family members before November 30, 2018 and track their progress toward this goal. Young people who meet their goal of 10 books will be invited with their families to join me at a recognition ceremony celebrating their achievement.
Learn more about the program on our website. 
  
NEIGHBORHOOD OFFICE HOURS 
This week, our constituent service representatives will be in Mt. Prospect and Glenview If you need assistance with a federal issue, from Medicare and Social Security to Immigration and the VA, please come see us!
View the full schedule on our website. 
  
WEEKLY WRAP-UP 
￼ 
  
Glad to stand with Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. This will be the Congress when we finally take action to pass universal background checks and other common sense measures to save lives. 
 
￼
￼
After President Trump's decision to fire Attorney General Sessions, Congress must exercise our responsibility to uphold the rule of law. Last week, I spoke on the House floor urging action to pass legislation protecting the Special Counsel investigation.
  
￼ 
  
I visited attendees at the Health and Services Fair in Mundelein sponsored by the Latino Police Academy. I’m glad our office could participate with a booth on the constituent services available for Tenth District residents.
  
￼ 
  
I spoke at an event sponsored by Hadassah Chicago-North Shore about rising above anti-Semitism and intolerance. This was an important community conversation amidst rising hate and the recent shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.
Thanks for reading!

11/19/18 15:21,Veteran Entrepreneurs ,"￼ 
November 19, 2018

Dear Friend, 
                                                                
There are 2.5 million veteran-owned small businesses across the nation.  We are thankful for their service to our nation and for the important investment they make to our economy.  Rob Pepper, owner of Pepper's Race II Food Mart and Deli in Eupora, is one member of this distinguished group of entrepreneurs.  Rob proudly served our nation for 27 years in the Mississippi National Guard.  In August 2007, Rob opened his convenience store and restaurant.  

￼

Rob enjoys being able to operate a business in his hometown.  ""I would like to see even more veterans go into business for themselves,"" Rob said.  ""I enjoy being able to serve the community any way I can.""  

Our veteran entrepreneurs have invested their hard-earned money to provide jobs to our citizens.  They have earned and deserve our support.  Through my role on the House Small Business Committee, I will continue to advocate for policies that roll back costly regulations and make it easier for veterans and all of our small business operators to conduct business. 

HONORING OUR VETERANS AND MILITARY FAMILIES

On November 11, our nation recognized Veterans Day.  Throughout the First District and across America, citizens came together to thank all those who have served our nation.  It is through their service and the many sacrifices of their loved ones back home that we are free.  It is with this in mind, that the month of November has been designated National Veterans and Military Families month.  

￼

At this hour, men and women in uniform are watching over us, including Mississippi National Guard soldiers of the 155th Armored Brigade Combat Team.  Sergeant First Class (SFC) Kasey Herndon and Staff Sergeant (SSG) Josh Herndon, Monroe County natives, are among those who deployed to the Middle East this summer in support of Operation Spartan Shield.  Jackie Benson, Kasey and Josh's aunt, shared their story with us.  Jackie said her nephews followed in the footsteps of their grandfather and military veteran, Jack Pugh.  ""June Sanders and Rick Herndon, Kasey and Josh's parents, are super proud of their boys,"" Jackie said.  ""We are all thankful that they are together during this deployment which is Kasey's third and Josh's first.""  Jackie said their families miss them, but are equally proud of their service.  Kasey and his wife, Tiffany, are the proud parents of Shane and Dean.  Jackie said Josh and his wife, Skky, plan to start a family when he returns home from the Middle East.  

We are thankful for all those who are serving our nation and look forward to sharing more of their stories with you.


COOPER TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY

￼

Cooper Tire & Rubber Company has delivered some great news for the First District.  The company has opened a new, one-million-square-foot warehouse in Byhalia, creating 100 jobs.  This is Cooper's largest distribution center in America.  Bob Sager, Cooper's Director of Supply Chain, said the facility is a compliment to their U.S. distribution network.  ""We are excited to have now opened this new facility, which serves to enhance our logistics infrastructure, supporting our efforts to offer exceptional service to our customers as we get tires to them when and where they want them.""  Cooper has three tire manufacturing plants in the United States, including one in Tupelo.  We are thankful for Cooper's investment in our workforce, the First District, and the state of Mississippi.                                     
                                            

ABBY MANUFACTURING EXPANSION

When the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act was passed by the House and the Senate and signed into law by President Trump, companies - one after another, moved forward with plans to re-invest in their operations.  As a result, scores of jobs have been created.  The surging economy and a fast-growing demand for more American products are two of the reasons why Abby Manufacturing in Walnut is expanding again this year.  

￼

The manufacturer of steel and aluminum products is responding to an increase in business with a $1.4 million corporate investment that will create 10 jobs.  Earlier this year, Abby Manufacturing added new laser cutting machines, a $324,000 investment that created 10 jobs.  We appreciate each and every one of our job creators who are having a profound impact on the lives of Mississippians.

11/19/18 15:04,My Priorities for the Next Congress ,"
  
￼
Dear Neighbors,
Based on the recent elections, I will have the opportunity to act on many important issues that that will make a difference in the lives of millions of New Jerseyans. In January, I intend to become the next Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees many important issues, including: healthcare, the environment, the internet and broadband, and consumer protection. 
As Chairman, I will push policies to build a stronger economy, create more good-paying jobs and protect consumers from skyrocketing costs that make it increasingly difficult to make ends meet. We’ll also conduct vigorous oversight of the Trump Administration, so Washington starts to work again for the people, not special interests. 
Below is a list of items that I have fought for throughout my career and will prioritize in the next Congress:
	•	Lower health care and prescription drug costs;
	•	Undo the Trump Administration’s efforts to sabotage our health care system;
	•	Strengthen Medicare and Medicaid;
	•	Rebuild America by investing in green energy, drinking water and broadband infrastructure;
	•	Address climate change by looking at the impacts on communities and the economy, and holding the Administration accountable for its policies that make it worse;
	•	Restore environmental protections gutted over the last two years;
	•	Protect net neutrality;
	•	Provide meaningful privacy and data security protections.
These priorities are incredibly important for keeping New Jersey safe, affordable and prosperous for working families for generations to come. Please take a moment to let me know how you feel about these issues by contacting me on my website at pallone.house.gov  or on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter.
Sincerely, 
Congressman Frank Pallone

Dear Lindsey,

Working with the Census is yet another opportunity for residents of the 15th District of Texas to directly represent and improve their communities.

	2.	Addresses questions, concerns and issues related to current and potential partners and stakeholders.
	3.	Establish partnership agreements with federal, state, local, and tribal governments, and/or local businesses and community groups to develop specific strategies to eliminate enumeration barriers in specific regions in support of the 2020 Decennial Census.
	4.	Develop presentations, give briefings, conduct meetings and promote partnerships with various governments, local businesses and community groups.

 Time To Use A Science-Based Approach To Wolf Management 
Before Friday's vote on my bipartisan legislation, the Manage Our Wolves Act, I spoke on the House floor in support of the bill. 
It gives management of the gray wolf population to our states, who are far more in tune in with their local ecosystem than bureaucrats in Washington. 
I'd like to thank my Republican and Democrat colleagues for supporting this important reform, because Wisconsin farmers deserve to protect their livestock.

Dear Lindsey, 
From my family to yours, happy Thanksgiving! As I sit around the table with my family this holiday, I want to thank our brave men and women who have selflessly chosen to serve and are away from their loved ones during this season. At this time last year, I was able to visit with our troops overseas. Tens of thousands of service members will not be at home with their families this Thanksgiving. Please remember them at your family’s table this year.
￼ 
A lot has gone on the past couple of months. I wanted to update you on a couple of items that you may have missed.
  
Joining the President in our Commitment to Fight the Opioid Epidemic 
In Western Pennsylvania and across the nation, too many of our family members, neighbors, and friends have been lost to the opioid crisis. In the fight to end this epidemic, I recently had the honor of joining the President at the White House as he signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act into law. 
￼  It was a pleasure to join President Trump at the White House signing ceremony for the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. 
This comprehensive, bipartisan legislation is designed to bring critical resources to the front lines of the opioid battle. I am proud to have contributed to this new law, which included my bipartisan bills, the REGROUP Act, Expanding Access to Treatment Act, and CODE RED Act. Together these pieces of legislation provide additional resources to federal, state, and local programs to stop drug traffickers and increase access to treatment for people suffering from addiction. 
This crisis requires an all-hands-on deck, comprehensive approach on a local, state, federal, and international level to provide solutions. As a member of the Congressional Bipartisan Heroin Task Force, the Judiciary Committee, and the Financial Service Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance, I have been able to focus on providing for the safety, relief, and care that our families and communities deserve.
In case you missed it, I joined Frank Sparks and Pat Septak on WBVP-WMBA to talk about the measures my colleagues and I have taken in the fight to end the opioid epidemic and keep all Americans safe. Click here to listen. 
  
Medicare Open Enrollment 
We are now in the middle of open enrollment season for Medicare.
On October 12, 2018, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance amounts for Medicare Parts A and B for 2019. Enrollees are now able to view their options for receiving Medicare benefits. 
The Medicare Open Enrollment period began on October 15, 2018 and ends December 7, 2018. CMS has made improvements to the Medicare.gov website to help beneficiaries compare options and decide if standard Medicare or Medicare Advantage is right for them. The site also now includes an out of pocket calculator that will provide information on both overall costs and prescription drug costs for enrollees. You can also obtain assistance and information by calling Medicare toll free at 1-800-MEDICARE or APPRISE at 1-800-783-7067. APPRISE is a free health insurance counseling program offered by the Pennsylvania Department of Aging. 
Additionally, last Congress, I sponsored the bipartisan Medicare Beneficiary Preservation of Choice Act. Signed into law in 2016, my legislation restores the critical 90-day re-enrollment period for Medicare Advantage plans that was taken away by the Affordable Care Act. If you choose the wrong Medicare Advantage plan during open enrollment, you will have the opportunity to change plans between January 1st  and March 31st  because of my legislation. Restoring this re-enrollment period gives seniors the flexibility they need to make sure they choose the best Advantage plan that works for them. This restoration takes effect in January 2019.

Expanding Opportunity for All Western Pennsylvanians 
￼  For many parts of Western Pennsylvania, Opportunity Zone investment is likely to bring about new family-sustaining job opportunities, which in turn will allow more young people to stay and prosper where they were raised. 
The Opportunity Zones program is a key provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that will encourage investment in underserved communities, including parts of Beaver Falls, Midland, Aliquippa, Johnstown and Somerset. By attracting more private sector capital to these areas, this program can encourage more business formation, job creation, and higher wages for Western Pennsylvanians.  Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) and I recently co-wrote an Op-Ed in the Post-Gazette to highlight this important initiative and how it will directly serve hardworking Western Pennsylvanians and their families. Read here. 
If I can be of any assistance to you or your family, please reach out to my office at 412-837-1361 or go to my website at rothus.house.gov. Also, if you need help with Social Security, Medicare, or another federal agency or program, my office is here to help!

Dear Friends, 
It has been a busy week in Washington. The House of Representatives started the week by electing strong Republican leadership to guide us into the 116th Congress. As we enter the final weeks of the year, there is still lots to get done, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to finish the year strong.  
Here's a look at a few of the highlights from my week:  
Honoring Our Veterans
￼ 
I have had the pleasure of meeting many veterans throughout my career, and each time I am humbled knowing there are such brave men and women who have served our great country. You may not know that West Tennessee actually has the highest concentration of veterans in the state. Last weekend, we observed Veterans Day, an opportunity to reflect on the sacrifices of our servicemembers of past and present. Below are just a few of the ways I was able to honor our nation's heroes last week. 
￼    
It was an honor to attend the City of Bartlett Veterans Day Ceremony in Veterans Park. Our veterans deserve the utmost respect, and I was humbled to be among so many local veterans as we showed our gratitude as a community. Thank you to Bartlett Mayor Keith McDonald for having me. 
￼ 
I also enjoyed my time in Lauderdale County honoring our veterans. They hosted a great ceremony and parade in honor of our nation's heroes, and I was glad to be in attendance. I was proud to honor these brave men and women alongside Senator Ed Jackson, General Gus Hargett, and Mayor Jon Pavletic. Thank you to Mayor Maurice Gaines for honoring our veterans in this special way. 
￼ 
We must remember the great debt that we owe veterans and members of the armed services who fight to maintain our freedom and prosperity. In fact, I believe it is our duty as leaders and lawmakers to ensure that these people receive the resources and quality of care they deserve. Veterans have sacrificed so much on our behalf, so it is our duty to ensure that their sacrifice ends when they come back home. 
I promise to always fight to protect our veterans and active servicemembers, and I hope you will take the time to say a prayer for those who have served or are currently serving and remember their sacrifices. May we honor you today and every day.  

West Tennesseans in Washington
￼ 
It was a pleasure to meet John Carbonell from Jackson. John works for the Society of Human resource Management (SHRM) and was visiting as part of a conference to advocate for needs of today's workforce.  
￼ 
I also enjoyed a visit from State Senator John Stevens and gave him a tour of the House floor.  Senator Stevens has been a strong voice for West Tennesseans in the Tennessee General Assembly, and I appreciate the many ways he works to serve our community. 
￼ 
My office is honored to give tours of the U.S. Capitol to West Tennesseans during their visit to Washington. I was glad my staff could show Matt and Courtney Montgomery around and tell them about the history of our nation's capital.

From my family to yours, have a safe and joyous Thanksgiving.

Wicker Supports Critical Missions of the Coast Guard
Senate Passes Bipartisan Bill to Reauthorize the Service
After years of negotiations, the Senate has passed a two-year reauthorization of the Coast Guard.  The bipartisan legislation is exhaustive, just as are the Coast Guard’s wide-ranging missions.  Not only does the bill support the tens of thousands of Americans in the service’s active-duty, reserve, civilian, and auxiliary forces, but it anticipates the Coast Guard’s long-term needs. 
The Coast Guard is responsible for carrying out 11 core missions for the American people.  One of those missions is search-and-rescue, which Mississippians saw firsthand after Hurricane Katrina.  That mission has been repeatedly fulfilled over the past two years as active hurricane seasons brought devastating storms to U.S. coastlines and put American lives at risk. 
Another mission is to stop illegal drugs from entering the United States, and the Coast Guard continues to tally major drug busts.  Last year, the service set a record for its counterdrug operations, intercepting more than 455,000 pounds of cocaine valued at $6 billion.  On an average day, the Coast Guard could seize upwards of 1,000 pounds of illegal narcotics.
New Ships, Needed Maintenance
To be effective in these missions, the men and women of the Coast Guard need technologically advanced equipment.  Mississippi’s shipbuilders have risen to this challenge, building all of the Legend-class national security cutters in the Coast Guard’s fleet.  The value of these ships is recognized in the Coast Guard bill, which approves the purchase of three more.
Another provision in the bill recognizes urgent maintenance needs, in particular for the Polar Star, our nation’s only heavy polar icebreaker.  At 42 years old, this vessel is 12 years past its intended service life.  However, the strategic importance of the Arctic and its potential as a shipping corridor continue to rise.  The United States faces serious geopolitical competition from countries like Russia that have aggressively built a large icebreaker fleet.
Uniform Standard for Commercial Vessels
The Coast Guard bill also addresses concerns from America’s commercial vessel operators, who have faced a patchwork of regulations regarding a vessel’s ballast water discharge.  The discharge of ballast water is important to a ship’s buoyancy, but it can also have an environmental impact.  The fear is that the discharge of ballast water could inadvertently introduce an invasive and potentially harmful species into a new environment.  To combat these concerns, regulations have been put into place over time by the Coast Guard, EPA, and 25 states.
The Coast Guard bill will simplify the situation with the adoption of a uniform, science-based national standard for ballast water discharge.  I have been a longtime proponent of streamlining the current regulations, even authoring a standalone bill to do so.  I am glad key provisions of my bill were included in the Coast Guard’s reauthorization and have earned the Senate’s support.  The approach combines the enforcement capability of the Coast Guard and the environmental expertise of the Environmental Protection Agency.  
The value the Coast Guard provides to the American people is evident in the scope of this reauthorization bill and the dedication by lawmakers to get it right.  The service’s diverse missions are critical to public safety and national security, as evidenced by the vote of 94 to 6 on the bill’s final passage in the Senate.

REPRESENTATIVE ADRIANO ESPAILLAT HOSTS EVENT HONORING TUSKEGEE AIRMEN

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) will host a post office renaming ceremony in honor of the Tuskegee Airmen on Monday, November 19th (today) from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at the United States Post Office (USPS) facility located at 99 Macombs Place in New York, which will be renamed as the “Tuskegee Airmen Post Office Building” following passage of Rep. Espaillat’s bill, H.R. 4406, which was signed into law earlier this year.

“The Tuskegee Airmen was a popular name given to the first all-black squadron activated into service by the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1941 during the peak of World War II. They were known for breaking racial barriers in the military and were active in fighting against Jim Crow laws in the South. Renaming this post office facility after the Tuskegee Airmen is a fitting tribute to honor their memory and contributions to this country, and I am honored to have passed legislation that was signed into law to help bring this event to fruition,” concluded Rep. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13).

This event is open to the public and press.

CONGRESISTA ADRIANO ESPAILLAT ENCABEZA EVENTO EN HONOR A AVIADORES DE TUSKEGEE

“Aviadores de Tuskegee fue un nombre popular dado al primer escuadrón integrado completamente por personas de la raza negra que entró en servicio en el Cuerpo Aéreo del Ejército de los Estados Unidos en 1941, durante el momento más álgido de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Eran conocidos por romper barreras raciales en el Ejército y participaron activamente en la lucha contra las leyes de Jim Crow en el Sur. Cambiar el nombre de esta oficina portal por el de los Aviadores de Tuskegee es un tributo apropiado para honrar su memoria y contribuciones a este país, y me siento honrado de haber logrado la aprobación de una legislación que fue promulgada como ley para ayudar a que este evento diera frutos"", concluyó el congresista Adriano Espaillat (NY-13).

￼
 
For the past two years, Republicans have introduced pro-growth policies that put the American people back in the driver's seat providing millions a chance at a better life. There are just a few more legislative weeks left in the 115th Congress and there is still so much to accomplish to ensure for Republican leadership to deliver its promises. Stay up-to-date with the most recent activity on what is happening on the Hill by following me on Twitter @RepGosar, Facebook and through Instagram.

Stopping the Caravan
As the first wave of illegal aliens reach our southern border and more to follow it’s imperative that the House pass legislation in the 115th Congress to secure our border and build the wall. A few weeks ago, I sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice urging it to look into who is organizing these caravans. As more waves of illegal aliens head toward our border it's critical that we get to the bottom of this.

Western Caucus Chairman
It is an honor to be unanimously re-elected as Chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus for the 116th Congress.  This caucus is the leading caucus on public land use and policy. As the federal government has overreached for decades at the expense of states and individuals this caucus acts as a check on these excesses to preserve liberty and economic opportunity. Over the past two years, we as a Caucus have accomplished so much. From introducing and passing a multitude of legislation to exponentially growing the membership of the Caucus, the caucus has been more successful then at any point in its history. I will lead the Western Caucus and continue its success working on the issues that impact the West and rural America

Booming Optimism
The good news keeps rolling! Thanks to pro-growth policies (all Democrats opposed the tax reforms) Americans continue to see results. The most recent jobs report found more workers are re-entering labor market, unemployment is at a record low and the number of employed Americans is at a record high! In addition, the National Federation of Independent Businesses said the optimism has only been this high three times in the last 43 years and has consistently been high all year long.

Another Win for Arizona
This week, the House passed my bill that will benefit local communities and families in Cornville by allowing for expansion of Windmill Park. The Cottonwood Land Exchange Act will require the U.S. Forest Service to exchange, at the request of Yavapai County, 80 acres of federal lands in the Coconino National Forest for 369 acres of lands owned by the county. The result is a usable additional 80 acres for Yavapai County versus the currently unusable 369 acres, giving Cornville a much larger and more functional park. This locally-driven solution is a win-win!

National Diabetes Awareness Month
Diabetes affects 30.3 million Americans and is extremely costly. in 2017, the total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes was $327 billion, including $237 billion in direct medical costs and $90 billion in reduced productivity.
Congress must continue to enable use of advanced technology, such as glucose monitors, and increase research to fight this disease. Learn more about National Diabetes Awareness Month here: http://www.diabetes.org/in-my-comm…/american-diabetes-month/
￼

This chart shows the estimated number and percentage of diagnosed and un-diagnosed diabetics among adults less then 18 years in the United States in 2015. 
""Championing American Businesses"" Bill
This week, my colleague Congressman Michael McCaul and I introduced the 'Championing American Businesses Through Diplomacy Act.' This bill prioritizes economic and commercial diplomacy at the Department of State and U.S. missions throughout the world, allowing U.S. businesses better access to markets abroad. 
Here are a few key points the bill seeks to address: 
·         Authorizes in statute the Assistant Secretary for Economic and Business Affairs, setting in statute their responsibilities to promote and support U.S. economic and commercial diplomacy;
·         Streamlines and combines two commercial diplomacy guides – the Investment Climate Statement and the Country Commercial Guide, respectfully produced by the Department of State and Department of Commerce –  into one annual guide for each country focused on critical information that businesses rely upon when assessing whether to do business in a particular country;
·         Requires Ambassadors and their Embassies to submit a report to the Department of State of the specific actions they took in the year prior of how they are aided businesses achieve market access, while assessing levels of private-sector commercial competition from other strategic competitor nation-states;
·         Requires the Secretary to report to Congress general commercial diplomacy trends, as well as assessments of commercial activity in strategic areas from competing nation-states that threatens U.S. national security; and
·         Places further emphasis on training our diplomats on matters of commercial diplomacy.

Walker Weekly Report
This week, the House returned back to Washington, ready to roll up our sleeves and get to work. Before the end of the year, we hope to pass critical legislation that will bring hope and opportunity to thousands of North Carolina families – like my co-sponsored FIRST STEP Act. 
The FIRST STEP Act was endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police and President Trump this week. It includes important sentencing reforms and educational policies to reduce recidivism and rebuild families. The legislation passed the House, and we are hopeful that the Senate will move the bill soon.
This week, we also took time to remember fallen Greensboro Police Officer Jared Franks on the House floor.
Keep reading for the full update. Have a blessed week.

HIGHLIGHTS

Honoring and Remembering Greensboro Police Officer Jared Franks on the Floor of the U.S. House
This week, we had the honor to remember the life of Greensboro Police Officer Jared William Franks on the floor of the U.S. House. 
Officer Franks dedicated his life to public service and creating a safer community for us all. He is the first Greensboro officer to die in the line of duty in 17 years, reminding us of the bravery and strength members of law enforcement show our communities every single day.
We will never forget your service and legacy, Officer Franks. Your family and the Greensboro Police Department have our prayers.

President Trump Endorses the FIRST STEP Act – My Co-Sponsored Legislation to Reform the Criminal Justice System and Bring Hope
We received great news on Wednesday as President Trump endorsed the FIRST STEP Act, my co-sponsored legislation to reform the criminal justice system and bring hope. 
America’s prison system routinely turns low level offenders into hardened, repeat offenders. The FIRST STEP Act takes important steps to reverse this trend by expanding education and job training opportunities for prisoners, offering them a much-needed hand up to once again become productive members of society. Justice is not the same as heavy-handedness.
The American story is a history of second chances, that’s why we must always ensure that after debts are paid, the path to redemption is paved.

Welcoming the New Members of Congress
This week, I enjoyed leading a bipartisan panel for all the incoming members of Congress on how to set up an office and hit the ground running. I am humbled by the support our office has received and we know we are blessed with the opportunity to continue serving next year in the 116th Congress.
Across the House, we are excited to get to work for American families, focusing on the issues that matter most: our economy, our security, lowering the cost of living, reducing drug and health care costs, and improving education for our next generation.

Congress Must Act on Puerto Rico
￼ 
Last month, I hosted Congresswoman Jenniffer González-Colón from Puerto Rico, for a discussion in Bristol Borough, to discuss the progress being made in Puerto Rico following hurricanes Irma and Maria. Puerto Rico experienced an accelerated exodus of residents and physicians. Many people in our community are rightly concerned about the situation in Puerto Rico. This week, I joined Congresswoman González-Colón to urge Congress to act. Learn about the legislation I've cosponsored to aid Puerto Rico’s post Hurricane Maria recovery and statehood efforts HERE. 
Inquiry into Croydon Post Office
￼ 
In the nearly three months that members of the community have waited, we have not received information on when, or even if, the Croydon post office will reopen. The interruption of service, and the limited resources deployed by USPS to mitigate this interruption, have caused challenges to many of Croydon’s residents. It is my hope that the United States Postal Service will immediately provide an update to the people of Croydon, on the status of repairs being made to the post office and when the post office will reopen, and full service will resume.

Happy Diwali

Diwali is the Hindu festival of lights, which is celebrated every autumn in the northern hemisphere (spring in southern hemisphere). One of the most popular festivals of Hinduism, Diwali symbolizes the spiritual victory of light over darkness, good over evil and knowledge over ignorance.

11/18/18 18:06,Working for Arkansas Families,"District Update | November 18, 2018
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email
￼
Dear Friends,

This week was a productive one as I spent time in Arkansas and Washington representing you. I continued to be a leader on trade issues, met with Arkansas families who visited our nation's capital, and had my bill to enhance and preserve Arkansas’s Flatside Wilderness pass the House, which is good news for Arkansans and visitors who enjoy the outdoors. Here are some of the highlights.

Enhancing and Preserving Arkansas's Flatside Wilderness
￼
I am pleased that my bill that allows Arkansans and visitors, young and old, to enjoy more of one of Arkansas’s most unspoiled landscapes - Flatside Wilderness - passed the House on Tuesday, which means it's one step closer to becoming law. This bill will add 640 acres of existing Forest Service land to the current Flatside Wilderness area.

As an avid outdoorsman, I'm excited that future generations will be able to explore and have access to more of this beautiful wilderness. I am particularly pleased to have the honor to name this addition for a tireless conservationist and advocate for Arkansas wilderness who is also a good friend, former Arkansas Congressman Ed Bethune. 

I gave a speech on the House floor in support of this legislation, which you can view here. I look forward to working with the Senate to get it across the finish line and onto the president’s desk for signature.

Promoting Trade Policies that Benefit Arkansans 
￼
This week I had the unique opportunity to engage on the topic of trade with a Cabinet Secretary, some of the smartest trade minds in the private sector, and one of Arkansas’s important trading partners. Trade is critically important to Arkansas’s economy, and I enjoyed engaging on this issue in an exceptional series of meetings and events.

On Thursday, I hosted a productive roundtable where my colleagues and I heard from trade policy experts from Goldman Sachs. We had a helpful conversation about tariffs, the impact of China, and current trade agreements with various countries. I discussed my alternative to the Trump administration's approach to across-the-board tariffs on steel and aluminum. 

These are issues that directly impact us in Arkansas, especially as it relates to our state's exports. I will continue to promote trade arrangements that benefit our state and help grow Arkansas's economy.

Spurring on Arkansas's Agricultural Industry
￼
Also on Thursday, I joined my Arkansas colleagues - Senator John Boozman, Senator Tom Cotton, Congressman Steve Womack, Congressman Rick Crawford, and Congressman Bruce Westerman - for a working-breakfast meeting with United States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. Agriculture is the largest industry in Arkansas and an integral part of our state's economy and heritage. I appreciate Secretary Perdue for hosting us to discuss how we can work together to help our Arkansas farm families prosper. 

Strengthening U.S.-Japan Relations
￼
On Tuesday, I participated in a panel discussion at the Japan-American Society of Washington, D.C. (JASWDC) about U.S.-Japan relations and trade negotiations with the organization’s interim president Dr. Abigail Friedman and Congressman Joaquin Castro (D-TX). 

I've been involved in trade matters with Japan since I served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Corporate Finance during the George H.W. Bush administration, where one of my key assignments was representing the United States as a negotiator in the historic bilateral talks with Japan known as the Structural Impediments Initiative (SII).

Earlier this year, I was selected to serve on the Japan-United States Friendship Commission, which is an independent federal government agency established by Congress in 1975 that promotes educational, cultural, and intellectual exchanges between our two countries. This has given me the opportunity to use my experience to promote policies that will strengthen our economic, security, and cultural relationship with Japan. 

Central Arkansans Visit Our Nation's Capital 
￼
On the top, we hosted Scott and Terri Ausbrooks (left) and Kimberly and Robert Stubbs (right) from central Arkansas. Both couples chose D.C. to celebrate their wedding anniversaries. It’s always good to see fellow Arkansans in Washington and show them around our U.S. Capitol.

On the bottom, Susan (right) and Sarah (left) Downey from Hot Springs Village were here in D.C. this week on a mother-daughter trip. If you or someone you know is visiting D.C., please reach out to my office or go to my website. We would happy to give you and your family a tour of the U.S. Capitol.  

Thank you for taking time to keep up with the work I'm doing on your behalf. If I can be of any assistance to you or your family, please reach out to my office at (501) 324-5941 or Hill.House.Gov. 

Sincerely,
￼

ISSUES AND LEGISLATION 
November 18, 2018 
National Rural Health Day:
On the third Thursday of November, Kansas celebrates National Rural Health Day. While our family farms and rural communities are wonderful places to call home, we know firsthand the unique set of difficulties when it comes to healthcare needs in the Heartland.
During my time in Congress, it has been a priority of mine to both educate my Congressional colleagues about rural healthcare and pass legislation that addresses these challenges. Last year, I introduced H.Res.627, a bipartisan resolution recognizing access to hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients in rural areas is essential to the survival and success of rural America.
In the 115th Congress, I had the opportunity to advance several of my bills, which expedited local dialysis clinic certification, funded Mental Health First Aid training, improved Medicare coordination, modernized electronic health records, and increased access to basic outpatient services and pulmonary therapies offered by physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and clinical nurse specialists.
Please join me in recognizing the vital role our rural healthcare systems play in our community this week as we recognize National Rural Health Day.
 
116th Congressional Leadership Elections:
This week, Republicans held their elections to vote on party leadership for the next session of Congress. In the House, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) was voted Minority Leader while Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) will serve as Minority Whip. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) was elected Chair of the Republican Conference. As a former Vice-Chair of the House Republican Conference, I know all three leaders will do their utmost to serve well and continue accomplishing the people’s priorities.
 
ICYMI: Look Ahead to Remainder of 115th Session of Congress:
As Congress heads into the final stretch of the 115th Congress, there are several priorities that need to be completed before the end of the year.
One of the most fundamental roles of Congress is funding the government. There has been progress made during the current budget cycle as Congress passed the majority of its appropriations bills for the upcoming fiscal year 2019. In the coming weeks Congress will continue to debate the final few spending bills to send to the President’s desk.
It is also common knowledge in Kansas that when farmers and ranchers do well, our communities also flourish. However, farm families face uncertainty when Congress does not do its part to reauthorize a timely Farm Bill and strengthen its essential risk management tools. This year’s Farm Bill, which is currently in conference between the House and Senate, must be completed and sent to the President soon to ensure that farmers and ranchers have the ability to plan for the long-term. As America’s economy continues to accelerate from our tax cuts and regulatory reform, this legislation will help our producers overcome challenging and uncontrollable dynamics like blizzards, droughts, and prairie fires—and in some particularly awful years, all three in succession. The tradition of a farmer passing her operation to her children when that time comes is a testament to the generations of successful aggies in Kansas and I promise to continue helping Kansas farmers help feed the world.
I am looking forward to getting down to business on these issues and more during the final months of the 115th session of Congress.

ABOUT BRADLEY | HOW CAN I HELP | CONTACT BRADLEY | WANT TO RECEIVE MY UPDATES?
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
Happy Thanksgiving! 
This week, as we gather with friends and family, I hope you will take the time to give thanks for the many blessings you have in your life. 
From my entire staff, family, and myself, we wish you a very happy Thanksgiving. I am extremely thankful for my family, my friends, our community, and the incredible opportunity I have to serve you in Washington. 
￼ 
I am thankful for the many pieces of landmark legislation we were able to pass this year, including fully funding our military for next year, providing funds for vital water infrastructure projects, and enacting meaningful change to the G.I. Bill and the Veteran’s Choice Program.
I am also thankful for all of the incredible news we’ve seen this year of our thriving economy and jobs market. 
There is still much work to be done, such as securing our borders through my 50 Votes for the Wall Act, keeping our economic boom going, and rebuilding our military to combat international threats. 
Most importantly, though, I am thankful for my incredibly wonderful family; every moment I get to spend with Rebecca, our children, and our grandchildren is a moment I feel truly blessed. 
Be sure to stop and take a few minutes to answer this simple question over the coming week: What are you thankful for this year? 
VA Clinic Update 
 ￼ 
I'm pleased to report that the new VA outpatient clinic in Mobile is on track for an opening in the first quarter of 2019.  
Crews broke ground on the new two-story 65,000 square foot clinic last August, and it is slated to open mid-March.
This new facility will help provide better care to our veterans in a state-of-the-art facility.  
Our veterans deserve the best care possible, and I am proud of all the work that has brought this clinic to fruition! 
Support Small Businesses 
￼ 
This Saturday is Small Business Saturday!  
After the great food, family time, and football of Thanksgiving, it’s great to get out of the house and start early on the Christmas shopping.
This year, beat the Black Friday crowds and get out to support the local Main Street businesses in your community. 
This year, we have seen some of the best economic news in a decade. Our unemployment rate in Alabama is the lowest ever, more jobs are available than a decade ago, small business satisfaction is at an all-time high, and Alabama has been named one of the best states for business environment in the United States.
Let’s keep up this success by supporting Main Street on Saturday! 
Pentagon Audit 
You may have heard that the Pentagon recently officially completed their first-ever audit. This is a major development that I will be closely studying into next year. 
Much of the credit for seeing the project through to the finish should go to Secretary of Defense James Mattis. We knew the audit would show some issues, but that is actually a good thing because now we can fix them.
It's time to act on the findings and ensure money is actually making it to our nation's warfighters and not getting stuck in government bureaucracy. 
In Case You Missed It! 
Here are a few articles from this past week that are worth a read:  
“Bradley Byrne: Words cannot express our gratitude.” - Alabama Today 
“Connect to Congress: Representative Bradley Byrne 11/14/18.” - WPMI 
“Here’s what the Pentagon’s first-ever audit found.” – Defense News

Photo of the Week 
￼ 
On Friday, I had the opportunity to provide an update for folks in Southwest Alabama on the important items we have coming up on the agenda this year and what to expect in the next. Highlights: I am dedicated to rebuilding our military, strengthening our economy, and securing our nation’s borders. 
What's Ahead 
This week is Thanksgiving, and I am very much looking forward to spending time with my family and loved ones. 
I will be reflecting this upcoming week on all of my town halls, business visits, and meetings with folks from Southwest Alabama to help set my legislative agenda in the 116th Congress. 
One of the top priorities of mine as we wind down this year will be to pass my 50 Votes for the Wall Act. We must take the issue of illegal immigration seriously and treat it for what it is: a national security crisis.  
I hope my colleagues in the House will make the right choice for the American people and support me in my efforts to build the wall and uphold the laws of our country. 
As always, if you need help with a federal agency or have questions about anything under debate in Washington, please contact my office. You can call my Mobile office at 251-690-2811 or you can click here to send me an email directly. I also invite you to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to get up-to-the-minute updates from Washington. At the end of the day, my staff and I are here to serve you!

From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:
Good Afternoon,
This week in Congress, I met with Wyalusing Elementary 6th graders on the steps of the Capitol.   
￼
Learning Outside of the Classroom
Each year, Wyalusing students travel to D.C. for a 3-day trip to tour the Capitol and visit the monuments on the National Mall. I spoke with the students about my day-to-day work as a Congressman, the history of the Capitol, and the legislative process. It is reassuring to see so many young people interested in the role that government plays in their lives. I am thankful for the Wyalusing staff for giving these students the special opportunity to learn about our nation’s capital firsthand. I hope you enjoyed your time in D.C.!
Visiting Lycoming Valley Intermediate School
Back in Williamsport, I enjoyed visiting with 6th graders at Lycoming Valley Intermediate School.
￼
It is important that we instill in our students the importance of civic engagement and the impact that we have in shaping the future of this country. I was very impressed with the questions that these students asked and their advanced knowledge of the Legislative Branch. I am sure that these students will continue to remain informed about issues that are important to them. Thank you for having me!
Williamsport Business District Expanded
I am pleased to hear that the Williamsport Planning Commission approved a development request to expand the Central Business District. It is exciting to see that our soaring economy is bringing new opportunities for small business owners and attracting investors who want to improve Williamsport’s downtown experience. This good news is just another example of how the bold conservative policy initiatives I have worked to pass are benefiting Pennsylvanians at home. 
$2.2M Camp Hill Bridge Construction Sees Completion
Officials from Lycoming County and other areas gathered at the newly revamped Pleasant Stream Road Bridge to celebrate its completion and recognize the positive impact that this improvement will have on the community. This infrastructure project will undoubtedly improve response times for emergency management services and alleviate everyday traffic in the area. I am confident that the positive effects of this construction project will spur additional plans for growth and development in our towns and cities.
Plan a Visit to Our Nation’s Capital
As we move into the Holiday season, it is a beautiful time of year to take a trip to Washington, D.C.
￼
Every week, I have the pleasure of having families from PA-10 visit and receive a personalized tour by one of my dedicated staff members. Any constituents planning to visit D.C. should contact my office here to arrange a tour for you and your family. We look forward to having you!

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend, 

We had a busy week in Washington continuing our work to ensure those affected by Hurricane Michael get the relief they need. My legislation to strengthen our coastal communities passed the House and I announced that I will be introducing a bill to provide tax relief to those devastated by Hurricane Michael. Please read about my week below: 

Strengthening Our Coastal Communities
￼ 
[Click the photo to watch my floor remarks]

Great news - my legislation addressing issues with the Coastal Barrier Resources maps passed the House this week. The Strengthening Coastal Communities Act of 2018 makes technical corrections to the Coastal Barrier Resources maps that adversely affect areas in the Panhandle. The Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) was signed into law in 1982 and works to preserve our nation’s barrier islands by barring federal funds and financial assistance from being used there, which therefore disincentivizes development. Dr. Dunn’s legislation maintains these protections for our nation’s barrier islands, while simply providing for more precise digital maps to distinguish the CBRA zones.

Hurricane Michael Tax Relief
Next week, I will be introducing legislation to ease the financial burden on those who were devastated by Hurricane Michael. The Hurricane Michael Tax Relief Act allows individuals affected by the Category-4.9 storm penalty-free early access to their retirement savings and helps employers and businesses within the disaster area. Hurricane Michael struck the Panhandle with a vengeance last month, leaving a level of destruction most have never seen in their lifetime. As we work to pick up the pieces and rebuild our communities, many are struggling with the financial burden left by the storm. Victims of the storm should not be unfairly penalized for using their retirement savings during this unprecedented disaster. This important legislation allows folks access to money they have saved over the years without facing penalties, while temporarily suspending limitations on charitable contributions to our area that are associated with hurricane relief.

Innovation in Medical Research ￼  On Wednesday, I hosted a round table with Congressman Roger Marshall to hear from experts about ways we can improve medical research and drive innovation. We discussed the importance of nuclear medical isotopes and the role they play in cancer treatments. As doctors we are acutely aware of how critical it is for cancer patients to receive these radiation treatments in a timely manner. Slowing the start of these treatments can lessen the effectiveness, and ultimately be detrimental to the patient. It is my hope that by continuing conversations, much like this one, we will be able to fix this problem and get our patients access to the treatments they need. Click here to learn more.   Thank you for your continued energy and enthusiasm, as reflected in your letters and Facebook posts.

Dear Friend,  
In recent months we have witnessed catastrophes that have struck our nation coast-to-coast, from the devastating wildfires across California, flooding in the Carolinas, and the incredible damage to agriculture in Georgia from Hurricane Michael. 
This past Friday, I petitioned my colleagues in Congress and the White House to help the Americans that have been devastated by natural disasters this year, including those who were impacted by the devastation to Georgia’s ag industry. 
￼ 
Speaking on the House Floor urging my colleagues and the White House to prioritize disaster relief. 
For the past few years, farmers have faced low commodity prices, unfair trade practices from foreign countries, labor shortages, and low crop yields which have created a strain on their businesses and hurt the surrounding rural economies. Hurricane Michael made all of those obstacles pale in comparison.
Following the storm - the likes of which Georgia has not seen in over a century - President Trump and Vice President Pence visited Middle and South Georgia to hear firsthand from farmers about how they went from having the best crop to no crop in a matter of hours.
While Georgia farmers are known for their resilience, they can’t get back on their feet on their own. This disaster is heartbreaking and without additional federal assistance, it will break the back of Georgia’s ag industry, the largest and oldest economic driver in the state of Georgia. 
This is not a partisan issue. This is an American issue. I will continue to call on Congress to set aside political differences and act now to help our farmers and others across our great nation that are struggling in the aftermath of these disasters.
If you or someone you know has been impacted by Hurricane Michael and is struggling with the first steps to seeking federal assistance, I would urge you to contact either our Tifton office at (229) 396-5175 or your local Farm Service Agency (FSA) office to see what assistance is available in your area. This will be a long process, and we are here to help.
  
MEETING WITH LOWNDES BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 
Thank you to members of the Lowndes County Board of Commissioners for meeting with me this past week. We had a good discussion on rural broadband, agriculture, and health care, as well as issues pertinent to Moody Air Force Base.  
I look forward to continuing to work with our South Georgia leaders to continue to bring infrastructure investment and economic growth to the region.

Congressman McHenry Weekly Update 


Wednesday's Hearing with Fed Vice Chairman Quarles 



As Congress returned to session for the first time since the election, I was back at work at the House Financial Services Committee. At our hearing On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to question the Federal Reserve's Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles on the recent changes to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress tests. In addition, I questioned Fed Vice Chairman Quarles on the need for new technology to help address the challenges banks are facing today. Click here or on the image below to watch my questioning of Vice Chair Quarles.

Joining Bloomberg to Discuss Wednesday's Hearing and More



Later that morning, I joined Bloomberg to discuss Wednesday's hearing with Fed Vice Chairman Quarles. During the interview I also discussed my candidacy to serve as the Ranking Republican on the House Financial Services Committee in the 116th Congress, which I announced last week. You can read my full statement outlining why I believe I am the best candidate to lead Republicans on the Financial Services Committee in the Congress ahead by clicking here. Video of Wednesday's interview can be accessed by clicking here or on the image below.

National Entrepreneurs' Day



On Tuesday, November 20th, join me in celebrating all of the entrepreneurs that make the Tenth District such a wonderful place to call home. From our innovative textile manufacturers to our delicious microbreweries thousands of jobs have been created by local entrepreneurs. Additionally, they have had a remarkable economic impact on communities all across western North Carolina. I am thankful for all of our local entrepreneurs’ hard work and for everything they do for the Tenth District.

What I Have Been Reading



Firefighters need at least 2 more weeks to contain Camp Fire, but rain forecast may offer relief

USA Today 

I am deeply saddened by the devastation and loss of life caused by the fires in California. Please join me in praying for the families of those killed by the wildfires and for all of those still searching for loved ones who remain missing. Today and every day I am thankful for this nation's firefighters and other first responders who have been working day and night to save lives and put out these fires.


This year's White House Christmas tree was almost abandoned, its grower admits

Charlotte Observer 

The White House has already begun preparing for the holiday season by picking this year's official White House Christmas tree, which will be the centerpiece of the White House's Blue Room holiday decoration. This year it comes from a farm right here in Avery County, North Carolina, which I used to represent. North Carolina has had more trees stand in the Blue Room than any other state. Click here to learn more about Christmas at the White House.


Here's the list of House Republican leaders for the next Congress

Roll Call 

Congratulations to our Leader, Kevin McCarthy, and our Whip, Steve Scalise, on their elections to serve as the leaders for House Republicans in the 116th Congress. They will be joined by Congresswoman Liz Cheney, Congressman Tom Emmer, and Congressman Mark Walker of North Carolina. I am confident we have a strong leadership team for the two years ahead.

Happy Thanksgiving!
 
 
From my family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving! We have a long list of things to be thankful for this year. I hope you enjoy time with family and friends this week and remember all there is to be thankful for.

Preparing for the Future
 
 
Part of living in South Carolina is preparing for natural disasters and I am working to ensure we are improving future disaster mitigation and response efforts. Hurricane Florence highlighted the need for I-73 as an adequate evacuation route for the Grand Strand. After the storm, rising flood waters threatened to close the only road access into the Grand Strand, putting 250,000 of my constituents at risk of being completely isolated with no lifeline to food, water, or medical supplies.   I spoke to WBTW about how I-73 will help mitigate the life-threatening impacts of future disasters and provide the lifeline we needed during Hurricane Florence. Watch the full interview below!   Watch the Interview »

National Apprenticeship Week 
 
 
Across the country, employers in virtually all industries are looking for employees and South Carolina is no exception. I frequently talk to Seventh District businesses who need workers to fill high-skilled positions.There are currently over 7 million open jobs in the United States and National Apprenticeship Week serves as an important reminder that we need to invest in a workforce that is prepared to take on these opportunities.   This week, Myrtle Beach students learned about how to attain the skills necessary to advance their careers in aviation mechanics, a high-demand job in a growing industry. This is just one example of how we can prepare a high-skilled workforce to meet the needs of employers in our region. Bridging the skills gap so that we can get people off the sidelines of the economy and into a career that is right for them will continue to be one of my priorities in Congress.

Shop Small 
 
 
After Thanksgiving, many of us begin holiday shopping on Black Friday. If you plan to shop after Thanksgiving, I encourage you to shop small and support local business owners on Small Business Saturday. It's this coming Saturday, November 24th. Shopping small is especially important this year as many of our local businesses are recovering from Hurricane Florence. Support our small business community this Thanksgiving! 
 

 
FEMA Updates
 
 
As our community continues to recover from Hurricane Florence, I will keep you updated with information from FEMA that may be helpful to you and your family during this process. 

Disaster Recovery Center Closures: As traffic at Disaster Recovery Centers slows down, some of the centers are closing. There are still DRCs open across the Seventh District where you can receive help filling out your disaster assistance application until December 5th. Find the closest center to you here.

Deadline Update: The FEMA deadline to apply for disaster assistance for damage and losses from Hurricane Florence has been extended to Wednesday, December 5th. 
 
Have a great week,
￼

Tom Rice

Good News
Over the past few months, I've seen countless examples of folks in our community going above and beyond to help each other in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence. Diane and Steve Rumley from Longs were devastated when they found that the 2,000 packages they had prepared to send to military families across the region were destroyed by the storm. They have put together packages for military families for the past 9 years and were worried they would not be able to complete this year's shipment. When community partners heard about the ruined packages, they re-donated items and the Rumley's will be able to send all 2,000 packages for military families to enjoy this holiday season!  I am inspired by the Rumley's dedication to brightening up the holidays for military families and am thankful to everyone who donated!

Meet Richard | How Can I Help You? | Issues | Media Center | Contact Me





Friends,
 
Thanksgiving is a time for gratitude and traditions. We all have our own meaningful and unique ways to celebrate this special holiday.
 
In my family, it’s a tradition to go around the table and share one thing we’re thankful for. This part is always pretty tough for me. I can’t pick just one. Not to mention I’ve inherited the “Watson Curse” from my Granddaddy, which means I can’t get through saying the blessing at a family gathering without getting choked up. I normally break the rules and list off several things: I’m grateful for my wife Renee, for our son Lane and our family, for the way God has richly blessed my life, and for the tremendous honor to serve as your representative.
 
Another great thing about Thanksgiving is the food. The turkey may be talked about the most, but let’s not forget about the sides. What would we do without a big bowl of gravy? And it wouldn’t be a Thanksgiving feast without green bean casseroles, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, corn and sweet potato casseroles. 
 
It’s a little like my work in Congress: while the big national priorities are vital – like tax reform and border security – our district’s priorities are just as important to me. 
 
For example, Hurricane Florence had a huge impact on our state. That’s why I traveled to every county in our district after the storm to meet with folks in shelters, survey storm damage, and discuss rebuilding needs. National attention may have moved on, but I’m still focused on our recovery needs.
 
Last week, I met with Governor Cooper and my colleagues in the North Carolina delegation to discuss ongoing Florence recovery efforts. I’ve made it a priority to make sure we are accurately assessing the damage and that recovery money is going to people who need the help and it isn’t being wasted by the bureaucracy. We have already secured critical funds, and we will continue to work together in a bipartisan manner to assist with the long-term efforts.
 
In addition, I continue to work to find a solution to GenX in our state. I’m glad the EPA finally released draft toxicity assessments for GenX and other PFAS chemicals last week. While these numbers are not finalized, they are lower than the state’s original goal and suggest that chronic exposure could be harmful. It is critical we fully understand the health effects of GenX so we can work with local, state and federal leaders to address this issue.
 
The EPA used the best available science and information from our community engagement event in Fayetteville to determine these draft toxicity assessments. They are seeking public input and continuing to work to develop a PFAS Management Plan. This plan will be used to reduce contamination and develop a coordinated response. I will continue to be a strong voice pushing EPA’s completion of the PFAS Management Plan, and I encourage swift action to help the state better understand what we need to do going forward to keep our water clean and keep our citizens safe.
 
Finally, as Fort Bragg’s Congressman, I want to give a special thanks to those who have sacrificed and those who continue to serve so that our country can remain prosperous and free – especially this holiday season. Many of you are unable to be home for the holidays, and you deserve our love, prayers and support. We would not be able to celebrate Thanksgiving and the many blessings we hold dear without the sacrifice of our heroes in uniform. 
 
Please join me in keeping in your hearts our men and women in uniform, our veterans and their families. 
 
 
Until next week,
￼
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)

￼
Babin Introduces Resolution Calling for End to Birthright Citizenship
WASHINGTON – U.S. Rep. Brian Babin (TX-36), Co-Chairman of the House Border Security Caucus for the 116th Congress, issued the following statement after introducing a resolution calling on the President to resume the interpretation of section 1 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution as originally intended and applied as law for a century.

“For a century after its enactment, Section 1 of the 14th Amendment was properly applied as written and intended to ensure all American citizens were afforded the sacred constitutional protections they deserve. While these important protections remain, in recent decades the misapplication of specific language in the amendment has led to implementation of the practice of birthright citizenship by which children born to foreign nationals – even those here illegally – are automatically granted United States citizenship. Birthright citizenship has long served as a powerful incentive for illegal immigration, and over time has become wrongly accepted as law or protected by our constitution. However, as birthright citizenship is justified due to a faulty legal application and has never been protected by the Supreme Court, ending the practice should not require a constitutional amendment.

“President Trump has boldly committed to examine this issue closely, and I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to support my resolution recognizing the imprudence of birthright citizenship and seeking an end to this misguided policy that has fueled illegal immigration and weakened our national sovereignty.”

The resolution, H. Res. 1143, has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee.

 Mueller Investigation Accountability
Over one year and millions of dollars later, special counsel Robert Mueller still has not testified before Congress to shed light on his clandestine activities and expenses. This investigation has gone on far too long without being held accountable to the American taxpayer. Our people deserve answers, and this investigation and its eventual findings will lack any legitimacy as long as it continues to operate in the shadows.

Dear Friend:

I appreciate you taking the time to read this brief update. It remains an honor for me to serve as your United States Representative in Washington, D.C.

As I noted in last week’s message, this past week I was back in Washington D.C. for the first week of the 115th Congress’s “lame duck” session. The new members of Congress will be sworn in for the 116th Congress on January 3rd. I remain optimistic that before we conclude for the year that we will reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, vote on a final version of the Farm Reauthorization bill, pass a Tax Extenders bill, and most importantly, finish up the annual appropriations process.

The Farm Bill is up for reauthorization and the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, is a big part of the Farm Bill. The dollars associated with the five-year reauthorization of the Farm Bill are 20% for agricultural support and 80% for SNAP. The primary disagreement between the House and Senate versions of the bill is a House-passed requirement that able-bodied adults, who are not responsible for taking care of young children, must actively seek and obtain work, volunteer for at least 20 hours a week if they can’t find work, or enroll in a job training program to remain eligible for assistance under the program. I believe that all public assistance programs, where an able-bodied adult is the recipient, should include a requirement to do something affirmative to demonstrate that they are making an effort to become self-sufficient.

In addition, to working on legislation, we had two important hearings in the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. The first was to receive an update from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on its progress in implementing a new Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. This system is to track the care provided to all eligible veterans under VA care. A key requirement of this system is the ability to interface with the Department of Defense’s new EHR system so that when a service member transitions off active duty their medical records can seamlessly transfer to the VA. The development of this system has been plagued with problems and massive cost overruns, but now seems to be doing better under new leadership.

￼

The second hearing was over serious problems in making timely and accurate payments for the tuition and living expenses to veterans using the G.I. Bill. These veterans were promised both tuition and a living stipend so that, while enrolled in school, they can focus on completing their education rather than how to pay for their tuition, rent and groceries. The amount of the stipend is based on the zip code where the veteran is attending school, but the VA’s IT system for processing the claims is not working and veterans are too often receiving late or incorrect payments. The VA has notified the schools that they will receive the payments for tuition, albeit late, but the late payments to the veterans to cover their living expenses have created a hardship for far too many. It is one thing for a university to receive a late payment for tuition, but it is another for a veteran not to be paid on time, thereby limiting their ability to cover their living expenses.

￼

During the hearing, the VA complained that the task of developing the new tuition and living stipend system that was passed in legislation last year and signed by President Trump, has been very difficult to implement because of its complexity. Yet the VA was given an opportunity to respond to the requirements of the legislation before it passed the House Veterans Affairs Committee, and to ask for more time before the program would be implemented to develop the IT system to support it, and the VA did not do so.

Finally, I invite you to stay in contact with me via my website, facebook or twitter account. See you around the district!

Friends,
A study done this past summer by the Ohio Department of Health found that more than half a million years of human life has been lost in the Buckeye State over a seven-year period due to the opioid epidemic. Too many lives have been cut short because of the opioid crisis. In Lake County alone, more than 13,318 years of life have been lost. 
As many of us know all too well, the opioid crisis is right in our backyards. It's hard to find someone who hasn't been touched by this epidemic - whether it's a loved one struggling with addiction or a friend who has lost the battle, most of us know someone who has been impacted by this epidemic. As a representative from one of the hardest hit states, I have felt the need to be a strong advocate in Congress to ensure we treat this epidemic like the national emergency it is, so we get needed funding directly to our hardest-hit communities now. I have sponsored legislation to expand treatment and have written letters and called upon leadership in the House and in the White House to declare this epidemic as a national emergency. If we really want to turn the tide on this crisis, our response must counter the magnitude of the problem. 
Congress has made progress in advancing necessary legislation to stop dangerous drugs from reaching our communities and to improve access to treatment and recovery efforts. On the Appropriations Committee, my colleagues and I have directed funding toward grants that go directly to first responders and our community organizations that are fighting this crisis on the ground every day. But there is more work to be done. 
We need more access to beds in hospitals and treatment centers. 
We need more full-time trained recovery staff. 
We need our doctors, nurses and medical professionals to talk to patients about the risks associated with prescription opioids and how to avoid the cycle of addiction before it begins. 
Over the last few months, the House has passed over 70 bills directly authorizing funding and resources for educational prevention programs, treatment and recovery centers, safe drug disposal regulations and resources for law enforcement and first responders to safely respond to overdoses. 
This is the largest federal response to a U.S. drug crisis in the history of our country. 
Most recently, the President signed the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act into law. This is a bipartisan effort to combat the opioid crisis by advancing treatment and recovery initiatives, improving prevention, protecting our communities and bolstering our efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl.
￼
Treatment and Recovery
	•	Improves and expands access to treatment and recovery services
	•	Provides incentives for enhanced care, coordination and innovation
	•	Establishes comprehensive opioid recovery centers
Prevention
	•	Addresses high prescribing rates while allowing those who need medication to maintain access
	•	Encourages non-addictive opioid alternatives to treat pain
	•	Improves data to identify and help at-risk patients and families 
Protecting Communities
	•	Gives law enforcement tools to get dangerous drugs out of communities
	•	Better intercepts illicit opioids at international mail facilities
	•	Improves access to federal resources for local communities
Fighting Fentanyl
	•	Cracks down on foreign shipment of illicit drugs
	•	Provides grants for local communities to combat fentanyl
	•	Resources to tackle ever-changing synthetic drugs 
Getting Help: 
If you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse, there is an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that offers free, confidential, 24/7, 365-day-a-year treatment referral and information services. You can call 1-800-662-HELP (4357) or visit their website at https://www.samhsa.gov/. 
If you are interested in learning more about the opioid epidemic, several federal agencies offer valuable information. You can visit: 
	•	https://www.usa.gov/mental-health-substance-abuse 
	•	https://www.hrsa.gov/opioids
	•	https://medlineplus.gov/ opioidabuseandaddictiontreatment.html
	•	https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids.
The people who suffer from this crisis the most are our family members, our friends and our neighbors. They are real people, with real stories. The opioid epidemic knows no boundaries, as it destroys the lives of Americans across the country, regardless of gender, race, socioeconomic status or age. I will continue to fight and advocate for funding that will directly impact and improve the lives in our communities in Northeast Ohio. 

Dave

The Bost Bulletin 
Friend: 
We were back at it this week in Washington. Right now, I am laser-focused on working to get the Farm Bill signed into law ASAP. We also sent a supportive message from Southern Illinoisans to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, recognized the importance of apprenticeships in our economy, and celebrated the birthday of the U.S. Marine Corps.  

Farm Bill Progress 
￼ 
My top policy focus right now is providing our agriculture producers with a sense of certainty. That means getting the Farm Bill signed into law. As a member of the House Committee on Agriculture, I had a seat at the table this week for discussions about a path forward for the Farm Bill. I’m optimistic that we’ll get this done in a timely manner and will continue to push for it. Southern Illinois farmers deserve nothing less. 

Support for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh 
￼ 
Last week, I delivered a 'prayer quilt' to Supreme Court of the United States Justice Brett Kavanaugh on behalf the Whittington Church congregation in Whittington, IL. The quilt was created to show spiritual support during Justice Kavanaugh's emotionally trying confirmation process.

Recognizing Apprenticeships 
￼ 
This week we celebrated National Apprenticeship week. Apprenticeships help prepare America's workforce to meet the needs of employers. Earlier this Congress, I introduced the Veterans Agricultural Apprenticeship Act with Rep. Al Lawson from Florida. Our bipartisan bill provides a common-sense solution to help our farmers and ranchers fill jobs and expand their operations while offering our veterans new skills and a potential career path after their service through apprenticeships. It's a true win-win.

Happy Birthday, Marines! 
￼ 
I was honored to stand alongside my fellow Marines at a ceremony celebrating the U.S. Marine Corps 243rd Birthday. I will always cherish the opportunity to sing the Marines' Hymn shoulder-to-shoulder. 

That’s a quick update on what I’ve been up to. I hope you have a great week ahead!

Honoring our Veterans
On Monday, our country reflected on the bravery and sacrifice of America’s veterans. Our region is proudly home to more than 55,000 veterans and it is a true honor to serve each one of them in Congress. 
Whether part of the Marine Corps, Navy, Army, Air Force, or Coast Guard, our men and women in uniform have served and sacrificed greatly to secure the freedom we enjoy here at home. We owe our veterans an endless debt of gratitude. When our veterans come home from serving our nation, it is our responsibility to ensure they receive quality healthcare, provide them the tools to start their own business, and find educational opportunities for them following their service. They stood for us and now we must stand for them.
To all our veterans as well as active duty, thank you for everything you have sacrificed for our freedom. You truly represent the best of our nation.  
￼
Advocating for our Veterans in Congress
Throughout my time in Congress, I have a focused on advocating legislation to ensure our veterans are taken care of and provided for after their service.
Last year, I introduced the Chuck Osier Burial Benefits Act of 2017. Named in honor of a veteran from the 22nd District, this bill would expand the benefit options for veterans who are cremated and laid to rest in a non-traditional resting place by requiring the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to offer either a commemorative urn or a plaque. The Chuck Osier Burial Benefits Act would signify an individual’s status as a veteran to ensure that the remains of all veterans are appropriately honored, regardless of the end-of-life decisions they make. I am grateful to the Osier family, especially Donna Osier, for their inspiration and dedication in working to introduce this bill. 
￼
With thousands of veterans transitioning out of the military annually, this bill will ease their transition to the private sector by empowering veterans to use their unique skills and expertise to open a new small business. When our veterans come home from selflessly serving our nation, they should be afforded every opportunity to use these skills to positively contribute to our local communities. 
 
The Veteran Entrepreneurs Act will reduce both the financial and regulatory burden involved in starting a franchise. Cutting red tape and creating a tax credit to cover 25 percent of initial franchisee fees will go a long way in helping veterans open their own small businesses and succeed in the economy after their service to our nation. This bill will encourage entrepreneurship among our veterans while creating jobs and growth in our local communities.
 
￼ 
  
Last July, the House passed my bill H.R. 1690, the Department of Veterans Affairs Bonus Transparency Act passed the House unanimously.  
Aimed at increasing oversight and maximizing transparency, this legislation would require that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) submit a report to Congress at the end of each fiscal year listing bonuses awarded to senior-level staff.  This measure adds a simple reporting requirement that will streamline oversight of bonuses at the VA by requiring the agency to proactively provide information to Congress that details the amount of each bonus awarded to senior executives as well as the job titles of the individuals and the location of their employment. 
I have no doubt that the men and women of the VA serve our veterans admirably each day. In fact, I know that many of them do. In my own district, I have spoken with veterans who are grateful for the compassionate care they receive from the VA Hospital in Syracuse as well as local VA clinics in Binghamton and Rome. However, given the patterns of mismanagement at the VA, it is imperative that Americans know how bonuses are being awarded at the agency. Moreover, Congress deserves to receive this information in timely manner without having to request it each year.
￼ 
Assistance With Grants and Letters of Support 
Whether you’re a member of a fire department in need of new equipment or a community organization looking to grow, our office can assist you in navigating the federal grant process. By working with the Congressional Research Service, we can help find grants that may be appropriate for your needs. In many cases, we may even be able to furnish you with a letter of support.

In the District & D.C.
￼ 
On Wednesday, I spoke on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to honor Merle Nell, a firefighter from Vernon, New York. Merle passed away in November, 2016 while on the scene of a fire in Vernon Center. His name is now etched on a wall with 2,551 other fallen firefighters from our great state who lost their lives in the line of duty. Watch my speech honoring Merle here. 
￼  
During my time in Congress, I have been a strong advocate for our local dairy farmers. I recently attended Farm Bureau meetings in Oneida and Oswego County to speak with farmers and learn directly from them how I can continue to bring their voice to Washington.

Friends,  After a productive couple of weeks back home in West Virginia, the Senate was back to business this week in Washington. We welcomed a new group of senators, passed legislation to strengthen and support the U.S. Coast Guard, and more. As we head into the final stretch of this Congress, I look forward to continuing to put West Virginians first and advocate for issues that matter most to you.  Click here or the image below for more details, and keep scrolling for additional updates, as well as photo highlights from the past several weeks. 
￼ 
Highlights from Back Home  It was great to be back in West Virginia over the past several weeks where I traveled to 27 communities in 15 counties, meeting with constituents, small business owners, teachers, students, and others. Talking with West Virginians like you allows me to learn more about what’s working and what’s not working, and taking your feedback back to Washington helps us to continue developing solutions that benefit West Virginians.  Visit the photos page on my website to check out more photos from the past several weeks and keep scrolling to see a few highlights:

Supporting Our U.S. Coast Guard  The men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard work incredibly hard and on so many different fronts to keep Americans safe and help ensure our nation is secure. Earlier this week, I was proud to join my colleagues in voting to pass legislation that supports and strengthens the work of the U.S. Coast Guard. I’ve had the opportunity to spend quite a bit of time with Coast Guard leadership and to learn more about their mission and capabilities firsthand—from search and rescue following natural disasters and assistance in securing our borders to the critical role they play in drug interdiction.  West Virginia is actually home to several Coast Guard facilities in the Eastern Panhandle. These facilities, and the men and women who work there, are critical to the Coast Guard mission, and this bill will help support their good work. As a member of the Commerce Committee, I’m proud to have played a role in getting it to the Senate floor, and I will continue working as chair of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee to make sure the Coast Guard receives the funding and resources it needs. Click here to learn more about this legislation and how West Virginia stands to benefit.  How Can We Help?  Whether you need help with a casework issue or have a question about scheduling a meeting at one of my offices, my staff and I are ready to assist you.

Honoring the Victims of the Tree of Life Synagogue Shooting
I took to the Senate floor this week to honor the victims of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting, and call for common sense reforms to our nation's gun laws.  
On October 27th, Pittsburgh, the Jewish community, and our entire country were shaken by a horrific, anti-Semitic attack that occurred during Shabbat morning services at Tree of Life. Eleven innocent people were senselessly slaughtered in the attack. Six others were wounded, including four police officers who responded to the attack.
In the wake of tragedies such as what occurred at Tree of Life, I have renewed my call to enact commonsense solutions to address some element of the gun violence that plagues this country.
When it comes to gun safety, too often Republicans and Democrats talk past each other rather than speaking with each other.
I hope we can put aside some of our political differences and do something sensible. It is our duty, and it would be a fitting act of remembrance for victims of mass shootings at the Tree of Life, Thousand Oaks, Sandy Hook, and all the others whose deaths from gun violence have scarred our country.

China's Gross Violation of Human Rights 
The Chinese government has very little regard for the human rights of its people. One of the most egregious examples has been the systemic persecution and detainment of Turkic Muslims, known as Uyghurs, who are being targeted because of their culture and religion.
Worse yet, China is using advanced technology, including technology developed in and exported by the United States, to create an all-encompassing surveillance state that has resulted in the imprisonment and disappearance of up to one million ethnic Uyghurs.
In an effort to hold China accountable for its human rights violations against the Uyghurs, I have introduced a bipartisan measure with Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) that works to determine how the United States can best respond to this detestable abuse, whether it be through policy or diplomatic means.

Combatting Opioid and Substance Abuse in Western PA 
I am pleased to announce that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded a nearly $2.75 million grant to Beaver County.
The scourge of opioid abuse and drug addiction has spared no corner of Pennsylvania. This is especially true for Beaver County where overdose deaths have become far too common. I am pleased that HHS is supporting Beaver County in its efforts to help at-risk youth and their families.
The grant will help Beaver County implement its Pathway to Wellness program, which is dedicated to taking on drug abuse by focusing on early intervention, engagement, treatment and recovery supports for adolescents, transitional aged youth, and their families. The grant will be paid out over five years.
If you or someone you know needs assistance with a federal grant, contact to my office to see if we can provide assistance.

Thanking Pennsylvania's Vietnam Veterans
Upon returning home from war, Vietnam veterans did not receive the recognition they deserved.
I have worked to honor these soldiers for their service, sacrifice, and valor. For instance, my bill to officially designate March 29th as Vietnam Veterans Day was signed into law last year by the President. Recently, my staff and I honored a number of Vietnam veterans in Wayne, Pike, Cumberland and McKean Counties, and presented them with commemorative service pins.
Read more about my recent visit to Wayne County here.
Assisting veterans is one of the many services my office provides. If you or someone you know is a veteran in need of help with a federal agency, or has not received an honor that was justly earned, reach out to my office to see if we can help.

Holding Strong
 
 
While I was disappointed with the outcome of the House election, I was pleased to see Republicans gain a larger majority in the Senate.  Regardless of election outcomes, I will continue to fight for conservative victories and common sense policies that are good for all Americans. 

Liberal Democrats are undoubtedly going to put forth showboat bills to reverse the tax cuts that have benefited millions of Americans, push for the socialized Medicare for All plan, and attack the President every chance they get. We will not let the empty promises of the Democratic party take over. Rest assured, I, along with my Republican colleagues, will fight back and continue defending our values.

While it is a minor setback, Republicans will come out stronger, more unified, and more determined than ever to win back our country in 2020.

Week in Review
This week, I was recognized by the Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary, Robert Wilkie, for my service in the U.S. military. 

As a young man, entering the Marines was an easy decision and a family tradition with both my uncle and grandfather also being Marines. I believe it is my duty to give back to the country that has given so much to me and am forever grateful for my time in the Marine Corps. It is now a privilege to continue serving the country as a member of the Mississippi National Guard and a member of Congress.

November 18, 2018
Dear Friend,  
Last week I returned to Washington to kick off the remainder of the 115th Congress.  Much of the week was spent in organizational meetings, as the leadership in the House will be switching parties in January and Speaker Ryan is retiring.  Due to the fact that there are so many House races in which the winner has yet to be declared, we have not been given information about committee assignments for the next term.  I will spend the balance of this year pushing for the legislative priorities that I know matter most to you and our community, including:  preservation of Medicare and Social Security, protection of our children, advocacy for Veterans and lower costs of prescription drugs.  Many people have asked me how I will approach my work as a member of the minority party.  The truth is that very little will change.  I have always been a consensus builder, enjoying good relationships with members on both sides of the aisle.  I will continue working with my colleagues to advance the priorities of our district.  
Please continue reading for a brief recap of my work last week! 
Honoring and Advocating for Those Who Have Served Our Nation 
My staff and I were honored to kick off last week by participating in many Veterans Day celebrations throughout our community (Zephyrhills, Oldsmar, Safety Harbor, New Port Richey, Hudson and Tarpon Springs, to name a few). It was great to see our community come together to acknowledge the service and sacrifice of those who bravely answered the call to serve our nation
￼ 
Last week, I had the distinct privilege of attending a ceremony to recognize Medal of Honor recipients and their families.  These individuals truly represent the best among the best.  
￼ 
In last week’s VA Economic Opportunity Subcommittee hearing I was able to question senior VA officials about the unacceptable delays in processing GI bill payments due to technological failure.  My main concern is that student Veterans, who have already been inconvenienced, face more uncertainty as they prepare for the spring semester without this problem being resolved.   Additionally, legislation I sponsored, the SIT-REP Act, would hold our student Veterans harmless from undeserved penalties or fees by the schools due to VA delays in payment processing. My bill passed unanimously in the House, but is awaiting action in the Senate.  I urge my Senate colleagues to get it passed quickly in light of potential additional delays.  
I was also glad to have the opportunity to work with Congressman Crist on the case of a local veteran that was highlighted by WFLA.  Obviously, my heart goes out to Mr. Henry.  My staff has partnered with Congressman Crist’s staff and already reached out to him to see how we can assist.  First and foremost, I want to make sure his medical needs are being taken care of and that he is being reimbursed by the VA for the care he received at Tampa General Hospital. It is important to note that we have new leadership at Bay Pines.  Mr. Paul Russo is the brand new administrator.  This incident occurred prior to him arriving.  I have personally reached out to Mr. Russo and expect a full and thorough investigation to take place.  We must ensure that our Veterans are receiving the best possible care, and that best practices are being utilized. It highlights the need for the Mission Act, which was signed into law last year.  If the VA isn’t meeting the need of the Veteran, the Veteran must be able to get care within the community. I’m going to stay on top of this issue, and I appreciate Investigative Reporter Steve Andrews bringing it to my attention. 
Ensuring Public Safety 
Public safety is not a partisan issue. Channel 10 highlighted a tragic story of a local senior who died from carbon monoxide poisoning after forgetting to turn off his car's keyless ignition.   My heart goes out to the Schaub family. The data regarding preventable deaths is troubling. There needs to be appropriate safeguards in place to protect consumers.  As a member of the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee, I intend to work with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to ensure that greater attention is paid to this important public safety issue. 
Facilitating Continued Economic Success 
Our economy continues to thrive, as evidenced by multiple metrics.  This article highlights the fact that the need for employees has just reached a 45-year high. We must keep moving in a direction that supports continued growth.   
Raising Awareness 
Last week, we recognized World Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Day. Pancreatic cancer has surpassed breast cancer, and is now the 3rd leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. It is expected to become the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related death by the year 2020. It is important that we continue to fund critical research which holds the promise for the development of better treatments and a cure for this silent killer.
￼ 
Advocating for Animals 
As co-Chairman of the Congressional Humane Bond Caucus, it was great to participate in last week’s Thanksgiving Humane Table dinner.   We recognized farmers throughout the country who provide humane and ethical treatment to their animals.  
￼ 
  
  
Thank you for reading this week’s update. I wish you and your family a blessed Thanksgiving.  I personally have much to be thankful for, including serving as your representative in Washington, D.C.

SUPPORT FOR SHEP

This week the entire Georgia House delegation joined me in urging the administration to make the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP) a top funding priority in fiscal year 2020. 

In our request to Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, we asked for the funding required to keep the project on track towards completion. 

This project has a benefit-to-cost ratio of 7.3 to one and will deliver $282 million in annual transportation savings to the nation upon completion. By every measure, SHEP is a project that will provide extraordinary value and benefits to our state, region and nation for decades to come. We must complete this project so these benefits can be fully realized.

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CLXXXVIII

Monday, November 12, 2018:  Today is Veterans Day and although we celebrate this day only once a year, in reality, every day is Veterans Day!  Every day we give thanks for the sacrifice and service that our Veterans have given to our country so that we can enjoy the many freedoms that we have in this country.  I begin my day at my home church, Wesley Monumental United Methodist Church located on Calhoun Square in downtown Savannah, where I attend our annual Veterans Day Breakfast.  This year we honor those veterans and active duty service personnel who have served during the Mid-East Wars.  I am very proud of our church and very proud that we have this annual recognition of our country’s heroes.  After addressing the group, I head to St. Simons Island for the annual Veterans Council of the Golden Isles Veterans Day parade and ceremony.  As fate would have it, the rain stops just as the parade begins and a large crowd gathers along the roadway as we march down the streets of this island paradise honoring those who have sacrificed so much and served our great country. 
￼
Rep. Carter at the Veterans Day Celebration in St. Simons
Afterwards, we gather at the stage area near the St. Simons Pier for the annual Veterans Day ceremony where we hear from elected officials and I have the opportunity to address the large crowd as the clouds give way to sunshine.  After honoring the 2018 Veteran of the Year, Lorin “Len” Taylor, and 2018 Outstanding Community Service Award winner, Katherine A. Trackwell, our keynote Speaker is Rear Admiral Jeffrey T. Jablon, United States Navy Submarine Group 10, St. Marys, who gives a great history and update of this vitally important part of our armed forces.  
Tuesday, November 13, 2018:  I’m up early this morning and at the airport grabbing a flight to Washington to get an early start to the week.  After arriving in my office I’m able to at least make a dent in the mountain of paperwork that has accumulated on my desk over the past month spent in the First District before meeting with staff for our weekly briefing.  After a series of meetings with my Chief of Staff, Legislative Director and Communications Director to catch up, my next meeting is with Bill Eley with the American Pharmacy Cooperative, Inc. (APCI), followed by a phone conference with the Army Corps of Engineers to discuss the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP) fish passage at the New Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam in Augusta. 
￼
Rep. Carter meeting with APCI
Next, I head to the Capitol where we have the leadership election candidate forum for the Republican Conference for the upcoming 116th Congress. Later this week we will be choosing our Minority Leader, Minority Whip, Conference Chair, Conference Vice-Chair, Conference Secretary and Conference Policy Director.  Today’s meeting is to hear from the candidates who are running for those offices.  Afterwards, I head to the House Chamber where we have our first vote series of the week.
Wednesday, November 14, 2018:  This morning I meet with other members of the Energy and Commerce Committee to discuss what legislation we want to try and push before the end of the year.  We also discuss legislation that we have already passed out of the House that is over in the Senate and what we can do to get that legislation moving.  Afterwards, I head to our weekly GOP Conference meeting as we are brought up to date on the schedule for the remainder of this session.  Next, I head back to my office where I meet with members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to discuss labor issues before having a phone interview with Inside Health Policy to discuss the 340b drug pricing program.  Next, I meet with my good friend Rick Desai who is visiting from the Atlanta area before meeting with representatives from Ultimaxx Health to learn more about the work they are doing in OTC pain relief alternatives.  
￼
Rep. Carter meeting with Ultimaxx Health
Afterwards, I head to the conservative Republican Study Committee meeting where we hear from the candidates running for Chairman of the group before heading to the 116th Republican organizing conference where we are joined by newly elected members and where we have elections for leadership positions for the next session.  Later, I head to the House Chamber for our first and only vote series of the day and afterwards pay tribute on the floor to former Glynn County Police Chief Matt Doering, who passed in September.  A link to my tribute can be found here.  
￼
Rep. Carter speaking to the Gulfstream Executive Development Program
My final stop of the day is downtown where I speak to the Gulfstream Executive Development Council members who are in town this week.
Thursday, November 15, 2018:  My first meeting this morning is with farmers from Southwest Georgia as they bring me up to date on the devastation that they experienced during Hurricane Michael.  The pictures and stories are horrendous and we discuss what needs to be done and our course of action in getting disaster relief funds to the area as soon as possible. 
￼
Rep. Carter meeting with farmers from Southwest Georgia
Next, I meet with members of the Lowndes County Chamber of Commerce who catch me up on the many fine things going on in this growing community before having a telephone interview with The Lancet to discuss health care issues for the next session.  After meeting with the General Counsel of the Public Service Telephone Company in Taylor County, I head to another 116th Republican organizing conference meeting and this time we vote on rule proposals.  Later, I head back to my office where I host a TeleTown Hall, one of my favorite events.  Tonight’s call is interesting in that that we seem to have more comments than questions and I find that very useful as that is what the call is for - to hear from constituents. 
Friday, November 16, 2018:  This morning I head to a meeting of the conservative Republican Study Committee where Mike Johnson (R-LA) is elected as the chairman for the upcoming session before heading to the House Chamber for our first and only vote series of the day.  Afterwards, I pay tribute on the floor to Glynn County Middle School student Oran Yeargan, who, after serving as an assistant on the football team all year, overcame obstacles and scored a touchdown this year.  A link to my tribute can be found here.  Before heading to the airport for my return flight home, I have a call with my good friend Major General Leopoldo Quintas, Commander of the 3rd ID at Fort Stewart.
￼
Rep. Carter speaking to the Richmond Hill High School football team
Once back in Savannah, I head to Richmond Hill in Bryan County where I have the opportunity to speak to the Richmond Hill Wildcat football team before their second round playoff game with Coffee County and also participate in the coin toss before kickoff.  (I might add that I did my part- Richmond Hill won the toss!)
Saturday, November 17, 2018:  I am delighted today to attend the public unveiling of the Owens-Thomas House and slave quarters free community restoration celebration in downtown Savannah.  This great project is another example of the historic preservation that Savannah is so famous for and shows once more how much the citizens of our great city care about our history.  Later in the evening, I head out to the UGA Marine Education Center on Skidaway Island to visit their impressive facilities.

Thank you for subscribing to my E-Newsletter! This week I want to update you on a recent event I attended honoring our veterans, share what was discussed at a recent town hall meeting, and let you know about important legislation supported by President Trump that will help lower recidivism rates. 
I enjoy hearing from you and responding to your questions via email, phone calls, and letters. If you'd like to share your concerns or opinions with me, or if you have questions about legislation or specific votes, you can send me an email here. I've responded to more than 145,000 since taking office. To stay up-to-date on my work in Pennsylvania and Washington, be sure to follow me on Facebook and Twitter. You can also check out my YouTube page here where there are 100+ videos, many of which are direct responses to your questions.
I'm also extraordinarily proud of the casework my office has been able to complete for constituents. More than 3,200 cases have been completed, and more than $650,000 has been returned to constituents. If you need help with a federal agency, my office can often help cut through some of Washington's red tape. I'd encourage you to contact my district office at (717) 393-0667 if I can help in any way.
 
Honoring Our Veterans 
￼ 
We owe our veterans and their families a debt of gratitude we'll never be able to full repay. Each Veterans Day, we must renew our commitment to do as Abraham Lincoln said and ""care for him who shall have borne the battle."" We can and should also honor their bravery and sacrifice every day. 
On this past Veterans Day, I attended and spoke at Millersville Borough's Annual Veterans Day event at Freedom Memorial Park. I spoke about how Pennsylvania has produced some of the greatest examples of courage and bravery the world has ever seen. It is home to pivotal moments in American history like Gettysburg and Valley Forge. Lancaster resident Jim Pontz shared his story from his service in Vietnam - and it's because of men and women like Jim that our nation is free and prosperous. 
If you are a veteran, or if you know one, and you need help with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (or any other federal agency) please call my office at 717-393-0667. It would be my honor to serve you or your family, and is the very least I can do to say ""thank you"" for all you have given to our great nation.  
 
Town Hall in Quarryville 
￼ 
I am honored to be able to serve our community in Washington, D.C. One of the most important parts of this job is remaining engaged with constituents all across the district, and ensuring your voices are represented in Congress. 
That's why I've made it a top priority to consistently and routinely meet with constituents in open formats where they can ask me questions and I can provide answers about legislation, votes, and committee work. I recently visited Quarryville Presbyterian Retirement Community where I hosted a town hall meeting. We discussed how to lower health care costs, protect and preserve Medicare and Social Security, expand educational opportunities, and how to address the needs of America's workforce. 
If you'd like to invite me to visit your place of work, volunteer organization, civic organization, or would like to schedule a meeting with me in one of my offices, you can send me an email here. You can also see all the places I've visited in the district by using my ""Here's Lloyd"" map here. 
 
FIRST STEP Act Gets a Boost from President Trump
￼ 
Earlier this year, I signed onto the bipartisan FIRST STEP Act as a cosponsor to help get it passed through Congress and signed into law. This legislation would lower recidivism rates and help individuals convicted of nonviolent crimes reenter society. Specifically, this bill would introduce evidence-based programming in prisons to better equip federal inmates to successfully rejoin society after their sentences are served. 
In May, the House passed this important bill. This legislation also allows non-profit and faith-based organizations to provide programming to inmates. The first step towards successful reentry to society starts before inmates leave the prison, and I'm glad to work across the aisle to achieve that success.
This week, President Trump announced his full support for the FIRST STEP Act. He's a critical voice on criminal justice reform, and I'm glad we have his support to get this bill through the Senate and signed into law. You can read more about this legislation and my work on it here.

Greetings,
This week, Congress passed my bipartisan National Timing Resilience and Security Act, which establishes a reliable alternative timing system to GPS satellites. Currently, there is no domestic back up system to GPS, and crucial infrastructure – including gas stations, medical devices, and ATMs – could shut down and pose immediate threat to life and the economy in the United States should it be disrupted for even just a few hours. It is important both to our national and economic security that we have an alternative GPS timing system, and I am grateful for Sen. Ed Markey’s leadership on this issue. I am hopeful this bill is swiftly signed into law. 
On Thursday, I was pleased to introduce Bernie McNamee at the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources’ nominations hearing. Bernie was nominated by President Trump to serve as a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Throughout his career, Bernie has demonstrated a commitment to public service and implementing policy that will benefit the American people. I have every confidence he will make an exceptional commissioner at FERC.
Finally, Congress recognized the tremendous service and sacrifice of Texas veterans by renaming the Mission Post Office as the “Mission Veterans Post Office Building.” I was proud to work with Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) on this bipartisan tribute to those who have answered the call to defend our country and the freedoms we hold dear, and look forward to seeing President Trump signing this measure into law.
Last year millions of Texans across the Gulf Coast felt the impact of Hurricane Harvey. In response, Congress worked together to pass crucial tax relief legislation in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey, Maria, and Irma, including the Cruz-Cornyn-Rubio legislation. This bipartisan bill eliminated the tax penalty for hurricane victims who wanted to withdraw from retirement accounts to pay for the costs of repairs from storm damages. 
Those Texans hit by this disastrous hurricane still have the ability to withdraw money from their 401k plans or any other retirement plans in order to rebuild from the storm without having to pay the 10 percent penalty that typically applies. Retirement account withdrawals must be made by December 31, 2018. Texans who are still rebuilding have until the end of the year to access their savings without a penalty. I strongly urge my fellow Texans to contact your tax advisor for more information or go to the IRS website at irs.gov.
Please read below for an update from this last week.

Congressman Smith's E-news: November 17, 2018 
￼  I was honored to join students, faculty, staff, and members of the surrounding community at Gering Junior High School to commemorate Veterans Day. 
Giving Thanks 
Thanksgiving is the time of year we come together with family and give thanks for our many blessings. This year I’m most thankful for our one-year-old son, Zeke, my wife, Andrea, and our endlessly loving family members who support us at every turn. I’m also thankful for renewed economic growth which increases opportunity for future generations of Americans.   After years of poor economic performance and weak employment prospects, the economy is growing and consumer confidence is building. This trend shows how productive Americans can be when empowered to pursue opportunity. Because of this growth unemployment has fallen such that businesses nationwide are finding it difficult to fill open positions.  This is why I introduced the JOBS for Success Act earlier this year to reform the welfare system and ensure states are doing everything in their power to help TANF recipients find stable employment. Helping people find work is good for employers and good for taxpayers, but best of all for the individuals, themselves, in need of assistance. I’m thankful for such an opportunity to bring disenfranchised workers off the sidelines of our economy and into self-sufficiency.  I’m also thankful for our men and women in uniform.  Having recently celebrated Veterans Day, I believe it’s appropriate such a holiday comes just before Thanksgiving to remind us of the sacrifices of so many on our behalf. I was honored to join students, faculty, staff, and members of the surrounding community at Gering Junior High School to commemorate these sacrifices and say thank you. We must also remember that many of our active duty service members won’t be able to come home for the holidays.   For this reason, my office participates in Holidays for Heroes to ensure our men and women in uniform remember how grateful we are while so many of them spend the holidays away from their families. Through this program, the American Red Cross collects cards signed by thankful Americans and distributes them to service members throughout the holidays.   My offices in Scottsbluff and Grand Island serve as collection center for these cards and we pass them along to the American Red Cross. If you would like to participate, please drop off your cards without postage at one of my offices by December 7th. This is such a small gesture we can make to show our gratitude to those who work each and every day toward protecting our families and the freedoms we enjoy. Happy Thanksgiving.  
Sincerely,
￼  ADRIAN SMITH Member of Congress

November 17, 2018 
Dear Friends,  This Sunday marks the 40th anniversary of the massacre of 913 people at the People's Temple in Guyana. I was there with my boss and mentor, Congressman Leo Ryan, who became the first Member of Congress to be assassinated overseas in the service of his constituents and the American people. I also was shot and left for dead, and my survival of that horrific chapter in human history helped shaped the person I have become today, as did the influence of Congressman Ryan.
Congressman Ryan was constantly searching for the truth and results. He was not content to sit back when others claimed nothing could be done and he doggedly pursued facts and justice, especially for those who were unable to do so for themselves. 
Given the political climate currently rocking our country, and the world, it's more important than ever that we honor the life and work of Congressman Ryan by seeking the truth, remaining engaged, and educating ourselves. That is why I have chosen the following articles to share with you today. My experiences, and those of many others, show that no matter how bad things may seem or become there is always hope and opportunities for us to affect positive change. 
All the best,  ￼

By Kevin Fagan, San Francisco Chronicle
It began apocalyptically. Then it got worse. 
First there was the massacre of 913 people, mostly San Franciscans, at a compound in Guyana run by a mad cult leader, Jim Jones, whose quasi-religious quest for racial integration and salvation for the poor had endeared him to many city liberals but masked murderous subjugation. Among the dead were a Peninsula congressman and three journalists who had flown in to investigate the jungle camp known as Jonestown. 
The shock of the mass killing hadn’t fully settled in when a deeply disturbed former San Francisco supervisor made his way into City Hall and fatally shot Mayor George Moscone and city Supervisor Harvey Milk. 
The anguish that began 40 years ago Sunday in a South American jungle compound and climaxed less than two weeks later with the City Hall assassinations marked some of the darkest days in San Francisco history. The events cast a gloom that would last for years. They also, in some ways, changed the course of the city’s future.

SF doctor was told by the NRA to stay in her lane. She said no.
￼
By Joe Garofoli, San Francisco Chronicle
Friday started typically for Judy Melinek. The San Francisco forensic pathologist called into work and learned that she had one gunshot victim to autopsy. Often, there are more. 
Before she left, she looked again at the tweet that incensed her. The 154,000-member American College of Physicians had just issued new guidelines for doctors to protect patients from gun violence, but the National Rifle Association wasn’t impressed. A tweet sent from the NRA’s political arm said: “Someone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane.” 
Melinek responded with a tweet that may be remembered as the rallying cry of a white coat revolution: “Do you have any idea how many bullets I pull out of corpses weekly? This isn’t just my lane. It’s my f— highway.” 
Melinek’s tweet, as a pathologist might put it, went viral.

Laws and disorder
Today’s Congress is dominated by party leaders and functions as a junior partner to the executive, an analysis by The Post and ProPublica finds.
By Paul Kane and Derek Willis, ProPublica
For more than 200 years, Congress operated largely as the country’s founders envisioned — forging compromises on the biggest issues of the day while asserting its authority to declare war, spend taxpayer money and keep the presidency in check. 
Today, on the eve of a closely fought election that will determine who runs Capitol Hill, that model is effectively dead. 
It has been replaced by a weakened legislative branch in which debate is strictly curtailed, party leaders dictate the agenda, most elected representatives rarely get a say and government shutdowns are a regular threat because of chronic failures to agree on budgets, according to a new analysis of congressional data and documents by The Washington Post and ProPublica.

Orwell Thought That Plain Political Language Could Save Us. Then Came Trump.
By Lane Greene, Politico Magazine
Since Donald Trump’s rise in 2015, calling his presidency Orwellian has been a kind of shibboleth among critics. After Trump’s first week in January 2017, Adam Gopnik wrote in the New Yorker, “re-reading Orwell, one is reminded of what Orwell got right about this kind of brute authoritarianism.” That same month, when Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway defended the administration’s “alternative facts,” Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote that “we’ve gone full Orwell.” Shortly afterward, sales of 1984 surged. 
But in one important respect, these commentators are missing something important. When it comes to language, Trump isn’t the kind of person Orwell was worried about. In fact the plain-speaking president represents something closer to Orwell’s imagined solution to a problem that consumed him, the use of public language to hide meaning. If you look at how Trump talks—and the similar rhetoric in Britain around Brexit, and the broader populist wind across Europe—it is proof that Orwell got some big things wrong when it comes to language’s ability to protect us from politicians who would rather have us not know the truth.

Dear Friend,
In a few short days it will be Thanksgiving in America and family members will be traveling home, there will be turkey on the table, games around the house, and football on the television. Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays – not just because of the incredible food and traditions – but because of the chance to gather with close friends and loved ones and reflect on all of life’s blessings...KEEP READING HERE


WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH

￼
I was grateful for the opportunity to thank veterans and recognize the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I in West Plains. It was great to see so many folks turn out for the Veterans' Day luncheon! 
￼
I'm proud that southern Missouri honors our nation's veterans every day. This week Cape Girardeau became an official Purple Heart City at their Veterans' Day celebration. Visual reminders will now be posted around the city as an everyday reminder showing veterans how much they are appreciated.
￼
There was a really touching ceremony this week at the St. Francois Courthouse paying respect to our nation's veterans. The men and women who bravely serve our country are the reason we're blessed to live in the freest country that's ever existed.


THIS WEEK IN DC
￼
I enjoyed meeting with Missouri students from Jobs for America's Graduates and discussing ways to prevent high school dropouts and prepare students for the workforce. They came all the way from West Plains, Charleston, and Kennett, so I had to show them around our nation's Capitol!
￼
I met with a bright group of students from St. Piux X High School who came to D.C. with the organization Close Up, which encourages students to be active and involved with their government.
￼
Everything Congress does impacts your family and our country. I want to hear from you - what do you think should be Congress' top priority?

Weekly Update: Economic Prosperity By Congressman Rob Wittman November 17, 2018  As the leaves change and fall to the ground (along with some snow this week), I’m reminded how things have changed so much in the last year. Our nation’s and Virginia’s economies are thriving due to the pro-growth policies we have passed this Congress. And, honestly, the results speak for themselves.  Data released from the Bureau of Labor Statistic on November 2, 2018 told us three important things: hiring is up, wages are up, and the number of workers and job searchers is up. We learned that payrolls increased by 250,000 in October, well ahead of estimates, average hourly earnings increased by 3.1% - the best pace since 2009, and the unemployment rate stayed at 3.7% which is the lowest since 1969.  Experts, such as Elise Gould, the senior economist for the Economic Policy Institute, said that this report is “definitely a strong signal that workers are finally beginning to see the growing economy reach their paychecks.” I’m seeing that too. I have talked with countless businesses and constituents in the First District who are able to hire more workers or make a family purchase because of the extra dollars in their paychecks.  The Editorial Board at The Wall Street Journal wrote that, “GOP growth policies rescued an economy that was fading fast.” Virginia’s economy, as a result of these policies, is booming. Earlier this month, I witnessed this growth first-hand at home. Governor Northam and I visited two businesses expanding their operations in the First District, bringing more jobs to our community. Premier Tech, Ltd., a global leader in the horticulture and agriculture sector, announced a $1.89 million investment in their King and Queen County facility along with the creation of 20 new jobs.  Carry-On Trailer Inc., a leading manufacturer of steel and utility trailers announced that they are investing $1.6 million in their Westmoreland County facility and adding 42 new jobs in the Northern Neck.   In Washington, I am always working to spur job creation in the First District and build a strong economy. It is investments like the ones Carry-On Trailer, Inc. and Premier Tech, Ltd. made in our community that spur further economic development and allow small communities to flourish.  I think the Chicago Tribune said it best, though, in an editorial at the beginning of the month: “There are plenty of measures of American satisfaction and security, but having a job is fundamentally important. Growth creates prosperity.” … “In other words, everything positive starts with jobs.” Unlike the seasons, my dedication to securing policies that will help keep Virginia’s economy growing will never change.

November 17, 2018
This week, the House passed H.R. 6651, bipartisan legislation which extends the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) – the most successful U.S. assistance program since the Marshall Plan.
Since its inception in 2003, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has received strong bipartisan support in Congress and through three administrations, Republican and Democrat.
Working in over 50 countries, PEPFAR has transformed the global HIV/AIDS response. PEPFAR supports 14 million people with lifesaving antiretroviral treatment and has tested more the 85 million for HIV since 2003. This is compared with only 50,000 people who were on treatment in sub-Saharan Africa when PEPFAR began. 
With PEPFAR support, more than 2.2 million babies have been born HIV-free to pregnant women living with HIV and their mothers have been kept healthy and alive to protect and nurture them. PEPFAR also provides assistance to more than 6.4 million orphans, vulnerable children, and their caregivers. 
I saw the miracle of this program firsthand when I traveled to Rwanda with Bono in 2015. It was a moving experience, and the people of Africa are so grateful to the United States for our support. 
This program is successful because it is inclusive. PEPFAR is led and managed by the U.S. Department of State's Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and Health Diplomacy and implemented by seven U.S. government departments and agencies, leveraging the power of a whole-of-government approach to controlling the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
Additionally, multiple departments and agencies work alongside private sector partners, non-profits, faith communities – allowing programs to maximize resources and results. Thanks to PEPFAR, the U.S. is world’s leader in responding to the global HIV and AIDS crisis. 
PEPFAR continues to expand its impact through transparent, accountable, and cost-effective investments. Thanks to the success of PEPFAR, stopping this disease is within reach. We are on the brink of achieving an AIDS-free generation, a great accomplishment that’s possible only because of bipartisan American leadership. That’s something that we should all take pride in. 
Sincerely,
￼

BACK TO WASHINGTON It was back to Washington this week after the October district work period. The House has a lot to accomplish between now and the end of the 115th Congress, including funding the government through the end of the fiscal year and providing funding for President Trump’s border wall.  NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH Family is one of the greatest gifts we are given in life. The upcoming Thanksgiving holiday allows us an opportunity to say thank you for the gift of family. November is National Adoption Month. Both are a perfect reminder that every child needs a safe and loving family and every child deserves a permanent place to call home. Read more in this week’s Mullin It Over via the Muskogee Phoenix.

11/17/18 11:27,My top priorities for the new Congress,"News From Congresswoman Sewell Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window          Click here to open a plain text version of this email 
￼ 
  Dear Lindsey, 
In just a couple short months, the Democratic Party will take leadership over the House of Representatives here in our nation’s capital. In the majority, I plan to focus Congress on the issues that matter most to working families, like lowering healthcare costs, increasing wages, repairing our aging infrastructure, and restoring our democracy. I want to make sure your voice is heard as we tackle these issues and more. 
What would you like to see Congress prioritize in 2019? Take this quick survey. 
￼  Rep. Sewell calls for legislation lowering healthcare costs 
Healthcare is an issue that intimately impacts the lives of every American. For families in Alabama and across the country, Congress must lower the overall cost of care, protect healthcare for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions, and strengthen our rural hospitals. I believe that whether you live in a rural community or a big city, whether you’re just starting a family or you’re preparing for retirement, your access to healthcare is a right. In the new Congress, I’ll push for legislation that stabilizes the healthcare marketplace, lowers healthcare premiums, and increases access to quality care for all Americans. 
Here in Alabama, we still have work to do expanding economic opportunity for working families. Over the past few years, I have crafted bipartisan legislation that would increase skills training for our workforce, and with Democrats in control of the House, I plan to build on this idea. I plan on fighting for infrastructure investments that give our workforce a competitive edge in today’s economy. That means delivering internet connectivity to families in our rural communities, repairing our roads and bridges, and building water and wastewater systems in communities that currently lack these basic necessities. 
￼ 
Rep. Sewell and Rep. Lewis partner
to advance voting rights legislation
Take a moment to let me know your top priorities for Congress next year. 
Lastly, I am dedicated to strengthening our democracy and restoring the right to vote for all Americans. I grew up in Selma, and the legacy of those who fought to ensure that every American has the right to vote is one I have never forgotten. In 2013, many of the protections included in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were overturned by the Supreme Court with disastrous effects for the American people. I believe that the immediate restoration of these protections is a top priority, which is why I have introduced the Voting Rights Advancement Act. My bill requires states with a history of discrimination to submit their election changes to the Department of Justice for clearance, stopping laws intended to suppress the vote from going into effect. In the new Congress, I plan on pushing for a vote on the VRAA in the House. 
If you haven’t yet, take the time to let me know what issues you would like to see addressed in Congress so I can make your voice heard here in the House of Representatives. I also encourage you to stay up-to-date by liking my Facebook page and following me on Twitter. Thank you for sharing your thoughts, and I look forward to staying in touch!

Sincerely,

Republican Congress Getting Results for Tennesseans:
	•	This week, we honor the men and women in Tennessee, and across the country, who have worn the uniform of our Armed Services – their dedication has protected our ways of life and freedom. This Congress, we’ve passed legislation to help veterans find health care closer to home and increase veterans’ disability benefits based on the rising cost of living.
Important news from this past week:
	•	Amazon announced it will be bringing a new operations hub to Nashville. This is good for Amazon, good for Governor Haslam, and great for Tennessee. Amazon’s decision to invest $230 million and create 5,000 good-paying jobs is even more evidence that Nashville is an attractive place to live and work.
	•	Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) CEO Bill Johnson announced this week that he is stepping down from his position. Those of us in the Tennessee Valley owe a big thank you to Bill Johnson – he and the board of directors have provided sound management and set the Tennessee Valley Authority in the right direction for the future. Electric power is reliable, rates are competitive, the debt is smaller and the air is cleaner thanks to the leadership of Bill Johnson and TVA’s board. Having TVA in such good shape makes it much easier to grow and recruit more good-paying jobs in our region.
	•	Earlier this week, the TOP500 confirmed the United States is home to the two fastest supercomputers in the world -- including the fastest supercomputer in the world, Summit, which is housed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
Making it easier for Tennessee students to apply for federal student aid 
￼ ￼
This week, I visited a group of high school juniors and seniors in Sevierville with President Trump’s Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, to show students and local school counselors how to use a new phone application that makes it simpler and easier to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and apply for federal aid. Last year, about 775 high school students in Sevier County filled out the FAFSA – along with another 400,000 Tennesseans -- but many others did not fill it out. We have apps on our phones to do anything from booking an airplane ticket to placing an Amazon order, so while it may seem very ordinary to fill out the FAFSA on an app, this is the first year it’s possible. I am glad Secretary DeVos is taking steps to make it easier for students to apply for federal and state financial aid, including Pell Grants, Tennessee Promise, and the Tennessee Hope Scholarship. Because of the state’s free tuition program for two years of college, a higher percentage of Tennessee families answer the 108 questions on the FAFSA form than in almost any other state. There are still too many questions on the form – I have introduced bipartisan legislation to reduce the number of those questions, but this is an important step to make it simpler to apply for student aid.
 
Asking the Senate Minority Leader why he’s picking on Tennessee 
￼
*Click here for video of my remarks.*
John Ryder of Memphis was nominated by President Trump over 282 days ago to be on the TVA’s Board of Directors. He’s been unanimously approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and for more than 176 days, he has been waiting on his confirmation. John has bipartisan support, and it’s time that he be confirmed. So this week I asked that the Senate confirm Ryder’s nomination, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer objected. So I asked him why block a nominee for the Tennessee Valley Authority who is eminently well-qualified and who’s needed on the board to pick a new CEO for the millions of people in the seven-state region. And I asked him why it is that he is picking on Tennessee. I’m extremely disappointed for John Ryder, who is a prominent lawyer and thought he might get to be on the TVA board. I’m disappointed for the people of Tennessee and the TVA region. And I’m disappointed that Senate Democrats say even though they approve of him, even though they’ve got no reason not to confirm him, they’re just going to slow the train down just because they can. I hope the Senate Democrats will end their obstruction of this exceptionally well-qualified candidate to serve on the TVA board.

Asking the Senate Minority Leader why it is he’s picking on Tennessee 
￼ ￼
I was thrilled to attend the opening ceremony of the new 16-mile section of the Foothills Parkway adjacent to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park last week. I consider it the best view of the highest mountains in the eastern United States, and one more thing Tennesseans can be thankful for this Thanksgiving.
Urging China to become a leader in stopping synthetic opioids
I spoke on the Senate floor this week about how China can become the global leader in stopping synthetic opioids from coming to the United States. Over 42,000 people died from an opioid overdose in 2016, and roughly 45% of those deaths were from synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Earlier this month, I led a group of five senators and two members of the House of Representatives on a trip to China where I encouraged Chinese officials to help stop the flow of deadly fentanyl into the United States. China cooperates with U.S. law enforcement agencies to combat the opioid crisis, but our cooperation faces challenges when a substance is not on China’s controlled substances list. So the request we made of Chinese officials was this: control all fentanyl substances as a class, just as the Trump Administration did for the United States in November, 2017. The Chinese government officials were very generous and respectful of their time with our delegation. They listened carefully, and they agreed to continue to work with our government to address this public health crisis. Thanks to the leadership of Ambassador Terry Branstad, our relationships with our counterparts in China, and the support of the international community, I am optimistic that we can work together to make even greater strides to stop the production and flow of fentanyl into the United States, and that China will stand proud in their efforts to take action against fentanyl.

Thank you to the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome for recognizing our work on opioid and substance abuse issues. Earlier this year, Congress passed and President Trump signed our opioid legislation into law to deal with the opioid epidemic, the biggest public health crisis in our country.
 
 
Celebrating the completion of a two-year trail rehabilitation project on Rainbow Falls Trail 
￼
The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is celebrating the completion of a two-year trail rehabilitation project on Rainbow Falls Trail. Last August, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and I had the opportunity to meet some of the folks working to repair the trail. Rainbow Falls Trail is one of the most popular trails in the Smokies. With these repairs, people will have the opportunity to enjoy this trail for generations to come. But the truth is too many roads, trails, campgrounds and visitors’ centers in our parks are in bad shape, and the National Park Service doesn’t have adequate funding to repair them all. That’s why I introduced the Restore our Parks Act which would cut in half the over $11 billion deferred maintenance backlog at our national parks and has the backing of President Trump and Secretary Zinke. The Restore our Parks Act is about filling potholes, fixing bathrooms, maintaining trails and campgrounds, repairing visitors’ centers and restoring our 417 national parks so Americans can enjoy them.

Congratulations to Vanderbilt University! This week the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy announced it will invest almost $1 million for science research – just another example of how Tennessee is a national leader in science, technology and research.
Below are some articles from this week I thought you would enjoy:

Weekly Review




November 5

Veterans Day: On the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, major hostilities of World War I ceased and the guns fell silent. One year later, President Woodrow Wilson recognized the first anniversary of the day, and 20 years later, November 11 became the national holiday, which is now known as Veterans Day.

It is a day for every one of us to stop and remember the services rendered by every veteran. 

With tens of thousands of South Carolinians and well over 20 million men and women serving in our nation’s armed services, it’s our duty and privilege to remember the sacrifices they’ve made and continue to make on our behalf. Accordingly, I would like to thank our veterans for their service and would ask that you do the same. As a nation, we are indebted to them for their service. 

We live in a country of laws and not men and a country founded on every citizen’s pursuit of happiness without undue government influence. As we all know, however, these blessings are not free. They’re ours only because generations of Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Airmen have responded to duty’s call and, in many cases, risked their lives to sustain freedom. 

George Patton Waters, grandson of General Patton, lives here in Mount Pleasant and was kind enough to let us feature his and his grandfather’s story two years ago. It has become one of my favorite videos that my team has created, and I wanted to share it one more time. I think this short video of Mr. Waters is quite moving and indeed captures the spirit of reverence that so many of us have come to associate with today.

I hope you’ll take a moment to watch it…and to reach out and thank a veteran in your life.

Historic Levels of Debt: The British philosopher Edmund Burke saw society as a generational compact. In fact, his specific words were, ""A partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born.""
If this is true, the compact is well on its way to being shattered.
In fact, obliterated.
I say this because not only is our federal debt rising, but the biggest driver of debt will be interest costs. What that translates to in plain English is that the young person born in the American system today will be paying interest on government consumed by the previous generation…or maybe even the one before that.
That’s the ultimate in taxation without representation. And that is the very thing that our Founding Fathers and early day patriots fought against so many years ago. Click here to read more.

Three Thoughts on the Midterms: In case you missed it, I’ve linked a New York Times op-ed that I wrote earlier this week. It walks through three national trends that I think to be very important in national elections going forward. In this piece, I use the recent First District race as a microcosm and as an example of these larger trends. But at the end of the day, the piece had little to do with our local race and everything to do with what happened in suburban congressional districts across this country.
I’m not alone in my concerns here, as Karl Rove, former adviser to President Bush, has written extensively on these same themes. One cannot grow a movement and one’s voice in the political process by shrinking the audience.
Some friends have asked why I would write for the New York Times given I’m a conservative, and my answer is that if I’m going to take the time to write a piece dealing with national trends, I want to maximize my reach in getting that message out. In this case, what I had hoped for was proven true, given all three television stations in Charleston, a myriad of state and local papers, and a variety of other national media sources have picked up on this piece and run with it. In short, that’s what we should do if we want to get ideas we believe out into the public mainstream.
In this case, I make the point that as Republicans, we have a remarkable legacy on the environment and conservation that has somehow been dissipated in recent years. I think that this is both a policy and a political mistake, given my belief that conservatism ought to apply with natural resources as well as financial resources. In short, the Bible talks about stewardship - what my dad used to call leaving the world leaving a better place than we found it, and I think we would be well-advised to not forget that simple notion. On finances, Republicans have not been as much a voice for spending restraint as they once were. I believe that there is an electoral consequence here too. Finally, I believe that tone matters. If I tell our boys the right thing with the wrong tone, they don’t listen to me. If I tell them the wrong thing with the right tone, they just might...and that’s even more problematic.
I could go on with a whole host of other observations on what I wrote, but in case you missed it, I’ve included it below so you can read it and analyze for yourself the things with which you agree…or disagree.
I hope your morning is going well….

Misapplication of Congressional Rules: Yesterday’s vote on the rule for the Manage our Wolves Act represented what I won’t miss in leaving Washington. It also represented games that are played here in our nation’s capital that subvert our respective voices as citizens.
I voted no on what would have otherwise been routine rule vote. It nonetheless passed 201 to 187.
Here is how the game is played.
Based on the rules of the House of Representatives, there are certain motions that are privileged. This means that if they’re brought forward, they immediately go to the Floor for a vote without being able to be stopped at the subcommittee or full committee level.
One of the most privileged of resolutions is tied to Congress’ constitutional responsibility in deciding matters of war. It was strengthened with the War Powers Act of 1973. It was at this time that Congress, as a result of having their collective voice ignored during the Vietnam War, codified what the Constitution had already said on Congress’ power on these matters...but went a step further in instituting a timeline in the Executive Branch’s ability to take unilateral action. If troops are in combat, the Executive Branch can only call it a policing action but for so long before they have to come to Congress for authorization. Click here to read more.

Vote to Rename the Oyster Bay Wildlife Refuge: Earlier this week, the House voted on a bill - H.R. 6064, which would rename the Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge in New York to instead be called the Congressman Lester Wolff National Wildlife Refuge. Although the bill passed with 385 members voting yes and only four voting no, I was one of two House members to vote present.
I don’t believe that federal buildings, facilities, or open space should be named after living political figures. This is something that I consistently fought against when I was governor, as it seemed that every interchange across the state miraculously wound up being named after a sitting House or Senate member.
This is not to say that those House or Senate members hadn’t contributed to society and weren’t good people; it was just based on the belief that more things should be named after the thousands and millions of taxpayers who built the building or paid for the open space.
In Lester Wolff’s case, he sounds exemplary on all fronts. My vote was not against him but rather the process of renaming facilities after living political figures. Click here to read more.

Dear Friend,   Thank you for the opportunity to update you on the work of the 115th Congress. I trust this finds you and your family well, as we work together to bring Hoosier common sense to Washington.

In This Week's Rokita Report
	•	Discussing Florida Recounts with Lou Dobbs
	•	New Leadership in the House
	•	Respecting Our Nation's Heritage
This Week in Photos
￼
Sunday was Veterans Day. We honored the heroic men and women who have scarified for our country and protected our freedoms.  Thank you!
￼
Last week, my office hosted our third School Safety Summit.  We brought together experts and leaders in the community for an honest discussion.  You can read reports from prior conferences here.
￼
I recently attended the Indiana Veterans Hall of Fame induction ceremony.  It was an honor to recognize this year's class of Hoosier heroes and hear about the sacrifices they made for our country during their service.

Discussing Florida Recounts with Lou Dobbs
As I hear about the troubles with election administration in Florida, I am reminded of Yogi Berra's quote, ""it's like déjà vu all over again.""  On Thursday, I was on Lou Dobbs to discuss the recount in Florida and House leadership elections.  I was reminded of my time in Florida in 2000 as a lawyer for the Bush campaign when it too faced a recount.  It struck me as remarkable that the same liberal counties in Florida still have not gotten their act together and are still unable to count votes in accordance with Florida law.  
￼
In 2000, those of us engaged in the recount process understood the stakes.  The final tally between George W. Bush and Al Gore was several hundred votes and this time, the tally between Governor Rick Scott and Senator Bill Nelson is over ten thousand votes.  That margin has not been reversed in recounts going back to at least the 2000 Presidential race.  Simply put, liberal elites in Florida cannot hold the country hostage like this any longer.  What they need to do is adopt common-sense election reforms.
As Indiana's Secretary of State, I oversaw the implementation of election reforms based on what we learned from the 2000 election and using the newest technologies.  We started the vote center trial run, which has given voters more flexibility on election day, letting them vote at a location convenient for their schedules and not at a specific assigned location.  From our trial run, over thirty counties in the Hoosier state have adopted this model.
In addition to making voting easier, we boosted the integrity of our elections.  No discussion of election integrity can happen, though, without voter ID laws.  This week, President Trump discussed the need for voter ID laws.  The President is exactly right - voter ID laws protect election integrity.  When I was Indiana's Secretary of State, we passed the Nation's first voter ID law and successfully defended it to the Supreme Court.  Our state law serves as a model for the Nation and made Indiana elections better.
New Leadership in the House
I am proud of my friend Kevin McCarthy for being named Minority Leader for the 116th Congress.  I know him and the rest of the leadership will do a great job fighting for all Americans against Nancy Pelosi and the liberal elites.
In addition to House Republicans electing Rep. Kevin McCarty as House Minority Leader, Republicans elected Rep. Steve Scalise as Minority Whip, Rep. Liz Cheney as Conference Chairwoman, Rep. Jason Smith as Conference Secretary, and Rep. Gary Palmer as Policy Committee Chairman.
I know everyone elected will continue to fight for strong conservative principles and support President Trump's agenda to make America great again.  My friend Jim Jordan ran a strong race for Minority Leader, and I know he will continue to be a strong voice for America.  I wish my colleagues well in their future endeavors.
Respecting Our Nation's Heritage
In July, I released legislation to improve the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA).  My bill would hold increase penalties for NAGPRA violations and move enforcement from U.S. Fish and Wildlife to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
The inspiration for the bill came about from an Indianapolis Star series, where reporters found that archaeologists from Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne excavated thousands of items from former tribal sites at Strawtown Koteewi Park, including artifacts and human remains, without properly notifying tribal leaders, per federal statute.  I was outraged.  The graves of the first settlers of the United States are meticulously protected by our laws.  The graves of Native Americans deserve that same respect.
￼
On Tuesday, I attended the Association on American Indian Affairs Repatriation Conference to share an update on my legislation.  I let the attendees know that the bill has bipartisan support and has helped start an important conversation about protecting these graves.  I look forward to continuing to promote this bill and these issues.

A Reflection on the Past and Look Forward at the Future
As we reflect upon Veterans Day and on the 100th Anniversary of the armistice that ended World War I, our nation is reminded about the importance of showing gratitude to those who served to protect our freedoms. As a U.S. Army veteran, I have no higher commitment than taking care of our active duty military, their families and our veterans. Every servicemember deserves to be honored because we are forever indebted to them for their sacrifices to defend our nation. When I was selected by my colleagues to chair the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs two years ago, I knew we had monumental challenges and a lot of work to do to improve care for these heroes. I am very proud of what our committee has accomplished during the 115th Congress.  
This Congress, the House has passed over 80 veterans’ related bills and over two dozen have been signed into law by President Trump. One of the most vital pieces of legislation passed this Congress was the VA MISSION Act. I was very proud to see this bill, which I worked on for two years, signed into law on June 6, 2018. This bipartisan piece of legislation puts into place comprehensive reforms that streamline the duplicative community care and Choice programs at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) into one cohesive program that improves access and quality of care, creates a non-partisan process for reviewing VA’s assets to ensure veterans can access the care they have earned, and expands VA’s Caregiver Program to veterans of all eras. This bill also strengthens VA’s internal capacity to provide timely, quality care to veteran patients within VA medical facilities by improving and expanding VA’s ability to train, recruit and retain the very best providers. 
Over the past several years, VA’s civil service rules hindered the department from firing an employee in a timely fashion for poor performance or misconduct. The previous rules resulted in a tiring and complex removal process that could take more than a year, or was often dismissed entirely. To change this process, Congress passed the Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act which was signed into law on June 23, 2017. This bill provided the VA Secretary increased flexibility to remove, demote or suspend any VA employee. It also provides protection for whistleblowers who have helped uncover and address ongoing issues within the department. The overwhelming majority of VA employees are good, hard-working people; the bad actions of a few have tainted the good name of many. This law was necessary to give accountability to the VA, and it is already having positive impacts on the department.   
One of the achievements I’m most proud of in the 115th Congress was getting the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act signed into law in August 16, 2017. Also known as the “Forever GI Bill”, this legislation expands access to GI Bill benefits for our veterans by making more veterans eligible to receive benefits and removes the time restrictions, so troops can have the benefits for life instead of the current 15-year time limit. It increases GI Bill funding for reservists, guardsmen, dependents and Gold Star families; extends additional benefits to Purple Heart recipients; provides additional benefits to servicemembers and veterans in STEM degrees; and provides GI benefits back to veterans whose schools close on them during the semester.  
Another significant reform was the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, which was signed into law on August 23, 2017. This bill modernizes the disability claims appeals system and assists almost half a million veterans and their families. The appeals reform legislation created three “lanes” for veterans’ appeals, the goal of which is to get veterans appeals adjudicated in a timelier manner. These lanes allow veterans to choose the option that works best for their individual situation, including an expedited review. Additionally, as a part of the appeals reform process, VA will update its IT systems, issue implementing regulations, create forms, train employees, and allocate staff appropriately to ensure that both new appeals and those that have been pending longest are all decided timely and fairly.  
While I’m proud of our accomplishments, all of these bills will just be pieces of paper without proper implementation. That’s why our committee stayed active this week, holding three subcommittee oversight hearings. For instance, there have been some hiccups in Forever GI Bill implementation. We discovered significant GI Bill payment delays for many veterans, which is of great concern to me. That is why we have held multiple oversight hearings – including one this week – on the implementation of this legislation, so that these issues are swiftly resolved. I will work tirelessly to ensure our student veterans receive the full and correct benefits they have rightfully earned.  Every member on this committee has the same goal - to give veterans the care and support they have earned and deserve. We will continue to implement the MISSION Act; make sure the Forever GI Bill is working for students; and ensure our disability appeals reforms are implemented effectively and working as intended. I look forward to continuing our work on reforming VA for the better.

NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH
￼
November is National Adoption Month – an opportunity to raise awareness about the positive impact adoption and foster care have on Hoosiers’ lives.
A stable home environment is crucial for a child’s development and success later in life. Adoption and foster care play a vital role in helping future generations achieve the American Dream.
That’s why I’m committed to supporting these parents and children and promoting strong and healthy families.
I’m working to ensure states and local communities have the resources they need to facilitate safe and efficient adoptions. The faster we can place vulnerable children in stable homes through foster care and adoption, the better chance these kids will have to thrive.
I introduced bipartisan legislation geared toward modernizing the process for interstate adoptions, and it was signed into law earlier this year. 
By eliminating the unnecessary paperwork and building on the success Indiana and other states have had with a modern, electronic system, we can reduce excessive delays and help children lead better lives.
The Modernizing the Interstate Placement of Children in Foster Care Act will help states transition to a modernized, electronic system for interstate that Indiana helped to establish.
I look forward to continuing our important efforts to give Hoosier families every opportunity to build a bright, successful future.
REPORT TRAINS BLOCKING ROADS
As you may know, the Indiana Supreme Court recently ruled that local authorities can no longer fine rail companies when trains are stopped for long periods of time and block street crossings. 
Blocked crossings are a public safety issue, and I am concerned about the danger they pose to commuters, emergency personnel, and anyone traveling around our community. 
If you ever witness a train blocking an intersection for an extended amount of time, you can file a complaint with the Federal Railroad Administration Region 4 office and the Surface Transportation Board. You can also report the blocked crossings to your local law enforcement authorities or mayor’s office.

The Washington Rundown 
This week, Congressman Butterfield returned to Washington, D.C. to welcome newly elected Members of Congress and to prepare for the 116th Congress.  In January 2019, the House of Representatives will welcome at least 50 new Democrats, allowing them to take control of the Chamber for the first time since 2011.  Once in charge of the House, Democrats will work to make health care more accessible and prescription drugs more affordable, and protect those with pre-existing conditions; as well as to fight for investments in priorities like infrastructure and education that will grow our economy and raise wages.  Democrats will also call for greater transparency, oversight, and ethics enforcement in the federal government.  The wildfires in California have caused widespread devastation, forcing roughly 81,000 to evacuate and taking the lives of at least 66.  Congressman Butterfield has advocated for additional emergency funding to help with recovery from hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires in North Carolina and across the country.  Please join Congressman Butterfield in keeping the impacted communities in your thoughts and prayers as California begins recovery.  News broke on Thursday that the U.S. Senate is scheduled to hold a final confirmation vote on Thomas Farr, President Trump’s nominee for a lifetime seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, before the end of the year.  Congressman Butterfield strongly opposes Farr's nomination, as well as voting rights activists and organizations across the country, due to Farr's dismal record in opposition to voting rights and workers’ rights. 
Butterfield, Cooper Call For More Florence Funds 
Congressman Butterfield met with Governor Roy Cooper and the North Carolina Congressional Delegation this week to push for more federal assistance with Hurricane Florence recovery efforts.  The meeting was productive and resulted in strong bipartisan support among North Carolina's Congressional Delegation to press Congress for additional funds to address housing, infrastructure, agriculture, and business.  The storm caused an estimated $17 billion in damages in North Carolina- more than Hurricanes Floyd and Matthew combined- and dumped 8 trillion gallons of rain in the state making it one of the heaviest rains in East Coast history.  Congressman Butterfield helped secure $1.68 billion in supplemental disaster funding in September, part of which helped begin recovery efforts in North Carolina.

Butterfield Lays Out 2019 Priorities 
This week, Congressman Butterfield sat down with The News & Observer to discuss his priorities in the new Congress. With Democrats taking the Majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, Butterfield looks forward to advancing key priorities for the benefit of North Carolina's First Congressional District and the American people.

Spectrum News: Should Nancy Pelosi be House Speaker? NC Lawmakers Weigh In  WASHINGTON, D.C. -- With Democrats set to take control of the U.S. House of Representatives in January, lawmakers now need to decide who should serve as speaker. 
Lawmakers have to decide who should serve as Speaker of the House. NC's three Democrats in the House express support for Nancy Pelosi. President Trump has all but endorsed Pelosi.  
All three of North Carolina’s Democrats are expressing support for Nancy Pelosi in her bid to regain the speaker's gavel. 
Congressman GK Butterfield, who represents North Carolina's first district, says that given the contentious climate in Washington, experience is needed. He wants the current leadership team to remain in place. ""We’re going to have to stand up to Donald Trump and the Republicans and we need strong, seasoned experienced leadership,"" he said. ""We don’t need those who come in now to engage in on the job training."" 
WTVD: In DC, Gov. Cooper Pitches Congress, Trump Administration on Hurricane Relief WASHINGTON, D.C. (WTVD) -- North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper visited the nation's capital on Wednesday to rally support for significant federal assistance for recovery from Hurricane Florence. 
In meetings at the Capitol and the White House, Cooper touted North Carolina's own investment in relief efforts to shore up backing for an additional $5 billion.

But during the postgame handshake line, Harris was involved in an altercation that not only ruined his birthday but also wrecked the postseason hopes for both the Demons and the Warriors.

SERVING OUR VETERANS
￼ 
Lindsey - 
This was a truly amazing veterans day. To all our veterans I say: thank you to every single one of you for putting on that uniform and going out there, putting your life on the line for someone else. Whether you’re Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines - thank you for all of your service to our country. 
Following veterans day, this week I helped introduce a bipartisan bill to recognize the service of the over 2 million female veterans in our country. When we made that promise to take care of our veterans, we swore to uphold that promise to all veterans - men and women alike. But unfortunately, there’s no doubt that female veterans still face unique challenges and healthcare needs that the VA has not yet been able to successfully address. Fixing this critical failure starts at the top, and our bill to change the mission statement of the VA to be more inclusive is a needed first step. 
I also know personally that when I deployed to Afghanistan and was injured, it wasn’t just a challenge for me, but it deeply impacted my wife and our entire family. That's why our bill also acknowledges the ongoing needs of families, caregivers and survivors.

EOD Day on the Hill
This week, the EOD Caucus – chaired by Rep. Brian Mast (FL), Rep. Susan Davis (CA), Rep. Tim Walz (MN), and me – hosted our annual EOD Day on the Hill. This event showcases and honors the amazing work of our military bomb techs. In the seven years we have had this event, this was the largest crowd yet. I was excited to see everyone together recognizing the amazing men and women who serve in the EOD.   I co-founded the EOD Caucus when I was first elected to Congress with the goal of educating Members of Congress about the EOD's role in keeping our troops safe abroad and supporting law enforcement stateside. Each year, I believe we move forward in achieving that goal and I am pleased to work with my colleagues to advance priorities to bolster and support the mission of EOD.

Arkansas Democrat Gazette
Cuba Libre!
U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford, who represents most Arkansas farmers in the Delta, recently spoke up on this issue, tweeting, ""The embargo against Cuba has been in effect for almost 6 decades and has done little to achieve its purpose of weakening the repressive Cuban government. It's time we stop denying our farmers access to the Cuban market.""
He has a point. This country has tried to isolate Cuba's government and embargo it to death, but still it remains. What, pray tell, is the benefit of continuing the embargo? Arkansans certainly aren't getting anything out of this outdated policy.

U.S. agriculture coalition meets in Havana despite Trump crackdown
HAVANA, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Representatives of U.S. agribusiness, the farming lobby and related industries opened a three-day conference in Cuba on Thursday aimed at increasing sales and cooperation with a country that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly lambasted and promised to tighten sanctions on.

McKinley Talks Outlook, Priorities For Coal
This week I spoke to a board meeting of American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity to talk about the outlook for coal in the next two years. We touched on priorities, including protecting resiliency of the grid, spurring energy innovation, and confirming judges that will interpret - not make - the law. We need to continue pushing the administration to finalize the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, prevent the premature retirement of coal plants, and incentivize technology to extend the life of plants. This is imperative as the closure of coal plants are a national security and economic threat.

New Leadership At NETL
We congratulate WVU’s Brian Anderson, who was named Director of the National Energy Technology Laboratory. NETL’s mission is vital to America’s energy future. We have worked with Brian over the years, and are confident NETL will continue as a leader in energy innovation under his leadership. 
Brian not only brings stellar academic credentials to the position, but he also understands the intersection of government, academia, and industry better than most. It is very exciting to have a West Virginia native who is committed to the Mountain State in this role. We look forward to continuing our work with NETL and Brian.  Click here to read more

McKinley Continues Prison Reform Discussion

As Congress considers legislation for prison reform, I will continue to support the guards who risk their lives every day to protect us from danger.  Click here to read more

Q&A: Thanksgiving Message
Q. How does Iowa rank for civic engagement? Q. What federal programs are in place to support foster kids and promote adoptions? 
Quick Links
The Senate Republican majority of the upcoming 116th Congress unanimously nominated me to serve as Senate pro tempore, a position that has historically been bestowed upon the most senior member of the majority party in the upper chamber of Congress. This is an honor for me and the state of Iowa. The President pro tempore is one of a handful of offices specifically named by the Founders in the Constitution. I may only be three heartbeats away from the Oval Office, but my heart is and always will be in Iowa and here in the U.S. Senate, where I’ve worked for the people of Iowa and our nation for 38 years.
In January, when committees are organized, I will opt to serve as chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance during the 116th Congress. The economy is better than it’s been in years and there’s a sense of optimism about the future of our country that people haven’t felt in a long time thanks to the pro-growth policies of a Republican President and a Republican majority in Congress. Looking ahead, at the Finance Committee, I want to continue to work to make sure that as many Americans as possible get to experience this good economy for themselves. 
Senator Durbin of Illinois and I sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services calling for the implementation of proposed regulations requiring pharmaceutical companies to list prices of their prescription drugs in direct-to-consumer advertisements. Requiring price disclosure when pharmaceutical companies choose to advertise their medications directly to consumers is a bipartisan, commonsense strategy to boost competition and help Americans struggling with high drug costs.  
A group of bipartisan colleagues and I introduced legislation to reduce crime, promote public safety and improve fairness in sentencing of federal crimes. The First Step Act, which has been endorsed by President Trump, is a landmark opportunity to increase fairness in prison sentencing and improve safety in American communities by helping inmates bound for release become productive members of society. With the President's support, Congress has a real opportunity to make these important reforms a reality before the end of the year.
The results of the Department of Defense's full financial audit are dissapointing, but not surprising. For decades, I’ve pressed the department to fix its broken accounting systems, get its wasteful spending under control and produce a clean audit – a task every federal agency except the Department of Defense has been able to accomplish. I’ve requested additional follow up from the office of Chief Financial Officer Norquist to learn more details about the audit results. I also want to ask specific questions about what changes the agency will make to solve the problems facing the Pentagon and how those changes will be implemented.
Post of the Week

Congratulations to my friend & colleague Senator Ernst on being elected to majority leadership as Vice Chair. She will serve Senate Republicans superbly just as she serves Iowans.

ALERT: Unhealthy Air Quality


￼
Dear San Franciscan, 
The hearts of every Californian and all Americans are heavy for the victims and families of all those impacted by the devastating wildfires burning throughout our state.  As we grieve for those we have lost and pray that all those still in danger remain safe, my office is ready to help you and your family stay safe as our city experiences very unhealthy air quality due to the destructive wildfires. 
The San Francisco Unified School District has canceled class today as a result of the deteriorating air quality both inside and outside schools. The University of San Francisco, San Francisco State University, and City College of San Francisco have also closed down campuses. The San Francisco Metropolitan Transit Authority shut down all cable cars; bus shuttles will replace those lines. Muni is free today so riders can escape the poor air quality. 
Air Quality Update: 
Current Status (as of ­­­­­­­­­­­­Friday, November 16 at 5:00 AM PDT): 
Air quality is currently at the Very Unhealthy level due to the Camp Fire. People with heart or lung disease, older adults, and children should avoid all physical activity outdoors. Everyone else should avoid prolonged or heavy exertion. Text your zip code to 888-777 to receive real-time emergency alerts.  
￼￼ 
PLEASE NOTE: The use of N95 masks are no substitute for staying indoors. If you must absolutely be outside, and choose to wear a N95 mask, it needs to be fit tested or at the very minimum, fit well with no gaps and be replaced when airflow becomes restricted. N95 masks can be sourced at local hardware stores. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends users to switch out an N95 mask for a new one after eight hours of continuous or intermittent use.  
Contact your health care provider if you experience the following symptoms:        • Repeated coughing      • Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing      • Wheezing      • Chest tightness or pain      • Palpitations      • Nausea or unusual fatigue      • Lightheadedness 
For those whose indoor air quality is inadequate, please refer to the map below for public spaces you can go to escape the unhealthy air quality. More information can be found here.  
￼ 
Stay up to date with the following links: 
	•	Visit sfdph.org  for public heath information related to air quality. 
	•	Visit airnow.gov for current and forecasted air quality conditions in the Bay Area.
	•	Visit baaqmd.gov for forecasted wind and smoke directions via the Wildfire Smoke Advisory.
Please take every safety precaution to protect your health and that of your loved ones. Limit outdoor activities and stay indoors as much as possible, in addition to keeping your windows closed. 
The people of California deserve to know that Congress will be there for them now and throughout the long road to recovery.  We will stand with the families and communities devastated by this disaster, and work tirelessly to help Californians stay safe, heal and recover.

Dear Friend,   
Last week, Americans elected a record 88 new members to the U.S. House of Representatives – the constitutionally mandated body charged with representing Americans across all walks of life.  There are also a record number of women representing millions of constituents, comprising 21% of both chambers of Congress, the highest on record. 
Throughout these past few months, the electoral cycle challenged our country.  As a people, we have been more introspective and intensive this year than perhaps we have been in a long time.  From healthcare to immigration policy, to jobs and trade, candidates seeking public office asked incredibly diverse constituencies to consider the significance of these issues in their own lives.
In the Capitol, the House of Representatives met from 1807 until 1857 in what is now called Statuary Hall.  In the floor, small placards mark the spot of the desks of former Members of Congress who became President.  In the bustle of a busy day, it's easy to casually go by the places of the heroic figures of our Republic.  Abraham Lincoln served briefly in the House.  Reflecting upon his own short term in the House as undistinguished, the future President also noted the impression made upon him by the constant speeches about the evils of slavery by an elder statesman named John Quincy Adams.   
President John Quincy Adams is the only member of Congress to be elected after he had been President.  After a long career as a diplomat, then President, he considered his final post in the House of Representatives as his favorite.  He died in office in 1848.  The couch where he died is still in an adjoining room.  The abstract idea of America's early years is made real inside the busy walls of the Capitol.  
As I hurried through Statuary Hall this week for a vote, the scene was much different.  The violinists of the Marine Corps Orchestra lined the walls of the room playing a beautiful melody.  The place where the television crews do their interviews was replaced by a welcoming table with a magnificent spray of roses.  Formal dining tables were set up to seat the Americans who have been newly chosen by the citizens to be their representatives for the next two years.  
This fanfare, this formality, this dignity is something called tradition.  It bridges the past and present, it reminds us of the sacrifice of those before us, and marks-with honor-the demand of the responsibility to govern.  Throughout this week, new members have arrived, met with reporters, interviewed future staffers, and vied for various important committee assignments.  For a moment, there’s a palpable spirit of collegiality towards one another that most Americans cannot see.  I have been congratulated over and over by colleagues and seen others with profoundly different perspectives hug to say good-bye.
The real work commences again shortly, requiring the will to solve our country’s gravest problems, free from the agonizing aggressiveness of political campaigns.  For a moment, the pride and unique privilege of being accorded the public trust creates an excitement of renewed possibility.   
But I've seen it before: Collegiality will quickly fade to divisiveness.  Consensus will not be aplenty.  The extremes will seek their pounds of flesh with extreme vengeance.  The business of Congress should not be a 24/7 four-alarm fire, yet media and social media have engendered a climate of anxiety and unyielding partisanship.  It is this that we must resist.  
What I can promise is that I will work to advance legislation on our most pressing needs, on health, conservation, national security, and food security.  I will ensure that our troops in the field and veterans at home get the support they need.  I will support judicious infrastructure projects vital to the nation.  Above all, I will continue the work to protect the dignity of all persons and just governance for all people.  To find our unity in diversity.  
  Sincerely, ￼  Congressman Jeff Fortenberry

Weekly Update From Congresswoman Anna G. Eshoo 
The U.S. House of Representatives resumed its session this week following the October recess. It was an exciting week, welcoming all the new Members-elect who came to Washington for their Freshman Orientation. As of today we have 89 new members-elect, including 35 women, bringing the total number of women in the U.S. House of Representatives to over 100 for the first time in American history.  
Highlights of Legislation the House Took up This Week 
Passed H.Res. 1138, Condemning the Anti-Semitic Attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh 
On October 27th eleven people were gunned down as they prayed at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Synagogues are holy places of worship and this attack was especially shocking because they were massacred by an anti-Semite, white nationalist. This is the single largest attack on the Jewish community in the history of our country. 
This week the House passed a Resolution that condemns this anti-Semitic attack, honors the memories of the victims, and offers condolences to and expresses support for their families, friends and community. It’s an honor to cosponsor this Resolution but we must do more. I hope this tragedy will lead Congress to take sensible steps to address the role of weapons in civil society. As many unspeakable tragedies illustrate, our country is long overdue for meaningful action in this area.
Legislation Anna Introduced and Cosponsored this Week 
Introduced Legislation to Help Non-Profit Veterans Organizations Qualify for 501(c)19 Tax Exempt Status  
On Veterans Day we paused to salute the brave men and women who have served our country, protecting and defending freedom and democracy. Because of their many sacrifices, veterans and members of the Armed Forces deserve nothing less than our ongoing commitment to care for their needs both during and after their service to our country.
I introduced legislation this week that will make it easier for non-profit veterans organizations to qualify for 501(c)19 tax exempt status. Currently, veterans’ organizations can qualify for this tax-exempt status if at least 75 percent of their members are veterans. Some organizations have lost their tax-exempt status and been forced to shut down as elderly members pass away. My legislation changes this requirement to allow the spouses, widows, or widowers of a veteran to count toward this eligibility requirement. The spouses of our veterans have made tremendous sacrifices and are often deeply involved in the work of these groups. My legislation will ensure organizations that are dedicated to improving the wellbeing of veterans can continue their critical work without the fear of losing this important tax exemption.
Cosponsored H.R. 7052, the No Federal Funds for Public Charge Act 
Last month the Trump Administration issued a cruel rule expanding the number of immigrants who could be considered a “public charge” when applying for entry to the U.S. or for a green card. Immigrants who are in the U.S. legally are only considered public charges if they receive cash welfare assistance or federal long-term care assistance. The new rule expands this to include: Medicaid; federal housing and rental vouchers; Medicare Part D coverage for prescription drugs; and SNAP. When a legal immigrant is considered a public charge, it counts heavily against their applications for green cards.
I’m opposed to this rule because it unfairly targets immigrants and will be detrimental to public health. I cosponsored legislation this week that prohibits funds from being used to implement this rule. 
Signed an Amicus Brief in National Monuments Case 
Last year the President dramatically shrunk the size of Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah. This move put millions of acres of public lands and resources in danger. Although the Antiquities Act gives the President the authority to declare new national monuments, it is silent on whether they can revoke or resize them. 
In response to the President’s actions, several environmental groups filed a lawsuit in federal court. Together with several House colleagues, we signed onto an Amicus Brief in support of their efforts. The brief argues that while Congress delegated to the President the power to declare national monuments, the power to rescind or resize them is a separate power that Congress did not grant.  It’s critical that the courts affirm that the President’s attempt to resize these monuments is illegal because he could very well target others to shrink as well. 
Letters Anna Wrote and Cosigned this Week 
Letter to the House and Senate Appropriations Committee Supporting Security Grants for Houses of Worship 
The recent domestic terror attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was the third mass shooting at a house of worship in the past three years, and the deadliest against the Jewish community in the history of our country. Sadly, there’s also been an upward trend in anti-Semitism and hate crimes in our country.
I recently joined several House colleagues in writing to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees urging them to provide $60 million for the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Nonprofit Security Grant Program in 2019. This program provides grants to nonprofits, including places of worship, to invest in security enhancements such as access controls and surveillance equipment to protect organizations at risk of a terrorist attack. 
Letter to the National Cancer Institute on Recalcitrant Cancers Act Implementation 
This week we recognized World Pancreatic Cancer Day which unites communities around the world to raise global awareness of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the only major cancer in the U.S. with a five-year survival rate for only 9 percent of those diagnosed, and it’s on track to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in our country by 2020. My 2012 law, the Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act requires the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to examine its current research efforts on cancers with very low survival rates, including pancreatic cancer, and work to develop early detection methods and better treatment options to improve outcomes.
This week I joined Senator Whitehouse, my Senate cosponsor of this legislation in writing to the National Cancer Institute commending them for their work and also urging them to consider future investments and recommendations to continue to advance the field of pancreatic cancer research. To read the full letter, CLICK HERE.  
In the Words of My Constituents 
Every week hundreds of my constituents call and write to me to express their concerns, share their passions and ask questions regarding a wide range of legislation and policies. I actually read every communication and every constituent receives a personal response from me regarding their specific questions and comments.
Here’s a snapshot of the issues constituents wrote and called me about this week:    
·         228 constituents wrote to me to express their concern about Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ resignation and express their support for protecting Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. 
·         40 constituents wrote to me to express their support of reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
·         103 constituents wrote to me in support of the Raise the Wage Act, which raises the minimum wage to $15.00 by 2024.
Weekly Highlights 
￼ 
This week I was honored to attend the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship Reception to present the Ellen Stovall Award for Innovation in Patient-Centered Cancer Care to my Saratoga constituent Gay Crawford, an extraordinary advocate and cancer survivor.
Over her 40 years of advocacy, Gay has established many cancer programs in Silicon Valley, including: Hospice of the Valley – the second non-profit hospice in California; Courageous   Kids – an American Cancer Society program for children with cancer; the California Cancer Registry; the Colon Cancer Free Zone; and most recently Cancer CAREpoint, the only community-based organization in Silicon Valley providing direct services to anyone impacted by cancer regardless of the type of cancer, location of treatment or ability to pay.
  
￼ 
I was invited to speak at the Bloomberg Government Next.2018 Conference this week where we discussed ways to bridge the gap between Capitol Hill and Silicon Valley. We also discussed the role social media played in the Tree of Life Synagogue mass shooting and what can be done to prevent another such tragedy. The discussion was about social media platforms and how to ensure that they’re not being used to organize and incite violence that targets innocent people and communities.
Announcements from Anna 
Medicare Open Enrollment 
Medicare open enrollment is upon us! Seniors who are 65 and older can enroll in Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage for the first time. This is the only time that today’s beneficiaries can review their coverage and change prescription drug plans. It’s very important that beneficiaries review their coverage now so that their plan will continue working for them in the coming year.
To enroll, you can call Medicare at 1-800-MEDICARE or visit Medicare.gov. You can also visit Medicare’s Plan Finder at Medicare.gov/find-a-plan, which provides details on the prescription drug plans available in your area. If you encounter any problems, call our Palo Alto Office at (650) 323-2984.
Medicare Advantage Plans in Santa Cruz County 
Good news for my constituents in Santa Cruz County! Starting on January 1, 2019, two providers will be offering Medicare Advantage plans in Santa Cruz County. Kaiser Permanente will cover Santa Cruz County residents 65 and older who are eligible for Medicare with ""Senior Advantage Santa Cruz."" 
Also starting in 2019, United Healthcare will offer ""AARP Medicare Secure Horizons,"" which are Medicare Advantage plans, to Santa Cruz residents 65 and older. 
These changes will affect 43,000 people (16% of the County’s population) who had no Medicare Advantage choices this year.
Anna’s Recommended Reading 
I frequently read articles or see videos I think my constituents would benefit from.   
Washington Post Op-Ed (11/12/2018) “In California, moments that test you under fire” 
This Op-Ed describes the fires ravaging in Northern and Southern California that have taken the lives of over 60 people and displaced thousands. In moments where it seems the world has turned upside down, this author highlights how communities have come together to help one another like never before.
Washington Post Op-Ed (11/13/2018) “To the mother of the gunshot victim I couldn’t save” 
This heartbreaking Op-Ed by a trauma surgeon in Maryland is written as a letter to the mother of a gunshot victim she could not save. She writes that removing certain types of guns and regulating the use of others will go a long way toward reducing the number of deaths related to gun violence.

BRINGING AWARENESS TO END DIABETES
￼ 
Dear Lindsey, 

November is diabetes awareness month and on Nov. 14 I wore blue to show my support for the millions of people who are suffering from this disease.

Diabetes is an urgent health problem in many Latino families, including my own. My mom is diabetic and that’s why this disease is so personal to me. Did you know that Latinos are 2x more likely to be diagnosed than non-Hispanic whites? Let’s work to end racial health disparities once and for all.

Together, we can help fight this epidemic.

In Community,

Dear  , 
It was a busy first week back in Washington following the historic midterm elections. Here’s a quick update on what I’ve been working on this week. 

Assistance for Veterans Seeking GI Bill Benefits 
Recent technology failures at the Department of Veterans Affairs have led to some veterans experiencing difficulties accessing their GI Bill benefits. According to testimony by VA officials in the House this week, thousands of veterans are currently waiting 30 days or more – in some cases, more than 90 days – to get their GI Bill education benefits. This is simply unacceptable, and I will continue to support efforts to ensure that the VA address this issue without delay. 
In the meantime, my office has already helped multiple veterans in this situation. If you are veteran or know a veteran who is experiencing delays in receiving GI Bill benefit payments, my office may be able to help. Give us a call at 860-886-0139 and ask to speak with our Veterans Caseworker, Manny Meneses.

Working to Reduce Violence Against Health Care & Social Service Workers 
Today, I was proud to introduce the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act, a bill that works to reduce violence against the workers in these industries. Every day, communities across our country receive services and dedicated care from health care and social service employees. In 2013, after hearing about tragic incidents of violence against health care workers, I requested that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) study the trends in workplace violence within these industries, as well as proposed action to curtail it. Thanks to the 2016 GAO report that was issued following my request, what we know now is that incidents of violence against these men and women appear at a rate 12 times higher than the rates for the overall workforce, and the rates continue to rise.  
This workplace violence prevention bill compels the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to do what employees, safety experts, and members of Congress have been calling for over many years – create an enforceable standard to ensure that employers are taking these risks seriously, and promoting the safe workplaces that their employees deserve.

Congress is shirking its duties in Yemen 
On Wednesday, I spoke on the House floor after Republican leaders in the House used a procedural gimmick to deny Congress the chance to debate H.Con.Res.138, a measure which would end U.S. participation in the Saudi-led coalition’s intervention in the Yemen Civil War. As an original cosponsor of this resolution and a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I feel strongly that this resolution deserves debate, and Congress should not be shirking its duty as a co-equal branch of government to act as a check on the executive branch. In the words of T.S. Eliot’s “The Hollow Men”, the 115th Congress is ending “not with a bang, but a whimper.”

Progress for the National Coast Guard Museum  
I have been working hard with my colleagues in the House to ensure the National Coast Guard Museum project in New London receives the bipartisan Congressional support it requires to bolster its production. Under a federal law passed in 2004, the Coast Guard is largely prohibited from using its federal funding to support the design and construction of the museum. However in 2016, I helped to successfully pass legislation to change this law and allow the Coast Guard to fund the development of exhibits at the museum, helping preserve critical artifacts from the service’s long history. Additionally, in 2017, I worked with Senator Murphy to help provide the first $5 million in federal funding to fulfill this new authority.  
This week marked another important step by Congress in supporting the museum. On Wednesday, the Senate passed the Coast Guard Authorization Act which, among other things, further expands the law to allow federal support for design and engineering of the New London museum. As I told the New London Day this week, this bill, which I initially helped pass the House in May, sends another powerful signal about Congress’s continued support for the museum.

Burr Leads Bipartisan Coalition Providing Tax Relief for Disaster Victims
Two months after Hurricane Florence devastated the Carolina coast, many are still struggling to rebuild their communities. I am committed to doing everything I can to make sure that North Carolinians continue to get the federal support they need during this long and difficult process.
This week, I led a bipartisan group of Senators in introducing a bill that will provide much needed tax relief for victims of Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael and the wildfires in California who have seen their homes destroyed, businesses swept away and savings wiped out. Our legislation provides several important tax breaks for eligible individuals and businesses that will help lessen the burdens they face and allow them to rebuild their futures. Working with my Senate colleagues from North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, and California, it is my hope that our bill will be considered and passed as soon as possible.
I also joined Senators Thom Tillis, Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott to thank Senate appropriators for the initial $1.68 billion in disaster relief funding allocated in October. We worked quickly to secure a down payment to help those hurting the most. There is still more to be done, however, and we announced our intention to request more disaster relief funding in the coming weeks. You can read our letter here.
I will be keeping those impacted by Hurricane Florence in my thoughts and prayers this Thanksgiving. As folks across the state make their way home to spend time with their families and loved ones next week, I want to wish everyone a safe and happy holiday. I’ll enjoy getting to spend some time with my wife, my children, and my grandchildren, and I’m always thankful for their love and support. I am also thankful for the privilege of representing the great state of North Carolina in the United States Senate. God Bless and Happy Thanksgiving.

 NY Republican: GOP Lawmakers to back Pelosi for Speaker if she backs rules reforms- The Hill
Pelosi's Quest to Be Speaker Hits `Uh-Oh' Moment Amid Opposition- Bloomberg  Rep. Tom Reed: Problem Solvers may hold power in House Speaker post- Olean Times Herald 
Brian Higgins won't vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker – but Tom Reed might- Buffalo News

Dear Neighbor,
Americans are fed up with the partisan bickering and the desire to make it easier for bipartisan bills to pass the House is gaining momentum. However, to do so we must change the House rules for the first time in decades.
And as I have said many times before, I will only support a candidate for Speaker if they agree to the rules reforms.
As of now, the total number of Problem Solvers Caucus members who have pledged to withhold their vote for Speaker is 21 unless rule changes are agreed to.
And with no Speaker candidate in place with a coalition of 218 votes needed to obtain the gavel, the Problem Solvers Caucus is seeing an increasingly large amount of leverage to change the rules.
Problem Solvers Caucus members held a very positive meeting this week with Speaker candidate Pelosi to discuss these rule reforms, and we look forward to continuing these discussions.
And as negotiations continue for Speaker, House Republicans voted earlier this week for our leadership in the 116th Congress, and I am happy to say I voted to elect Rep. Kevin McCarthy as our Minority Leader and Rep. Steve Scalise as our Minority Whip.
As always, if you are looking for assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to any of our offices. Our doors are always open.
Until next time,
 Tom

11/16/18 18:30,The honor of a lifetime.,"￼
This afternoon, the President presented me with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor. As a scrappy young boy who came up in poverty, I never could have dreamed of seeing this day. To be recognized in such a manner was the highlight of a lifetime. 
￼ 
Photos via Twitter 
According to the White House  press release , President Trump awarded me the Medal of Freedom in recognition of my successful service as a legislator, having sponsored more bills that have become law than any living member of Congress. The award also recognizes my efforts to “champion religious liberty, fight against communism, and stand on the side of freedom around the world.”
The Presidential Medal of Freedom “may be awarded by the President to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.” I am truly flattered to be counted among this group, but I can’t take credit to myself. That’s why I accepted this award on behalf of the people of Utah. Without you, I could have accomplished nothing. The landmark reforms that I passed in Congress have always been a joint effort—drafted by me under constant guidance from my friends in the Beehive State. In that sense, the legislative legacy I leave behind is not mine but ours.
￼ 
Click here for a video from President Trump about the ceremony. 
Justice Antonin Scalia, Babe Ruth, Elvis Presley, Roger Staubach, Alan Page, and Miriam Adelson, were also recognized at today’s ceremony.  Click here  to watch the event. Even long after I have left the Senate, I will continue striving to work for the betterment of Utah and the nation.  
Sincerely,
  ￼ 
Orrin

Congratulations

Elections are over and I would like to congratulate Governor Ralph Torres, Lt. Governor-elect Arnold Palacios, and everyone who was voted into office on Tuesday. We may have been competitors, but now the people of the Marianas have decided they want us to work together in the best interests of our islands. The Governor and all our elected officials have my pledge to listen to that decision, especially in the face of the work we need to do to recover from typhoons Mangkhut and Yutu.
 

Yutu recovery updates
 

The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced new business hours (see above) for its Disaster Recovery Centers. The Saipan DRC moved to the Multi-Purpose Center on Friday. And the Rota DRC will close permanently at 6pm on Wednesday, November 21. But help will still be available through disasterassistance.gov and the FEMA helpline: 800-621-3362. 
 
 

U.S. workers who became unemployed or underemployed as a direct result of Typhoon Yutu may now apply for Disaster Unemployment Assistance through the CNMI Department of Labor. Claimants must present proof of eligibility and evidence of earnings. Applying in person is recommended. 
 
 

The U.S. Small Business Administration’s Business Recovery Center on Saipan is open 8am to 4pm, Monday to Saturday, at Marianas Business Plaza. SBA representatives are also available to meet with business owners and residents at FEMA’s Disaster Recovery Centers. On Friday, November 23, SBA will open a disaster loan outreach center at the Rota Mayor's Office. 
 

Transitional Shelters
Shelters in Saipan remain open with 698 occupants.

Food
The American Red Cross’ prepared meals will end on Saturday, November 24. The Commonwealth is developing a six-week pantry box project that will enable survivors to prepare their own meals.

Tenting program
To date, 296 tents have been installed on Saipan and 203 tents on Tinian.

Water
FEMA reports that the Commonwealth Utilities Corporation has restored 82 of 130 water wells as of Friday evening Chamorro time.

The CNMI government will distribute bottled drinking water at Koblerville Youth Center on Saturday, November 17 from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Each household can have up to two five-gallon bottles. Private businesses assisting with recovery efforts will also be there to hand out free ice - up to two 10-pound bags per vehicle or up to two 10-pound bags per walk-in.

On Sunday, November 18, CUC will close all but one water filling station on Saipan. The Koblerville Water Station on Tinaktak Drive will remain open from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. daily until further notice.

Health
CHCC’s DanDan satellite clinic (across CUC’s parking lot) will be open November 18 from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. and November 19 to 21 from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Available services include urgent care, first aid, vaccines, and triage. The San Antonio Clinic will remain closed as the Systems of Care program prepares to resume services. WIC clinic hours remain open Monday to Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The Saturday clinic will resume in December. Tinian Health Clinic Emergency Room is operational but remains on generator power.

Transportation
Saipan airport began allowing entry to a limited number of commercial flights as of November 15. Normal operational hours will resume on November 20. The Tinian Airport continues to operate on generator power.

Schools
Tinian elementary, junior-senior high school, and the Head Start program will reopen on Monday, November 26. All other schools and programs on Saipan and Tinian are expected to resume on December 3. Some will be on a double session schedule with instructional time set at four hours for each session. Some schools may be relocated or share campuses. Public schools in Rota continue normal operations.

Northern Marianas College announced the target date for the continuation of classes is December 3 for afternoon and evening classes. The date may be adjusted depending upon conditions.

Communications
Cell service on Saipan is at 83 percent operational. Tinian cell is at 50 percent operational.
 

$1.6m for Yutu recovery

$1,632,500 has been awarded to the Northern Marianas to aid in disaster recovery efforts, Interior’s Office of Insular Affairs announced on Wednesday. $1 million in Capital Improvement Program funds will be used to erect temporary classroom pods while PSS rebuilds their classrooms, and $632,500 in Technical Assistance funds will provide displaced families emergency shelter stations equipped with disaster-related supplies. Congress appropriated $18 million in Technical Assistance funds to the Department of Interior in FY18—an increase of $1.2 million over FY17—to allow for this kind of response to any special needs that arise in the insular areas during the course of the fiscal year.
 

Protecting our islands

Protecting our islands from the increased frequency and intensity of typhoons and other environmental harms associated with global warming is one of my priorities in Congress. So, this week I joined with 112 of my House colleagues in a letter to EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler urging a reversal of the Trump Administration’s decision to do away with the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which has been successful in reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global climate change. Our letter was endorsed by the American Lung Association, the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters, GreenLatinos, and Earthjustice. 
 

Agent Orange report inconclusive

In April 2017, Representatives Madeleine Z. Bordallo (D-Guam), Ron DeSantis (R-Florida) and I enlisted the Government Accountability Office to investigate concern about exposure to the Agent Orange defoliant widely used by the U.S. in the Vietnam War. We wanted to know where the U.S. stored, transferred, and used Agent Orange or its components and of any associated site contamination in the U.S. and its territories. The GAO report released Thursday found that nearly all of the Agent Orange procured by the U.S. was either used in military operations or destroyed. However, shipping documentation and logbooks for the time are incomplete. From the available logbooks, GAO identified at least one vessel carrying Agent Orange that stopped at Guam on its way to Vietnam and at least three vessels that stopped at Guam on the return from Vietnam. GAO did not find evidence, however, indicating that any of the tactical herbicides were offloaded or used in the Northern Mariana Islands or Guam. Because GAO was unable to obtain records for every shipment of Agent Orange, they cannot conclude with certainty whether Agent Orange was ever stored or used in the Marianas. DOD, EPA, and Guam EPA are currently conducting Agent Orange testing at Andersen Air Force Base. However, because of the short half-lives of the active chemical components found in Agent Orange, and the multiple sources of dioxins, there is a low probability of making any conclusive findings.

At the Veterans Day Ceremony at NH State Veterans Cemetery 
Dear Lindsey, 
Supporting Those Who Serve 
On Sunday, I was humbled to give remarks at the Veterans Day ceremony at the New Hampshire State Veterans Cemetery and express my gratitude to veterans, active duty servicemembers and military families for their incredible courage, sacrifice and patriotism. However, saying thank you is not enough. I saw my father and father-in-law struggle with the unseen wounds of war following their service in World War II, and I understand how important it is to support veterans and help make their return to civilian life easier. Through my work as a member of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I will continue advocating for veterans here in the Granite State and across the country. We must do everything we can to provide our brave men and women with the services and care they need and deserve. 
Increasing Access to Higher Education 
It was great to join the New Hampshire Higher Education Assistance Foundation (NHHEAF) and the students at Merrimack Valley High School on Tuesday to help kick off this year’s College Application Month. Completing a college application is an important first step in accessing higher education, which is becoming increasingly essential to competing in today’s changing economy and workforce. We must work to make higher education more accessible and affordable for all Granite State students who wish to pursue college. 
￼
Speaking to Merrimack Valley High School students about College Applications
Seeking Justice for Survivors of Domestic and Sexual Violence 
I am very troubled by the proposed changes to Title IX announced today by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. These changes will drastically undermine decades of progress designed to make our schools and campuses safer. Sexual harassment and assault are already one of the most underreported crimes in our society and creating barriers to survivors will only serve to further increase the challenge of seeking justice. I am especially troubled by provisions that permit schools to lower their evidentiary standards as they investigate misconduct claims and set an excessively high bar for defining harassment. Tragically, 1 in 6 women and 1 in 25 men will be sexually assaulted during college, and we should be strengthening rather than undermining these critical protections that help survivors seek the closure they deserve and move forward with their educational aspirations.
This week it was announced that the state of New Hampshire, Grafton County, the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence and the Organization for Refugee and Immigrant Success are receiving grant funds from the United States Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women to help support Granite State survivors and families struggling with domestic and sexual violence. I’ll continue working to combat these pervasive problems and push for a much-needed reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. 
Here to Serve You 
My biggest responsibility in Congress is to serve you, the people of New Hampshire’s Second Congressional District. If you have questions, concerns, or ideas, please do not hesitate to reach out to my Washington, DC office at 202-225-5206 or my Concord office at 603-226-1002. Thank you, as always, for everything you do to help make New Hampshire such a wonderful place to call home. Have a great weekend!

Honoring A Legend

 

This week, I had the privilege, along with my colleagues, of introducing legislation to honor a man who helped changed history. Reverend James Lawson is one of the most consequential Civil Rights leaders in American history.  I along with, Congressmen Ro Khanna, John Lewis, and James Clyburn, introduced legislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the civil rights icon. 
￼
Rev. James Lawson was well known for his non-violent stance which influenced the direction of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. His fingerprints can be found on every major civil rights victory. 
Among his many feats, he trained young protesters and activists and launched the Nashville, Tennessee sit-ins to challenge segregation in downtown stores. He also helped develop the strategy for the Freedom Riders who rode buses in southern states to challenge segregated seating on public buses.  When you look back at the historic videos and see the protesters withstand food thrown in their faces and the vile name-calling, it is hard to watch. But those determined protesters never lifted a hand in anger. Even when they were punched, kicked and pushed their silence and unwavering stand was their way of fighting back.  This was the teaching of Rev. Lawson who spent three years in India as a missionary and studied Mahatma Gandhi’s strategy of nonviolent struggle before returning to the United States.  He became a leader in the Civil Rights movement and worked closely with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to achieve equality through peaceful activism. Dr. King called Lawson the “leading theorist and strategist of nonviolence in the world.”   This year, Rev. Lawson will be celebrating his 90th birthday. I can’t think of anyone more deserving of the distinguished Gold Medal. 
Warmly,
￼
Emanuel Cleaver, II

Friends 
  
Over the weekend I met with so many honorable veterans.  
Each day I'm reminded that the opportunity to represent the great state of Kansas is only possible due to the sacrifices made by those who have and continue to defend our country. Freedom isn't free, and it's paid for daily by our men and women in uniform.
This week on the Hill, Kansas Bank Commissioner Michelle Bowman was confirmed by the Senate to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.  
I have no doubt that Miki will bring the skills and expertise needed to represent and articulate the needs of community banks at the Federal Reserve, and it’s great to have another Kansan in D.C,! 
Read more on her confirmation here.

Honoring our Veterans this week: 
￼
On Sunday , I was proud to stand before the House of Representatives announcing the addition of a fourth stone to the Golden Belt Veterans' Memorial in Barton County. I felt an immense sense of pride to see so many Kansans attend the ceremony to honor our Veterans despite harsh weather conditions.
It was an excellent service, and I was so grateful to be a part of it. I cannot thank our veterans and men and women in uniform enough. 
 
As soon as I got back to D.C., I addressed the House floor to discuss how impactful this ceremony was. To watch click the video above.
On Monday, our Salina and Garden City offices hosted a Veterans Day open house where we discussed ways our office can help our vets and went over information and resources for those working with VA healthcare and benefits programs.
￼

 
During the open house, I had the opportunity to meet several veterans who honorably served our country. Many of which continue to serve their communities through volunteer and leadership roles.
 
The Big First is home to thousands of veterans, many of whom receive their health care and other benefits from the VA. Our offices want to be a resource to our veterans and their families encountering issues with a VA program.

So please, if you are having an issue with a VA or DOD program, please contact Nikki at the Salina office at 785-829-9000.  
On the Hill, in observance of Veterans Day this year the VA decided to recognize all Veterans serving in Congress and on staff with a Veteran’s pin.
￼
I served seven years as an Army Reservist where I helped train a mobile hospital support unit and rose to the rank of Captain. I was especially grateful to receive the 2018 Veterans Day lapel pin. 
  
Deregulatory measures
by this Congress gives families relief 
Before coming to Congress, one of the top concerns voiced by both families as well as businesses was the burden of federal overregulation.   Obamacare increased the cost of healthcare and made it harder for families to access quality care; Dodd-Frank reduced access to capital in rural communities, and thousands of last-minute regulations contributed to more than $40 billion in regulatory compliance and implementation costs.   While some regulations can be positive, it was clear that Washington wasn’t thinking through the real-world implications of these policy decisions. Over the past two years, this Congress and this Administration have worked hard to repeal some of the most burdensome of these regulations.  
 
You can read more about the work we’re doing to help reduce the burdens on Kansas families and businesses here, in my Wichita Eagle op-ed. 

Opportunities between Cuba and the US 
On Tuesday, I met with Ambassador José Cabañas of Cuba, this meeting was following my October meeting with incoming Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel. With the change of regime in Cuba that took place this past spring, the time is right to begin building new relations.
￼
  While he was here, we were able to chat about one of my favorite sports and America’s favorite pastime - baseball which has a rich history amongst Cuban-Americans. Also in this meeting we discussed the benefits of an expanded trade relationship between Cuba and the U.S.   Kansas has the potential to be a vital supplier of commodities to Cuba if the unnecessary, outdated regulations were to be lifted. I have and will continue, to show my support for the removal of the restrictions on trade and travel between Cuba and the U.S. 
Bipartisan health care roundtable
On Wednesday, I co-hosted a bipartisan roundtable with my colleague Congressman Neal Dunn, M.D. on the necessity of basic science research in health care innovation. The roundtable, held by the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, brought together eight experts in various fields of medicine and research to discuss their efforts in improving care and lowering costs. I was glad to see nearly a dozen bipartisan members join us to ask questions and learn more about the benefits of research from the panelists. As the federal government is the nation’s largest supporter of basic research, it’s important to bring their voices to the table so we can continue to collaborate on pressing issues confronting the industry.   I also invited a fellow Kansan, Dr. Scott Weir, to join the panel. As the Director of the Institute for Advancing Medical Innovation at the University of Kansas, Dr. Weir shared the remarkable advances in cancer treatment KU is bringing to the medical community. It was great to see him at the roundtable, and an honor to hear the great work he is doing.  
￼     I walked away from the roundtable feeling inspired by the work these panelists are accomplishing through basic science research, and look forward to remaining a champion for the industry! 
 
The pathway forward in Washington
If we want our Congress to actually come together after and govern for the good of the country, we must go beyond the rules of civility because we need so much more than nice. 
Author and Leadership Coach, Dr. Ramon Corrales, Ph. D and I worked together on an op-ed that outlines the importance of civility and how to make meaningful progress to heal the nation by practicing a higher level of wisdom.

Foxx Report
 
On Tuesday, I cosponsored and called for the vote on H.Res. 1138 to condemn the attack on the Tree of Life synagogue and all forms of anti-Semitism. An evil hatred was at the heart of the crime, and the House passed this resolution by unanimous consent to reject that hatred and remember those who lost their lives while reaffirming the right of Americans to freely exercise their religious beliefs. We remain united in rejecting terror and hate and offer our shared condolences to those who are grieving. The victims, their families and the Jewish community in Pittsburgh remain in my prayers.  CELEBRATING NATIONAL APPRENTICESHIP WEEK
Each of us knows a person with considerable gifts and talents who may not desire traditional postsecondary education. Apprenticeships are an example of one life-changing path that can provide countless Americans with the knowledge and skills they need to achieve lifelong success. For the sixth straight year, skilled trade jobs continue to be the hardest positions to fill all over the world and nearly half of all job creators are struggling to hire employees with the right skills. During this Apprenticeship Week, I highlighted how we at the Committee on Education and the Workforce recognize this and have worked hard this Congress to make skills-based education a viable and valuable path for American workers.

PROTECTING LIFE & RELIGIOUS LIBERTY   Last week, the Trump Administration delivered on its promise to protect freedom of religion or belief, issuing two final rules to expand conscience protections for employers morally opposed to paying for contraception and abortifacients under employer-based health insurance plans. While the former regulation exempted churches and religious orders from the contraceptive mandate under Obamacare, these new finalized rules allow exemptions for non-profits, small businesses and non-government educational institutions who hold religious or moral objections. Entities that object to covering some, but not all, contraceptive items would be exempt with respect to only the methods they conscientiously oppose. Furthermore, the rules leave in place government programs that provide free or subsidized contraceptive coverage to low income women. Americans should never be forced to choose between their religious or moral convictions and using their talents to create jobs and provide goods and services in the public square. These rules provide a fair solution to the overreaching contraceptive mandate. Read more here.  NORTH CAROLINIANS IN THE CAPITOL

National Adoption Day began in 2000 when seven cities opened courtrooms on the Saturday before Thanksgiving to alleviate the backlog of pending adoptions. Since then, more than 65,000 children have had their adoption finalized during a National Adoption Day celebration. The number of North Carolina children in foster care has been increasing with last year totaling nearly 11,000. There are more than 425,000 children in foster care nationwide with over 110,000 awaiting adoption by permanent families. National Adoption Day raises awareness of these children and educates the estimated 47 million Americans who have considered adopting a child in foster care. Click here to learn more about this year's efforts to connect children awaiting adoption with parents who can provide the love and stable environment they need to realize their potential.

WHAT'S COMING UP?

Next week the House will hold a district work period in observance of Thanksgiving. I wish a blessed Thanksgiving to the Fifth District and safe trips to all who are travelling!
Sincerely,

In the Spotlight: Frelinghuysen Honored with Navy's Distinguished Public Service Award Providing Greater Educational Opportunity Department of Energy Makes a Critical Investment at Rutgers Salute: Hudson Maxim Elementary School in Hopatcong  
In the Spotlight: Frelinghuysen Honored with Navy's Distinguished Public Service Award
On Wednesday, I was extremely grateful to receive the United States Navy’s highest civilian honor, the Distinguished Public Service Award.  Secretary of the Navy, Richard Spencer, presented me the award in a ceremony in my Washington office.
I am truly honored to receive the Navy's Distinguished Public Service Award. Supporting our sailors and Marines — past and present — has been, and will always remain, a priority for me.
The citation from Secretary Spencer states: “For exceptional service to the Department of the Navy as a member of Congress and the House Appropriations Committee. Representative Frelinghuysen’s dedicated service to our Sailors and Marines ensured they were provided the resources necessary to support and defend the Nation’s interests around the globe. His strong leadership as chairman of the Defense Subcommittee and later chairman of the full Appropriations Committee ensured the Navy — Marine Corps team remains the most capable force in history. Through his tireless efforts, he guaranteed the highest levels of sustainability for our combat forces and enhanced the quality of life for the men and women of the Department of the Navy. With grateful appreciation for his 24 years of public service to the Nation and for his outstanding contributions to the Navy and Marine Corps, the Honorable Rodney Frelinghuysen is awarded the Department of the Navy's Distinguished Public Service Award.”
The Navy Distinguished Public Service Award, established in 1951, is an award presented by the U.S. Secretary of the Navy to civilians for “specific courageous or heroic acts or exceptionally outstanding service of substantial and long-term benefit to the Navy, Marine Corps, or Department of the Navy as a whole.”
 
Providing Greater Educational Opportunity
Over the years, I have been a proud leader in the fight for school “choice” — giving families greater freedom to escape poorly performing schools.  I am committed to working to provide parents with a choice in their child’s education in New Jersey and across the U.S. 
Almost twenty years ago, I helped create a successful private school scholarship program in the District of Columbia. Through the creation of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP), doors have been opened for parents to rescue their children from failing schools and gave them an opportunity to place their children in an environment where every child is encouraged to achieve success.
This critical program, which has received consistent funding, year after year, through the House Committee on Appropriations, provides low-income students an opportunity to receive a scholarship to attend a DC private school of their parent’s choice. Since the enactment of the legislation, the number of DC students in Charter Schools has expanded to 42,000 students or 47% of the total student population of Washington, D.C.! 
Today, the OSP is working for these students. An evaluation of the program, published by the Department of Education, found that participating students graduated at a rate 21 percentage points higher than their peers.
While this program affects families in our nation's capital, it should be an option for families in every state. I believe that with these scholarships, DC showed that there was an effective way to provide educational opportunity for disadvantaged children in poverty and empower their parents with choices.
 
Department of Energy Makes a Critical Investment at Rutgers 
Earlier this week, Rutgers University, the State University of New Jersey, was awarded $2.9 million by the DOE’s Advanced Research Projects Agency — Energy (ARPA-E).
ARPA-E recently provided dozens of financial assistance awards to worthy recipients totaling $98 million. These awards will support research and development into advanced energy technologies to transform the nation’s energy system. Specifically, the Rutgers award will support “Microbial Curing of Cement for Energy Applications”
This funding will help our state continue its long history of scientific leadership and support efforts to promote energy security and economic growth throughout the nation.
These awards were funded by the Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Omnibus Appropriations Act, which I authored and was signed into law in March. The legislation provided $353 million for ARPA-E. The President’s Budget had proposed eliminating this funding. The FY19 Energy and Water Appropriations bill, which the House passed and the President signed into law on September 21, continues this funding level for ARPA-E, which the President had again proposed eliminating. 
 
Salute: Hudson Maxim Elementary School in Hopatcong
This week we salute the first graders, and their teacher Doreen Sciabica, at Hudson Maxim Elementary School who helped create a quilt that will be gifted to a veteran in need through the Quilts of Valor Foundation.
It is never too early to teach our children about the sacrifices our men and women in uniform make to keep us free. I praise these students for their efforts to bring comfort and healing to a veteran! 
You can read more in Jennifer Jean Miller’s article that ran in the New Jersey Herald.

Dear Friend,
Congress reconvened this week amidst a wave of change. Democrats will soon control the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years, providing a much-needed check on President Trump’s harmful agenda. But a Democratic majority in the House won’t only be doing damage control; my colleagues and I want to pass meaningful legislation that helps working families and highlight priorities neglected and undermined over the last two years.
Achieving these goals can only happen with strong leadership. That’s why I’m running to serve in the new Congress as the Democratic Whip, the third-ranking House Democrat. With a diverse caucus, we need a whip with the skills and experience to build coalitions and win votes. My track record of developing, drafting and whipping landmark bills proves I have the background that the Democratic caucus needs for this job and at this moment. Read my letter announcing my candidacy by clicking here.   
The 116th Congress, fueled by greater diversity and a commitment to good governance, has the potential to achieve big things. I congratulate the newly elected members from both parties and look forward to working with all of my House colleagues to help make the American dream achievable for all. 
 ￼ 
There was positive change elsewhere this week. On Thursday, the FDA announced they are restricting the sale of flavored e-cigarettes at gas stations and convenience stores. I applaud this action, which comes not a moment too soon. A whole new generation is being exposed to nicotine through these products, whose appealing flavors attract a large number of children and teenagers. Ultimately, we must go further by banning the sale of all flavored e-cigarettes and cigars, which I demanded in a letter I sent to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb earlier this year. Better yet, Congress should also pass my Tobacco to 21 Act (H.R.4273), which will safeguard the health of even more of our kids.
I’m also continuing to fight back against the Trump Administration’s assault on the environment. On Thursday, my colleagues and I sent a letter to EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler demanding he reverse the agency’s reckless effort to replace the Clean Power Plan. This Obama-era initiative would have put our country on the right track to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and leading the world in the fight against climate change. The proposed replacement, the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, is a giant step backward, like so much else coming from this administration. 
￼  
I want to remind you that Open Enrollment season is underway, your chance to secure quality and affordable health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Between now and January 15, Coloradans can visit connectforhealthco.com to easily shop for plans. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to achieve better health and security for you and your family.   
￼ 
And on Wednesday, we observed World Diabetes Day. This year’s theme was “The Family and Diabetes,” a reminder that this condition affects not only those living with diabetes, but their loved ones as well. One notable example is the financial impact on families caused by skyrocketing insulin costs. They need relief, which is why my Diabetes Caucus Co-Chair, Rep. Tom Reed (R-NY), and I conducted an extensive investigation into this troubling trend. We must continue doing all we can to raise awareness and fight for cures on behalf of every person affected by diabetes.

WEEK IN REVIEW 
￼
To start off this week's From the Front... I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nation’s capital, including Matt Wood of Fayetteville, Katherine Stephani of Fayetteville, Hannah Froberg of Fayetteville, and William and Rachel Dixon of Prairie Grove. Safe travels back to the Natural State!
￼
This week, the House considered and passed on suspension the Rabbi Michoel Ber Weissmandl Congressional Gold Medal Act (H.R. 2740), the National Geologic Mapping Act Reauthorization Act (H.R. 4033), a bill to rename the Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge as the Congressman Lester Wolff National Wildlife Refuge (H.R. 6064), a bill to establish a procedure for the conveyance of certain federal property around the Dickinson and Jamestown Reservoir in the State of North Dakota (S. 440, S. 2074), the Cottonwood Land Exchange Act (H.R. 6146), the Gulf Islands National Seashore Land Exchange Act (H.R. 2615), the Flatside Wilderness Enhancement Act (H.R. 5636), the World War II Pacific Sites Establishment Act (H.R. 5706), a bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to grant to States and local governments easements and rights-of-way over Federal land within Gateway National Recreation Area for construction, operation, and maintenance of projects for control and prevention of flooding and shoreline erosion (H.R. 6666), the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief Extension Act (H.R. 6651), a bill to affirm strong United States-Liberia ties and support for democratic principles, and call for full implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommendations (H.Res. 1055), the Affirming United States-Australia cooperation on space research, exploration, and utilization (H.Res. 1052), and the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership Act (H.R. 6018).  
￼
I had the pleasure to renew an old friendship when I gave the oath of office to newly promoted Colonel Micah Bell of Rogers. I have known Micah since I recruited him to attend the University of Arkansas 25 years ago after he graduated from Rogers High School. It was an honor to be part of this ceremony and see Col. Bell’s military career continue to flourish. I am extremely proud of his accomplishments and service. Colonel Bell, you continue to make Arkansas and our nation proud. 
￼
On Wednesday, I joined my Republican colleagues to choose the GOP House leadership team for the next Congress. Congratulations to my friends Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise on being elected Republican Leader and Whip for the 116th Congress. I am also proud to see Liz Cheney selected as chair of the House Republican Conference. We have lots of work to do over the next two years, and I am confident that these qualified leaders will help us execute our goals. I look forward to continuing our work together and fighting for the American people!
￼
Agriculture is one of the economic engines of the Natural State. It was great to sit down with US Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and my colleagues in the Arkansas delegation to discuss issues related to the needs of farmers, ranchers, and producers. Thank you to Secretary Perdue for his time and productive discussion.
￼
As you might know, I am the co-chair of the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform, a bipartisan and bicameral panel of 16 lawmakers tasked with identifying and recommending reforms to the budget process. Throughout the year, we’ve been hard at work to design a neutral process for the future – one which allows Congress to move forward with its budgetary agenda, no matter which party holds the majority. Our efforts included five public hearings, meetings in which members vetted solutions, general work to build consensus, and finally putting pen to paper on actual recommendations. On Thursday, we announced and held a markup on the Committee’s report, recommendations, and legislative text. We still have lots of work to do to get a final proposal over the finish line, but I am proud of the bipartisan work we have done so far. We have an obligation to deliver significant reforms to create a properly functioning budget and appropriations process.
￼
On Friday, we wrapped up legislative business with the passage of the Manage our Wolves Act (H.R. 6784) and the Strengthening Coastal Communities Act (H.R. 5787). H.R. 6784 provides for removal of the gray wolf in the contiguous 48 States from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife published under the Endangered Species Act and was passed by a vote of 196-180 (Roll Call #420). H.R. 5787 updates existing coastal barrier maps across the country under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) and was passed by a vote of 375-1 (Roll Call #419). 
￼
In other news, small business optimism continues to grow according to a recent report released by the National Federation of Independent Business. “Thanks to a number of factors, including the federal government’s loosening grip on the private sector, the U.S. regained the top spot in the World Economic Forum’s ranking as the most competitive country during the month of October. An unburdened small business sector is truly great for employment and the general economy,” said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. Learn more here. 
This weekend, I am looking forward to being back in the District! Remember to keep an eye on my website or check out my Twitter and Instagram pages to stay up-to-date with the latest news from the Third District and Washington.

NEWSLETTER-MN07: Updates

￼
Oklee – Red Lake County
 
Dear Friends,
 
This week, the House of Representatives passed legislation that includes my language to give the State of Minnesota the authority to manage its population of gray wolves in a way that will best suit the needs of Minnesotans. My constituents have long expressed the need for local management of gray wolves, and I urge the Senate to act on this quickly. On Wednesday, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue visited my office to discuss issues for the House Agriculture Committee heading into the 116th Congress. I appreciate the good working relationship I have with Secretary Perdue and I look forward to working with him during the next Congress. I am continuing to negotiate the farm bill with my colleagues on the conference committee and I believe we are close to finishing our report. I remain confident we will have a 5-year farm bill enacted by the end of the year.
 
Sincerely,
￼ Congressman Collin C. Peterson
Minnesota 7th District
 
Manage Our Wolves Act
￼
 
I voted in support of a bill that includes my language to delist gray wolves in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Wyoming. This morning, the Manage our Wolves Act passed the House on a bipartisan 196-180 vote and moves across the Capitol for Senate action. Farmers and ranchers in rural Minnesota need to be able to protect their livestock and pets from predatory gray wolves that are constantly stalking herds across the state. This scheduled vote followed a letter written by a coalition of 19 agriculture and sportsmen’s organizations that urged Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to place my bill on the House floor for a vote before the year’s end.
 
I gave a speech in support of this bill on the House floor. You can watch video of my speech by clicking here.
 
Farm bill
I would like to be able to tell you in this newsletter that we have a farm bill conference report drafted and ready for conferees to sign, but we’re not quite there yet. However, we are finally in striking distance of an agreement. We have narrowed issues down and I have worked with Chairman Conaway on a House offer that has been presented to the Senate to help us close out remaining issues. We are still focused on the goal of getting a new farm bill passed before the end of year to bring certainty to our ag producers and rural communities.
 
Secretary Sonny Perdue
￼
 
Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue stopped my office to congratulate me on my reelection after we chatted on election night. We discussed the status of the farm bill, the Trump Administration’s rulemaking on SNAP waivers, and the agenda for the House Agriculture Committee in the upcoming congress. I appreciate the good working relationship I have developed with Secretary Perdue since his appointment and look forward to working with him on the issues facing our farmers and rural America.
 
American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall
￼
 
I spoke with American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall on Friday. We discussed the ongoing farm bill negotiations and the importance of enacting a 5-year bill by the end of the year. Zippy and I agree that American producers depend on a 5-year bill to increase certainty for them at this time when environmental and financial stresses have a lot of folks concerned about the future.
 
New Flyer
￼
 
This week, representatives of New Flyer visited my office to thank me for my efforts to keep U.S. bus manufacturers competitive. I recently joined a letter urging the Department of Transportation to clarify its “Buy America” regulations to ensure that manufacturers, like New Flyer’s plant in Crookston, can properly project costs, procure parts, and avoid disruptions to transit systems. I also thanked Wayne Joseph (President of Transit Bus Business - pictured far left) and Paul Smith (Executive Vice President – pictured far right) for their decades of advocacy as they look forward to retirement at the end of the year. 
 
White Earth Tribal Council
￼
Raymond Auginaush, Sr., Alan Roy, and Eugene Tibbetts
 
Recently elected members of the White Earth Tribal Council visited with me to discuss the tribe’s wild rice cultivation efforts and the farm bill. White Earth Nation grows and harvests significant amounts of wild rice by hand that is high in protein and dietary fiber. I look forward to working with White Earth to expand market access for their wild rice. 
 
Stronger America Through Seafood
￼
 
I am the lead Democrat on the AQUAA Act, a bill which streamlines federal permitting processes for aquaculture facilities in federal waters and creates research and development opportunities to expand domestic markets of American-grown shrimp and fish. A coalition of seafood, restaurant, and manufacturing groups knowns as Stronger America Through Seafood (SATS) visited with me to show their support for the bill which will also benefit Minnesota-based aquaculture facilities. 
 
National Young Farmers Coalition
￼
Sophie Vranian (Watertown), Sam Karns (Duluth), Starr Brainerd (Duluth), Andrew Bahrenburg, Aimee Haag (LITCHFIELD), Lindsay Lusher Shute
 
On Thursday, representatives of the National Young Farmers Coalition visited my office to talk about the farm bill and federal programs for young and beginning farmers. During farm bill negotiations I have supported the increase of funding for the Beginning Farmers and Rancher Development Program, a program that provides financial and educational resources for young farmers. We also discussed what the House Agriculture Committee could look like during the 116th Congress. I hope to recruit members from the incoming class of representatives that are dedicated to learning the details of federal agriculture policy, so that Congress can effectively serve Americas producers.
 
Teamsters
￼
 
This week, I met with representatives of the Teamsters to discuss the issues affecting pensions across the nation. Congress must work to protect the hard-earned dollars American workers have invested over the years for their retirements. I signed onto the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act, also known as the Butch Lewis Act in the Senate, so we can keep these funds from insolvency. It is time for the Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans to move legislation that addresses this problem, and I will continue to work with my friends on both sides of the aisle to see this through. Additionally, some members of the group were Vietnam War veterans, and I was honored to present them with Vietnam War Commemoration Lapel Pins to recognize their service.
 
Beth Ford
￼
Katie Zenk, Beth Ford, Adam Durand
 
Beth Ford, Land O’Lakes new CEO visited my office on Thursday. She talked about the importance of completing the farm bill for dairy producers in Minnesota as well as the need to make progress on other issues like immigration reform and resolving ongoing trade disputes. I have worked on a bipartisan basis on each of these issues and will continue to do so to strengthen our rural economy. 
 
Energy Conservation Improvement Programs
￼
 
In 1980, the Public Utilities Commission was directed to initiate a pilot program to demonstrate the feasibility of investments in energy efficiency. Four decades later, Minnesota has a host of Conservation Improvement Programs, Clean Energy Resource Teams and a statewide Energy Savings Platform for communities. Minnesota now ranks 8th in the National Energy Efficiency Scorecard. Since 2008, the Conservation Improvement Program has saved Minnesotans an estimated $3.5 billion on their energy bills. 
 
Find more information about Minnesota’s energy-saving initiatives here.
 
Veterans Day Lapel Pin ￼
 
Department of Veterans Affairs Assistant Secretary Melissa Glynn presented me with a Veterans Day Lapel Pin, which is given to Congressional Members that are also veterans. I served in the North Dakota National Guard from 1963 to 1969 and honored to have received this recognition.
 
Welcome Madeleine!
￼
 
My office welcomed Minnesota native Madeleine Lerner this week. Madeleine graduated from the University of Minnesota, Morris in 2017 and has her Master’s in Conflict Transformation and Social Justice from Queen’s University Belfast. She will be interning in D.C. through the end of the year and helping serve the folks of the 7th District. I am happy to be able to give students interested in government an up-close view of the legislative process.
 
Spring Internship Application Deadline Approaches
I highly encourage all college students and recent graduates interested in serving Minnesota’s 7th district to apply to intern in my Washington, D.C. office. The deadline for submitting applications for spring 2019 internships is November 27, 2018. I am proud of the talented young people in our district and look forward to seeing the next group of students here in Washington.
 
For more information and to apply, visit my website. This is a paid equal opportunity position.

Thanksgiving Dinner Cost Drops for 3rd Straight Year
￼
 
The American Farm Bureau Federation conducts an annual survey on the cost of classic holiday food products. The annual survey shows that the average cost of a Thanksgiving dinner is down 22 cents per person this year. In a similar trend, the price of your Thanksgiving turkey is about $1.36 per pound cheaper than it was last year - down 3 percent. Milk, sweet potatoes, green peas, and rolls also dropped in price. The Farm Bureau concludes that, after inflation, the average price of this year’s Thanksgiving dinner is $19.37, the cheapest it has been in more than a decade.
 
Minnesota Ranks #2 for Volunteering in the U.S.
￼
 
The Corporation for National and Community Service recently released a ranking of states based on the volunteering and civic engagement of residents. Minnesota was ranked #2 among states and Minneapolis and St. Paul together are the #1 cities. These volunteer activities provided an estimated $3.3 billion in economic value to Minnesota. We should be proud of our state’s commitment to service, and I hope that folks continue to offer what time they can for volunteering in their communities.
 
World Pancreatic Cancer Day
￼
 
 
On November 15th, pancreatic cancer advocates around the world united in recognition of World Pancreatic Cancer Day. People around the globe showed their support by wearing purple and by shining a light on the work that must be done to combat this deadly disease. Pancreatic Cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States and is the only major cancer with a survival rate in the single digits, about 9 percent.

New Flyer Excelsior CHARGE
 
New Flyer is the largest transit bus and motor coach manufacturer in North America. The company employs more than 1,200 people in Minnesota – around 400 of them at their plant in Crookston. This week, New Flyer announced that their sixty-foot-battery-electric bus completed the Federal Transit Administration’s Model Bus Testing Program. With completion of the testing, U.S. transit agencies can now utilize FTA funding to support their purchases of New Flyer’s battery-electric busses. New Flyer greatly contributes to the economy of the 7th District, and their innovations will help cities around the country cut down on carbon emissions. I display a miniature model of one of their new electric bus in my Washington D.C. office.

Manage Our Wolves 
Today, the House of Representatives voted to pass H.R. 6784, the Manage Our Wolves Act. I cosponsored and voted for this bill because it is important to the Sixth District and the state of Wisconsin. 
Since 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has actively worked to remove the gray wolf from the endangered species list based on the overwhelming scientific evidence that the species has recovered drastically in recent years. Despite efforts to make progress on the issue, including numerous rulemakings to highlight the recovery wolves have made in Midwestern states, most significantly Minnesota and Wisconsin, the delisting process has been blocked by DC-based judges through the judicial review process required by the Endangered Species Act.  This delayed process has allowed wolf populations to grow substantially, which has led to an increase in wolf related depredations. Livestock and pets throughout northern areas of the state, including areas in the Sixth District, have been killed by wolves. From 1980 to 2017, Wisconsin farmers experienced over 2,000 wolf related depredations to their livestock to go along with 354 attacks on domestic pets. Over the past four years, an average of 132 livestock have been killed by wolves and 26 pets per year.   Wisconsin and other states have shown that they have the ability to manage wolf populations at the state level and keep them at a healthy, sustainable degree. There is no reason for farmers livestock to be at risk and for residents to lose their beloved dogs and cats when Wisconsin can maintain a healthy wolf population at the state level. Voting to remove wolves from the Endangered Species List and put control back into the hands of the states gives farmers and residents the peace of mind that they deserve.

Forest Service Harassment 
This week, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a hearing on the culture and conduct of the U.S. Forest Service, highlighting reports of rampant sexual misconduct and harassment individuals in the department have experienced over the past several years. While misconduct, harassment, and gender discrimination in the Forest Service and USDA has been addressed before, the agencies have not taken the necessary steps to combat this behavior. 

With almost 1500 complaints of misconduct since August of 2017, finding a solution to this problem in the agency is long overdue. While U.S. Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen acknowledged the issues in the department and stressed the reforms currently in place, it is clear that a complete overhaul of the culture of the department is necessary to put an end to these reports of misconduct and harassment. 

This behavior cannot be accepted and changes to the U.S. Forest Service must be made. I will continue to monitor this situation and the ongoing reforms in the department. Click here to listen to my comments during the hearing.

Fighting to Enhance Nutrition Education Programs
This week, I partnered with my colleague Representative Alma Adams (D-NC) to introduce the Long-Term Investment in Education for Wellness (LIVE WELL) Act. Eating disorders affect 30 million Americans of all body types and socioeconomic backgrounds. 
Federal nutrition education programs help establish a lifetime of healthy eating and lifestyle choices for thousands of families across Upstate New York. Including eating disorder prevention activities as part of the framework for nutrition education is a logical step towards promoting overall health and well-being. The LIVE WELL Act utilizes evidence-based, long-term health practices into existing USDA grant programs to improve the lives of people with eating disorders and to more broadly improve health outcomes for children.

Honoring our Nation’s Heroes 
This past weekend, the nation recognized Veterans Day as we honored those who have served our nation to protect our freedoms and our way of life. Thank you to all the men and women of our military who have bravely sacrificed for our country.
I was able to participate in three different Veterans Day events over the course of the weekend, including in Edmeston, Hyde Park, and Stephentown. This Veterans Day had special meaning as it was the 100th anniversary of the armistice agreement that ended World War I.

Advocating for Fair and Effective Trade Policies
The undue impact of recent trade actions by China has reverberated in industries across our state, especially in the forest-based sector of the economy. Retaliatory actions coupled with unnecessary and burdensome import requirements on logs exported from the U.S. have severely damaged the ability of local family-owned companies to compete globally. 
I’ve been working closely with local businesses and have been a leading advocate in Congress for trade policies that increase open and fair market access for small businesses and hold bad actors like China accountable for their actions. Earlier this week, I sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue expressing concerns about China’s enforcement of antiquated and restrictive fumigation requirements on log shipments from the U.S. and the impacts these barriers are having on local companies. 
Read the letter I sent to Sec. Perdue here: https://bit.ly/2QNfTcm
More on the impact China’s trade policies are having on Upstate New York businesses can be found here: https://bit.ly/2PtQnw9

Continuing my Commitment to Fighting Climate Change
It has been a pleasure working with local advocates from the Columbia County and Mid-Hudson Chapters of Citizens Climate Lobby for the past two years on a variety of initiatives to address climate change. Together, we’ve worked to have my legislation - the Healthy Fields and Farm Economies Act - included in the 2018 Farm Bill to further support on-farm conservation practices, rejected anti-climate appropriations riders, and reduced CO2 emissions by transitioning to more efficient energy sources. 
I always appreciate the thoughtful and productive conversations we have as well as their willingness to compromise. Through working together, we forged new pathways and identified bipartisan solutions to strengthen our rural economies and local communities, and to better protect our environment for generations to come.

Heating Assistance Application Now Open
New York’s Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) is now accepting applications. As winter makes its arrival in Upstate New York, I recognize that the cold winter months often bring unbearably high heating costs to many in our community. Because of this, many – especially seniors – are forced to choose between heating their homes and basic necessities, such as food or medicine.
LI-HEAP is a federally-funded assistance program that helps seniors as well as low- and middle-income families heat their homes. In September, I joined colleagues from both sides of the aisle to support a robust appropriations bill that invested nearly $4 billion into the LI-HEAP program, with over $300 million specifically for New York State. We all know too well the frigid temperatures winter can bring in Upstate, which is why this program plays a pivotal role in supporting our community’s most vulnerable.
More information on the New York’s HEAP program and how to apply for assistance can be found here and here.

This week, I questioned the nominee for Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Ronald Vitiello during a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing. 
In a one-on-one meeting in October, I provided Mr. Vitiello with a report from the American Academy of Pediatrics about the long-term health impacts on children from separating them from their parents and detaining families indefinitely, which Mr. Vitiello committed to review. 
After asking him repeatedly about the report at the hearing, Mr. Vitiello finally acknowledged that he agreed with the findings of the report. However, Mr. Vitiello would not commit to recommending to the President that he end these policies. As I made clear during the hearing, I firmly believe that we have the capacity in the United States of America to control our borders without harming children. 
I asked Mr. Vitiello to start moving forward with solutions that protect children while securing our borders. Both are possible. You can watch video here. 
I also pressed Mr. Vitiello about his claim that members of New Hampshire’s Indonesian community – who fled their homeland under religious persecution – should be subject to deportation. You can watch that video from the hearing here.    
With every good wish,

Senator Maggie Hassan 
What the Senator is Working On
Fighting for New Hampshire 
Senator Hassan voted to approve bipartisan legislation to reauthorize, strengthen, and support the U.S. Coast Guard. The brave men and woman of the U.S. Coast Guard work tirelessly to keep Americans and Granite Staters safe, including helping stem the flow of illegal drugs and counter terrorist threats, and it’s critical that they have the support from the federal government that they need to continue doing their jobs as effectively as possible. 
Senator Hassan released a statement on the EPA’s draft toxicity assessments for GenX and PFBS, which are both under the class of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Read her statement below: 
“These assessments are a step forward in helping to get answers for Granite Staters and Americans who have been exposed to PFAS contamination in their drinking water and have rightly been asking about any potential health risks such exposure may cause. However, the EPA must do far more to assess and limit exposure to these contaminants that are emerging in drinking water throughout New Hampshire. I will continue fighting for New Hampshire communities that are exposed to these toxic chemicals and ensure that no Granite Stater is forced to question the safety or quality of their drinking water again.”  
The New Hampshire Congressional Delegation announced that New Hampshire will receive grants from the Office on Violence Against Women to help law enforcement support the survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, and stalking, and ensure that there is justice.  
News from the Granite State 
On Monday, Senator Hassan hosted the Innovate NH Entrepreneurship Forum, which featured interactive workshops for entrepreneurs from across the state. The workshops covered critical “how-to” topics to get small businesses off the ground and make them successful. Read more about the event here.

Honoring our Veterans
￼ 
I had a wonderful time talking with and thanking veterans at Smith-Cotton High School last weekend. 
As the nation prepared to mark Veterans Day and the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, I had the distinct pleasure of meeting and speaking with a group of veterans from our very own Centralia. About two dozen veterans – most of them from the Vietnam War - attended the meeting, and each of them shared their stories. It was an honor to thank them for their service and welcome them home! We had a good discussion on health care.They raised concerns about VA benefits, and some worried about how long it takes some veterans to be treated. Many expressed accolades for the good care they’ve received at the Truman VA Hospital, which was good to hear. My goal is to ensure each of our veterans receives his or her promised access to care. I encourage any veteran who believes there has been an undue delay in scheduling a medical appointment with the VA to contact my caseworker Janna Worsham, who works in my Columbia office, at 573-442-9311.

￼ 
It was an honor to speak at the Veterans Day events hosted by Smith-Cotton High School and Green Ridge High School. 
As part of Veterans Day ceremonies throughout our district, I also had the honor of speaking at Green Ridge High School’s Veterans Ceremony, as well as the Veterans Ceremony at Smith-Cotton High School in Sedalia. Both events were amazing! They were well-attended by students and veterans and included patriotic music by the students, a POW/MIA ceremony, flags and standing ovations for our nation’s warriors. In my comments I thanked the veterans for all they have done to keep our country free, reminded our students that the freedoms we enjoy were hard-earned, and encouraged our young people to make the time to thank a veteran. I am so grateful for our heroes’ willingness to embrace duty, display courage, and make sacrifices for each of us.
 
Fighting the Opioid Epidemic
 ￼ 
A big thank you to Butler Walmart for letting me stop by to learn how their pharmacy is doing its part to end the opioid crisis. 
The opioid epidemic is moving through our country with a fury. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to do everything we can to stop addiction before it begins and educate our friends and family about the dangers of being careless with painkillers. 
 I recently met with management and staff at the Walmart pharmacy in Butler to discuss the preventative measures the company is taking to combat opioid addiction. The pharmacy currently includes an educational handout with each opioid prescription, filled with prescription facts and instructions for using painkillers in a way that lowers the chance of addiction. Additionally, Walmart is working to prevent the cycle of medication overdoses and addiction by offering special DisposeRx kits at their pharmacies and on their website. When water and the DisposeRx powder are added to drugs in a prescription vial and shaken, the drugs are dissolved, rendering them unusable. 
 One of the issues employees raised was the lack of a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) in Missouri. I believe such a program would help prevent drug-shopping. There have been several documented cases of individuals from other states visiting Walmart pharmacies in Missouri to take advantage of the lack of monitoring and load up on prescription drugs, which only fuels the opioid epidemic.

The good news is that, despite the lack of a statewide PDMP, many Missouri pharmacies are able to work with individual counties that have monitoring programs. In this way, the pharmacists are acting as gatekeepers, able to monitor other pharmacies’ dispensing of certain drugs and whether an individual has had multiple prescriptions of the same drug filled in a short timespan. This type of program is just one way we can fight this destructive epidemic. 

Photos of the Week
￼ 
I had the pleasure of speaking with the Fayette High School government class about the federal government and listening to their concerns. 
  
￼ 
I was thankful for the opportunity to share with the Rotary Club in Mexico the initiatives we’re working on in Washington to improve their everyday lives. 
 
￼ 
That same day, I stopped at Law-te’ Coffee House to discuss with folks in Moberly how the policies we’ve been working on in Washington have left them better off now. 
 
￼ 
I appreciated everyone who joined me at Scooters in El Dorado Springs last week. We had a lot of good discussion about the needs in Missouri’s Fourth District, especially the necessity of high-speed internet. We have to continue expanding broadband to our rural communities so our students and families don’t fall behind in the digital divide. 
 
￼ 
On Veterans Day weekend I had an early wake-up call to speak at two Veterans Day school assemblies. As I drove, I enjoyed the beautiful snowfall from the night before as I reflected on how grateful I was to honor our local heroes for their service to our nation.      
￼ 
I had a great conversation with a wonderful group of Adrian High School students about the opioid crisis and how we can work to achieve a Drug Free Missouri. 
 
￼ 
After church on Sunday, I stopped by our doughboy statue at the Harrisonville courthouse to remember the 53 Cass Countians who gave their lives during WWI and to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the end of this war. It was a sober reminder that freedom isn’t free, and I am grateful for all who went. 
 
￼ 
I was sobered & grateful to visit with Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) specialists at the EOD Day on the Hill event. These courageous warriors protect their fellow soldiers by taking out improvised explosive devices (IED’s) that maim and kill, and I am thankful for their service. 
 
Weekly Dose of Good News
The economy is still booming. The October job report was stellar, with the unemployment rate remaining steady at 3.7 percent – the lowest  level since December, 1969 – while 250,000 jobs were created in the same month. In addition to the job creation and low jobless rate, workers’ hourly earnings growth was at its highest since April 2009. Also, the prime-age labor force participation rate surged from 81.8 percent to 82.3 percent, the highest rate since May 2010. Make no mistake: policies we have fought for in Washington have given our citizens the confidence they need as they look for new jobs or seek better, higher paying jobs. Our policies have made our country a better place and that’s something we can all be thankful for this Thanksgiving season!

Dear Friend, 
I'm back to work in Congress this week working hard with my colleagues on both sides of the political aisle to fix problems and deliver real results back home across South and West Texas. Take a look: 
I cannot fundamentally do my job without regular feedback from my bosses, each of you in TX-23. That's why I take time each week to respond to your questions, because listening to your concerns allows me to make sure your voice is heard in Congress.  
￼ 
If you missed this week's Hurd on the Hill column: I asked my Military and Veterans Liaison Ashley Estep to tell you why she joined the Air Force and what motivates her to continue serving today. I hope you enjoy her story. 
￼ 
My heart is heavy for the family and friends of Air Force Capt. John Graziano and the Laughlin AFB community. We must never forget the selfless service and sacrifice of our service members and their loved ones. We are forever grateful.  
￼ 
Americans simply cannot be protected for generations to come without a well-educated workforce. That's why in Congress I strive to be an advocate for educational opportunities for our South and West Texas students.  
￼ 
Although World Kindness Day was technically on Monday, I wanted to share some wise words from a friend I met at last year's Amistad parade in Del Rio: Kind is cool.  
￼ 
From this week's opening of the Bexar County Military and Veterans Services Center. If you know of or are one of San Antonio's nearly 250,000 veterans or 80,000 active-duty military, you can learn more at 210-335-6775 or at bexar.org.  
￼ 
As always, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office with any questions or concerns. For real-time updates on my work for you, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube at @HurdontheHill. 
Have a wonderful weekend!
 Sincerely, 
Will

Happy Friday! 
We have made it through another work week, and I’m happy to be heading home to Arizona tonight to be with my family, friends, and constituents. As we approach the Thanksgiving holiday, I’m continually reminded about what I am thankful for and how grateful I am to be serving Arizona’s Fifth Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.   Happy Veterans Day 
￼ 
This week, the nation observed Veterans Day. We would not still have our freedoms without the sacrifices of countless veterans who have selflessly served the United States for hundreds of years. These men and women, who walk among us, are the reasons we continue to wake up in this great nation with our liberties still intact. 
We should be grateful every day for our veterans and ensure that our heroes know especially how thankful America is for their service and devotion.
Thank you, veterans. Arizona’s Fifth District owes you a debt of gratitude.  Honoring Our Veterans 
￼ 
As we continue to honor our veterans and thank them for their service to our nation, I could think of no better individual to join me on this week’s podcast than Bill Montgomery. Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery served our country in the U.S. Army, and he continues to faithfully serve our county and state as a stellar public servant. I hope you will enjoy our conversation about his service, the opioid crisis, and criminal justice reform.

￼ 
Republicans may only be in the majority in the House for a little while longer, but there’s still more we must do to complete our promises to the American people. I’m not ready to give up, and I’m going to work hard until the last day of the 115th Congress. Read my op-ed on what I believe we should be doing for the last weeks of the 115th Congress or my interview with the Daily Signal from yesterday.   Congratulations, Chairman Paul Gosar! 
￼ 
Congratulations to Rep. Paul Gosar on his re-election as Chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus. Under his leadership, the membership has grown significantly, and our influence has expanded throughout the House and Senate. We have effectively fought for our priorities of eliminating onerous regulations and fostering economic prosperity throughout the past two years. The Western Caucus has never been in better shape, and I am privileged to serve with Chairman Gosar.   Welcome to the U.S. Capitol 
￼ 
My office gives tours of the U.S. Capitol a lot, and we were pleased to welcome the Call family this week – on the first snow day for the winter, no less. I enjoy the opportunities to meet the individuals who pass through our doors and am thankful for the Arizona warmth they bring with them. If you are visiting Washington, D.C. and looking to tour the Capitol, please visit my website to request a tour.   Legislative Update

Carper's Connection
November 16, 2018
Dear Friend, 
Over the past week and a half, the news has been dominated by post-election coverage. But behind all the headlines about politics, serious negotiations were wrapping up on a bipartisan bill that was months in the making and means big things for marine life and clean waterways in Delaware and across our country.  
￼
On Wednesday, by an overwhelming vote of 94-6, the Senate passed a major bill reauthorizing the critical work of our United States Coast Guard. The reauthorization makes sure that the men and women of the Coast Guard have the tools and resources needed to protect our shores, restrict the flow of illicit goods and help Americans in need of emergency rescue at sea. For the Coast Guard contingent based at the Indian River Inlet, this bill means more funding for cutting edge watercraft, easier access to health care, improved leave policies and clarity on inspections and enforcement procedures. This reauthorization alone is good news for our service members and our security.
But within this bill is another measure that I’m particularly proud of – one that will help ensure clean water and healthy ecosystems for the shipping channels of Delaware, like those leading to and from the Port of Wilmington. Known as the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, or “VIDA,” this provision directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to craft new, strong rules to limit pollution and invasive species that boats can release into American waterways. VIDA empowers both the Coast Guard and states with the tools they need to enforce these new standards – making sure there is always a cop on the beat in our waterways with the ability to protect our precious resources. 
As a former governor, I’m proud that this bill also gives local leaders a louder voice when it comes to the protection of their waters. VIDA allows governors in the Great Lakes to establish their own guidelines for the entire basin, and it lets leaders block off particularly vulnerable areas as “off-limits” to all ballast discharges. 
￼
Getting to this point on VIDA was a multi-month endeavor – and it hasn’t always been easy. In April, the Senate failed to pass a version of this bill because many of my colleagues and I were concerned that it did not adequately protect marine life and ecosystems from the threat of invasive species. It was a frustrating bump in the road that could have caused many to throw in the towel, but, instead, we went back to work to get this right. From my position as top Democrat on the Senate environment committee, I worked with Democrats and Republicans alike, and our staffs on both sides of the aisle, to craft a solution that earns support from stakeholders across the board. 
After months of collaboration, we developed what I like to call a “win-win” for environmental quality and economic growth. Thanks to this bill, coastal waters throughout the country will be cleaner and more marine ecosystems will be protected from the scourge of invasive species. At the same time, VIDA provides long-term certainty to the American shipping industry, upon whom we all rely to safely and efficiently move goods in and out of the country. 
There’s an old African proverb that says: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” Although we had our differences along the way, what brought Democrats and Republicans together was a common appreciation of how important clean water is to our country. Whether you live on the Delaware River or on the shores of Lake Michigan, this is something that all Americans value.
￼
People in Delaware say to me all the time: ‘When is Congress going to get something done?’ While these smart, bipartisan wins don’t always make the front page, they are important and show what can be done when both sides commit to getting things done and done right, rather than scoring political points. 
I’m proud that this bill will bring real results to First State ecosystems and the brave men and women of the Coast Guard based in Delaware. I will continue pushing members of the House to support this great bipartisan bill, and by doing so, demonstrate that, even right on the heels of last week’s elections, Congress is still committed to hammering out principled compromises on difficult, but important issues.  Accomplishments like these give me hope that, in the next Congress, we’ll have even more opportunities to find common ground and make progress in tackling other problems.

Bipartisan TRACED Act Cracks Down on Illegal Robocall Scams
 
Sen. Thune, chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, today announced the introduction of S. 3655, the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act. Amidst ever increasing numbers of robocall scams, the TRACED Act gives regulators more time to find scammers, increases civil forfeiture penalties for those caught, promotes call authentication and blocking adoption, and brings relevant federal agencies and state attorneys general together to address impediments to criminal prosecution of robocallers who intentionally flout laws.
 
“I’ve heard from countless South Dakotans who are tired of the abusive robocalls and scams that are constantly interrupting their daily lives,” said Thune. “The TRACED Act targets robocall scams and other intentional violations of telemarketing laws so that when authorities do catch violators, they can be held accountable. Existing civil penalty rules were designed to impose penalties on lawful telemarketers who make mistakes. This enforcement regime is totally inadequate for scam artists, and we need do more to separate enforcement of carelessness and other mistakes from more sinister actors.”
 
S. 3655 is cosponsored be Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.).

Dear Friend, 
Opioid Legislation Signed Into Law

President Trump has signed into law a bipartisan opioid package that included my legislation, the Alternatives to Opioids in the Emergency Department Act. This legislation establishes a three year program to test alternative pain management tools to reduce the amount of opioids being used in an emergency setting. The opioid epidemic has hurt so many Coloradans and Americans, but with this new legislation signed into law we can work to advance policies that prevent drug abuse, expand treatment, and support families.  
Read more about this legislation here. 
Jobs Growth and Wage Increase for October 

Wages are rising in Colorado and new jobs are being created because of sustained, strong economic growth. Wages have increased by nearly 3.1 percent, which is the highest in nearly a decade, the economy has added 250,000 jobs in October, the unemployment rate of 3.7 percent is the lowest since December 1969, and the labor force participation rate ticked up to 62.9 percent. This is all great news that proves when we advance policies that reduce taxes on hard working families and make it easier for businesses to hire new employees it keeps our state moving in the right direction.    
Traveling the State
While traveling the state last week, I attended a celebration at Estes Park to commemorate great summer tourist numbers, along with Estes Park receiving Sunset Magazine’s Best Mountain Town award and being listed on Expedia's Top-Rated Vacation Destinations in North America. It was a pleasure joining Mayor Jirsa last week for a celebration with lodging and business owners. 
￼ 
￼ 
I visited Loveland's Northern Colorado Regional Airport where I was able to see the Colorado Remote Tower Project. This project pioneers the next generation of air traffic control technology. It is the first to combine visual/camera input and radar/track-based input, which allows control of air traffic at airports from a remote location. This project will enhance airport safety and efficiency.  
￼ 
￼
I recently spoke at the ribbon cutting ceremony for Molecular Products Group and attended a demonstration of the new manufacturing facility to celebrate the investments made in this great Colorado technology company. The idea for this facility that produces more jobs within the state to service the national defense and homeland security industry has been in the works since 2015. I congratulate everyone who worked to make this new high tech manufacturing facility happen.

￼ 
Bipartisan Call for Additional Funding for Massive Wildfires
I joined Senator Bennet and a bipartisan group of colleagues recently in requesting funding to modernize firefighting assets to make sure the U.S. Forest Service can respond in a more efficient and cost-effective manner to devastating wildfires. The fire season this past year in Colorado stretched resources thin and demonstrated the need to invest further in these firefighting assets.

My staff is available to assist you with finding out the status of a case and requesting additional information from a federal agency. I have offices in Denver, Durango, Pueblo, Grand Junction, Fort Collins, Greeley, Yuma, and Colorado Springs. Learn more about how we can help here.

Manage Our Wolves 
￼ 
Click here to watch my remarks on the House floor. 
Today, I am pleased to announce the House of Representatives approved bipartisan legislation introduced by Rep. Sean Duffy (R-WI) and myself to return management of gray wolves to state control. The recovery of the gray wolf is a success story for the Endangered Species Act, and the best available science must determine whether a species remains listed. States are best-equipped to effectively manage gray wolves and respond to the needs of the ecosystem and local communities. I am pleased that this bill will return management of the gray wolf species to the states, as requested by the Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife and as proposed by the Obama administration. Learn more. 
Peaceful is Their Sleep in Glory 
￼
On November 10, the world reflected on the centennial of the Armistice of World War I. I laid wreaths at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial just outside of Paris, France to honor three Washington natives who lost their lives or went missing in ""The Great War."" Inscribed on the chapel overlooking the Suresnes cemetery are the words, 'Peaceful is their sleep in glory,' and it was a moving experience to recognize the ultimate sacrifice of fellow Americans who never came home.  
These young men's sacrifice is more than most of us can imagine. The ground in which they rest is hallowed, and it was an honor to pay respects on behalf of the people of the Fourth Congressional District. I laid wreaths at the gravesite of Private Harold H. Anderson of Bellingham and at the Tables of the Missing in honor of Private Robert W. Ely of Kennewick and John Tomlinson of Toppenish. In addition to laying the wreaths, I also participated in a memorial ceremony to honor all Americans who lost their lives in World War I with a group of bipartisan members of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Never Forgotten 
￼ 
This week, the Senate passed my legislation, H.R. 5504, to designate a post office in West Richland as the ""Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman Post Office Building."" U.S. Marine Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman was serving in the 2nd Raider Battalion at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, when he was tragically killed in a cargo plane crash in Mississippi on July 10, 2017. The bill now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law. 
After speaking with the Schmieman family, it became clear that Dietrich was truly devoted to his service and his Marine Corps brothers-in-arms. I am proud to be able to honor him through this legislation, and I am grateful his memory will live on in Central Washington. Sergeant Schmieman's sacrifice will not be forgotten, and this post office will serve as a local reminder for his family, friends, and community of the honorable sacrifice he gave for his country.  
I spoke about Sergeant Schmieman on the House floor earlier this year. Click here to watch.  
Progress for Central Washington Water Users 
The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) released its FY19 Distribution of Additional Funding that includes $7.1 million to the Columbia Basin Project Ephrata Office and allocates up to $2 million for design and oversight to the Odessa Groundwater Replacement Program. Every dollar of additional support for the Columbia Basin Project makes a difference for the future of water users facing depletion of the Odessa Aquifer. The Bureau's announcement for the project is very helpful, and I will continue to make the case for the federal government to support this critical investment on behalf of farmers, ranchers, and other water users who are counting on a replacement water source. Click here to read about the announcement. 
In other good news for Central Washington, this week, the House Committee on Natural Resources approved legislation I introduced to transfer title of BOR related works and lands to the Kennewick Irrigation Distirct (KID). In accordance with the December 2017 Memorandum of Agreement between KID and BOR, this legislation will transfer title of works beginning at KID's head gate and extending 40 miles east to the Columbia River. The transfer includes the conveyance of land and project facilities, and it should be completed no longer than two years after the enactment. Transferring the title to a local entity will allow more responsive water management, streamlining water uses on behalf of the local community. My legislation reduces government waste and excess regulations, and I am grateful to Chairman Bishop and my colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee for approving this important bill.

Long’s Short Report – Modernizing NAFTA into a 21st century trade agreement
By: Rep. Billy Long
It’s been nearly 25 years since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed by the U.S., Canada and Mexico. This landmark free trade agreement was created for the purpose of making it easier for companies in each country to do business. Because of this agreement, nearly all tariffs were eliminated, with the exception of a few agricultural products.
In the last 25 years, NAFTA has become outdated and has failed to keep up with today’s ever-changing economy, leading to our annual goods trade deficit growing to almost a trillion dollars since 1993. President Trump campaigned on a promise of renegotiating this agreement in order to benefit all Americans and to reflect a 21st century global economy.
On September 30 of this year, after months of negotiations, President Trump, along with Mexico and Canada, reached an agreement to update and revise NAFTA, renaming it the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). USMCA is a free and fair-trade deal that will support high-paying jobs in the U.S. while also growing the North American economy.
USMCA would incentivize industries, such as manufacturing, to obtain their products in North America by updating the rules of origin and origin procedures. Not only would USMCA require that 75 percent of auto content be made in North America, it would also require that individuals who make 40 – 45 percent of auto content make at least $16 an hour, helping increase wages.
Similar to manufacturing, the agriculture industry would also significantly improve under USMCA. Specifically, USMCA would provide new export opportunities for dairy products between the U.S. and Canada, eliminate some agriculture tariffs previously put in place under NAFTA, such as whey and margarine, and allow the U.S. access to new markets in Canada.
While NAFTA was created to tackle problems that would arise in the 21st century, it has failed to keep up with changing technology and the economy. USMCA aims to fix these problems by updating and modernizing intellectual property protections, which would strengthen innovation and economic growth. Some of those provisions include expanding patent protections, a 10-year data protection on biologic drugs, establishing standards that prevent individuals from obtaining or reproducing digital content illegally as well as increasing protections for trademarks.
Along with enhanced intellectual property provisions, USMCA addresses modern forms of commerce by creating a new Digital Trade chapter. Digital trade is a key driver of U.S. economic strength and accounts for more than half of U.S. services exports. This new chapter will help support the growth of e-commerce and consumer demands, while also setting a standard for other countries around the world.
This is just another example of President Trump following through on a promise that betters American lives. The president is expected to sign USMCA on November 30, 2018, before sending the agreement and implementing legislation to Congress for approval. It must also be approved by the governments of Canada and Mexico.

Dear Friend,  
This week, I held my 10th annual Veterans Day event and paid my respects to the residents of Shelby County killed in World War I on the 100th anniversary of the Armistice that ended that conflict.  I also attended an event honoring the Reverend James M. Lawson Jr., noted that open enrollment for 2019 insurance policies with HealthCare.gov is under way, called attention to the need to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in our elections, welcomed newly elected freshmen members of the 116th Congress to  Washington for their orientation, celebrated the grand opening of the River Garden Park, remembered Karim Sameh Azab, prepared to hold an evening “Congress On Your Corner” event, offered 2019 Capitol Historical Society calendars, and highlighted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s advice on the use of antibiotics.

Paying Tribute to Veterans on Veterans Day 
￼ ￼ 
On Monday, I commemorated Veterans Day with my 10th annual event for my constituents who have served our country in uniform.  I spoke about veterans legislation I support, including the Putting Our Veterans Back to Work Act and the Compassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States (CARERS) Act. I also welcomed Memphis VA Medical Center Director David Dunning, Shelby County Veterans Court Judge Bill Anderson, Naval Support Activity Mid-South Commander Michael Mosi and Memphis Area Legal Services Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) program manager Chassia Taylor. Gwendolyn Turner gave a rousing rendition of our national anthem, Reverend James Kendrick offered a prayer and the Trezevant High School JROTC Color Guard presented colors.  On Sunday, I visited the Doughboy Statue in Overton Park to recognize the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I and the 231 soldiers from Shelby County who lost their lives in that conflict.  
Honoring the Reverend James M. Lawson Jr.  
￼ 
On Wednesday, I joined my colleagues in honoring the Reverend James M. Lawson Jr., the Civil Rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called “the leading theorist and strategist” of non-violence, by cosponsoring legislation to award him the Congressional Gold Medal. He objected to the Korean War on moral grounds and was sentenced to two years in prison for his resistance. Subsequently, he was a missionary to India where he studied the principles of non-violent resistance put forth by Gandhi. Reverend Lawson was pastor of the Centenary United Methodist Church in Memphis and invited Dr. King to Memphis during the 1968 Sanitation Workers strike. In my remarks at the Capitol Hill event honoring Reverend Lawson and highlighting the Congressional Gold Medal legislation, I said the Civil Rights Movement was our country’s second Civil War and that the Reverend Lawson was as much a general as Grant or Sherman. I also recalled Reverend Lawson’s work with John T. Fisher to keep Memphis peaceful after Dr. King’s assassination, and I praised Lawson as a wise man from whom young people can continue to learn a lot. The Reverend Lawson was recently honored by Vanderbilt University, which kicked him out as a student for his Nashville lunch counter sit-ins, and where he later taught, along with Perry Wallace, the basketball great who integrated the Southeastern Conference. Other speakers at Wednesday’s event included the NAACP’s Hilary Shelton, AFSCME organizer Bill Lucy, Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Cedric Richmond, House Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn, and Reverend Lawson himself, now 90, who spoke of the early stirrings of his thirst for justice and his ongoing quest. 
Flagging Open Enrollment Now Available at HealthCare.gov 
￼ 
Open enrollment for 2019 HealthCare.gov insurance plans is now under way. This year, open enrollment runs only through December 15. I will be making use of every possible means to make my constituents aware that the time available to sign up has been limited again this year compared to the enrollment periods during the Obama Administration -- six weeks shorter than it was in 2016. This week, I recorded a public service announcement for local radio to encourage signing up.For more information on signing up for health care, see Healthcare.gov.      
Working to Protect the Mueller Investigation  
￼ 
Congressman Cohen addresses a crowd gathered November 10 in Civic Center Plaza downtown to call for protecting the Special Counsel’s investigation of Russian interference. 
The President fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions and installed Matthew Whitaker, rather than the Deputy Attorney General as is appropriate, as Acting Attorney General.  Because Whitaker has not been confirmed by the Senate, a number of legal scholars have questioned the legality and constitutionality of his occupying the office. Additionally, there are concerns about Whitaker regarding statements he has made about the Muller investigation as well as previous business dealings, specifically his prior involvement with World Patent Marketing which, in 2017, was fined $26 million and closed down by federal regulators for deceiving consumers. It is now more important than ever for Congress to protect Mueller’s probe by passing the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act (H.R. 5476) that I have cosponsored. We are watching a slow-motion Saturday Night Massacre and are at the cusp of a Constitutional crisis as other firings appear possible. The American people deserve the truth. Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation must be allowed to continue without political interference.   
Welcoming the Freshman Class of the 116th Congress 
When Congress convenes for the first time on January 3, 2019, a projected 100 new freshmen will fill the House chamber, a higher than usual number of new members.  The diversity of the class is encouraging, with more women, more African Americans, more Latino/as and more veterans than in previous years (we are also doubling the number of Native Americans). I’ve spent this week getting acquainted with some of my new colleagues who were in Washington becoming oriented to their new roles. I was especially pleased to meet with Congresswoman-elect Angie Craig of Minnesota, a University of Memphis graduate and former reporter for The Commercial Appeal. I gave her a copy of the the feature story about her in The Commercial Appeal and she said she was particularly happy it had been written by her old friend and colleague, John Beifuss. I look forward to working with the new class next year. 
Celebrating Grand Opening of the River Garden Park 
￼ 
At the dedication, left to right -- J.R. “Pitt” Hyde III, Carol Coletta, Mayor Jim Strickland, Barbara Hyde, Congressman Cohen and Henry Turley. 
Last Friday, I attended the grand opening of the River Garden Park at Riverside and Jefferson, part of the $70 million Memphis Riverfront Concept that is transforming our city’s western edge. The Memphis Riverfront Parks Partnership, which replaced the Riverfront Development Corporation, is overseeing the redesign of the waterfront, including major work on Tom Lee Park slated for next year. Memphis is fortunate to benefit by a $5.2 million contribution to the beautification effort from the Hyde Family Foundation. Such gifts of philanthropy are much appreciated and much needed. Many have done much for our city but the Hydes have been in the forefront for years. I’m proud to have played a part in the transformation of our riverfront by working to secure U.S. Department of Transportation funding for Big River Crossing, the longest pedestrian/bicycle trail over the Mississippi River on the Harahan Bridge, which opened in October 2016. 
Remembering “A Gentle Giant” -- Karim Sameh Azab 
As a Tiger basketball fan since childhood, I was saddened to learn of the death of University of Memphis basketball player Karim Sameh Azab from leukemia on Thursday. Our office’s staffers Linda Archer, Betsy Dudley and Beanie Self were called upon by the university to arrange for the Egyptian native’s visa so that he could play in Memphis. They later worked to get visas for his parents so they could be with him in his last days. I recall mentioning Karim to President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi when I was in Egypt. Karim will be remembered as a kind and gentle giant and I’m sure the team will dedicate the remainder of the season to his memory. 
Holding My Next “Congress On Your Corner”  
My Memphis staff and I will hold an evening “Congress On Your Corner” for those who can’t make our daytime events, on Monday, November 26, at the Benjamin Hooks Central Library, 3030 Poplar, from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m.  As your representative in Congress, part of my job is making sure your concerns and issues with federal agencies and federal benefits are dealt with fairly and expeditiously. We can help with Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits and military service issues, Small Business Administration (SBA) loans and services, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) home loans, federal grant applications, visas and passports, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issues and more.    
Offering U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars   

￼  
My office will soon have a limited number of 2019 U.S. Capitol Historical Society calendars available. If you would like to receive a calendar, please complete this form on my website. Due to the rules of the House, I can mail calendars only to residents of Tennessee’s 9th Congressional District.

Weekly Health Tip
￼ 

Each week, I share a health tip in the hope of promoting a healthy lifestyle for residents of the 9th Congressional District. As always, it is best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine or lifestyle.   
This week is Antibiotic Awareness Week which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and partnering organizations observe to improve antibiotic prescribing practices and inform the public of the threat of antibiotic resistance due to overuse. The CDC estimates that 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in an outpatient setting are unnecessary. Overuse of prescribed antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance – the ability of bacteria to defeat the drugs designed to kill them. More than 23,000 people die every year as a result of having infections resistant to antibiotics. Read more about the proper use of antibiotics here. 
Quotes of the Week  

￼ 
“At the heart of racism is the idea that a man is not a man.” -- The Reverend James M. Lawson Jr., 1968. 
“Nonviolence in many ways was an effort to help people see that they were of infinite worth and dignity. That their very life in fact was a center of the life of the universe, that the full power of what life is all about is located in every single human being. And no matter how tortuous that person's life is, they still have certain power if they're willing to exercise it and cultivate it and use it. And it may be risky, but it can be done. So the whole notion of nonviolence, philosophically, is that you are a person of infinite worth and as such you can exercise influence all around you. – The Reverend James M. Lawson,  December 2, 1985, interview for Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years (1954-1965).  
As always, I remain, 
Most sincerely,

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  November 16, 2018
CONTACT: James Hogge 231-640-9158


Bergman Votes in Favor of Bipartisan Manage Our Wolves Act 

Washington - Today, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 6784, the Manage Our Wolves Act. H.R. 6784 would direct the Fish and Wildlife Service to end Endangered Species Act protection for the grey wolf. In 2009, President Obama's Administration had determined the grey wolf no longer needed these protections, but litigation in 2014 overturned that ruling in federal court. Following House passage today, Rep. Bergman released the following statement:

""Proper conservation efforts and species management are essential to the First District of Michigan. The Manage Our Wolves Act is a major win for sportsmen and farmers and the state wildlife agencies who have worked diligently to bring the wolf population back to adequate levels.  If signed into law, this bill would return power back to the states, allowing us to appropriately manage our wolf population and protect our farms and our wildlife.""

SERVING YOU  |  MEDIA CENTER  |  LEGISLATIVE WORK  |  OUR DISTRICT
 
November 16, 2018
 
 
 Dear Friend,   On Wednesday the New York Times published a staggering report on Facebook’s inappropriate actions and deception over the past three years. Like many, I was outraged by the totality of wrongdoing committed by leading Facebook executives who wanted to hide the truth about Russian manipulation, smear their critics, and protect their enormous profits.  It’s been clear for a long time that Facebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself. Congress needs to put in place new laws to hold them, and other large corporations, accountable to the public. Click here to watch my interview on Chris Hayes from last night and learn more about the work I’m doing protect consumers and rein in corporate influence. You can also click here to read my comments in a New York Times editorial on this important issue.  SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY   Next Saturday, November 24th is Small Business Saturday. This celebration began in 2010, making this year the ninth annual event. The Small Business Administration estimates that the previous eight Small Business Saturdays generated over $85 billion.  Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. They play an incredibly important role in supporting job creation and local economic growth.  On Monday, I will join representatives from the Small Businesses Administration, my colleagues in Rhode Island’s Congressional Delegation, along with members from the East Bay Chamber of Commerce, and the Bristol Merchants Association to highlight the importance of supporting small businesses in our state. I’m looking forward to touring several small businesses in historic Bristol and encourage fellow Rhode Islanders to support local shops and restaurants this holiday season.   FOR THE PEOPLE  This week newly elected members of Congress came to Washington, D.C. for orientation. I’m looking forward to getting to work with the incoming class, as well as my current colleagues who will return next year.  Democrats will get to work on Day One creating jobs rebuilding our infrastructure, bringing down the cost of prescription drugs and health care, and cracking down on any politician who abuses their public office.   We are going to deliver results for the people of this great country. Click here to learn more about our plans for the next two years.  OPEN ENROLLMENT FOR HEALTH CARE   Health insurance is incredibly important and helps protect you from unexpected costs, like a trip to the hospital or an unforeseen accident. That’s why I want to make sure that all of my constituents are aware that November 1st marked the start of Health Source RI’s open enrollment period for 2019 coverage.   From now until December 31, you can purchase a plan or renew your coverage through HealthSourceRI.com. Once you sign up, you will get coverage that starts on January 1, 2019.   Here are four facts you need to know about enrolling in coverage or renewing your coverage:  • The open enrollment period for HealthSource RI for 2019 began on November 1. December 23 is the deadline to pick and pay for a plan to ensure uninterrupted coverage in 2019. December 31 is the last day you can purchase health insurance for 2019.   • Coverage could be more affordable than you think. That’s because financial help is available for 8-in-10 HealthSource RI customers. In 2018, nearly half of HealthSource RI enrollees paid less than $100 a month for their health insurance.   • If you had coverage through HealthSource RI in 2018, make sure to head back to update your information and compare your options for 2019. Every year, plans and prices change. This year, it’s more important than ever to shop around! You may find a plan that fits you better, for cheaper.  • Free help is available. If you have questions about signing up or want to talk through your options with a trained professional, free help is just a click, call or click away. Explore your options and estimate your health insurance cost in under five minutes with HealthSource RI’s Plan Comparison & Savings Tool. Call HealthSource RI at 1-855-840-HSRI or visit the Walk-In Center at 401 Wampanoag Trail in East Providence. Want to save time? You can schedule an appointment with an enrollment specialist by clicking here. Or, check out one of the two dozen enrollment events across the state, or find a Navigator in your community by dialing 211. Take the time to learn about your options and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact my office.  As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns, please call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov.

Dear friends,
Each year, we honor our veterans on November 11, a day that marks the end of World War I when the armistice went into effect on the 11th hour, of the 11th day, of the 11th month. This year marked the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day and the end of World War I. I was honored to participate in a number of Veterans Day events to honor the service and sacrifice of our veterans and their families.
I delivered a floor speech on Oct. 17 to highlight the Senate’s significant bipartisan victories on behalf of our nation’s veterans, including having passed 22 pieces of veterans’ legislation since January 2017 that have all been signed into law. I also reflected on what Veterans Day means to me as a veteran and as chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. You can watch my floor remarks here. To read more about the Senate’s accomplishments, click here.
￼
Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to present the Prisoner of War Medal to 96-year-old U.S. Army veteran Ralph Rumsey from Georgia. I helped secure the medal for Mr. Rumsey nearly 73 years after his release as a prisoner of World War II. This opportunity and Mr. Rumsey’s service inspired my op-ed, “World War II POW just one example of why Senate’s work to help veterans is vital,” which was published in the Macon Telegraph on Veterans Day. To read my words reflecting on Veterans Day and thanking our men and women in uniform, click here.
On Oct. 24, I had the privilege of presenting Jennifer Gerding with a U.S. flag flown over the U.S. Capitol in memory of her father, William Carroll, a U.S. Army veteran of World War II and the Korean War who was awarded two Silver Stars, a Bronze Star, and two Purple Hearts for his service.
￼
Also on Oct. 24, I was honored to receive the ‘Harry S. Truman Award’ from the National Guard Association of the United States, the association’s highest honor. I was selected to receive this year’s award for my efforts to introduce and shepherd through Congress the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 to improve veterans’ education benefits and enhance the post-9/11 G.I. Bill. 
￼
On Veterans Day, Nov. 11, I participated in a dedication ceremony in Douglasville, Ga., for a home that was built for U.S. Navy veteran Marilyn Clark and her family by the Northwest Metro Atlanta Habitat for Humanity as part of its Veterans Build program. This is the second house to be dedicated in Veterans Place, the first-ever all veteran Habitat neighborhood in the state of Georgia; and only one of two in the country. Read more about this special occasion here. 
   ￼￼
On Tuesday, Nov. 13, I participated in Johnson Ferry Baptist’s Veterans Appreciation Lunch in Marietta, Ga., where I delivered keynote remarks to more than 150 attendees who included active duty and retired service members, veterans and their families. 
￼
And on Wednesday, Nov. 14, I hosted the third annual Senate veterans appreciation reception in Washington, D.C., honoring members of Congress and staff who have served and continue to serve in the U.S. armed services.

In Other News
	•	This week, the Senate passed a resolution Senator David Perdue and I reintroduced that urges caution on roadways during the holiday season. The resolution designates the Sunday after Thanksgiving as “Drive Safer Sunday,” which falls on Nov. 25 this year. The Sunday after Thanksgiving is among the busiest highway traffic days of the year and provides an opportunity to remind drivers to use extra caution throughout the season. Our law enforcement officials and first responders are working hard to keep us safe, and we can each do our part to help each other. I wish all Georgians a safe and happy holiday season.
	•	On Thursday, the Senate passed a bill I introduced with Senator David Perdue to designate a United States Post Office in Columbus, Ga., as the “Richard W. Williams, Jr., Chapter of the Triple Nickles (555th P.I.A.) Post Office.” The service members of the Richard W. Williams, Jr., Chapter of the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion, better known as Triple Nickles, served with distinction and honor in this unit and beyond, and I’m glad to know we are one step closer to renaming this Columbus post office in their honor. As the nation’s first all-black parachute unit, these heroes courageously protected and defended our country throughout the 20th century, and I am glad to have the opportunity to thank them for their selfless actions and distinguished service.
	•	On Thursday, President Donald Trump delivered a national address in which he highlighted the major bipartisan accomplishments made by Congress on behalf of veterans. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, I’m proud of all that we have accomplished on behalf of our nation’s veterans, and I thank President Trump for his unwavering support. Since President Trump took office, we have improved accountability at the VA, we’ve made it so veterans will be able to choose when and where they receive care that best fits their needs, we’ve overhauled the appeals system to make sure veterans get timely responses and we have provided the tools to make the VA more responsive to the veterans it serves. We’ve worked hard from day one because our veterans should be a top priority, and they have been for the Senate and for President Trump and his administration.
	•	On Thursday, I was pleased the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis will be the first conditions included in the National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System, part of the 21st Century Cures Act, to advance research on these and other neurological conditions that affect so many lives. We’ve worked for some time to ensure the creation and funding for this important project. 
What’s on Tap?
The Senate will return to session on Monday, Nov. 26, following the Thanksgiving holiday. Dianne and I wish everyone a safe, happy and blessed Thanksgiving. 
Sincerely, ￼

Bolstering our Cybersecurity 
￼ 
This week, I chaired a hearing of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities to discuss cooperation between the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security in regard to defending our nation against cyber-attacks. Thank you to all of our witnesses for providing testimony on this important topic. Click here or on the image above to watch my opening remarks. 
 National Apprenticeship Week 
￼  
Apprenticeships are critical to developing a highly skilled workforce. This week is National Apprenticeship Week – a time to recognize the educators, business leaders, and workers who help prepare students for the high-skilled careers of tomorrow. This Congress, we’ve achieved some important wins to help North Country students secure apprenticeships:
	•	I helped write the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act – now law – to expand access to career training opportunities like apprenticeships.
	•	With my support, the House passed a bipartisan initiative to increase the number of women in apprenticeships and skills training programs.
	•	Senator-elect Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and I co-authored the Cyber Ready Workforce Act to help create apprenticeships in the growing field of cybersecurity.
House Leadership Elections 
On Wednesday, House Republicans gathered to elect our leadership for the 116th Congress. I'd like to Congratulate Rep. Kevin McCarthy, elected Republican Leader; Rep. Steve Scalise, elected Republican Whip; Rep. Liz Cheney, elected Chair of the Republican Conference; Rep. Mark Walker, elected Vice Chair of the Republican Conference; and Rep. Gary Palmer, elected Chair of the Republican Policy Committee. I'm looking forward to working together to get big things done for the American people and for our district next Congress.
I am proud to report that my proposal to require House leaders to vacate their leadership position should they choose to run for higher office was adopted unanimously on Thursday. This commonsense reform helps ensure a full-time leadership team to better focus on the concerns of the American people.

Congresswoman Beatty Recognized as a “Changemaker” 
On November 14, 2018, Playworks, Inc., an organization dedicated to helping schools and youth programs create recess and play environments where every child can join in, honored U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) for her work to advance civility across America and in the halls of Congress. Co-founder of the Congressional Civility and Respect Caucus, Beatty has held numerous events this year at Central Ohio schools and organizations, and in Congress on the importance of treating and speaking to each other with respect and civility.   “Being civil is not about changing people’s minds or compromising your own beliefs,” Beatty said. “Rather, it is about listening to one another and treating each other with respect—especially those with opposing views. That is why I am working hard with my fellow members of the Civility and Respect Caucus to spread and amplify this crucial message, and that starts with our young people.” Beatty continued, “I am honored to be recognized by Playworks for this all too important work, and look forward to working with them and many others to tone down the heated political rhetoric. We can disagree without being disagreeable.”

11/16/18 13:09,Blaine's Bulletin: National Diabetes Awareness Month,"￼ 
November 16, 2018

BLAINE'S BULLETIN

Do you know what disease affects 13.4% of the adult population in Missouri, costs our state $6.7 billion dollars and increases the risk of death by 50%? Approximately 689,000 Missourians have diabetes, joining the more than 30 million Americans who suffer from the disease. Diabetes is taking a toll on healthcare resources in Missouri and across the nation. More importantly, if not properly treated it can be life-threatening.  
November is recognized as National Diabetes Awareness Month, an opportunity to educate the public on prevention and management of the disease. More than 30 million Americans have the three major types of diabetes, type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes. In addition, there are also 84.1 million Americans affected by prediabetes, a condition where someone has elevated blood sugar levels, but not high enough to qualify as type 2 diabetes.  This is an enormous threat to the health of our friends, families, and communities.
Since coming to Congress I have been a member of the Congressional Caucus on Diabetes. The Caucus is the biggest advocate in the House for people suffering with diabetes and leads the support for legislative action to improve diabetes research, education, and treatment. This includes additional funding for agencies like the National Institutions of Health and the Centers for Disease Control to invest in medical research to prevent and treat diseases such as diabetes.  The research performed at NIH and CDC has led to unbelievable medical breakthroughs and saved the lives of millions of Americans.   Over the last 20 years, the number of adults with diabetes has more than tripled in the United States. Diabetes is an everyday reality for millions of Americans, including our family members, friends, neighbors and colleagues. In honor of National Diabetes Awareness Month, I hope you will reach out to your loved ones and urge them to learn more about the disease and take preventative measures to stay healthy. Please visit The Centers for Disease Control, Missouri Department of Health & Senior Services, and the American Diabetes Association websites, where you can find resources regarding diabetes prevention and management.

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 11.16.18
Friday, November 16, 2018 –                                 
Two Churches and Thanksgiving
Most Virginians and most Americans are familiar with the words of Patrick Henry, “Give me liberty or give me death!” Fewer are familiar with where he said it.
When he uttered his famous declaration to the Second Virginia Convention on March 23, 1775, Williamsburg was still the capital of Virginia, but it remained under control of the British authorities led by the King’s representative, Lord Dunmore.* So to meet freely, delegates to the convention gathered at St. John’s Church in Richmond.
I thought of this son of our Commonwealth, and his meeting place in particular, while attending a recent Congressional Prayer Breakfast.
A guest at the breakfast was Tunne Kelam, a citizen of Estonia who today represents his country in the European Parliament.
Estonia celebrated its 100th anniversary of independence this year. As a small nation in the Baltic region, Estonia was long a part of the Russian Empire. In the wake of World War I and the collapse of Russia’s tsarist regime, Estonia declared its independence and repelled an attempt by the newly-formed Soviet Union to subdue it.
Unfortunately, Estonia would find itself twenty years later caught between the socialist Nazis and the communist Soviets, two of the worst tyrannies ever to afflict humanity. During World War II, the Nazis and the Soviets would both occupy Estonia, murdering thousands of its people and sending thousands more to the death or labor camps.
Yet these calamities and the ensuing decades of Soviet oppression following World War II did not crush the spirit of the Estonian people. They rejected the attempts of the Soviets to eradicate Estonian culture and sought to restore the independence they had once enjoyed.
Mr. Kelam was one of the Estonians determined to see his country free again. In 1988, he joined with others to form the Estonian National Independence Party. This was a milestone on the road back to independence, and he was at the meeting that formed the party. Just like that meeting in Richmond over two hundred years before, these patriots met in a church.
There are other links between this story and our American one, too. Mr. Kelam told the prayer breakfast that they drew inspiration from the fact that the United States refused to recognize Soviet rule over Estonia. He took comfort that the greatest democracy in the world didn’t accept that they had been extinguished as a nation.
One of the things we celebrate on Thanksgiving is that we became that greatest country ever based on democratic principles. Over the centuries, people have come to our country for the same things the Estonians who rejected Soviet rule wanted: the right to govern ourselves, to speak according to our consciences, and to live in peace with whichever faith we practice, among others.
In our country, we have flourished while securing these rights, so taking a national day to give thanks is entirely appropriate.  
While Virginia’s Thanksgiving occurred in 1619 at Berkeley Plantation, many of the famous Thanksgivings in our history have occurred during momentous times for our democracy. The Pilgrims were celebrating the survival of their colony in 1621; George Washington issued his Thanksgiving proclamation in the first year of the Federal Government under the Constitution; Abraham Lincoln instituted the annual custom of Thanksgiving amid the Civil War. Perhaps it is during trying times that we should be most thankful for the blessings we do possess.
Tunne Kelam’s story certainly caused me to reflect on the things we can be grateful for in America. I hope you will reflect on them, too, when we join our family and friends around the table this Thanksgiving. The words of the classic Thanksgiving hymn “We Gather Together” still say it best:
We gather together to ask the Lord's blessing; He chastens and hastens His will to make known; the wicked oppressing now cease from distressing; sing praises to His Name, He forgets not His own.
During the Thanksgiving season, I hope that each and every one of you will have safe travels, find those things for which you can be thankful, and remember that in our nation of broad and diverse beliefs, we can celebrate America by giving thanks for the things which bind us.
If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.  You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671. To reach my office via email, please visit my website at www.morgangriffith.house.gov. Also on my website is the latest material from my office, including information on votes recently taken on the floor of the House of Representatives.
*Lord Dunmore would be chased from Virginia the next year by the Ninth District’s own Andrew Lewis.

Dear Friend,  As you may know, I did not seek reelection and in January of 2019 Congressman-elect David Trone will be sworn-in to represent Maryland’s Sixth District.   Under the direction of the Architect of the Capitol’s office, my office will close November 16 as preparations are underway to provide office space for incoming members and their staffs. If you have urgent matters or casework, please contact the offices of Senator Ben Cardin (202-224-4524) or Senator Chris Van Hollen (202-224-4654).   It has been a tremendous privilege to serve you in Congress. I have considered it an honor to represent the Sixth District and have greatly appreciated your patience, your trust and your time. I believe that it is the duty of Congress to tackle the big issues facing the country and to try to solve problems, but it is also in many ways “the help desk” for the federal government. I am truly proud of the work my staff in Gaithersburg and Hagerstown has done to help thousands of constituents with federal agency casework and receive their benefits.   When I was first sworn-in back in 2013, I remember feeling a tremendous sense of responsibility, a responsibility to do what was best for the people of the district. I hope that I met that standard. 
In gratitude, 
John

Good morning folks - 
You sent me to Congress with a specific mission: cut wasteful spending and make Washington squeal.  
I take seriously the responsibility you have entrusted in me to make Washington more competent and less wasteful.  
Every month, I will be researching and identifying areas of waste, abuse and inefficiencies. Then, once a month, I will give out the Squeal Award, which recognizes a Washington expense, program or concept that has proven to be wasteful and must be cut. 

Squeal Award: Does the Air Force really need $1,280 cups?
$32,000 of your hard-earned dollars spent on cups? That doesn’t sound right. But it’s true. The United States Air Force (USAF), specifically the 60th Aerial Port Squadron at Travis Air Force Base, purchased cups that cost $1,280 apiece. 
In a recent Fox News article, it was reported that this squadron has wasted nearly $56,000 on cups in the past three years.  Just this year, 25 cups were purchased for a whopping $32,000.  
This is taxpayer money being spent, folks! 
According to Dr. Heather Wilson, Secretary of the USAF, since 2016, the branch has spent $326,785 on nearly 400 cups, an average of $816 per cup. This is flat out reckless!
The purpose of the cups is to reheat drinks like coffee or tea during flight.  While enjoying a hot beverage is fine, there has to be a cheaper way.  And, what’s so special about these cups? Well, not much that we can find.  The handles even break easily and replacement parts are not available –meaning they would just have to purchase a new one completely. 
We must keep a check on our military branches and federal agencies to ensure they are wisely stewarding your money.  In this case, I want to thank Iowa’s senior senator, Chuck Grassley, in providing aggressive oversight of this case, as this negligent use of taxpayer money has to stop. 
For incredibly wasteful and unnecessary spending, I hereby present the United States Air Force with this month’s squeal award.

Thank you!

Dear Lindsey,
 Are you in need of new or better health insurance coverage?  The open enrollment period to sign up for Affordable Care Act (ACA) individual health coverage in 2019 is underway and will close on December 15th, 2018. This is the only time when individuals can purchase new health insurance in the federal marketplace or change their coverage options for the coming year.
Health insurance is often more affordable than consumers might think due the availability of federal subsidies. Health plans vary based on type of coverage and income. Most people qualify for financial assistance, and 8 in 10 people are projected to get health insurance for less than $75 per month out-of-pocket. 
Free information is available to anyone considering buying a plan on the marketplace:  you can visit www.healthcare.gov or call the toll-free Consumer Call Center at 1-800-318-2596.  The Call Center is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You can also connect with qualified individuals in your area who can help you find a plan that is right for you by visiting https://Localhelp.HealthCare.gov.  
Despite efforts by some to undermine the insurance marketplace, last year 519,803  North Carolinians signed up for health care coverage in the ACA marketplace. As your representative in Congress, I will continue fighting to preserve the ACA’s protections and benefits, as well as other health programs like Medicare and Medicaid that so many North Carolinians rely on for care.
For resources and frequently asked questions regarding the ACA, visit my website at www.price.house.gov/open-enrollment or contact my constituent services staff at (919) 967-7924. To stay in touch regarding health care policy and many other important issues, please connect with me on Facebook and Twitter or subscribe to my e-newsletter.

Spc. Trevor Win'E  
Honoring One Of Our Own 
Friends,   I am excited to announce our bill to name the U.S. Post Office on N. Tustin Street in Orange after local hero Specialist Trevor Win’E has been passed by the Senate. The bill is now on its way to President Trump's desk and will soon be law.  On April 30, 2004, while serving in the lead truck of a military convoy, Spc. Win'E suffered critical injuries from an attack by an improvised explosive device in Tikrit, Iraq. The following day, at age 22, Trevor died.  While nothing will replace Trevor, this post office will memorialize him for the community who loved him so much. We will always be reminded of his bravery, his service, and his sacrifice for our community and our country.   This post office will also serve as a reminder of the sacrifices made by countless service members like Trevor. We must never forget those who make the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Each and everyone of them is a hero.  I am honored to have been able to recognize Trevor. He will be greatly missed but never forgotten.   
Sincerely,

Dear Friend,   Health insurance can protect you and your family from astronomical costs when a serious accident or illness occurs. Did you know that the average cost for a three-day hospital stay is $30,000? Or that a broken leg can cost up to $7,500? Health insurance helps protect you from unexpected costs like these. Coverage could be more affordable than you think.  November 1st marked the start of HealthCare.gov’s open enrollment period for 2019.  
￼ 
 From now until December 15, you can purchase a plan or renew your coverage through HealthCare.gov. Once you sign up, you will get coverage that starts on January 1, 2019.   Here are five facts you need to know about enrolling in coverage or renewing your coverage: 
	•	The open enrollment period for HealthCare.gov for 2019 began on November 1 and ends on December 15, 2018. The open enrollment period is short – only 45 days. Beat the rush and sign up early.
	•	Coverage could be more affordable than you think.  That’s because financial help is available.  Most people using HealthCare.gov qualify for financial assistance.  As a result, for 2019, 8 in 10 people can find plans for less than $75 per month.  
	•	If you had coverage through HealthCare.gov for 2018, make sure to head back to update your information and compare your options for 2019 by December 15. Every year, plans and prices change. This year, it’s more important than ever to shop around!  You may find a plan that fits you better, for cheaper.
	•	Free help is available. If you have questions about signing up or want to talk through your options with a trained professional, free help is just a call or click away. The Call Center is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week – call 1-800-318-2596. Or visit https://localhelp.healthcare.gov where you will find organizations in your area that have trained enrollment assisters.
	•	Virginia has expanded Medicaid. Thanks to the bipartisan work of the Virginia General Assembly and the leadership of Governor Ralph Northam, Virginia has finally expanded its Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act. The Commonwealth began accepting applications for expanded health coverage on November 1. More information about the new Medicaid health coverage and eligibility rules is available at www.coverva.org. The website includes an eligibility screening tool to help individuals assess whether they may qualify for Medicaid coverage. 
Take the time to learn about your options, and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact my office.
Very Truly Yours, 
￼

U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s eNewsletter - - Week of November 11, 2018

Senator McConnell Unanimously Elected to Serve as Majority Leader for the 116th Congress 
￼ The doors of the Office of the Senate Republican Leader in the United States Capitol 
On Wednesday, Senator Mitch McConnell was unanimously re-elected by his colleagues to serve as Senate Majority Leader. Senator McConnell is only the second Kentuckian to lead his party in the U.S. Senate.  The other Senator from Kentucky to serve as party leader was Alben Barkley.
U.S. Senate Majority Leader McConnell said, “I am grateful to my colleagues for again placing their trust in me. As Majority Leader, I set the Senate’s schedule and agenda. Therefore, I have and will continue to consistently choose to prioritize legislation and nominations that will directly benefit the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I am proud of our incredible record of achievement. Working with President Trump, we have made the last two years the most productive in moving our country right-of-center since I came to Washington.
“We passed tax reform that put more money in the pockets of hard working Kentuckians and helped people get back to work. We stopped the War on Coal in its tracks. We passed landmark legislation to combat the opioid epidemic. We also began a transformation of the federal judiciary, ended Obamacare’s individual mandate, and provided relief to community financial institutions. After harmful Obama-era cuts to our military, we rebuilt our defense forces and delivered a well-earned pay raise for our servicemembers at Kentucky’s military installations and we delivered improved care to our veterans.
“When the new Congress begins next year, there is more work to be done. I will keep fighting for Kentucky in the Senate, and as Majority Leader, I look forward to many more accomplishments for our state.”

Senate Passes Legislation Benefiting Kentucky Waterways, Jobs 
Kentucky employer praises Senator McConnell for his leadership
On Wednesday, the Senate passed bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the U.S. Coast Guard and to support the brave men and women who put themselves in harm’s way every single day. This important legislation also includes the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (VIDA), which will benefit Kentucky and its 13,000 maritime jobs.
Senator McConnell praised Senate passage saying, “America calls on our Coast Guard to protect our ports and coasts, to safeguard the shipping lanes that enable American commerce, and to stem the tide of illegal drugs before they reach our shores. By passing this bipartisan legislation, the Senate fulfilled an important promise to some of the brave men and women who have taken an oath to keep us safe. Aspects of this legislation are particularly important to states like my home state of Kentucky – the heart of our nation’s inland waterways system.”
“For too long, maritime workers have struggled under a complex system of overlapping and duplicative regulations. They make normal shipping functions needlessly difficult, including the incidental discharge of ballast water. A confusing web of rules from states, the Coast Guard, and the EPA leave operators to face constant uncertainty -- and lead to higher costs,” Senator McConnell added. “This bipartisan legislation replaces the existing system with a uniform, cost-effective, and national standard enforced by the Coast Guard. For the 13,000 Kentuckians whose jobs depend on our state’s inland waterways, this provision can help cut costs, promote efficiency, and protect our natural waters.”
“I am thankful for the leadership and support of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in getting the VIDA legislation through the Senate and in recognizing its importance to the inland waterways industry, which plays a vital role in our nation’s economy and in particular the Commonwealth of Kentucky. VIDA fixes a burdensome patchwork system of regulations and provides clear and consistent regulations for inland waterways operators while maintaining the high standards of environmental protection under the direction of the Coast Guard. Once again, Leader McConnell has stepped up for the nation and the Commonwealth of Kentucky,” said Matt Ricketts, President & CEO of Crounse Corporation in Paducah, Kentucky.
The legislation now goes to the House for approval and then will be sent to President Trump for his signature. Follow Senator McConnell's press offices on Twitter at @McConnellPress and @SenateMajLeader to stay up to date on the latest on what is happening with this legislation.

McConnell Op-Ed: Will Democrats Choose to Continue Bipartisan Achievements in New Congress, or Put Politics First?
￼
This week, Senator McConnell penned an op-ed for FoxNews.com, writing:
""Last Tuesday I was proud to see that the American people voted to keep Republicans in control of the U.S. Senate. But we also learned that, come January, the Republican Senate majority will be dealing with a House of Representatives under Democratic control...
""So make no mistake. The Senate has proven its ability to reach bipartisan solutions to some of the most pressing challenges facing our nation. And looking ahead to the coming year, there will be no shortage of opportunities to continue this impressive record of cooperation across the aisle and across the Capitol. What we can make of those opportunities will depend on our Democratic colleagues. Will they choose to go it alone and simply make political points? Or will they choose to work together and actually make a difference?""

Tester Pushes Bill to Address Missing and Murdered Native Women Epidemic Closer to Final Vote
Savanna's Act named in honor of Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, who was murdered last year
￼
 
(U.S. Senate) - After introducing Savanna's Act last year to help address the Missing and Murdered Native Women epidemic, U.S. Senator Jon Tester and his colleagues on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee unanimously voted to advance this critical piece of legislation today, moving it one step closer to becoming law.  ""When it comes to ending this epidemic, Native communities have to navigate a jurisdictional maze of bureaucracy,"" Tester said. ""That's why we need Savanna's Act, to improve information sharing between law enforcement agencies, establish better response protocols, and put an end to these crimes committed across Indian Country.""  According to the National Institute of Justice, more than 80 percent of native women have experienced violence-almost half within the last year. As a senior member and former Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Tester has worked hard to raise awareness about this epidemic, support survivors, and bring their assailants to justice.  Tester's bill will require the Department of Justice to better collect and report crime data across Indian Country and increase access to federal crime databases that track crimes against Native Americans. It will also create standard guidelines for responding to cases of missing and murdered Native Americans, laying out a clear framework for cooperation between tribal, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.   Earlier this year, Tester secured a historic $133 million to help tribes assist survivors of violent crimes through the Crime Victims Fund and is sponsoring legislation to make this source of funding permanent. The SURVIVE Act was passed unanimously out of Committee and is currently awaiting a vote on the Senate floor.  Tester also recently called on the Senate to hold a hearing on the Missing and Murdered Native Women epidemic, after introducing a Senate Resolution that designated May 5, 2018 a ""National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Native Women and Girls.""

Dear Friend,

A Message from Congressman Sandy Levin
November 2018
Dear Friend: 
It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve the people of Macomb and Oakland Counties for the past 36 years in Congress. I have tried to live up to the trust that you have placed in me and to stay grounded in the values of my parents and family.
Much has changed in Congress, the Nation and world during these years, more good than bad, but certainly some of both. One constant for me has been the belief that public officials have an obligation to say what they believe after digging deeply into the facts and consulting broadly. And we must talk to each other, not at each other, recognizing that conviction and compromise can and must coexist.
There has been important progress and achievements over the years, including defending Social Security from privatization proposals, helping rescue the U.S. auto industry during the ""Great Recession,"" creating the Drug Free Communities Program to support anti-drug coalitions, and - of course - expanding access to affordable health care to millions of Americans, even as the work continues on so many problems, including making trade policies fairer for American workers. Below is an update on the issues I have been working on during my last term in office.
It has been a privilege to work with all those who have helped me along the way to understand and attempt to respond to the concerns and challenges facing people of every race, religion and background. Should you have thoughts or suggestions you would like to convey, please email me at RepSanderLevin@mail.house.gov or call my office in Roseville at (586) 498-7122.
Sincerely,  ￼  Sandy Levin

Issues Update

Stopping the Offshoring of U.S. Jobs
I opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) 25 years ago because it failed to include basic labor and environmental protections, have fought to address these fundamental issues in every subsequent trade agreement, and now am working to ensure any renegotiated NAFTA addresses these critical issues. Earlier this year, I led a letter signed by 183 Democrats urging United States Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer to stop the outsourcing of American jobs by requiring Mexico to end the wage suppression of its workers through the denial of basic labor rights.
￼
Meeting with Michigan communications workers to discuss need for fair trade and tax policies
With the recent release of the text of an agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada on a revised NAFTA, there must now be active work with Mexico to achieve basic changes in their law and practice as a prerequisite for approval of a renegotiated NAFTA by the U.S. Congress. Any agreement must end Mexico's so-called ""protection agreements"" entered into with no worker participation or approval, and resulting in Mexican workers being paid only $1 to $2 an hour. This structure has denied Mexican workers a path to the middle class and has directly contributed to the loss of jobs and suppression of wages for U.S. workers.
Strengthening Medicare
After adamantly opposing prior efforts to end the guarantee of Medicare benefits through privatization proposals, I have focused on strengthening the existing program. Last summer, I introduced the Medicare Dental, Vision, and Hearing Benefit Act of 2017 (H.R. 3111), which would expand the Medicare benefit package to include dental, vision, and hearing care.
The current gap in Medicare coverage has harmful consequences for older Americans. Poor dental care is closely associated with systemic health problems; vision loss is the third leading chronic condition among older adults and is closely associated with clinical depression and injuries due to falls; and hearing loss is a socially isolating condition that impacts about two-thirds of older Americans, yet only about 30 percent of individuals who could benefit from a hearing aid actually utilize one.
Preserving Drug Free Community Funding
21 years ago, then Representative Rob Portman (R-OH) and I co-sponsored the Drug Free Communities (DFC) Act to provide seed money to local anti-drug coalitions. For more than two decades, the coalitions in Oakland and Macomb Counties have thrived, and there has been an exponential growth of drug-free community coalitions throughout the United States.
In Michigan alone, from 2000 to 2023 there will have been $8,408,356 granted to local coalitions. All of this money goes directly to educate, advocate, and offer prevention services to promote healthier communities.
Over the last two years, we have successfully fought against the proposed defunding and elimination of the Drug Free Communities Act. The program was not only saved, but saw an increase in funding. At a time when our youth and communities are facing issues like the opioid epidemic, proliferation of drug abuse issues, and the ever-evolving problem of e-cigarette use among teens, local organizations dedicated to education and prevention have never been more important.
￼
Addressing the importance of drug free community coalitions at CADCA's 27th Annual National Leadership Forum
Protecting the Great Lakes
With my regional colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we have been leading efforts in Congress to protect this vital natural resource and fund the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI), including turning back misguided proposals from the Trump Administration to eliminate or significantly slash funding since it entered office.
Over the last eight years, the federal government has invested in more than 2,000 GLRI projects to clean up the Great Lakes, fight invasive species, target nearshore nonpoint pollution, restore habitat and protect wildlife, and promote environmental education and partnerships.
Fighting for Responsible and Fair Taxes
At the end of 2017, the Congress passed a partisan tax bill that would increase our nation's debt by $1.5 trillion, while proving huge tax breaks to corporations and wealthy individuals. The negative effect on our nation's debt is already being felt with the deficit growing by 17% in 2018 alone.
￼
Highlighting the need to close one of the biggest tax loopholes for the very wealthy
According to data from the non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), those with income of $1 million or more would receive an average aggregate tax cut of over $64,000 under the new tax law, while nearly 5 million households with income below $100,000 a year will actually see their taxes go up by over $500. This past September, the House of Representatives passed an additional bill that would add trillions more to the deficit by extending provisions, among others, that would cut the top income tax rate for those earning over $500,000 a year; double the exemption for the estate tax to $11 million for individuals and $22 million for couples; and provide a tax deduction for pass-through business income with 56% of the tax benefit going to those earning over $1 million a year. I fought and voted against both bills with the firm conviction that they were unfair and irresponsible.
Rebuilding Our Roads
In June, the federal Department of Transportation announced a $97 million Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) Grant for Mound Road to help restore and improve the 30-year old roadway, transforming it into a next generation commercial corridor.
I worked closely with county and municipal officials from the outset of the grant application process, including by writing a letter in support to U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao in August 2017, and teaming with other Congressional leaders to send a joint letter of support this year.
Preventing Gun Violence
50 years ago, one week after Bobby Kennedy was assassinated, I spoke on the issue of gun violence at Wayne State University, highlighting the paralysis of public policy to respond given the political muscle of the gun lobby. This same roadblock continues to exist today, even after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida earlier this year, and so many shootings before and after.
And yet, we have seen a community's grief transformed into a national demand for action, led by students here in Michigan and around the nation. It is far past time for the Congress to respond with common-sense reforms to reduce gun violence, including closing loopholes in the current background checks process and banning the sale of military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.
￼
Meeting with Berkley students about gun violence
Seeking Bipartisan Immigration Reform
We need comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, puts an end to family separation at the border, and provides appropriate border security.
Of particular concern in the metro-Detroit area, has been detention and attempted deportation of members of the Chaldean community, most of whom have lived and worked here for many years if not decades, have U.S. citizen children, and who would face an immediate threat to their safety if deported to Iraq. I worked to stay their deportation back in July 2017, demanded information about Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) rationale and plan for deporting the Chaldean-Americans, and personally visited a number of them being held in a detention center in Youngstown, Ohio.
Demanding Justice for the Unemployed
The Michigan Supreme Court is currently considering a case filed on behalf of jobless workers who were wrongly accused of fraud by the state's unemployment insurance (UI) system. Along with local advocates for these workers, I led the fight to uncover and demand a response to this scandal in which over 40,000 Michiganders, who were unemployed and looking for work, were falsely accused of fraud between 2013 and 2015 because of flaws in the Michigan Integrated Data Automated System (MiDAS). Those impacted suffered financial hardship as the state garnished their wages and seized their property, forcing some into bankruptcy. This was a serious injustice and everyone affected deserves to be fully compensated for lost benefits, fees, penalties, legal expenses and other costs.

11/15/18 18:31,Yet another attack on our wild creatures,"Update | Thursday, November 15, 2018
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼ 
  
Gray wolves are under attack from some of their worst predators: special interests.  This iconic species have been driven to near extinction by humans. Gray wolves are currently protected by the federal Endangered Species Act in much of the contiguous United States, with the exception of certain areas Congress has already carved out in the west, including Eastern Oregon.   Since House Republicans have been in charge, they've had an abysmal record on animal welfare and their first proposed legislation after the recess was to remove all gray wolves from protection under the Endangered Species Act, giving full management control to states. In Oregon, wolves are slowly fighting their way to a fragile recovery despite problematic management by the state. For far too long, Congress has played games with the future of our beloved wild creatures. Scaling back protections now is not only wrong, it has no basis in science. 
But, there is hope—the days of Republican control of the House are numbered. When Democrats take control of the House next Congress, I will fight to put an end to the GOP putting politics over facts. I will fight to let actual scientists inform our decisions, and will focus our efforts on actually funding programs that preserve our wild creatures, protect our lands, and save our planet.
When it comes to the environment and protecting endangered species, I believe science—not mindless politics—should rule the day.

Courage, 
￼

Dear Friend,
As my tenure in Congress comes to an end, my offices are preparing for an orderly transfer to Representative-elect Tom Malinowski for New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District.  
Accordingly, my Washington office will close Tuesday, November 20th.   
Subsequently, all tours offered by my staff have ended.  Tours of the U.S. Capitol can still be reserved and conducted by the official tour guides of the Capitol Visitors Center.  Tour requests can also be made via the offices of New Jersey Senators Cory Booker and Robert Menendez. 
Constituent services offered by Westfield and Flemington District Office staff will remain uninterrupted until Thursday, December 20.   
Residents who have open casework issues will be contacted in the coming days with the option to transfer their cases to Representative-elect Malinowski’s office in the new Congress or end their inquiry altogether.  No new constituents casework will be accepted.  All new casework inquiries will be forwarded to the offices of Senators Booker and Menendez.  If you have any questions or concerns, please call 908-518-7733 or 908-788-6900.  
My deepest gratitude goes to all of the residents of this wonderful congressional district.  It has been an honor to represent you in the U.S. House of Representatives for the last ten years.  The election is now over. We must move the Nation forward in a bipartisan and united way, treating each other with civility and respect, as I have always done and will continue to do.

Dear Friends –
We need to update the Hartford region’s infrastructure. Our highways are in a state of disrepair, the North End of Hartford is cut off from the rest of the city, we’re blocked from the riverfront, and, most urgently, our levees are in need of repair. I’ve been holding different discussions throughout the region to move the conversation forward on the future of our region’s infrastructure. 
On November 20th from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM I am hosting a public forum on the I-84 and I-91 tunnel proposal at Hartford Communities That Care (2550 Main Street, Hartford, CT 06120). We have a once in a lifetime opportunity to correct the planning mistakes of the past, reconnect neighborhoods, recapture the riverfront, and foster job growth in our communities. What we decide will impact generations to come. Please add your voice to this important dialogue on Greater Hartford’s future. 
More information about the I-84/I-91 tunnel proposal can be found here. Please call my District Office at 860-278-8888 with any questions.
Hope to see you on Tuesday night!
Best wishes,

Climate change is already happening. According to experts, we know that methane is responsible for about a quarter of the climate warming. Methane is a greenhouse gas that is 25 times more potent in its global warming potential than carbon dioxide and is also a precursor to ground level ozone, a health-harmful air pollutant. Because of its potency as a greenhouse gas and its atmospheric life, reducing methane emissions is critical to mitigating global climate change.
Nearly one third of methane pollution comes from oil and natural gas operations. In 2010, the Government Accountability Office found that a significant amount of natural gas was being wasted through venting and flaring at oil and gas production sites on Federal and Indian lands. To prevent the unnecessary pollution and waste of resources, BLM developed the Methane and Waste Prevention Rule requiring oil and gas companies to limit the leaking or flaring of natural gas on public lands and pay royalties on captured gas. Because the primary constituent of natural gas is methane, this rule would prevent an estimated 1.8 million tons of methane to be released into the atmosphere in just the first 10 years.
Unfortunately, the Trump administration has moved to rescind the BLM Methane and Waste Prevention Rule as well as weaken EPA’s methane leak inspection and repair requirements for oil and gas operations. Instead of being required to perform leak inspections as frequently as every six months on drilling equipment, the new EPA revision proposes from a year to as infrequently as once every two years for low-producing wells. The proposal would also double the amount of time a company could wait before repairing a methane leak from 30 to 60 days and double the amount of time required between inspections of the equipment that traps and compresses the natural gas, from once every three months to once every six months. Most concerningly, it would allow energy companies operating in states that have their own state-level methane standards follow those standards instead of the federal ones. That would include states where the pollution standards have been more lax than federal standards. In sum, these proposed EPA revisions would weaken emission control standards for the oil and natural gas sector, allowing at least an estimated 380,000 additional tons of methane by 2025.
According to the EPA’s own analysis, the proposed rules would not only pump hundreds of thousands more tons of the climate-warming gas into the atmosphere, but also add millions of dollars in agricultural, health-care and other costs to the U.S. economy because of climate change. Not only that, but according to the International Energy Agency global oil and gas methane emissions could be reduced by up to 75 percent using technologies available today and could be reduced by 50 percent at zero net cost to companies. Simply put, reducing methane emissions is one of the most cost friendly ways of combating global warming.
While the rule to rescind the BLM rule was just finalized, if you share my concern about these unnecessary two rule makings, you can still find out how to comment on the EPA rulemaking here.    To keep current with the latest climate change news and information, follow the Safe Climate Caucus on Facebook and Twitter.

Dear Lindsey, 
  
On October 12, 2018, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance amounts for Medicare Parts A and B for 2019. Enrollees are now able to view their options for receiving Medicare benefits. 
The Medicare Open Enrollment period began on October 15, 2018 and ends December 7, 2018. CMS has made improvements to the Medicare.gov website to help beneficiaries compare options and decide if Original Medicare or Medicare Advantage is right for them. The site also now includes an out of pocket calculator that will provide information on both overall costs and prescription drug costs for enrollees. You can also obtain assistance and information by calling Medicare toll free at 1-800-MEDICARE or APPRISE at 1-800-783-7067. APPRISE is a free health insurance counseling program offered by the Pennsylvania Department of Aging.  
Additionally, last Congress, I sponsored the bipartisan Medicare Beneficiary Preservation of Choice Act. Signed into law in 2016, my legislation restores the critical 90-day re-enrollment period for Medicare Advantage plans that was taken away by the Affordable Care Act. If you choose the wrong Medicare Advantage plan during open enrollment, you will have the opportunity to change plans between January 1st and March 31st because of my legislation. Restoring this re-enrollment period gives seniors the flexibility they need to make sure they choose the best Medicare Advantage plan that works for them. This restoration takes effect in January 2019. 
If you have questions about Medicare open enrollment, please call our district offices:

Dear Friend, 
You have until now through December 15th to find a health plan that works for you and your family. You can log onto healthcare.gov to get covered today. 
￼ 
Honoring our Veterans 
On Veteran's Day, and every day, we must honor the sacrifices made by our brave men and women in uniform, and remember the generations before them who defended and protected our ideals and freedoms. They continue to be models of patriotism and courage, and it is a great responsibility to ensure our veterans have a simple transition back into civilian life. You can read my full statement here.  
￼ 
I spoke at the Veteran’s Day wreath laying ceremony, honoring the service and sacrifice of our veterans. On behalf of the San Antonio community, we thank our servicemembers for their commitment to our country.  
￼ ￼ ￼ 
Team Castro joined other community members at the San Antonio National Cemetery for the 100th anniversary commemoration of the WWI armistice and in honor of Texas’ WWI veterans. 
￼ ￼ 
District Update 
Team Castro joined Doctors Without Borders panel discussion on migration from Central America; attended the Communities in Schools panel discussion about ongoing challenges faced by our community’s students; and joined the Alamo Area Council of Governments for an update on compatible development initiatives between Joint Base San Antonio and our community. 
￼ ￼ ￼ 
Foreign Affairs  
As we mark 100 years of U.S.-Australia collaboration on diplomatic, cultural, economic and military issues, we must also come together to better understand what lies beyond within our Universe and how this bilateral relationship can support such exploration. I welcomed the passage of a bipartisan resolution I authored with Rep. Elise Stefanik (NY-21) that affirms United States-Australia space exploration, research and utilization cooperation (H.Res.1052). You can read my full statement here. 
￼ 
I also spoke this week at the National Bureau of Asian Research’s 2018 Pacific Energy Summit on ways in which U.S. and Asia policymakers can collaborate on advancing shared trade or energy objectives.
￼ 
Importance of Education 
It was great to visit KIPP Aspire Middle School to speak with students about the importance of pursuing an education. 
￼ ￼ ￼ 
As Congress continues to address issues that directly affect San Antonians’ daily lives, I want to hear from you. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or questions for me by calling my office at 210-348-8216 or reaching out online through my website, castro.house.gov.

Dear Friend,
￼
It’s National Apprenticeship Week and I hope you’ll join me in recognizing the importance of career training in America. 
My family jokes that I’m ‘an electrician with a tie’ and I look at
￼
issues in Congress through that lens. That’s why it was a perfect fit for me to talk about my work to expand apprenticeships and make career training more affordable on This Old House! 
I talked to VoTech students about my experiences as an electrical apprentice and how a traditional four-year degree is not for everyone.

Hey Thanks, Nashville  Nashville Scene  A thank-you letter from U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper to the city of Nashville.  The 2018 midterm races that still aren’t over  Vox  We’re more than a week out from Election Day, and multiple Senate, House, and governor races still haven’t been called.  Federal judge says Florida voters can fix ballot signature  The Associated Press TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — A federal judge early Thursday ordered that voters in Florida be given until this weekend to fix their ballots if they haven’t been counted due to mismatched signatures. 
U.S. Budget Deficit Jumps to $100 Billion at Start of Fiscal Year  Bloomberg The U.S. recorded a $100.5 billion budget deficit in October, an increase of about 60 percent from a year earlier, as spending grew twice as fast as revenue.  China’s military power could match America’s by 2050  Vox Chinese President Xi Jinping wants his military to be as powerful as America’s by 2050 — and his control of major economic and military institutions in his country could help him do just that.  Theresa May faces hostility on all sides as she fights to save Brexit deal  POLITICO British prime minister rocked by resignations of two Cabinet ministers as she tries to sell her EU divorce deal.  Details of Brexit Deal Pay Heed to Complicated Ties  The Wall Street Journal  The Brexit agreement runs to 585 pages.  Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook’s Leaders Fought Through Crisis  The New York Times This account of Facebook’s cascading crises, much of which has not been previously reported, is based on interviews with more than 50 people.  School security costs billions, but what works often isn’t clear  The Washington Post Although school security has grown into a $2.7 billion market — an estimate that does not account for the billions more spent on armed campus police officers — little research has been done on which safety measures do and do not protect students from gun violence.  A Surprise Discovery Around a Lonely Star  The Atlantic A planet more than three times the mass of Earth may be orbiting in a star system long thought to be barren.

Dear Friend, 
Folks from across the district gathered in schools, at Legion Hall’s, outside courthouses and elsewhere earlier this week to pay tribute to the selfless heroes who have defended our country against all enemies, foreign and domestic. 
Many of our veterans didn’t get the “thank you” they deserved when they returned from deployment but thankfully, programs like the Honor Flight have given many of them the opportunity for a proper celebration. 
The Honor Flight is a nationwide program which takes our veterans on a whirlwind trip to Washington, DC to see the memorials that remember the wars they served in. Originally started to enable World War II veterans to be able to see the World War II Memorial, many Honor Flights are now taking veterans from the Korea and Vietnam Wars. 
I generally get to personally thank our veterans on the Honor Flight when they arrive in Washington. It’s an awesome opportunity to visit with them and see the joy, and some sadness, as they see the memorials dedicated to their respective wars. However, I know the entire trip from the airport to the memorials to the bus ride home and final arrival is filled with the celebration they deserve. 
It’s an emotional moment when a group of Honor Flight veterans comes through the airport. Everyone stops what they are doing to acknowledge them as they board their flight. It’s quite a sight to see motorcycle and police escorts accompanying their bus as it travels the interstate. Final arrival home, which doesn’t take place till late in the evening, is an incredible celebration after a long day. Friends, family and community members wait with American flags and cheer for the veterans as they and their escorts are announced and presented with tokens of appreciation. 
Our North Missouri veterans are served by several Honor Flight Networks across the district including the Great River Honor Flight, Central Missouri Honor Flight, Heartland Honor Flight, and the Honor Flight Network of Kansas City. Local organizations raise money to fund the Honor Flight so the veterans get to go free of charge. I’m thankful that our veterans are given this unique opportunity. 
We always say that there is no way we can adequately thank our veterans for their service and that is certainly true. However, programs like the Honor Flight and the countless Veterans Day ceremonies and breakfasts that take place across North Missouri continue to serve as a reminder that freedom isn’t free. I’m glad that the busyness of life has yet to stand in the way of taking time each year to remember those who have enabled us to go about our daily life unencumbered. 
Sincerely,
￼ 
Sam Graves

MILITARY ACADEMY NOMINATIONS  - DUE DECEMBER 14TH -
￼

Rep.  Norma Torres addresses public safety explorer’s from Chino Police Department, Montclair PD and Pomona PD, to learn more about how they can earn up to $500,000 for their Bachelor’s degree.


Dear Neighbor,
As your Congresswoman, it is my honor to nominate students to attend our country’s top military service academies: the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Air Force Academy, and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. The fifth service academy, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, does not require a congressional nomination for appointment.
I nominate one individual for each academy slot through a competitive process. The students nominated and accepted to the nation’s military academies will receive four years of tuition-free college. High school juniors and seniors, and recent graduates, are eligible to apply. 
The nomination application period closes on December 14th, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. PST.  
 If you have any questions, please contact Marisol Guerra of my staff at Marisol.Guerra@mail.house.gov or 909-481-6474. You can read our list of frequently asked questions HERE and download the application HERE.  It is my hope that our students are taking advantage of every avenue to higher education. Please help me share this life-changing opportunity for our students.   Sincerely, 
￼



￼

Rep. Torres meets a potential applicant during one of two Military Academy information nights her office hosts every year. 



￼

Rep. Torres congratulates area high school students accepted to the U.S. military service academies in 2018. This year, students received $2.5 million collectively in scholarships.

It is an honor and a privilege to serve as your United States Senator and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for once again allowing me to serve you. I want to remind you that my offices are available to provide assistance with federal agencies through casework and also to get your legislative opinions and concerns to me so I can put them to use in Washington. Together we’ve accomplished so much - from combatting the opioid epidemic and fighting for our miners' pensions, to securing funding for the vital agencies that serve our communities – and I look forward to continuing to work together to move our home state forward in the days and years ahead. 
  
Honoring our Nation's Heroes 
It is my hope that each of our Veterans and their families had a memorable Veterans Day this weekend. Time and time again throughout our country’s history, West Virginians have been at the forefronts of our fights for liberty, justice, and peace. These are our neighbors, family members, co-workers, and friends. Most importantly, they are our fellow Americans. I’ve always said that West Virginia is one of the most patriotic states in the country.
We shouldn’t honor these brave men and women just once a year, though. Showing our appreciation is something we should do each and every day. As a nation, we should show our gratitude to our veterans by providing whatever they need when they return home. I am pleased with the progress we are making for our state and nation’s Veterans, but we’ve got more work to do. Too many of our Veterans are homeless, jobless, and without access to adequate healthcare. I won’t stop fighting to make sure that this country keeps its promises to our Veterans and provides our service members with the care, benefits, and services they have earned and deserve.
It is because of them that America remains a beacon of hope and liberty for people across the world. May God continue to bless our Veterans and may He bless the United States of America and the state of West Virginia.

FMCSA Military Driver Programs 
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) is proud to help experienced military drivers transition to commercial driving careers.  
Below are FMCSA programs that make it easier, quicker and less expensive to obtain a commercial driver’s license (CDL).
	•	The Military Skills Test Waiver Program exempts qualified military drivers from having to take the CDL skills test. More than 23,000 service members and veterans have taken advantage of this exemption. 
	•	The Even Exchange Program (or Knowledge Test Waiver) allows for qualified military drivers to be exempt from the knowledge test. When the exemption is used in conjunction with the Military Skills Test Waiver, this allows a qualified military driver to exchange his or her military license for a CDL.  
	•	The Under 21 Military CDL Pilot Program will soon launch. This study research program will assess the safety impacts of allowing qualified military drivers younger than 21 to operate CMVs in interstate commerce. 
	•	The Commercial Motor Vehicle Operator Safety Training Grant Program assists current or former members of the United States Armed Forces (including National Guard and reserve members) and their spouses in receiving training to transition to the motor carrier industry.  
More information on these FMCSA military driver programs is available on the website.

REPRESENTATIVE ADRIANO ESPAILLAT HOSTS EVENT HONORING TUSKEGEE AIRMEN

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) will host a post office renaming ceremony in honor of the Tuskegee Airmen on Monday, November 19th from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at the United States Post Office (USPS) facility located at 99 Macombs Place in New York, which will be renamed as the “Tuskegee Airmen Post Office Building” following passage of Rep. Espaillat’s bill, H.R. 4406, which was signed into law earlier this year.

“The Tuskegee Airmen was a popular name given to the first all-black squadron activated into service by the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1941 during the peak of World War II. They were known for breaking racial barriers in the military and were active in fighting against Jim Crow laws in the South. Renaming this post office facility after the Tuskegee Airmen is a fitting tribute to honor their memory and contributions to this country, and I am honored to have passed legislation that was signed into law to help bring this event to fruition,” concluded Rep. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13).

“Aviadores de Tuskegee fue un nombre popular dado al primer escuadrón integrado completamente por personas de la raza negra que entró en servicio en el Cuerpo Aéreo del Ejército de los Estados Unidos en 1941, durante el momento más álgido de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Eran conocidos por romper barreras raciales en el Ejército y participaron activamente en la lucha contra las leyes de Jim Crow en el Sur. Cambiar el nombre de esta oficina portal por el de los Aviadores de Tuskegee es un tributo apropiado para honrar su memoria y contribuciones a este país, y me siento honrado de haber logrado la aprobación de una legislación que fue promulgada como ley para ayudar a que este evento diera frutos"", concluyó el congresista Adriano Espaillat (NY-13).

11/14/18 16:46,Protecting Veterans and Low-Income Families from Housing Discrimination,"￼
Dear Friend,   
As a fair housing lawyer, I witnessed the pain experienced by families who were discriminated against as they searched for a home. I’ll never stop working to make sure that every Virginian can live free from that pain.  
That’s why this week I worked with Senator Orrin Hatch to introduce the bipartisan Fair Housing Improvement Act of 2018 to protect veterans and low-income families from housing discrimination. Many veterans and low-income families pay their rent through vouchers, and as it stands now, landlords can discriminate against them, denying housing based on how they pay rent. The Fair Housing Improvement Act would expand the Fair Housing Act’s protections to prohibit housing discrimination based on source of income or veteran status, giving more families access to affordable housing and a shot at economic mobility. Housing decisions should be made on a potential tenant’s merits, not harmful prejudices that hurt the nation’s veterans and families.  
Read more about the bill here >>  
I’m proud that this legislation will help us continue a long pursuit to protect all Americans from discrimination.  
Sincerely,   
￼

Dear Friend,
I just met the new Democratic members elected to serve in the 116th Congress and I am inspired and hopeful.  The new Congress will have a record number of female members – over 100 – and will be the most diverse in American history!  
￼
Democrats will focus on lowering health care costs, especially prescription drugs, raising wages by rebuilding America, fixing our broken campaign finance system, and strengthening our nation’s ethics laws.   Veterans Day 2018 was memorable as we marked the 100-year centenary of WWI Armistice Day.  Our community is a patriotic one where we honor our veterans and their families for their service every day of the year.  I am grateful to all who have worn the uniform in honor and selfless sacrifice. 
￼
Open enrollment is happening now in Florida!  You can sign up for quality and affordable health insurance at HealthCare.gov and you and your family can be covered!  Join the over 1.7M Floridians who last year chose a policy that works for them and their family.  You can receive free, independent advice from Covering Florida Navigators at CoveringFlorida.org and other grassroots experts. 
￼
This week, Republicans in Congress have scheduled a vote on the following bill:  H.R. 6784 – This bill would deliver a damaging blow to the continued recovery of gray wolves by removing Endangered Species Act (ESA) protections for the species in the contiguous 48 states.  ESA listing decisions should be made in accordance with clear scientific evidence and the law and not be micromanaged by Congress.  Also concerning, if Congress can arbitrarily remove protections for wolves it can similarly remove protections for other treasured and iconic endangered species, including the Florida Panther – or even further down the slippery slope to threatened species like the manatee.  I look forward to serving in our new majority next Congress, and pledge to continue to work on what matters to you especially boosting wages, lowering the costs of prescription drugs, strengthening health care under Medicare and Medicaid, tackling the impacts and costs of the changing climate and working to ensure a healthy and clean environment.  My entire team and I are here to serve you!  Thank you.  Sincerely, 

Kathy Castor

Health Insurance Open Enrollment: What You Need to Know  
Dear Friends,  
Right now you can sign up for affordable health insurance for 2019. 
Why get covered? Because health insurance can protect you from unexpected costs when an accident or illness occurs. Signing up for comprehensive coverage will give you and your family peace of mind, as well as financial security if you or a loved one gets hurt or sick.  
Here’s what you need to know to get covered using the health care marketplace:  
	•	Open enrollment for New Yorkers began on November 1st and ends on January 31st. You can sign up for coverage or learn more by visiting nystateofhealth.ny.gov or calling 1 (855) 355-5777.
 
	•	Coverage is more affordable than you may think, and you may qualify for financial assistance. Last year, 8-in-10 marketplace shoppers could find premiums for less than $75 per month. 
 
	•	You can find out whether your doctor works with your plan. You can check here – but it’s still a good idea to call your health care provider and confirm these details before you sign up for a plan.
 
	•	If you have questions, help is available. If you’d like to get in touch with a broker or navigator who can help you sign up for insurance, you can search for someone in your area here.  Or, if you’d like to attend an in-person event to learn more, you can find upcoming events in New York City and Westchester County here.   
Accidents and illness can happen at any time – that’s why affordable, comprehensive health insurance is the smart choice.  
I hope you’ll visit nystateofhealth.ny.gov today and find a plan that works for you. 
Sincerely, ￼ Eliot L. Engel MEMBER OF CONGRESS

Poll: Caravan
On Friday, November 9th, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation declaring that immigrants seeking asylum along the southern border must present themselves lawfully at a port of entry. This order made use of the authority granted by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act which gives the president the ability to protect the integrity of our immigration system and national sovereignty. The proclamation provides clarity to border patrol agents while aiming to ensure order and efficiency for our immigration system. You can read more about the proclamation here.

Question of the Week: As part of ongoing efforts to reform our country's immigration policies, do you support requiring that all immigrants wishing to claim asylum must do so at the legal points of entry and not after being apprehended once unlawfully entering the border?

[_] Yes.
[_] No.

Dear Lindsey,
This last Sunday, Veterans Day, was a time for us to all to thank America's veterans for their service to our great country and honor the sacrifices they have made.
Arizona is home to more than 500,000 veterans from every branch of our Armed Forces. 
While we can never repay the debt we owe these men and women, I ask that you join me in honoring them, not only on these holidays, but every day. I am also grateful for the work the veterans on my staff do for other Arizona veterans every day. Their service to their brothers and sisters has not, and will never stop.

We have a great deal of work ahead of us, and I look forward to continuing this bipartisan work to improve the lives of our veterans.
If you are, or if you know, a veteran in need of assistance with the VA or any other program, do not hesitate to reach out to my offices in Casa Grande, Flagstaff, or Tucson to speak with a caseworker.

Dear friend – 

You may have heard the words ""your health is your wealth."" As the son of a doctor, it was a common phrase in our house – and as we get older and take care of our families, it becomes truer than ever. Insurance is crucial to safeguarding your health and financial security. Even the healthiest folks aren't immune from getting sick or having accidents. Health insurance helps protect you from the unexpected, and the deadline for open enrollment is fast approaching.

From now until December 15th, Floridians can purchase, change, or renew plans through HealthCare.gov for coverage starting January 1st.

Here's what you need to know about signing up for health insurance coverage for 2019:
	•	Open enrollment is shorter than in past years. The open enrollment period – when you can sign yourself and your family up for health insurance – ends on December 15th. That's just a few weeks away, so review your options as soon as possible and sign up! 
	•	Coverage could be more affordable than you think. That’s because financial help is available. During last year’s enrollment period, over 90 percent of Florida enrollees were eligible for some form of financial assistance made available through the Affordable Care Act. 
	•	Existing enrollees may have new options. If you had coverage through HealthCare.gov for 2018, head back to update your information and compare your options for 2018 before the December 15th deadline. Every year, plans and prices change. So shop around; you may find a plan that better meets your needs for less! 
	•	Free help is available. Healthcare is confusing for everyone. Professionals are available to help you find the right plan and get signed up. If you have questions about signing up or want to talk through your options with a trained professional, free help is just a call away! The Call Center is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (except holidays) – call (800) 318-2596. 
	•	Need in-person help? No problem. Visit coveringflorida.org to find in-person assistance to help you find a plan, fill out an application, and enroll. You can also call (877) 813-9115 to schedule an appointment at Pinellas locations. 
Don't miss out and find yourself without coverage for 2019. More information on open enrollment can be found on our website and if you have any questions, feel free to call our office. Don't forget, the deadline to enroll is December 15th. Let's get covered, Pinellas!  Sincerely, 
￼
Charlie Crist United States Congressman

Open Enrollment Has Begun 
A MESSAGE FROM CONGRESSMAN STENY H. HOYER 
Open enrollment in Maryland continues through December 15. During this time, Marylanders can sign up for a new health insurance plan or make changes to their current plan by visiting MarylandHealthConnection.gov. I encourage everyone to visit the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange to find the plan that is best for them and their family as many plans have decreased in price. The open enrollment period is the only time to make changes to your health insurance plan for 2019.  
Many families who sign up for health insurance through the Exchange qualify for financial assistance. Free, in-person assistance in selecting a plan is available throughout the Fifth District. Click here to find assistance near you.  
￼ 
As always, I encourage all Fifth District residents to continue to share their concerns and insights with me by contacting my office or connecting with me on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.   
Sincerely Yours,   ￼  Steny H. Hoyer

11/14/18 9:26,Epilepsy Awareness Month,"News from Representative Tom Emmer
￼
Dear Friend, 
Today, I want to take a moment to raise awareness about a disease affecting over 3.4 million Americans. As the 4th most common neurological disease in the nation, epilepsy remains misunderstood by many. Since 1 out of every 26 people will be diagnosed with this illness, we should all take the time to understand the impact and learn seizure first aid. 
During Epilepsy Awareness Month, I encourage you to utilize these resources to better understand this condition that many Americans experience:  
	•	To better understand epilepsy, visit here. 
	•	A helpful glossary of terms on this condition can be found, here. 
	•	For information on seizure first aid and safety, visit here. 
	•	If you are a caregiver to someone with epilepsy, there are resources for you here.
If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact the Epilepsey Foundation’s Helpline 24/7 by calling: 1-800-332-1000. You can also ask a question online here.  
Sincerely, 
 ￼ 
P.S. Thank you Tayler (Ramsey, MN), for your suggestion to highlight Epilepsy Awareness Month!

Dear Friends, 
It is great to be back in Washington after the long district work period and to get back to fighting for the people of Texas' 10th Congressional District. I return more committed than ever to securing real results for my constituents and the state of Texas. As I look ahead to the 116th Congress, I am excited for the new opportunities that lie ahead. 
￼ 
Here I am walking into the Capitol earlier today ahead of my floor speech. 
  
Honoring our Veterans 
This Sunday we celebrated Veterans Day. A day we pause and reflect on the enormous debt of gratitude we owe to all the brave men and women who have served in our nation’s armed forces. Their service has ensured we remain the shining city upon a hill.  Every Veterans Day, I think about my dad and his service. He served in the U.S. Army as a bombardier on a B-17 and participated in the air campaign on D-Day during the invasion of Normandy. It was his service that inspired me to do more in service to my country. Earlier this month, I got the opportunity to fly in the same plane he did back in June of 1944 and it was such an incredible moment.
As President Truman said in his first address to the nation: ""Our debt to the heroic men and valiant women in the service of our country can never be repaid. They have earned our undying gratitude. America will never forget their sacrifices. Because of these sacrifices, the dawn of justice and freedom throughout the world slowly casts its gleam across the horizon.""  Thank you to all our veterans!

Seeking Top Republican Position on Foreign Affairs Committee 
On Friday, I announced my intention to pursue the Ranking Member position on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. I have dedicated my professional life to national security and have proudly served on the Foreign Affairs Committee since first coming to Congress. Confronting the many foreign policy challenges facing our country will require strong and steady leadership. I have run a productive and results oriented security committee and believe that I am the right person to be Ranking Member. In this position, I will communicate a clear vision that projects American leadership on the world stage.

Fighting Terrorism in Africa 
Today, the House unanimously passed my Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership Act. Our military successes in Iraq and Syria have splintered ISIS, squeezed terrorists out of the Middle East, and sent them fleeing to Africa. As a result, terrorist organizations are solidifying their control of the continent and prohibiting its prosperity. My legislation authorizes for the first time a program that works with African countries to build their capacity to conduct counterterrorism operations and strengthen the rule of law. I want to thank my colleagues for their overwhelming bipartisan support in passing my legislation.

November Terror Threat Snapshot 
As Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security I have been releasing monthly reports to highlight the growing threat America, the West, and the world face from ISIS and other Islamist terrorists. The most notable point from the last update was that five senior members of the Taliban have all been appointed as members of the terrorist organization’s political office in Qatar. The men, collectively known as the Taliban Five, are former inmates of the American prison at Guantanamo Bay. The men were released as part of an exchange deal to ensure the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in 2014.

Legislative Update 
Last week, Members were in their districts for a District Work Period. No votes were held. 
This Week, the House opens for legislative business on Tuesday and is considering numerous pieces of important legislation. Below are a few you may be interested in:
	•	H.R. 6018 – the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership Act of 2018. This is legislation I introduced to authorizes for the first time a program called the Trans-Sahara Counter Terrorism Partnership, which works with countries such as Chad, Mali, and Nigeria, to build their capacity to conduct counterterrorism operations, and strengthen the rule of law. 
	•	H.R. 2740 – the Rabbi Michoel Ber Weissmandl Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2017. I am a cosponsor of this legislation to require the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate to arrange for the posthumous award of a Congressional Gold Medal to Rabbi Michoel Ber Weissmandl in recognition of his acts of valor during World War II.  
As always, I encourage you to visit my website, mccaul.house.gov, for more information on constituent services and legislative updates. Also, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to get the latest updates on my work in Washington and the 10th District of Texas.

￼
Friends, 
On Sunday, we celebrated Veterans Day. It is so important that we pause as a nation to recognize the men and women who put it all on the line to protect our freedom. To the many men and women we celebrate: Thank you for your selfless service to this great country. May God bless you, and may He continue to bless America. 
￼ 
Last week, I had the privilege of speaking at Wetumpka High School’s Veterans Day ceremony. It’s always inspiring and humbling to be in the midst of men and women who put it all on the line in service for our country.  
￼ 
I’m grateful to each and every veteran who attended the event for their sacrifice and bravery. This celebration was only possible because of our heroes.
CELEBRATING NATIONAL VETERANS AND MILITARY FAMILIES MONTH
President Trump has once again declared November the second annual National Veterans and Military Families Month to “salute the brave and dedicated patriots who have worn the uniform of the United States, and… celebrate the extraordinary military families whose selfless service and sacrifice make our military the finest in the world.” I am glad that the President has once again demonstrated that we are committed to veterans and military families more than just on Veterans Day.  
YOUTHBUILD IN EUFAULA IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE 
￼  
Did you know that there are an estimated 4.9 million 16-24 year old individuals in this country who are not in school and are also unemployed? It’s true, and roughly 3 million of these young people are living in poverty. 
Last week,  I had the opportunity to visit YouthBuild in Eufaula, which is one of the 147 Department of Labor-funded YouthBuild programs in the country. I can tell you firsthand - this group of mentors and educators is making a huge difference in the lives of young students here in our district. As of now, roughly 10 students are working towards their high school diploma or its equivalent while earning a stipend and learning job skills.
In Congress, I have gladly supported funding for this critical program, and I will continue to do so in the future. Thank you for having me on campus. Your work is truly invaluable. You can read more about this great program in my weekly column.  
LUNCH WITH THE EUFAULA KIWANIS CLUB  
￼ 
I enjoyed being with the Eufaula Kiwanis Club during their lunch meeting last week! I really appreciated this opportunity to update some of the people I represent about what’s going on in Washington and the work I’m honored to do on their behalf. Looking forward to next time!
STAFF ANNOUNCEMENT: MIKE ALBARES NAMED MY NEW CHIEF OF STAFF 
Some exciting news from my office: I am thrilled to announce that my longtime staff member, Mike Albares of Dothan, has been named my new Chief of Staff. Mike is an exceptional leader who has served my office and the people of Alabama’s Second District with distinction for more than seven years, and I am confident he will enable my office to continue delivering results on behalf of the people we serve. 
Mike replaces my former Chief of Staff, Torrie Miller Matous, who this week was named the Director of External Affairs of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). You can read more via Alabama Daily News.  
THE WEEK AHEAD 
Congress is back in Washington this week, and there is plenty to be done before the end of the year. You can stay up to date on my work in Congress via Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.          
It is an honor to serve you in Congress. Please never hesitate to let me know if there is a way my office can be of assistance. 
Sincerely,  
￼  Martha Roby

The Webster Wire
Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends: 
Sunday, we remembered our men and women in uniform who have shown a level of courage and commitment to our nation by sacrificing for our freedom to ensure we remain the land of the free. I am humbled and grateful to remember the sacrifices that have been made and the lives that been lost. It is due to countless lives selflessly lived and lost in defense of our country that we have the privilege to stand today free and grateful. Thank you for your service to our country, and for protecting the values that have made the United States of America the greatest nation in the world. 
Serving veterans is one of my top priorities. I was honored to participate in events in Leesburg and The Villages this weekend that recognized veterans and expressed our gratitude for their – and their loved ones – sacrifice to defend our country.   
We owe our veterans a debt we can never repay. Yet, too often, our veterans’ attempts to receive the compensation or benefits they have earned are met with delays. Since January 2017, more than $4.5 million has been returned to veterans in my district in compensation, pension, or retroactive payments. I am pleased that we have been able to intercede on behalf of so many constituents to ensure they receive the services and compensation they have earned. I will continue to work to provide veterans with the quality, efficient, and timely services they need and deserve.
￼ 
_______________ 
Under the authority given him through the Immigration and Nationality Act, Friday the president signed a presidential proclamation requiring individuals seeking asylum in our country to present themselves lawfully at a port of entry. Once again, President Trump is putting Americans’ safety first and making securing our borders a priority.  
We are compassionate nation, welcoming those who seek protections from persecution and a chance at a better future for their family. To protect our borders, we must insist that all who arrive and seek to live within our borders abide by our laws.  Our laws provide protections for individuals seeking asylum who come to a port of entry – instead of attempting illegal crossing.   
Drugs have flooded across our porous borders, poisoning communities, and costing lives. Gangs like MS-13 take advantage of our open borders and the loopholes in our immigration system, including by trying to recruit unaccompanied alien children. In many cases, human trafficking has become an easier and more lucrative business for drug cartels.  They lure thousands of young women to the U.S. with promises of a better life, only to impress those women into sex slavery upon arrival.

Citrus is not only an integral part of Florida’s identity, but also Florida’s economy. According to the Florida Department of Citrus, nearly 76,000 Floridians work in the citrus industry. While in Floral City, I visited Ferris Groves on their first open day of the season. For over 80 years, Ferris Groves has been offering a variety of the finest citrus in Florida.

It was an honor to be a part of the Veteran Pinning Ceremony at Melissa’s Place Adult Day Care Center in Wildwood. 8 men and women were honored for their courageous service.

Constituent Corner
A veteran from Tavares contacted my office about an appeal that was remanded by the Board of Veterans’ Appeals. My office submitted an inquiry and followed up with the veteran service officer working to obtain background information on the claim. Because the veteran was homeless, he was also put in touch with a shelter who could help with the immediate needs. This information was provided to the VA and to expedite the appeal. Efforts were made to obtain the DD214 which was necessary to complete the appeal. We followed up with the Appeals Management Office for a status update and learned that it had indeed been flagged as a hardship and was now marked Ready for Decision. Two issues were completed with a third remanded for additional work, which we continued to follow. It was a pleasure to learn that all issues were completed, resulting in a retroactive payment of over $85,000. In addition, the VA enrolled the veteran in a service dog training program.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.  
District Update
Every year just before Thanksgiving, the Florida Farm Bureau hosts Farm-City Week, a week that celebrates the positive relationships between farming families and city residents. Agriculture plays a vital role in Sumter County. Last week, my Community Relations Representative, Pam, participated in the Sumter County Farm-City Tour, visiting with owners of Riverview Apiaries and Trueblue Growers, LLC. 
On Veterans Day, my Community Relations Representative, Victoria, visited with veterans at Sunshine Gardens Memory Care Facility in Crystal River and thanked them for their devoted service to our country. 
￼￼ 
  
Legislative Update
Last week, the Trump Administration took two important steps towards better protecting religious liberty and preventing taxpayer dollars from being used to fund abortions through Obamacare.  The Department of Health and Human Services finalized new regulations that allow churches, nonprofit organizations, small businesses and religious schools to be exempt from the Obama administration’s contraceptive mandate.  These new regulations remove the unconditionally narrow exemption that the previous administration had for religious objections. 
Further, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed a rule that will require insurers providing Obamacare plans with abortion services to separately bill enrollees for the portion of the plan that covers abortion.  This rule is consistent with the Hyde Amendment that prevents taxpayer dollars from being used for abortion services. 
Survey
Of the following names reported by the press, who do you think President Trump should pick as his next Attorney General? 
	•	Keep current acting-attorney general Matt Whitaker
	•	Pam Bondi, Attorney General of Florida
	•	Alex Acosta, U.S. Secretary of Labor
	•	Chris Christie, Former Governor of New Jersey
	•	Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina
	•	I don’t know

Kansas Common Sense  November 13, 2018
Hello,
 
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
 
Honoring Our Nation's Veterans
As we came together as a nation to recognize Veterans Day, we honor the incredible sacrifices men and women in uniform have made on behalf of our nation and for our freedom. America has been made exceptional by the enduring courage and bravery of our troops, who have waged war against our adversaries in far off places so that our country and world could remain more peaceful. We also are called today to rededicate ourselves to make certain that veterans are treated with the care and respect they deserve following their service to our nation, and I hope we all take time to reflect on the profound impact of our servicemembers, past and present. To all those who have served our country: thank you, we respect you and we love you.
Speaking at the Johnson County Veterans Day Observance  On Saturday, I attended the Johnson County Veterans Day Observance where I had the the honor of thanking those who have so honorably served our nation. We have much to learn from our veterans, who didn’t serve because of “Republican this” or “Democrat that,” but because of a deeply-rooted belief in protecting the freedoms our nation has to offer. Thanks to all who came out for this special event during the cold weather. 
 ￼ 
Hosting U.S. Air Force Under Secretary Donovan at Wichita State On Friday I hosted U.S. Air Force Under Secretary Matthew Donovan at Wichita State University to tour their Innovation Campus. During the tour, we saw their Experiential Engineering Building, the National Institute for Aviation Research, and visited with various faculty, staff, students and industry professionals. The Innovation Campus is a unique opportunity for our state and features innovative technology and equipment that benefits students and employers across the aerospace industry. 
Nearly every Air Force platform relies on the expertise or parts supplied by Kansans, and the manufacturers and engineers in Wichita are eager to not only continue their work for the Air Force, but to grow that work. Wichita – the Air Capital of the World – offers the expertise, capacity and desire to be an epicenter of talent, innovation and efficiency for the Air Force and I am committed to making certain the Pentagon remains acutely aware of the ways the Wichita area can serve the Department of Defense. I will continue to work to bring defense leaders to Wichita to see the abundant opportunities for growth and the value of increased partnerships with academic and industrial leaders here. I’m proud of Wichita State, Spirit Aerosystems, and the various local businesses and manufacturers who play a critical role in the development of the Air Force. I remain committed to helping orchestrate these continued partnerships. Click here to read more on Friday’s events. 
 ￼ 
Resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions On Wednesday, the president announced the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Jeff Sessions served our country honorably and fulfilled the duties that were statutorily required of him. As Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, it was an honor to host Attorney General Sessions recently in Kansas, and I am appreciative of his work to ensure Kansas has the resources it needs to keep our communities safe. I expect that during this transition period, the Department will make certain federal law enforcement agencies continue to protect our country, carry out the rule of law and allow the Special Counsel investigation to continue unimpeded. 
My Subcommittee’s Continued Work to Protect Olympic Athletes from Abuse Recently, the United States Olympic Committee announced it would begin the process to decertify and disassociate with USA Gymnastics. This week, the Washington Post highlighted my subcommittee’s work to protect Olympic and amateur athletes from abuse. As this work continues and as various announcements continue to be made surrounding the USOC and USA Gymnastics, it is important that my subcommittee continues to press those involved for answers and that all bad actors are held accountable. Click here to read more from the Washington Post on our successful investigation and the subcommittee’s pragmatic approach to solving this long-overdue problem. 
Touring Morton County Hospital This week I was in Elkhart to visit the Morton County Hospital. During my visit, I toured their facilities and held a discussion with hospital board members, staff and administrators, including Morton County Hospital CEO Richard Bergling. 
Morton County Hospital is currently in the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program – an important Medicare initiative that helps certain rural hospitals in sparsely populated states expand care to patients in their communities. Ensuring Kansans have access to quality healthcare in their own communities is one of my top priorities and an issue I’ve continued to advocate for. This program allows Kansas hospitals who utilize the program to continue receiving Medicare reimbursements that more accurately reflect the true cost of providing care to their patients. For Elkhart and similar communities, access to robust healthcare services offered by community hospitals are essential because access to quality healthcare services determines whether Kansans can remain in the communities they call home, and whether their children can return to raise families of their own. 
 ￼ 
Visiting with Students at Elkhart High School During my visit to Morton County, I stopped by Elkhart High School to visit with students, faculty and staff. Elkhart was recently the recipient of a donation of five computers through my office as part of the United States Senate’s Computers for Schools program. This program, administered by the Office of the Sergeant at Arms, channels surplus computers into classrooms across the country to help encourage and enable technology use in the classroom in this digital age. I was pleased to hear how the school plans to utilize these computers, and am honored to have a positive impact on these students’ education. 
Thank you to students Shayden Hanes, Torie Cayton, and Ethan Buck for my tour, I appreciate Principal Chris Hattabaugh and Superintendent Rex Richardson for hosting my visit. 
 ￼
Speaking to the Dodge City Kiwanis Club
Last week, I joined the members of the Dodge City Kiwanis Club at their regular meeting. During the meeting, I heard an update on the club, its activities and their engagement with the Dodge City community. We also discussed the importance of civic engagement in communities across Kansas. Kiwanis clubs all across Kansas and the country play a vital role in communities of all shapes and sizes, and I’m grateful for the positive impact they’ve had on this state.
I appreciated the warm welcome from the members I met, and I extend my thanks to Club President Lee Griffith for inviting me to speak.
￼
Visiting Fort Hays State University Attending David Basgall’s Ag Law and Policy Class On Monday, I was on the campus of Fort Hays State University (FHSU) to visit with various administrators, faculty, staff and students. While on campus, I joined David Basgall’s agricultural law and policy class and heard about the course’s curriculum and the various topics that students are covering throughout the semester. I also fielded a number of questions from students regarding the farm economy, trade, recent trade announcements and issues facing Kansas agriculture. Thank you Mr. Basgall for allowing me to join in on Tuesday’s class, and thanks to FHSU Department of Agriculture Chair and University Farm Superintendent Dr. Clyde Cranwell for arranging my visit to campus. 
Touring FHSU’s Center for Applied Technology I also had the opportunity to tour the FHSU Center for Applied Technology (CAT). The CAT building is the newest building on FHSU’s campus, having just recently opened in August 2017. It houses the industrial technology, technology, engineering teacher education, sculpture, blacksmithing and foundry programs. The building is equipped with industrial equipment that gives students hands-on experience with cutting-edge technology to better prepare them for their career. 
Providing opportunities to Kansas students in the STEM fields will remain absolutely essential to developing, attracting, and retaining a modern workforce in our state that can compete in the increasingly globalized economy.  The future of our country depends on bright students, such as those I met at FHSU. FHSU is striving to provide Kansas students with quality STEM education to ensure their success. Thank you to Chair of the Department of Applied Technology Mr. Kim Stewart, Interim Dean of the Werth College of Science, Technology, and Mathematics Dr. Grady Dixon and to various students and faculty for the visit and for arranging my tour of this facility. 
 ￼  
Visiting with Ellsworth Residents On Wednesday, I stopped in Ellsworth to visit with various community leaders, residents and business owners. Community visits allow me the chance to visit with local residents on the issues most important to them, and allow for me to offer an update on the work I’m doing in Kansas and in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many folks who took time out of their day to visit with, especially those at the county courthouse during a busy time of the year. 
Touring Wichita Area Businesses
On Thursday, I was in Wichita where I had the opportunity to tour area businesses and hear from the owners and various employees. My first stop was at RedGuard. RedGuard manufactures secure, blast resistant modules, which are put to use in places like our oil fields, as well as by the U.S. State Department for our diplomatic missions all over the world. Through their subsidiary, SiteBox Storage, they also create mobile offices, mobile refrigerators, storm shelters and portable storage containers. I was able to get a better understanding of how the decisions made in Washington ultimately impact these jobs in Wichita as well as RedGuard's customers in Kansas and across the globe. Thank you to Ross Draney, Troy Lorenz, Mike Kastens, Darren Hillman and owner Jeff Lang for the tour of the facility and for our thoughtful discussion.
Additionally, I stopped by Alloy Architecture, an architecture firm that serves Wichita, the surrounding region and the state of Kansas. During my visit to Alloy I was able to hear relevant updates on their work in the Wichita community and the innovative and new technologies they’re using in their business. Thank you to numerous employees for taking time to visit with me and to long-time friend and President of Alloy Architecture David White for the tour and conversation.

Thank You
Dear Friends,

I am truly humbled by the opportunity you have given me to continue serving the 10th District of Georgia in the 116th Congress. I want to thank every Georgian who participated in our great democracy by casting their vote. I will work tirelessly every day to deliver on the faith you have placed in me – always remembering my promises to you, striving to help our families thrive, and advancing conservative solutions to restore the American Dream. 

Guided by our shared values, I look forward to building on past successes, seizing unique opportunities, and taking on new challenges as we work to build a better future for our children and grandchildren. Regardless of who is in charge, my commitment to ensuring you keep more of your hard-earned money with less government interference in your lives will never change. The priorities of our community will always be my central concern, and I’m honored to be your voice in Washington.

 
Never Forget: Honoring All Who Served
As we celebrated Veterans Day, it was inspiring to see folks of all ages come together across Georgia to honor our Nation's heroes. I enjoyed every bit of this Veterans Day weekend, from the Putnam County Veterans Day Honor Event to my Veterans Appreciation Coffee in Monroe. All of the brave men and women who have served in our Armed Forces have earned nothing less than our unwavering and steadfast support, and I’m thankful for everything these patriots have done to defend our freedoms and keep our country safe.

Throughout my time in Congress, I’ve been grateful to have the opportunity to meet and serve many of Georgia’s veterans. My staff and I will always go to bat for those seeking help, and during yesterday’s celebration, I was overjoyed to learn how my office successfully resolved a case for a local veteran who was having difficulties getting his medical bills paid by the Atlanta VAMC.

It's hard to find the right words to express my gratitude and admiration for these brave men and women. They have provided an invaluable service by defending America and the freedoms we hold dear, and that service often comes with great sacrifice. For those who have served, and those who still wear the uniform today, a grateful Nation salutes you.
￼



Connecting With You 
I value all feedback from the residents of the 10th District, and I firmly believe that our government works best when representatives and constituents communicate directly with each other. Last Monday, I enjoyed staying in touch with folks at home to discuss the challenges facing our community and Nation. Meeting with community groups, like the Rotary Club of Monroe, is vital to keeping my finger on the pulse of what’s happening in the region. During the get-together, I highlighted the work being done by Congress and President Trump to improve the economy, lower taxes, and fully fund the military. Thanks so much for having me, see you next time!
￼
￼


Success Stories
One of my most important responsibilities as your representative is assisting you when you have a problem with a federal agency, and I make it a priority to have members of my team regularly criss-cross our district to hold Mobile Office Hours. 

These events are the perfect opportunity for those of you who may not live near one of my three district offices to get assistance. From claims with the Department of Veterans Affairs to the Social Security Administration, my team and I have been proud to help hundreds of constituents resolve their difficulties in dealing with government bureaucracy. One success story arising from a Mobile Office Hours opportunity comes from a local veteran in Wrens who simply wanted to get “a real, fair review” from the VA regarding her claim. After help from one of my dedicated caseworkers, she has now been approved for an increase in her VA benefits! I’m incredibly proud of my team and the work we do to help everyday 10th District residents. 

But don’t just take my word for it, I encourage you to read the letter below highlighting another favorable outcome. 
￼

While we can’t always guarantee the outcome of your case, we do promise to do everything we can to advocate for you and ensure that your claim receives the full attention it deserves. If these sound like familiar problems for you or someone you know, I encourage you to come by our Mobile Office Hours this month in Putnam County. On Wednesday, November 28th from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., members of Team Hice will set up shop at the Eatonton-Putnam Chamber of Commerce to answer the casework-related questions you may have. We’ll do everything we can to assist you in your claim and get you the answers you deserve. Click here for more information on this upcoming event.

Valuable Training
In honor of National Apprenticeship Week, I’m thrilled to highlight the Department of Labor’s new digital platform: www.Apprenticeship.gov. Through apprenticeships, hardworking Americans gain meaningful, real-world experience before graduation, and I’m proud that the State of Georgia has been at the forefront of preparing young workers for the opportunities of today and tomorrow. 

During the 2018 Regional Job Fair in October, I was honored to recognize high school students who are part of the German Apprenticeship program. Once they successfully complete the program, the students will have progressed through a technical college program leading to a diploma and will be just a few credits shy of a college associate’s degree. They will have achieved the highly respected German-American Chamber of Commerce certification as an Industrial Mechanic, earned a U.S. Department of Labor Apprenticeship certificate – with no college debt – and enter the workforce with a high-demand job. Furthermore, they will accomplish all this, while also having the opportunity to earn between $20,000 to $25,000 while still in high school. Click here to watch a short video highlighting this outstanding program from the 2018 Regional Job Fair.

POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: Rep. Jody Hice meeting with veterans in Monroe Monday Gwinnett Daily Post – 11/11 U.S. Rep. Jody Hice, R-Ga., is inviting military veterans from his district to meet with him Monday so he can show them that he appreciates their service. Hice announced he will host a Veterans Appreciation Coffee gathering from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m. at his Monroe District Office. Veterans will be able to enjoy coffee and pastries during the meeting, which the congressman’s office said will also serve as an opportunity for the veterans to address Hice about issues they and the military are facing. “Our Nation is blessed to have courageous warriors who served in order to protect our most valued treasures, our freedom, and our democracy,” Hice said in a statement. “These patriots upheld the highest sense of selfless honor, and for this, I am privileged to express my heartfelt appreciation for their service to America.”
Hice re-elected Walton Tribune – 11/7 Republican Jody Hice won a landslide victory in his bid for a third term in Congress. With 84 percent reporting at 12:20 a.m. Wednesday, Hice had 63 percent of the vote against Democrat Tabitha Johnson-Green. “It’s always great to get an election behind you and I’m unquestionably, indescribably grateful to the voters of the 10th District,” Hice said.
Hice defeats Johnson-Green locally, leads overall Union-Recorder – 11/6 Incumbent U.S. Rep. Jody Hice (R-Greensboro) turned back a strong challenge from Democratic challenger Tabitha A. Johnson-Green in Tuesday’s general election in Baldwin County.

Allen, Hice honor veterans Augusta Chronicle – 11/6 Congressmen Rick Allen and Jody Hice visited Grovetown High on Nov. 1 to honor World War II veterans and view the documentary, “Honor Flight.” “It’s one of the most moving documentaries I’ve ever seen,” Hice said. “It’s just a special treat. The documentary has just gone over the top to get the heart and soul of what these people went through.” The film shows a group of volunteers from a non-profit organization attempt to send World War II veterans in the Midwest to see memorials built in their honor.

Dear Friend,  Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to read about some of last week’s highlights here in Texas.   Honoring Veterans With PTSD & Mental Illnesses   We kicked off Veterans Day with the Pearland Veterans Day HIKE for Mental Health. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) estimates that 15% of Vietnam War veterans, 12% of Desert Storm veterans and 11-20% of Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom veterans have PTSD.  As a result, we’ve seen a shocking rise in the number of veteran suicides. This year, Congress passed a record amount of funding for the VA – $86.5 billion – including $8.6 billion for mental health care services and $206 million for suicide prevention outreach. I will continue to advocate for our returning servicemen and women with PTSD and other traumatic brain injuries so that they can get the care they need and deserve. If you or a veteran you know need assistance, please call my office at 281-494-2690. My staff are more than happy to help with a claim if possible. ￼  Rep. Pete Olson speaks at the Pearland Veterans Day HIKE for Mental Health   CYAC Students Learn About Foreign Service  We had a great meeting of this year’s Congressional Youth Advisory Council (CYAC).  We were joined by Robin Blunt, the Regional Director of the State Department’s Office of Foreign Missions. She discussed her career path and how to become a Foreign Service Officer. Students also worked on mock legislation that they will debate in May. As always, it was a pleasure to meet with these bright students and hear their questions about their government. ￼  Rep.

During the event, we specifically recognized local Vietnam veterans for their service. We also discussed a bill I’m supporting called, the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act,  which expands the number of veterans eligible for VA disability benefits covering illnesses caused by Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. We will never forget the service and sacrifice of our nation’s veterans. ￼  Rep.

Honoring our Veterans
On Sunday, we recognized America’s veterans for their dedicated service to our nation. Veterans Day is a time to honor the sacrifices of all who have served, as well as the sacrifices of their families. As a proud Marine, I have great respect and gratitude for the patriotic men and women who have served in our nation’s Armed Forces to defend our cherished freedoms. I am working in the Senate to ensure that our nation honors its commitments to veterans, and forever honors their brave service. 
I joined my fellow Hoosiers in honoring our veterans at the Indiana War Memorial in Indianapolis this weekend.

Labor Secretary Acosta in Indiana 
Today, America faces a skills gap as technological advances continue to transform the workforce. It’s important for us to find ways to better equip Americans with the skills needed for 21st century jobs. That’s why I hosted U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta at an apprenticeship and workforce development roundtable on Friday at Gaylor Electric in Noblesville. We discussed the importance of apprenticeships and innovative measures to address the skills gap. 
Gaylor Electric’s apprenticeship program is one example of how work-based learning benefits both businesses and Americans entering the workforce in today’s economy. Thanks to tax reform, Gaylor was also able to invest in a mobile innovation center that provides on-the-go and on-the-spot training to students and electricians.
Gaylor Electric President and CEO Chuck Goodrich said, “We are so appreciative to U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta and Senator Young, for coming to our office. Their enthusiasm for our country and their concern for doing more to provide a path to success, was inspiring. The business and craft professionals in attendance were in full agreement, workforce development is a high priority.”

WIBC - Labor Secretary Promotes Apprenticeships in Indiana Visit 
Indiana’s been trying to line up job skills with college curricula. The U.S. Secretary of Labor has visited Noblesville to promote the same idea. Alexander Acosta joined Indiana Senator Todd Young on a tour of Gaylor Electric , which has an apprenticeship program for high school students. Acosta says more companies and colleges need to work together on similar programs. He says colleges should be talking with businesses about what skills are needed for today's job market, then tailor their curricula accordingly. 
Indiana Public Media - U.S. Secretary of Labor Visits Indiana, Stressing The Importance Of Apprenticeships 
As thousands baby boomers retire each year, many existing jobs need to be filled, on top of new jobs coming online. U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta visited Indiana with U.S. Sen. Todd Young Friday to explore what Hoosier businesses are doing to address the state’s skills gap. The two went on a tour of Gaylor Electric in Noblesville to see first-hand an apprenticeship program the company offers to fill the workforce gap.

Secretary Acosta and I also held a panel discussion on retirement security at Indiana State University in Terre Haute on Friday. The panel focused on the importance of retirement security, the vital role employers play in helping their employees plan for retirement, and current federal legislative and regulatory efforts to expand access to workplace retirement plans.
According to the Department of Labor, more than 40 million people do not have access to any workplace retirement plan. This represents nearly a third of private-sector workers. I introduced the Retirement Security Flexibility Act and the Federal Retirement Commission Act to help strengthen private retirement programs and ensure Americans have the tools necessary to plan for retirement. 
Indiana State University Board of Trustees Chair Edward Pease said, “Financial security for American seniors is increasingly important as the population ages and federal budgets are stressed. Senator Young’s leadership in tackling this challenge in creative ways is one of the bright spots as we look for solutions.”

Media coverage from the event: 
Terre Haute Tribune Star - Sen. Young, Secretary Acosta laud proposed retirement plans 
Closing the nation’s retirement savings gap was a key topic for a panel featuring Indiana’s U.S. Sen. Todd Young and U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta on Friday at Indiana State University. Administrative proposals from the U.S. Department of Labor and federal legislation proposed by Young would enable small- and medium-sized businesses to offer workplace retirement plans similar to 401(k) plans offered to employees of bigger companies. “Only 14 percent of small businesses now offer retirement plans to employees,” Acosta said. 
WTHI – U.S. SECRETARY OF LABOR MAKES A STOP AT ISU TO TALK RETIREMENT SECURITY 
Planning for retirement is important, but not everyone has access to retirement plans through their workplaces. Senator Todd Young and U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta visited ISU on Friday. They talked about retirement security. Their focus was on helping smaller businesses offer plans to employees. They say employers play a vital role in helping employees plan for retirement. 
Hoosier Veteran Receives Purple Heart 
I recently had the great honor of presenting Mr. Paul Lucas of Poland, Indiana with the Purple Heart, which he earned during the Korean War. One of the best parts of my job is ensuring veterans, like Mr. Lucas, receive the recognition they have earned, especially when it’s such a long time coming. Helping veterans and their families track down their military service medals is one of the many services I am proud to provide constituents, and I’m thrilled I was able to present Mr. Lucas with his medals. More on Paul’s story, here.

Congressman Cook Joins Labor Department in Recognizing Employers Who Hire Veterans
￼
Last week, Congressman Paul Cook attended the U.S. Department of Labor announcement of the 2018 HIRE (Honoring Investments in Recruiting and Employing) Vets Medallion Program Demonstration Award, recognizing the meaningful and verifiable efforts undertaken by job creators to hire and retain veterans. Honorees include small businesses, community-based nonprofits, and national companies.

In 2017, President Trump signed into law Congressman Cook’s bill, H.R. 244, the HIRE American Military Veterans Act, creating the HIRE Vets Medallion Program. The HIRE Vets Act promotes private sector recruiting, hiring, and retaining of men and women who served honorably in the U.S. military through the voluntary participation of employers. The awards program recognizes employers who have truly demonstrated efforts to reach out and support our veterans searching for employment.

Congressman Cook said, “It’s an honor to see this legislation come to fruition. Today's recipients deserve to be recognized for making significant strides toward hiring more veterans. Veterans who serve this country honorably shouldn’t struggle to find employment, and this bill creates an innovative system to encourage and recognize employers who make veterans a priority in their hiring practices. I look forward to seeing full implementation of the program next year.”

Recipients of the 2018 HIRE Vets Medallion Program Demonstration Award were evaluated based on a range of criteria, including:

• Veteran hiring and retention
• Availability of veteran-specific resources
• Leadership programming for veterans
• Dedicated human resources
• Compensation and tuition assistance programs for veterans

Applications for the 2019 HIRE Vets Medallion Program will open to employers on January 31, 2019. For more about the HIRE Vets Medallion Program and Award, please visit www.HireVets.gov.

Stage is Set to Advance Our Restore Democracy Revolution  
￼  According to a recent poll conducted by the University of Maryland and the non-partisan research group Voice of the People, 65 percent of Republicans and 85 percent of Democrats who responded back a constitutional amendment to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, and put a stop to the billions of dollars in secret, dark money corporations and wealthy special interests are permitted to contribute to federal campaigns. 
Dear Friend,  
Now more than ever, our Nation’s future depends on overturning the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, so we can finally put a stop to the billions of dollars in secret, dark money corporations and special interests are permitted to spend for terrible, false, and negative TV ads. 
These messages, which begin months before Election Day, go on ad nauseum – discouraging good people from running for office, denigrating the candidates, driving down voter turnout, and causing Americans to lose faith in their leaders and the integrity of our public policymaking process. 
According to the highly respected Center for Responsive Politics, last week’s congressional mid-term elections accounted for more than $5.2 billion. Much of that money came via incredibly wealthy special interest groups hoping to advance their own narrow agendas in the next Congress. And much of the rest was raised by incumbents who go to Washington to govern, but end up spending the lion’s share of their time dialing for campaign dollars like mid-level telemarketers. 
The good news is that key elements of our Restore Democracy legislation – a blueprint that includes some of the very best ideas for campaign and elections reform (see article below) – are gaining support inside and outside of Congress.
The Washington Post reported last week that influential organizations including Planned Parenthood, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights have signed onto a “Declaration of American Democracy,” demanding that campaign and elections reform – including a Constitutional Amendment to overturn Citizens United – be a major priority of the next Congress. 
Hopefully one key element will be the reintroduction and passage of legislation Wisconsin Republican Congressman Mike Gallagher and I have put forward to end congressional campaign fundraising – by incumbents and challengers alike – on days when Congress is in session. Our “Go to Washington, Go to Work” Act would ensure that when Members of Congress go to Washington, they go to work governing and doing the people’s business – not fundraising for reelection on the people’s time.
The simple fact is that there’s not a single Republican or Democrat in Congress who prefers fundraising to governing. Everyone comes to Washington with ideas they believe will improve our Nation and make life better for people. But far too many of the best ideas will be left on the cutting room floor until we change the system. And changing the system is what our “Go to Washington, Go to Work” bill is all about. 
We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email. 
Sincerely,  ￼ 

The Restore Democracy Revolution 
This is What Will be Required to Restore Our Democracy and Take Back Our Government
￼  One of my very first acts after returning to Congress in 2013 was to introduce a Constitutional Amendment to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, which unleashed billions of dollars in secret, dark money into our campaigns and elections. This photo, taken during our press conference at the National Press Club, appeared on the front page of Capitol Hill’s well known daily newspaper, Roll Call.  
Our Restore Democracy legislation is a blueprint for reform encompassing the best ideas put forth by many thoughtful leaders over the years. Any one of these elements would constitute major reform in and of itself. Taken together, the ‘Restore Democracy’ package would bring about a true renaissance for our democratic process.  Here’s the plan in a nutshell:
Overturn Citizens United and get Secret, Dark Money out of Politics  
Congress must enact a Constitutional amendment to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court’s ‘Citizens United’ decision because corporations are not people. And campaign contributions are not defined as ‘free speech’ under the First Amendment.
Require Full Disclosure of Campaign Finances 
Congress must have the power to require full public disclosure of all campaign financing so voters are aware of who is providing financial assistance to their candidates and how much they receive.
Institute Small Donor and Public Financing  
Congress must create a system of small donor and public financing for elections in order to offset the power of well-financed special interests, and ensure that when Members of Congress go to Washington, they go to work on the people’s business – not on raising campaign funds.
Limit the Campaign Season 
Congress must limit the campaign season by restricting spending on congressional campaigns to a period 60 days before a primary or general election, and prohibiting both incumbents and challengers from raising political contributions while Congress is in session.
Preserve and Expand Voting Rights 
Congress must protect the right to vote by outlawing voter suppression activities, and providing an online voter registration system in every state. Our democracy succeeds – and our government works best – only when everyone participates.
Outlaw Partisan Redistricting 
Congress must eliminate partisan redistricting and gerrymandering so reapportionment creates compact and contiguous Congressional districts that represent a regional community of interest and follow geographic boundaries and county lines.
Restore Regular Order 
Congress must restore the traditional process of regular order that has served our Nation well for more than 200 years. All legislation must be the subject of public hearings with at least 72 hours provided for public review prior to recorded votes. Every bill must be considered under an open rule, with every amendment considered and given an up or down vote. Regular Order fosters bipartisanship and cooperation as we find points of agreement toward the best solutions to tough problems. 

EPA Announces Plan to Boost Corporate Profits and Accelerate Global Warming in 2019
￼  Our old friend, Pulitzer Prize winning Star Tribune cartoonist Steve Sack, nails it again with this cartoon pointing out that global warming is causing more and more extreme weather events.  
The President has called climate change a “hoax” invented by the Chinese. Well, he can try telling that to people in California, Florida, and up and down the East Coast whose homes, communities, and lives have been devastated by terrible fires, rain storms, and hurricanes.Our hearts go out to them. 
In fact, it could not be more obvious that the battle against climate change is the greatest challenge of our time. And the price of failure is almost unimaginable. According to a new report from the International Panel on Climate Change, unless the world undertakes an immediate, herculean effort to save our planet, thousands of lives will be lost and even more disastrous storms, flooding, food scarcity, and damage topping $54 trillion will occur by 2040. 
Yet the President's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans last week to triple its efforts in 2019 to roll back air quality rules and regulations designed to eliminate billions of tons of carbon emissions that drive climate change.  
And EPA has made clear that by March, they will have officially nixed the Obama Administration’s Clean Power Plan, designed to move the nation away from coal, oil and other fossil fuels toward the use of more wind, solar and hydroelectric power. 
The simple truth is, the United States should be leading the global effort to address and solve climate change with the same tenacity it took to defeat fascism in World War II or put a man on the moon in 1969.
But instead, the President has called climate change “a Chinese hoax” and announced that the U.S. will pull out of the Paris climate accords. The hard, cold fact is that unless determined people of good will find a way to overcome his refusal to accept facts and science, the entire world will pay the price for countless generations to come.

 GRANT WATCH 
Electric Infrastructure and Smart Grid Technology in Lake and St. Louis County to Get $5,670,000 Upgrade 
￼  Under our watch, Minnesota’s 8th District has received more than $1.2 billion in federal grants for projects that create good paying jobs and make life better for people
We were pleased to announce an important grant for Minnesota's 8th district last week. 
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) - via the Electric Infrastructure Loan and Loan Guarantee Program - announced that the Cooperative Light and Power Association in Two Harbors will be the recipient of a $5,670,000 rural development investment to build 35 miles of line and improve 12 line miles and make other system improvements, including $439,278 in smart grid technologies. 
￼  
First energized in 1936, the Cooperative Light and Power Association serves more than 6,000 residential and commercial consumers in the Arrowhead region of northeastern Minnesota. Tourism, timber and mining are the major industries in the service territory, which also serves four state parks, a National Forest and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.
To help keep you updated, we will be using the Monday Report to highlight important federal grants for the 8th District. 

Our Week in Washington
￼  On his walk home from work last week, my Press Secretary, Jordan Metsa, witnessed what he calls ""one of the most beautiful sunsets he's ever seen"" over the U.S. Capitol Building. He was able to snap this photo, which captured the remarkable sight that evening.  
Our Week in Mora 
￼  In the southeastern five countries of 8th District: Pine, Isanti, Chisago, Kanabec and Kanabec (PICKM) transportation providers and users met at the East Central Regional Development Commission in Mora to organize the East Central Regional Transportation Coordinating Council Advisory Board (ECRTCC Advisory Board). Their mission is to work towards transportation access for seniors, military Veterans, people with disabilities, and low income individuals. My Field Representative Rick Olseen attended on my behalf and spoke about my legislation, H.R. 5664, that addresses the tax issue many volunteer drivers are facing.
Our Week in Minneapolis
￼  My Field Representative Rick Olseen has been attending the United Veterans Legislative Council of Minnesota on my behalf at the Minneapolis VA for the last six years. He’s receiving a Certificate of Appreciation from the group’s Chairman Jerry Kyser. The wellness of our military Veterans is so important to me, and it’s been a privilege for my staff and me to help many Veterans in the 8th District.  
Our Week in St. Paul 
￼  Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen attended the Minnesota Department of Health Flex Advisory Committee Meeting in St. Paul. They focus on rural issues for hospitals, emergency medical services and wellness. The word cloud chart on the screen illustrates the input the group received from a series of public meetings they hosted to find out residents top concerns throughout the region.  

Coming Up in Washington
This week:
	•	The House is expected to take up H.R. 6651, the PEPFAR Extension Act of 2018, extends  authorities, limitations, and reporting requirements relating to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), as initially authorized by Congress in 2003 and reauthorized in 2008 and 2013.

Finally...
Did you know November is Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month? 
￼  The bipartisan Bold Infrastructure Alzheimer's Act, H.R. 4256, introduced by Congressman Brett Guthrie (R) of Kentucky, has my support along with 209 other members of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
November marks Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, and as a Member of Congress, I am doing everything I can to support efforts that raise awareness and work toward a cure. Specifically, I have signed onto bipartisan legislation - supported by the Alzheimer's Association - to provide the funding and resources the Center for Disease Control (CDC), health care providers and researchers require to combat this deadly and extremely costly disease.  
As it stands now, Alzheimer's Disease is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States - costing a quarter of a trillion dollars each year. More than 5 million Americans live with this debilitating disease.
By working together to pass the Bold Infrastructure Alzheimer's Act, Congress can improve quality of life for those who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and reduce human and financial costs associated with it.

11/13/18 15:34,Every veteran has a story,"￼ 

Dear Friend, 
I hope you had a wonderful Veterans Day weekend honoring the brave men and women who have served in our nation's military. Words are never enough to fully display gratitude to our veterans and their loved ones for their service and sacrifice.  
As I head back to Congress today to continue working hard for South and West Texans, I wanted to make sure you saw a few highlights from the weekend.
This week's Hurd on the Hill column is a truly special edition. In honor of Veterans Day, I asked my Military and Veterans Liaison, Ashley Estep, to tell you why she joined the U.S. Air Force and what motivates her to continue to serve today. I hope you enjoy her story.  
￼ 
This Veterans Day also marked the 100th Armistice Day, recognizing the anniversary of the end of the First World War on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. 
￼ 
I was glad to be able to spend my morning yesterday speaking with students at Leon Springs Elementary. These bright kids know their stuff, and their admiration for service at such a young age is inspiring. Thank y'all for letting me be a part of your Veterans Day ceremony.  
￼ 
San Antonio is home to nearly 250,000 veterans and 80,000 active-duty military. The Bexar County Military Transition Center will ensure that our veterans in Military City, USA receive the support they deserve so they can continue contributing to our community long after they leave the military.  
￼ 
As always, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office with any questions or concerns. For further updates on my work for you, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube at @HurdontheHill.  
 Sincerely, 
 ￼  
Will Hurd Member of Congress

Dear Friends, 
I hope you're all having a good week. There are a few things going on in Wisconsin I'd like to take a moment to share with you.  
If You Love Your Freedom, Thank A Vet!   Even though Veterans Day was officially recognized earlier this week, we should all continue to take the time out of our busy day to thank America's veterans. They put on the uniform to ensure that the United States of America is the most free, most prosperous nation in history. Whether you're out and about at the gas station or grocery store, if even for a second, say thanks to a vet!

Dear Friend,
Missouri is home to nearly 500,000 veterans who have put their lives on the line to protect our freedom and way of life. We owe them a debt of gratitude for the countless sacrifices they made for us.
It’s important that we say thank you to our veterans, but it’s also important that we put those words into action.
This year, the Senate has passed and President Trump has signed into law several bills to support veterans and their families. Here’s an overview of the Senate’s work to honor our veterans:
	•	VA Mission Act: In May, the Senate overwhelmingly passed the bipartisan VA Mission Act to modernize veterans’ healthcare services at the VA and improve access to the high-quality, timely care veterans deserve.
	•	Veteran Peer Act: I was proud that my Veteran PEER Act was included in the VA Mission Act and signed into law. The Veteran PEER Act expands veterans’ access to peer counseling specialists to better combat the risks of suicide and treat associated mental health conditions.
	•	Veterans Employment Training Programs: I chair the Labor, Health and Human Services, & Education appropriations subcommittee. Our funding bill for FY2018provided $300 million for the Veterans Employment Training (VETS) Programs. This program provides separating service members with employment training and additional services as they transition to the civilian workforce.    
	•	Military Construction & Veterans Affairs Funding Bill: This bill included several priorities for Missouri veterans, such as funding for the VA electronic health record system. This will help streamline care as service members transition from the military to the VA system. The funding bill also included resources for medical facility improvements and cemetery expansion at the Jefferson Barracks Division of the VA St. Louis Health Care System. In response to the misconduct at the Fayetteville VA, the bill also included a provision to increase accountability and help prevent similar incidents in the future.
As we head into a new Congress, I will continue working to ensure we deliver on our promises to the brave men & women who served.
 
Sincere regards, 
￼

Since our nation's founding, our servicemembers have fought to preserve the freedoms and liberties that make this country the greatest in the world. 
On Veterans Day and every day, we must remember the service and sacrifice of our nation's veterans and their families and continue our commitment to our troops on the battlefield and our veterans as they return to civilian life. The last few days have been jam packed with some great events to honor our local veterans throughout NY-1:

November 12, 2018   Dear  @gmail.com,  Earlier today it was an honor to march in the Collinsville Veterans Day parade along with my fellow veterans from American Legion Post 365. 
￼ 
This weekend I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to speak at the Veterans Day ceremonies in Newton. Despite the bitter cold, attendance was outstanding! Legion members and volunteers put out 519 flags — one for each veteran in Jasper County — starting at 6 a.m. Saturday morning. 
￼
Friends, it was an honor to serve our great country in the U.S. Army, and I am thankful for the opportunity the people of the 15th District of Illinois gave me last week to continue serving you and our country in Congress.  
Many things will change when the 116th Congress convenes in January, but one thing I hope will only grow is the bipartisan support shown to our veterans. We have had many successes in the last two years to build on, including major reforms like:  
	•	the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which created an efficient process to remove, demote or suspend any VA employee for poor performance or misconduct.
	•	the VA MISSION Act, which consolidated the VA’s multiple community care programs and authorities and provided funding to sustain the Choice Program so veterans can get the care they earned and deserve, and 
	•	the Forever GI Bill, which removed restrictions so eligible veterans can use their education benefits throughout their lives, instead of within the current 15-year deadline.
All three of these landmark laws earned bipartisan support, and I hope Republicans and Democrats will continue working together on behalf of our veterans in the next Congress to ensure that those accountability measures are implemented and that those programs are funded as required.  
Thank you again to those who served, and God Bless America.  
Sincerely, ￼  John Shimkus Member of Congress

Dear Friends, 
First, and foremost, Happy Veterans Day. Yesterday marked the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, “The War to End All Wars.”  Sadly, tragically, war is still with us.  But this weekend, and officially today, we remember all members of our community – past and present – who have answered the call to duty and worn the Nation’s uniform in honorable service to our country. 
This past week I have had the great privilege of joining several events celebrating our veterans, including in Waukegan, Lake Forest, North Chicago, Great Lakes, Buffalo Grove, Grayslake and Highland Park.  It was an honor to meet so many veterans, to hear some of their stories, and best of all, to be able to personally thank them for their service.  The highlight, however, has been seeing so many neighbors, and especially young students of all ages, participate in these programs.  These veterans reflect the true spirit of our nation and are extraordinary role models for all of us. I am glad to see them get their just recognition. 
Our veterans have earned our utmost respect and have our care for their families and their physical and mental health, both before and after they hang up their uniforms. We also owe our veterans opportunity to transition into and succeed in civilian life. These are commitments I am resolved to uphold as your representative in Washington. 
I also know this is our first newsletter since last week’s election. I am grateful for the opportunity to continue serving you, and our entire Tenth District for two more years.  I am excited to continue our conversations and working together on the priorities of our communities.  In the weeks ahead, I look forward to sharing with you my hopes and goals for the 116th Congress that starts in January.  
In the meantime, this week I want to keep our focus on our veterans.  Please read on for an incredible story of a female WWII veteran and our efforts to give her and her family a belated recognition of her service.  
CONSTITUENT SERVICE SPOTLIGHT: HONORING WWII FEMALE PILOT WITH VETERAN STATUS
￼￼ 

On Friday, I was also privileged to participate in a ceremony honoring Janice Christensen, a World War II veteran of the elite Women’s Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) and former resident of Waukegan. 
Founded in 1943, WASP was a wartime civilian women pilots organization, which graduated only 1,074 women to operate military aircrafts and fly non-combat missions. Members flew more than 60 million miles throughout the course of the Second World War serving over 120 bases around the country, including missions towing aerial targets for anti-aircraft gun practice, simulating strafing missions, and more. Despite their military service, WASPs were denied veteran status until 1977. 
Sadly, Janice passed away in 1965, never having seen her military service properly honored. Our office worked with surviving members of the Christensen family to secure a World War II Victory medal and WASP medallion from the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
￼

While Janice never lived to see her service recognized, it is inspiring that our community came together to pay their respects to her and the other WASPs. 
Because of their honorable service, we have today a military that accepts all Americans willing and able to serve – man or woman, black or white, straight or gay. 
And because of her pioneering service, female pilots have gone on to serve with distinction in our Armed Forces, including in combat missions. We can look to our own Senator Tammy Duckworth as an example. 
  
VETERANS BREAKFAST IN WAUKEGAN 
￼ 
Janice’s case was unique, but our office has worked for hundreds of other Tenth Distrit veterans to help navigate the VA, Department of Defense, Medicare, Social Security, and other federal agencies on their behalf. Our team of experienced constituent service representatives is ready to serve you if you have a issues – please contact us at (847) 383-4870. 
In that spirit, it was a pleasure to welcome more than 100 local vets to a breakfast at Cristo St. Rey in Waukegan on Friday to thank them for their service and share a bit more about ways our office can be of assistance. 
  
HONORING VETERAN ENTREPRENEURS 
Did you know that nearly 1 our of every 10 businesses in the United States is veteran owned? Vets are self-employed at higher rates than civilians, and the skills learned in the military can translate well to entrepreneurship. 
Promoting opportunities for veteran-owned small businesses has been one of my focuses in Congress through support of the Boots to Business training program and protecting set-asides for federal contracts. 
This week, I introduced a bipartisan resolution celebrating the contributions of the many veteran-owned businesses creating jobs and improving communities across the country. 
Read the resolution online. 
  
NEIGHBORHOOD OFFICE HOURS 
This week, our constituent service representatives will be in Des Plaines, Waukegan, Wheeling, Zion, Grayslake and Highland Park. If you need assistance with a federal issue, from Medicare and Social Security to Immigration and the VA, please come see us!

Thanking members of our community who have served at a Veterans Day Commemoration in Buffalo Grove. Medal of Honor recipient Allen Lynch also attended. 
￼ 
Thank you Lake Forest Country Day School for inviting me to join last week’s assembly honoring local veterans. Wonderful to see young people thanking our veterans for their service. 
￼

I was glad to join today’s Veterans Day Commemoration ceremony at Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center and swearing in of new Executive Director Dr. Robert Buckley. Veterans of all ages were in attendance (including Barbara Miller who is a Marine Corps veteran and is 95).

￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ 

Dear Lindsey: 
As we celebrate Veterans Day, please join me in honoring and thanking our nation's veterans for dedicating their lives to defend our country. 
For over 200 years, brave women and men have proudly answered our nation's call to service at great cost to themselves and their families. From the Battle of Lexington and Concord on that fateful April morning, to the fields of Gettysburg, to the shores of France, to the Middle East and Africa today, selfless men and women have agreed to join the ranks of our Armed Forces and stand for something bigger than themselves. 
Our nation can never fully repay the debt we owe our men and women in uniform, but I am proud that our office can help. Since coming to Congress in 2015, we have assisted more than 400 veterans and their families to receive the benefits they were promised and earned. If we can ever be of service to you or a veteran that you know, please do not hesitate to contact us. It would be our honor to assist.
Again, thank you to all veterans for your service and sacrifice to our country.
￼ 
Sincerely, ￼ Mark DeSaulnier Member of Congress

Dear Lindsey, 
November is National Veterans and Military Families Month, a time for us to honor our nation’s heroes for their selfless dedication to our country. As the daughter of a Korean War veteran and the mother of an Army Captain, I know firsthand the hardships and uncertainty military families endure. I am proud to represent over 75,000 veterans who call Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District home.  Veterans Day is extra special in the St. Louis area this year. After years of renovations, the Soldiers Memorial Military Museum reopened on November 3rd. I recently attended a flag raising ceremony and toured the new state-of-the-art facility. Soldiers Memorial beautifully honors our local military members, veterans, and their families. We must always remember the service and sacrifice of men and women from all generations who have served our nation. These brave Americans put God and country before themselves to protect the freedoms we enjoy today. I humbly thank all veterans for their service to our great nation. 
￼
￼
￼
My staff is always ready to assist if you need help accessing VA benefits or making an appointment at a VA medical center. If you are a veteran and need assistance, please contact my district office at (636) 779-5449. The VA also has a crisis hotline for veterans, service members, and their loved ones, where they can receive confidential support 24/7. The hotline number is (800) 273-8255, or text 838255.
Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District has always been my home, and I am proud to continue serving such a strong and dedicated community. There is still much more work to be done to address the challenges facing our nation and build on the successes of this past Congress. I look forward to continue working to roll back burdensome red tape, bolster our economy, support our military, and provide a voice for the most vulnerable.
Sincerely,
￼  Ann Wagner Member of Congress

11/12/18 10:48,To All Those Who Served 🇺🇸  ,"￼

 Lindsey,  This Veterans Day, please join me in thanking all who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces. 
 Throughout our nation’s history, many brave men and women have answered the call to defend our nation.  I am grateful for each and every American who has stepped up to serve, and today I am reminded of the many Texas veterans who have donned our nation’s uniform.  ￼  More than one in 12 veterans have chosen to live in Texas, no doubt thanks in part to our state’s welcoming and patriotic nature. It is said that “Texas Defends America,” and when I reflect on the long, decorated list of veterans that have called our state home, I believe it to be true.
 We owe these men and women a great deal of appreciation and support—today and every day. So to all veterans in Texas, thank you. We are grateful for your service, daily sacrifice, and dedication to this nation.
 May God bless each veteran and their family, and may God continue to bless Texas and the United States of America.

 Sincerely,
￼

Wicker Underscores Critical Role of Family Caregivers During Alzheimer’s Awareness Month
Millions of Americans Provide Care to Loved Ones With Dementia
We are all too familiar with the debilitating effects of Alzheimer’s disease.  We know the disruption that its symptoms of progressive forgetfulness and confusion, leading eventually to helplessness, can cause in daily lives, and the major challenge we still face in finding a cure.  Alzheimer’s remains 100 percent fatal.
Not to be overlooked, however, is the profound impact that Alzheimer’s disease has on entire families.  Loved ones not only have to bear painful witness to their family member slipping away, but they also often carry the weight of arranging assisted living and special care.  Alongside the serious emotional toll is a tough financial reality, in which families endure years of additional costs or are forced to leave the workforce to provide the extra care themselves. 
Billions of Hours Devoted to Care
This month is an opportunity to shine light on the devotion displayed day in and day out by family caregivers, who often deal with their own health issues as they try to take care of their loved ones.  According to the Alzheimer’s Association, there are more than 16 million caregivers in the United States who lend billions of hours to those suffering from Alzheimer’s or other dementias.  Fittingly, November is recognized as both National Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month and National Family Caregivers Month.  The two are closely intertwined.
In 2015, I authored the “EUREKA Act” to help accelerate federal efforts to treat and cure Alzheimer’s disease.  That law, which supports the development of prize competitions for research breakthroughs, is also aimed at helping caregivers.  Earlier this year, a EUREKA competition was launched by the National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health calling on innovators to come up with technology-driven improvements in patient care. 
Efforts to Strengthen Caregiver Support and Training
Lawmakers have followed the “EUREKA Act” with other legislative initiatives that focus on critical outreach to caregivers.  One of these bills would support a nationwide infrastructure for understanding and treating Alzheimer’s disease.  That infrastructure would include new centers of excellence and state public health departments to help identify caregivers’ unique needs.  Another bill would encourage more comprehensive strategies for managing a patient’s care over time as well as innovative ways to deliver caregiver support and training.  I am a cosponsor of both of these bills and hope to see their passage in the Senate soon.  In the executive branch, training for caregivers has been a priority of both the Health Resources and Services Administration and the Administration for Community Living. 
These efforts coincide with support for strong research funding.  Congress was successful in increasing funding for Alzheimer’s research this year, exceeding the $2 billion in funding put forward as a goal by the “National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease.” 
Taking an aggressive approach to Alzheimer’s care is necessary.  Alzheimer’s affects an estimated 5.7 million Americans.  With Thanksgiving around the corner and the time this season affords us with our loved ones, it seems especially appropriate to extend our gratitude to the many people who are helping us in the fight against Alzheimer’s.  This includes not only researchers and health professionals but also family members and caregivers, whose constant love and compassion offer strength and hope amid heartbreaking circumstances.

Walker Weekly Report
I am humbled by the support our office has received and we know we are blessed with the opportunity to continue serving next year in the 116th Congress. We promise to always stay true to our mission and to put serving North Carolinians first. We will strive to empower North Carolina families by promoting responsible government, bridging traditional political and cultural divides, and advocating for the values of our constituents.
This week, we set a milestone in serving North Carolina veterans, we celebrate our nation's heroes on the centennial of the end of World War I, and we remember a young Greensboro police officer who gave the ultimate sacrifice keeping our community safe.
Keep reading for the full update. Have a blessed week.

HIGHLIGHTS

Humbled and Honored to Be Re-Elected as the Congressman for North Carolina's Sixth Congressional District
I am truly humbled by the opportunity to continue serving North Carolinians in the 116th Congress. I will work tirelessly every day to deliver on the faith you have placed in me – always remembering my promises to you, striving to help our families prosper, and advancing policies that restore the American Dream.
In the 116th Congress, we will face new challenges, but I will remain steadfast in my efforts to make a difference – not just an argument – and to deliver for the people of North Carolina.

Honoring North Carolina's Veterans and Closing our 1,000th Veterans Case
 
On Friday, our office closed our 1,000th veterans case. That's 1,000 North Carolina veterans who have been given the benefits and help they were promised when they signed up to serve our nation. On Veterans Day, and every day, we are dedicated to providing excellent care and service to our nation's heroes. 
Our veterans personify the virtues and ideals of our great nation and the timeless idea of serving a greater cause. God bless America's heroes and their families.
North Carolina veterans deserve better than to suffer for years on VA waiting lists or travel hours just to get the care they were promised when they put their country before themselves. Extending the Choice Program that helps get our heroes faster care closer to home and expanding assistance options for their family caregivers will help us keep our promise to our veterans, from the Greatest Generation to the current generation.
The signed into law VA MISSION Act is an important step in our office’s work to serve each of those who have given selflessly to our nation. We have also passed the Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act that will reform the VA to better serve our heroes and hold federal bureaucrats accountable for their unacceptable failures in caring for our nation’s veterans – as well as the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act to ensure Navy veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange get the care they deserve.

ABOUT BRADLEY | HOW CAN I HELP | CONTACT BRADLEY | WANT TO RECEIVE MY UPDATES?
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
This week, it is back to work on Capitol Hill. 
As I return to Washington after the October work period here in Southwest Alabama, I am energized to get back to work for the people of our region.  
I heard from many great folks during this past month, and time and again I heard the issues that were at the top of their lists: immigration, our economy, veterans’ services, and infrastructure.
We have a lot of work to do here in Congress before the end of this session.  
One of the top priorities of mine will be to pass my 50 Votes for the Wall Act. We must take the issue of illegal immigration seriously and treat it for what it is: a national security crisis.  
I hope my colleagues in the House will make the right choice for the American people and support me in my efforts to uphold the laws of our country. Be sure to follow my Facebook page for up-to-the-minute updates from Washington. 
Celebrating our Veterans 
￼ 
One hundred years ago, on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918, the world’s largest, deadliest, and costliest war to that date drew to an end. The guns that boomed over field and forest in Europe fell silent.  
World War I was over.
One year later, President Woodrow Wilson issued a statement to the nation in celebration of the first Armistice Day, expressing his thoughts on The War’s end. 
In 1938, twenty years after the Armistice, Congress formally recognized Armistice Day as a national holiday “dedicated to the cause of world peace.”
Raymond Meeks, a native of Birmingham, brought the idea of a national Veterans Day to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, to be held on what was then Armistice Day. Gen. Eisenhower greatly supported this idea, and in 1947 Weeks led the first national celebration of Veterans Day right here in Alabama. 
In 1954, President Eisenhower signed into law the formal celebration of Veterans Day here in the United States, dedicated to the memory of all those who served our country in the armed forces.  
To this day, words cannot express our gratitude for the service of our military members.
I continue to advocate strongly for our nation’s Veterans. We need to provide them with proper access to educational and workforce opportunities, we must work towards a healthcare system that works for them, and we must help them to get the services they deserve. 
Just this year, I voted to provide greater funding for programs in the VA, positive reforms to the G.I. Bill, and better access to career and technical education for veterans to reenter the civilian workforce.   
I was honored to take part in the Daphne High School Veterans Day Program on Friday and also spoke at the Loxley Veterans Memorial Dedication in Loxley Municipal Park on Saturday. Today, I attended a veterans celebration on Ono Island, and I look forward to being a part of the Veterans Day ceremony tomorrow at St. Luke's in Mobile and attending the annual Veterans Day Honors Luncheon at Fort Whiting.
Service in the military is more than just a job. It is a dedication to support and defend the Constitution and the people of the United States, both at home and abroad. That service is immeasurable, and I am humbled to represent those who have fought for our freedoms.  
Our Economic Strength 
￼ 
Last month’s jobs report showed another record month of job growth and availability throughout the United States. 
The strength of our economy in Alabama is apparent. The economic boom has brought benefits like lower debt and a stronger business climate to the people of Alabama. 
Thanks to conservative policies like last year’s historic tax cuts, the American people have more money in their pockets and our communities are stronger. Alabama is booming with more jobs, higher wages, and record low unemployment.
By keeping our workforce, business owners, and local businesses at the forefront of our pro-growth agenda, we continue to be better off now and stronger for the future. 
Getting Around the District 
￼ 
I recently spent some time in Atmore [bottom left] to discuss important issues. First, we held a roundtable with community leaders to talk about rural healthcare and efforts to save our rural hospitals. Second, I visited Rolin Construction to learn more about their projects across the Southeast and issues impacting their industry. Always good to be in Escambia County!
I spent some time with the Southwest Mobile County Chamber of Commerce Monday morning [top] to talk about the exciting things happening in Southwest Alabama and across the country. Our economy is booming, our military is stronger, and the American people are better off now. 
It was great to be at Mama Lou's Restaurant on Tuesday [middle left] for a meeting of the Robertsdale Rotary Club. I shared an update about how our communities like Robertsdale are safer, stronger, and more prosperous thanks to our pro-growth agenda. 
On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to visit with the team and tour the new Veterans Recovery Resources outpatient clinic and administration building in Mobile [middle right]. As we approach Veterans Day, it’s important to honor our veterans and all the organizations who support them, and it was great to see the work these folks are doing!
And on Thursday, we celebrated the grand opening of the new Charles White Family Health Center in the Hillsdale area out in west Mobile [bottom right]. I appreciate the important role community health centers play in promoting public health in Alabama.

On Sunday, I met Admiral Bill Daniels during the Veterans Day celebration on Ono Island. Admiral Daniels served our nation during World War II. A true American hero! 
What's Ahead 
On Tuesday, I will return to Washington to enter the final legislative period of this 115th Congress.  
My colleagues and I will be doing everything we can to advocate for a better America; we must focus on our military strength, our national and border security, pro-growth and pro-business policy, and must put the American people first while we still have the Republican majority in the House of Representatives.
After the end of this year, get ready for crazy season from Democrats in the House. They are going to try and impeach President Trump, impeach Justice Kavanaugh, and investigate everything under the sun. We will fight these ridiculous efforts and try to focus on results over resistance. Ultimately and thankfully, we have the Senate to block all these ridiculous efforts.
One thing is certain, as we get back to work in Washington, I will continue to be a strong advocate for these issues and for the people of Alabama.  
As always, if you need help with a federal agency or have questions about anything under debate in Washington, please contact my office. You can call my Mobile office at 251-690-2811 or you can click here to send me an email directly. I also invite you to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to get up-to-the-minute updates on my travel in Southwest Alabama. At the end of the day, my staff and I are here to serve you! 
Stay in touch, 
￼

November 11, 2018
Greetings,
Monday marked the first anniversary of the horrific attack on the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs. One year ago, America mourned the 26 innocent lives taken by a madman that Sunday morning. But the light of providence shone through dark clouds. We celebrated the heroism of Stephen Willeford and Johnnie Langendorff, who chased down and stopped the murderer. We prayed with the survivors, and their countrymen came together to offer aid and solace. We honored the strength and leadership of survivors like Pastor Frank Pomeroy, who lost his own daughter that terrible day, but summoned the grace and courage to comfort his congregation.
The memorial tower of the new First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs will be a lasting home for the bell of the old church. When it rings out for future generations, it will make a joyful noise: one of remembrance, of victory, and of trust that a joy deeper than our understanding blooms in the midst of sorrow.
This Veterans Day, we pause to honor the selfless service and unyielding courage of the men and women of our Armed Forces. We say ‘thank you’ to every brave soldier, sailor, airman, marine, and coast guardsman who pledge themselves to the defense of our nation, our Constitution, and our way of life.
The Lone Star State is home to 1.6 million veterans, and our home has a rich tradition of military service. From Fort Bliss to Red River Army Depot, from Sheppard Air Force Base to Naval Air Station Kingsville, Texas is proud to stand as a pillar in America’s national security.
Today, we especially honor the memory of millions of Americans, including 200,000 Texans, who served in World War I, a conflict of such devastation that its victorious end became a national holiday eventually dedicated to all Veterans: Armistice Day. On the 11th hour, of the 11th day, of the 11th month of 1918, the last guns of the Western Front went silent. One hundred years later, the sacrifice of those who sang ‘we won't come back ‘til it's over, over there’ resounds across the ages, answered with gratitude and fond remembrance in every American heart.
Please read below for an update from this last week.
Keep Texas Strong,

Dear Friend, 
 As our community gathers together this weekend to celebrate and honor our veterans, we must first acknowledge the beautiful lives that were so tragically lost this week at Borderline Bar & Grill. As a community, we have weathered significant challenges in the past — by coming together and helping where there is need — and I know we will do so again.
 As we remember those who were taken from us this week, I want to mention two of them: Navy veteran Tel Orfanos and Marine veteran Dan Manrique. They both symbolize what is so special about the long and proud military tradition here in Ventura County — a dedication to the greater good, our shared values, and ceaseless humility and selflessness.
 On this day each year, we recognize and thank our veterans who embody those qualities and who have served our country with such honor and bravery. This year, we also acknowledge others within our community who demonstrate that same selflessness and humility that our veterans exemplify daily.
 I saw it in the actions of Sgt. Ron Helus, who gave his life to save others. I saw it in the young people who carried their friends out of the bar to safety. I saw it in our own Sheriff Geoff Dean, days from retirement, who lost a friend and who stood strong during this terrible ordeal so that others could find strength through him. And I saw it in all of our first responders, who sacrifice for our community every single day.
 So, as we honor our veterans, let’s do so by recognizing those here in Ventura County who live their lives, and have given their lives, in pursuit of a higher ideal. The ideal of community, of purpose, and of selflessness.
 Sincerely,
￼
JULIA BROWNLEY Member of Congress  P.S. Your suggestions help me do a better job of serving you. Did you find this email informative? [Yes] [No] [Other]

From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:
Good Afternoon,
This week in Congress, I paid tribute to our men and women in uniform by participating in the Lycoming County Veterans Day Parade in Hughesville.
￼  
Recognizing the Sacrifices of Our Veterans
I had the distinct honor to walk in the Veterans Day Parade with our veterans, first responders, and all who support our past and present military personnel in PA-10. Each year, the Veterans Day Parade is held in a different town in Lycoming County. School bands, area fire trucks, police, members of the American Legion, and veterans of Lycoming County walked from the Hughesville Fairgrounds to the fire hall. I am always impressed by the detail and the hard work put into the floats. We owe a constant debt of gratitude to those who have served our great nation. Thank you to our veterans and their families for your countless sacrifices to keep America safe.

2018 Congressional App Challenge Competition 
Congratulations to Alan Everett, of Millerstown, PA, for winning this year’s Congressional App Competition for Pennsylvania’s Tenth Congressional District!
￼
The Congressional App Challenge, an organization created in 2013 in conjunction with the U.S. House of Representatives and the Internet Education Foundation, encourages students to learn to code and inspires them to pursue careers in computer science. The contest, which launched in June with student submissions reviewed in late October, was open to all middle and high school students in PA-10.
Alan’s app was entitled Constructing Computer Logic for All, which allows users to design logic circuits. I am constantly amazed by the capability of our students to solve problems with technology. In today’s digital age, STEM, coding, and computer science are rapidly growing and Alan’s app will undoubtedly inspire other students to pursue careers in these fields. I am proud of Alan for his hard work and happy to announce him as the winner of the Congressional App Challenge Competition for Pennsylvania’s Tenth Congressional District. I thank Alan for his innovation and I know he has a very bright future in science and technology.
USDA and ONDCP Unveil Latest Tool to Help Rural Communities Address the Opioid Epidemic
The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and U.S. Department of Agriculture worked in tandem to develop the Rural Resource Guide to Help Address Substance Use Disorder and Opioid Misuse. This resource guide enables rural leaders to find Federal resources that can help them combat opioid use in their communities. This tool is another positive step forward in addressing the misuse of opioids that has affected so many Americans.
Taking Action to Ensure Safe Hauling of Livestock
I joined 59 other Members of Congress in sending a letter to the Federal Motor Carrier Association in support of Hours of Service (HOS) waivers for livestock haulers.
￼
The current HOS rules negatively impact the health and safety of livestock. We must ensure a framework that meets the unique needs of our livestock haulers and the animals they transport.
To learn more about the current Hours of Service rules and what Congress is doing to support our livestock haulers, click here.
Annual Crow Migration Poses Health Risk
Midway through fall, many areas in PA-10 see a major influx of crows. The Infection Prevention and Control at UPMC Susquehanna cautions that these birds and their droppings carry a variety of diseases harmful to people. Those living in residential areas can help to prevent the spread of germs by discouraging these birds from roosting around buildings. Anyone coming into contact with these birds, or their droppings, should wash their hands with soap and water.
As Always…
Please never hesitate to contact me at my offices in the district or in Washington, D.C.  I want to hear from you and learn what is most important to serve you in the best possible way.

ISSUES AND LEGISLATION 
November 11, 2018 
Midterm Election Results:
Congratulations to each candidate across the nation who were duly elected in their respective elections on Tuesday night and congratulations to Congressman-elect Steven Watkinsas he heads to Congress as your new representative for Kansas’ Second District. I know he will serve you, our district, and our country well.
Representing our great state of Kansas is the honor of a lifetime and it is my hope is that our elected officials consistently work for what is best for the good people we represent.
 
Look Ahead to Remainder of 115th Session of Congress:
As Congress heads into the final stretch of the 115th Congress, there are several priorities that need to be completed before the end of the year.
One of the most fundamental roles of Congressis funding the government. There has been historic progress made during the current budget cycle as Congress passed the majority of its appropriations bills for the upcoming fiscal year 2019. In the coming weeks, Congress will continue to debate the final few spending bills to send to the President’s desk.
It is also common knowledge in the Wheat State that when farmers and ranchers do well, our communities also flourish. However, farm families face uncertainty when Congress does not do its part to reauthorize a timely Farm Bill and strengthen its essential risk management tools. This year’s Farm Bill, which is currently in conference between the House and Senate, must be completed and sent to the President soon to ensure that farmers and ranchers have the ability to plan for the long-term. As America’s economy continues to accelerate from our tax cuts and regulatory reform, this legislation will help our producers overcome challenging and uncontrollable dynamics like blizzards, droughts, and prairie fires—and in some particularly awful years, all three in quick succession.The tradition of a farmer passing her operation to her children when that time comes is a testament to the generations of successful aggies in Kansas and I promise to continue helping Kansas farmers help feed the world.
I am looking forward to getting down to business on these issues and more during the final months of the 115th session of Congress.
 
Hosting Open Office Hours:
On Tuesday afternoon, I held open office hours and was glad for the chance to have several productive discussions ranging from H.R. 392, the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2017, to ensure small businesses are not knee deep in federal regulation, and the grassroots actions taken by the United Nations Foundation’s Nothing But Nets campaign that focuses on fighting malaria. Thank you to everyone who stopped by!

Dear Friends,

It's Veterans Day, and we thank all the brave men and woman who have served our country here at home and abroad. It is because of our veterans' sacrifices that we enjoy the freedoms we have today. 

If you see a veteran, take time to say, ""thank you!"" I'm proud to have four veterans on my staff who work tirelessly to ensure our heroes get the care and benefits they have earned. May we always be grateful for the ultimate sacrifices that have been made for the liberties we enjoy, and may we never take our freedoms for granted.

Thank You, Veterans
￼
Today, we are celebrating the centennial of the end of World War I - the war to end all wars. The armistice was signed at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, which we call Veterans Day here in the United States. 

Over the 70,000 Arkansans traveled over in 1917 to support our brothers in France and Great Britain. Two of those Arkansans were my grandfather and great uncle. The war changed and shaped their lives for the rest of their days. The poppy on my lapel is a symbol of remembrance for WWI. Poppies were said to be the first flowers to grow in the churned-up earth of soldiers' graves after the war as immortalized in the poem, ""In Flanders Field."" 
I am thankful for our troops here at home and our military partners who have stood beside our soldiers during times of war and in peace. Watch my video here. 
Morrilton Intermediate School's Veterans Day Assembly
￼
It was a real treat to speak with such bright young students at Morrilton Intermediate School's Veterans Day Assembly as we honored our Morrilton veterans. I am always encouraged to see the next generation of Arkansans supporting our heroes, and I enjoyed having the opportunity to meet with some of these young students. 

My Great Uncle and WWI Veteran, Ralph Brownwell Hill
￼
Both my great uncle and grandfather served with distinction in WWI. My great uncle, Ralph Brownwell Hill, was just 22-years-old when he enlisted in the French Army Medical Corps. He volunteered for the American Field Service driving an ambulance in France during WWI. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre, valorous service medal award, for his “courage and military greatness” after helping to evacuate an outpost as toxic shells rained down. 

After the war, he stayed to study in France, later returning to Little Rock and eventually forming Vinson-Hill, an investment brokerage company with my grandfather, Jay. For more historical insights, visit Pulaski County History Society. 

Honoring Our Vilonia Veterans 
￼
Tom, my Director of Veterans Affairs, was on hand today for the Veterans Day Patriotic Program at the Museum of Veterans and Military History in Vilonia. The day included a great WWII reenactment and a time of honoring our brave Arkansas veterans.

A veteran himself, Tom assists other Arkansas heroes get the care and benefits they have earned. If you, or someone you know, needs assistance, please contact my team at (501) 324-5941 or at hill.house.gov.

Julie's Sweet Shoppe 
￼
For Veterans Day each year, Julie Sweet Shoppe opens its doors to veterans across the state. I have been fortunate to attend this event for three years now, and every year I am impressed with this example of our community stepping up to show our veterans our appreciation for their dedication and sacrifice to protect our freedoms. 

Thank you for taking time to keep up with the work I'm doing on your behalf. If I can be any assistance to you or your family, please reach out to my office at (501) 324-5941 or Hill.House.Gov.

Weekly Update: Today, We Honor our Veterans By Congressman Rob Wittman November 11, 2018  Since the dawn of our nation, our Armed Forces have stood up and fought for our freedom; we sleep soundly because of their bravery. Our veterans made great sacrifices for us on the battlefield and we owe them a debt of gratitude for that service. Nearly 800,000 call Virginia home, and I am committed to ensuring our veterans can access the benefits they've earned through their service to a grateful nation. We stop today and give pause on Veterans Day to honor those who have answered our nation’s call to arms.  This Veterans Day we remember the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day, or the armistice from the first Great War of the last century— November 11th. The cessation of hostilities on the Western Front of World War I took effect at eleven o'clock in the morning—the ""eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month"" of 1918. The name was changed to Veterans Day in 1954 to recognize all who have served our great nation.  The First District is home to one of the highest growing veterans populations but also plays an important role in the future of our military as well, with many of our nation’s finest warriors stationed at places like Fort A.P. Hill, Marine Corps Base Quantico and NSWC Dahlgren. Over the years, I’ve been blessed to get to know many of those men and women, and they are a constant inspiration. Their support for this Nation is steadfast, their determination to see a mission through is unwavering, and their integrity and selflessness are unflinching.  This weekend I got to spend time with some of our nation’s heroes. Yesterday, I attended the Veterans Day Ceremony at the A.T. Johnson Museum in Montross to honor World War I and World War II veterans and today, I spent the morning at the Fredericksburg Area Veterans Council’s Veterans Day Ceremony to honor all who have served our country.  Without the efforts of these dedicated souls we would not be the Nation that we are today.  We remember all who have served this Nation. Grandfathers who stormed the beaches at Normandy, uncles who fought through torrential rains in Korea, cousins who braved the jungles of Vietnam, and of course the sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, and husbands and wives who have served or are currently serving our Nation.   This Congress, the House has made landmark changes for these heroes. America’s veterans deserve the highest quality medical care and most efficient delivery of benefits possible. The VA MISSION Act consolidated the VA’s multiple community care programs and authorities and provides further funding to sustain the Choice Program so veterans can get the care they earned and deserve. The House has also passed the Forever GI Bill - Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act to enhance or expand education benefits for veterans, service members, families and survivors, and the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act to expand VA benefits to approximately 90,000 sailors who served off the coast during the Vietnam War.  I hope you take the time this Veterans Day to speak with some veterans and learn more about their service. America is who she is today because of them. I would like to thank all of you who have served our Nation, for what you have done, and what you continue to do.

Dear Friend, 
As we celebrate Veterans Day, I want to extend my thanks to our veterans and the families who support them. It is an honor and privilege to represent you in Congress. To honor their sacrifices and commitment to our country, it is our duty to take care of our warfighters and their families. I’m honored to work to ensure that our veterans’ sacrifices are not forgotten, and I am committed to ensuring that our nation’s promises are kept to our veterans and their families. 
￼ 
Meeting with the Vietnam Veterans of America Forsyth, Ga. chapter in August. 
While there is certainly much more work to be done, I am proud of what we have accomplished the last two years, and I thank President Trump for his commitment to our troops and to rebuilding our military in order to assure American freedom and the society which we enjoy. 
Congress has also delivered many of the reforms we promised veterans, and we have done so in a bipartisan way, and with the House and Senate working together. Now, the VA will begin implementing these reforms. Rest assured that Congress will continue to monitor the implementation of these reforms to ensure they are done properly and as quickly as possible. 
As members of Congress, we have a duty to ensure our veterans receive the benefits and support they deserve. VA’s current process for reviewing disability claims is broken. There’s absolutely no reason a veteran should wait for months or years on end to hear back on their disability appeals claim. Any servicemember who is injured in service to our great country deserves access to every benefit they’re entitled to – and they deserve for that access to be timely.  There is progress being made to address the backlog of appeals claims, and the House Veterans Affairs Committee held an oversight hearing to check on their progress toward implementing the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, legislation signed into law by President Trump that will speed up the appeals process once implemented by the VA. 
We’ve also made great strides toward reforming VA health care. In June, the VA MISSION Act was signed into law with my support. This was a big win for our veterans. Specifically, the legislation: 
	•	Streamlines VA’s seven community care programs into one cohesive program;
	•	Funds the Choice Program for one year while VA implements the new program created under the VA MISSION Act;
	•	Expands the VA’s Caregiver Program to veterans of all eras and their caregivers; and
	•	Creates a non-partisan process for reviewing the department’s assets to ensure veterans are receiving the care they need where they need it.
It also includes a number of provisions that would strengthen VA’s internal capacity to provide timely, quality care at VA facilities by improving and expanding VA’s ability to train, recruit and retain the very best providers. 
￼ 
Working to ensure our more than 53,000 GA-08 veterans get the care they deserve. 
Also, I am very proud to share that in June, President Trump signed into law a bill authored by myself and Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) to remove an undue burden on veterans seeking to be buried in cemeteries under the control of the National Park Service, such as Andersonville National Cemetery. In short, this law, the Veterans Cemetery Benefit Correction Act, requires the Department of Interior to provide an outer burial receptacle, or “grave liner,” at no cost for veterans buried at National Park Service managed cemeteries. Previously, this benefit was only available to veterans seeking to be buried in cemeteries under the control of the VA.
Thanks to a constituent who raised the issue to me a few years back, and with the support of Sen. Isakson, Congressman Sanford Bishop (GA-02) and other allies in Congress, we were able to close this gap in benefits and ensure our veterans and their families receive the benefits promised to them, no matter where they are laid to rest.
￼ 
Highlights of the Veterans Cemetery Benefit Correction Act, which was signed into law in June. 
These are just a few of the ways this Congress has been working for our troops, their families, and our veterans. As we continue to work on policy issues this year and gear up for the 116th Congress to start in January, I look forward to continuing to press my colleagues on the importance of continued VA reform and supporting our active duty troops. We are who we are today because of your service, and I aim to make sure no one ever forgets that. 
It’s a great honor to represent so many veterans and to represent all of those who serve at Robins and Moody Air Force Bases. Middle and South Georgia have a rich history of military service, and our Veterans, Guardsmen, Reservists, and Active Duty warfighters are continually meeting the call to deploy and protect our great nation. 
My staff is always available to assist veterans with VA disability claims or any other federal issue. If you or a member of your family needs assistance, please call any of our offices or visit my website by clicking here.  
￼ 
If you are a veteran experiencing issues with the VA, please give us a call. 
To our veterans and their families, thank you for your bravery, service, and sacrifice. It is an honor and a privilege to represent you in Congress.

Happy Veterans Day: Honoring all who served.

Dear Lindsey,
We all can learn a lot from veterans, especially during divided times. Veterans are diverse- all races, all political affiliations, genders, and generations. But nearly every veteran has a sense of camaraderie and fellowship with other veterans. They are a united group who served to defend our freedom.  A few months ago, I had the privilege to meet with veterans from the Greatest Generation - Richard Over (age 96) and Sandy Treat (age 95). Both trained at Camp Hale in Colorado - and served our country in defeating the Nazis (on skis, no less). It was a profound honor to hear their stories.
￼
Located between Red Cliff and Leadville, Camp Hale was established in 1942 as a training facility for the Army’s famed 10th Mountain Division. Soldiers at Camp Hale trained in mountain climbing, skiing, and cold weather survival contributing to our victory in Europe particularly in the Austrian Alps.
To honor Sandy, Richard, and so many others, the Continental Divide Recreation, Wilderness and Camp Hale Legacy Act, which I co-sponsor with Sen. Michael Bennet, designates Camp Hale as the first-ever National Historic Landscape.
In addition, it expands protected public lands in Colorado by over 90,000 acres - encompassing areas like Williams Fork, the Tenmile Range, Hoosier Ridge, and Porcupine - as well as expanding the existing Holy Cross, Eagles Nest, and Ptarmigan Peak Wilderness Areas.   Read more about it here:

Rep. Jared Polis visits Vail in bid to protect heritage and legacy of 10th Mountain Division birthplace
The Continental Divide Recreation, Wilderness and Camp Hale Legacy Act signifies how we can and must honor veterans. It directly honors them through Camp Hale, but it also honors the lands and country that they served to protect. 
Thank a veteran today on Veterans Day and honor them always.
Sincerely,
￼
Jared Polis,
Representative

Dear Friends, 
On Veterans Day, Americans pause to salute the brave men and women who have served our country to protect and defend freedom and democracy. Because of their many sacrifices, veterans and members of the Armed Forces deserve nothing less than our ongoing commitment to care for their needs both during and after their service to our country.  
As the 115th Congress draws to a close, I’m proud to have been part of many successful efforts to strengthen our nation’s commitment to caring for the needs of veterans. Last year I cosponsored and voted for the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act which lifted the 15-year time limit on the use of veterans’ GI bill education benefits. The law also expanded GI benefits to all post-9/11 Purple Heart recipients, and created a pilot program for veterans to take high technology courses. This law will ensure more veterans have access to the economic opportunities that come with a college education following their service. More recently, I voted for the Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act to increase disability benefits for disabled veterans, and for spouses and children of fallen servicemembers to ensure their benefits keep pace with inflation.  
I’m very proud that Congressional Democrats helped secure a $5 billion increase in funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). These funds will be used to improve mental health and suicide prevention services for veterans, invest in new and existing VA facilities, and create an electronic health records system within the VA. 
I’m also pleased to announce that I will introduce legislation in the coming days to make it easier for non-profit veterans organizations to qualify for 501(c)19 tax exempt status. Currently, veterans’ organizations can qualify for this tax-exempt status if at least 75 percent of their members are veterans. Some organizations have lost their tax-exempt status and been forced to shut down as elderly members pass away. My legislation changes this requirement to allow the spouses, widows, or widowers of a veteran to count toward this eligibility requirement. The spouses of our veterans have made tremendous sacrifices and are often deeply involved in the work of these groups. My legislation will ensure organizations that are dedicated to improving the wellbeing of veterans can continue their critical work without the fear of losing this important tax-exemption.  
We have an abiding obligation to serve the brave men, women and their families who have served our country. So, on this Veterans Day let us honor their service with actions that fulfill our commitment to our servicemembers and their families, past and present…actions that are worthy of them from a deeply grateful nation. 
Warm regards,  
￼  Anna G. Eshoo

Hi, 
Since the founding of our nation, millions of men and women have served our country and defended the freedoms Americans enjoy. Veterans Day is an opportunity to show our appreciation for those who have selflessly answered this call to serve. As we pay tribute to them on this day, it’s important to remember that we must show our support for veterans year-round by ensuring that they and their families are taken care of and receive the benefits they have earned as well as the full support of their communities. 
Colorado is home to thousands of veterans and I have had the pleasure of meeting and hearing from many of them across the Third Congressional District. It is unacceptable that many veterans have been made to wait, or even worse, go without the medical care they need because of mismanagement, bureaucratic red tape or understaffing at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). We have implemented numerous reforms that have steadily addressed the issues plaguing the VA, including a recent reform Congress passed and the President signed. The VA MISSION Act removes more of the barriers that have prevented veterans from receiving timely and quality healthcare in the past. 
Included in the VA MISSION Act is language from my bill, the Veterans Improved Access and Care Act of 2017. This provision eliminates an arbitrary rule which mandated that veterans could only seek non-VA healthcare if they were unable to receive care at a VA facility within 30 days or if they lived 40 miles away from a VA facility. Now that it is law, veterans will have access to more local healthcare providers regardless of their situation or location, improving access to timely care.
While we have come a long way to reforming the VA and access to care, there is still much work to be done and we must continue to enact reforms to ensure that our nation is fully living up to the promises made to veterans. 
Another reform that I am currently advancing through Congress would provide dental benefits to low-income veterans. While medical benefits are available to all veterans through the VA, dental benefits are not. This can create a variety of problems for veterans who may not have dental insurance or cannot afford to pay for a trip to the dentist’s office out of pocket. Going without routine dental care can have severe impacts on an individual’s health and wellbeing, so I recently introduced the Dental Care for Low-Income Veterans Act to help provide critical dental benefits to veterans who need them most.
We owe our nation’s veterans a tremendous debt of gratitude, so as we take this day to honor those who answered the call to serve, let us also reaffirm our commitment to honor them year-round by providing them with the care and benefits that they have rightfully earned. My team and I are always available to assist Colorado’s veterans with the VA and other federal agencies, and if you or someone you know is having a problem with their veteran’s benefits, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office at 719-542-1073. 
To those of you who have served, I thank you and wish you a very happy Veterans Day. God bless you all, and God Bless America.
Sincerely,

Congressman Flores Announces 2018 TX-17 Congressional Veteran Commendation Recipients 

 
For the seventh consecutive year, U.S. Representative Bill Flores is recognizing local veterans for their service to our nation and community with a unique award – the TX-17 Congressional Veteran Commendation.

“On Veterans Day we honor those men and women who have served in our nation’s military. The 17th Congressional District is home to thousands of veterans, many of which have continued their service through their involvement in our communities.  Today, I am privileged to announce that we are awarding 26 veterans with the TX-17 Congressional Veteran Commendation. The military service of this year’s receipts span over seven decades, from World War II to the current War on Terror,” Congressman Flores said. 

Congressman Flores started awarding local veterans annually with the TX-17 Congressional Veteran Commendation in 2012 to coincide with Veterans Day. The veterans who receive this commendation are nominated by local constituents in recognition of both their military service and service to their respective communities. Recipients of the commendation receive a special commemorative challenge coin, a certificate of recognition and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol in their honor on Veterans Day.

“Our nation’s veterans have sacrificed much for our freedom and liberties and we owe them a debt of gratitude for their selfless service. I look forward to awarding these veterans with their well-deserved commendations and continuing this 17th District Veterans Day tradition,” Flores added.

Recognizing Veterans, Past and Present
Every Veterans Day, we honor the sacrifices and bravery of our nation's military. It is our duty as a nation to remember veterans who selflessly served and made great sacrifices to protect our rights and freedoms.
To recognize some of Pennsylvania's brave veterans, I hosted a ceremony in Hamlin (Wayne County) honoring Vietnam veterans with a commemorative pin. Our commonwealth's Vietnam veterans bravely served this country and it was an honor for my office to recognize them for their service.
As the son of a U.S. Marine, I know firsthand the sacrifices that our veterans and their families make. God bless our men and women in uniform on this Veterans Day, and every day.

Celebrating Emmaus Public Library
This week, I joined the staff at Emmaus Public Library to celebrate the opening of the new children's wing. The 2,780 square foot addition increases the library's current floor space and provides a new area for children's classes, events, and collections.
Libraries have long played an important role in communities, both for promoting literacy and providing access to important resources. I am certain this new addition will prove a valuable investment in the community. Congratulations to the great folks at Emmaus Public Library on this wonderful expansion!

Supporting Pennsylvania's Manufacturers
Since joining the Senate in 2011, I have consistently supported pro-growth policies to help job creators in Pennsylvania thrive. From passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, to rolling back erroneous and overbearing regulations, Congress has made significant progress in the right direction.
This week, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) recognized my work by honoring me with the Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence, which recognizes Members of Congress who support policies that enhance the ability of U.S. manufacturers to succeed in the global economy.
I'm honored to be recognized by NAM for my efforts to strengthen Pennsylvania's important manufacturing industry and look forward to continuing this important work.

￼
Bad Policy for Pennsylvania's Employers
The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is a federal program mandating oil refiners to blend a certain amount of renewable fuels, such as corn ethanol, into the nation's fuel supply every year. Not only has the RFS failed to achieve its intended goals, the program also imposes financial harm on motorists, the broader transportation sector, and domestic oil refiners that are forced to comply with the mandate. The Trump administration recently directed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to craft a rule allowing for the year-round sale of E15 gasoline -- an important priority on the ethanol industry's wish list. This one-sided approach to reforming the RFS only benefits the powerful ethanol lobby and its allies, and threatens the existence of oil refiners like Monroe Energy and Philadelphia Energy Solutions.
To better understand the threat posed by this policy, I brought together Pennsylvania refineries, local labor leaders, business stakeholders, and elected officials in Trainer (Delaware County) to discuss the RFS.
While the best solution is the full repeal of the RFS, that is unlikely to happen in the near future. The Trump administration should enact reforms to the RFS that improve conditions for both the agriculture and oil refining sectors. I appreciate the chance to hear from the affected parties directly and will continue my work to find a suitable solution.

Congressman McHenry Weekly Update - Honoring Our Nation's Veterans


Honoring All Who Served



Today is Veteran's Day, a day in which we celebrate and honor all the brave men and women who have served in our nation's military. I am thankful for everything these heroes have done to defend our freedoms and keep our country safe. Please join me in thanking our country's veterans for their service today and every day. In the Tenth District we have many U.S. military veterans who continue to serve the western North Carolina community. CKL Electrical Contractors, Inc. in Forest City recently received the HIRE Vets Medallion award. This award from the United States Department of labor honors the employers who hire our nation's heroes. Congratulations to this Tenth District company for their service to our veterans.

￼





Armistice Day



On this day, one hundred years ago we celebrated Armistice Day, which marked the end of World War I. On November 11, 1918 Germany surrendered and signed a peace treaty with the Allied Forces. I am thankful for the sacrifices made by U.S. soldiers a century ago to protect the freedoms that continue to make this country great today.

￼





Happy Birthday to the United States Marine Corps



On Saturday, the United States Marine Corps celebrated 243 years of dedicated service to our nation. Since they were established in 1775 the United States Marines have defended our freedoms and kept our country safe. Please join me in honoring these brave men and women and thanking them for their service. Click here to watch a video of the history of the Marine Corps birthday.

Honoring our Nation's Heroes
 
 
Happy Veterans Day to our nation's heroes! We will never be able to thank them enough for their service to our country. This year, Veterans Day is especially significant because it also marks the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. This is an opportunity to reflect on the many sacrifices that have been made to protect our rights and freedoms- sacrifices that must never be taken for granted. Today and everyday, we salute our veterans!

Moving Our Country Forward 
 
 
I am so honored to spend another term as your Representative in Congress. Thank you from the the bottom of my heart for your support and trust in me. Although we now have a divided Washington, I am committed to advancing policies that will move our country forward and build on the many accomplishments of the last two years. 
 

 
Disaster Recovery Efforts 
 
 
I am so grateful for the tireless work of federal, state, and local officials during Hurricane Florence as well as for their ongoing efforts throughout the recovery process. Over the last few weeks my staff and I have met with disaster recovery officials across the district to learn about their experience during Hurricane Florence and see how we can help them as they support our community through recovery. We also received valuable input about how we can improve disaster preparedness in the future. I will continue to be in close communication with these officials and work to ensure they have the resources necessary to do their job.
 

￼
 
 
FEMA Updates
 
 
As our community continues to recover from Hurricane Florence, I will keep you updated with information from FEMA that may be helpful to you and your family during this process.

Intern Spotlight
 
 
We are lucky to have a great interns serving the Seventh District in our Washington D.C. office. Here is what they had to say about their experience interning in our office:
Tara Hix is from Myrtle Beach and said, ""As a fellow constituent, I like working for Congressman Tom Rice because it is an honor being able to help serve my own District. I also think it is incredibly neat how we have the opportunity to be so close to the legislative process.""   Katie Kerrigan is from Oakton, Virginia and said, ""I like working for Congressman Tom Rice because it is an excellent opportunity to see and understand the legislative process, while being able to provide help for constituents in the 7th District. There is truly nothing more exciting than being at the heart of American politics.""

￼
America will continue to be the greatest nation on Earth because of the sacrifices of our brave men and women in uniform and their families. We owe a debt of gratitude to these heroes. This Veterans Day is a time for us to recommit ourselves to upholding the promises we made to them. I will continue to strive to do my part. 

To the members of the United States Armed Forces, past and present, thank you for your service. May God bless our troops, and may God continue to bless the United States of America.
 

Friends, 
 
Last week, a record number of Americans exercised our constitutional right to vote. We saw the highest turnout for a midterm election since 1966. As Fort Bragg’s Congressman, I am constantly grateful for the sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform to preserve this right for all of us. That’s exactly why my wife Renee and our son Lane prayed for our veterans, active duty service members and their families as we headed to the polls. We are fortunate to live in the most vibrant democracy in the world. 
 
As citizens, it is our duty to make our voices heard.
 
As you know, the midterm elections changed Washington’s landscape. Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives with Democrats gaining a slim majority, and Republicans maintained control of the Senate with an even bigger majority than before. We’ve seen a similar pattern like this over the years. On average, the president’s party has lost 32 House seats in a midterm election. And as recently as 2010, the president’s party lost 63 seats.
 
While I am disappointed to see Republicans lose our majority in the House, I am grateful for the opportunity to continue representing you in Congress. It’s humbling to know folks across our district overwhelmingly believe in my ongoing work to provide top-notch constituent services, rebuild our military, give veterans the care they deserve, back small businesses and support working families. I can assure you I will continue to be a conservative voice and stand up for our district’s priorities.
 
Across the country, it is clear Americans have divided opinions – and we have a divided government again. It is my hope that over the next two years Washington can avoid the partisan politics that has dogged our country before and continue to focus on real solutions. It is imperative that Republicans and Democrats come together to get things done. I’ve made working across the aisle a top priority since my first days in office, and I’ve had several bipartisan bills signed into law. In fact, a local paper in North Carolina applauded the bipartisan work of G. K. Butterfield, a Democrat from Wilson, and me earlier this year, saying “… there are thoughtful, hardworking lawmakers on both sides of the aisle working mightily to fix what’s broken.”
 
I hope we will see this kind of bipartisanship for the next two years and Democrats will work with Republicans and President Trump to build on the progress we’ve made. Because we’ve seen incredible results so far: the biggest tax cuts in history that have led to more jobs and more take-home pay; unprecedented resources and policy changes to fight the opioid epidemic; landmark VA reform to break the bureaucracy of the VA and give our veterans the care they deserve; anti-human trafficking legislation that has decreased online advertising for sex trafficking by 80%; policies to build the wall and protect our border, support ICE and target dangerous gangs like MS-13; and historic funding to rebuild our military and give our troops their largest pay raise in a decade.
 
At the end of the day, I identify as a conservative Republican. Some of my colleagues might identify as liberal Democrats. But we are first and foremost proud Americans working to better our country, and that’s the perspective I will continue to take into the work I do on your behalf in Congress.  
 
 
Until next week,
￼
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)

Happy Veterans Day
￼
No one is more worthy of respect than our veterans. On Veterans Day, we honor those brave, selfless men and women who put on the uniform to serve our nation.

President Woodrow Wilson declared the first Veterans Day, then called “Armistice Day”, in 1919. So many of our countrymen had been sent overseas to fight in the Great War. Europe had been ravaged. Entire countries were decimated. Truly, the world emerged a different place. Yet our homeland remained unscathed. President Wilson recognized the importance of thanking those who had served so valiantly.

Our republic has endured because so many throughout our history have answered that call to service. Many paid the ultimate sacrifice. Families and communities across our great nation have felt the grief of losing a loved one. And many more who served have returned with serious injuries. The costs are high, but our flag remains flying because so many were willing to pay them.

The 36th Congressional District of Texas is home to over 50,000 veterans. So many of us who call Southeast Texas home grew up instilled with a deep love of country and allegiance to the flag. Even today, when our liberties sometime seem under attack, we have so much to be thankful for. We must never lose sight of the blessings of liberty our God has bestowed upon us. We are a blessed people to live in the greatest nation on Earth.

From WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan, so many among us have fought for the freedoms we cling to. Their bravery is only matched by their humility. Today is our day to recognize and thank them for the sacrifices they and their families have made. They represent the highest ideals of our great republic, and we must never let them feel unappreciated.

So on this Veterans Day, please take a moment to personally thank someone in your life who has served in the military. And let us remember the men and women who are currently serving to keep our flag flying and our people safe. 

May God bless our military and all those who have served.
 Recognizing the Greatest Generation
World War II created one of the greatest generations of men and women as the nation united and sacrificed together in order to defeat tyranny both in Europe and the Pacific. It is such an honor to meet and recognize veterans of the Second World War. A few weeks ago, I acknowledged the military service of 100 year old WWII veteran Bill Antone.
￼
God Bless the Texas Rangers
The Texas Rangers have been protecting and serving our great state for 195 years! These distinguished law enforcement officers were established in 1823 when Stephen F. Austin, known as the Father of Texas, employed ten men to protect several hundred newly settled families in Texas following the Mexican War of Independence. In just two short years, the Texas Rangers comprised of more than 300 men.
￼
This week, I had a chance to visit with Texas Ranger Joe Haralson (pictured above) from Spurger. He is currently the most senior ranger in the state of Texas!

Veterans Day Programs Across TX-36
 Deweyville
￼
Lanie Brown, Regional Director of Community Relations on my staff, had the pleasure of meeting Iraq War Veteran and Army Ranger Brandon Price while attending Deweyville High School's Veterans Day program where he was the keynote speaker. Brandon was injured in Fallujah in 2008 and was awarded a Purple Star and two Bronze Stars for his heroic actions.
Dayton
￼
For the past eight years, one of the largest Veterans Day programs in the district has been held in Dayton. This is such an awesome program, and I am glad I was able to send my thoughts and thanks through video! 
￼

 Mont Belvieu
 Barbers Hill High School hosted this years community-wide veterans program that was facilitated by Old River Baptist Church. Although I could not be in attendance this year, I am glad my staff was able to participate in the program.
￼
Anahuac
The City of Anahuac held their Veterans Day program at Fort Anahuac Park yesterday. The event was hosted by American Legion Post 104.
￼
 Did You Know?
 
￼
The Purple Heart medal is often referred to as the military's oldest medal. General George Washington created it in 1782 to recognize meritorious actions, but its importance soon faded. In 1932, General Douglas MacArthur led a movement to revive the award on Washington's 200th birthday, and he later received Purple Heart No. 1. 
￼
On August 15, 1944, Major General Robert T. Frederick received his eighth Purple Heart, which is believed to be the most any soldier has been awarded in a single conflict. General Frederick was a U.S. Army officer who fought in WWII and commanded the First Special Service Force, eventually called the Devil's Brigade. He also received two Distinguished Service Crosses, two Distinguished Service Medals, a Silver Star, two Legion of Merit Medals, and two Bronze Stars.

Dear Constituent,
In observation of Veterans Day, we honor the courageous men and women in uniform for their service. Nearly 60,000 veterans call Virginia's 8th Congressional District home. I am proud to represent a district with such a strong ethic of service.
This day is quite personal: My father fought in the Korean War and my father-in-law was in the Battle of the Bulge. I am deeply committed to caring for America’s veterans. During this Congress, I have supported several bills meant to improve veterans’ lives and the lives of their families. This includes the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, also known as the Forever GI bill, which improves and extends GI Bill benefits granted to veterans, their surviving spouses and dependents. This bill was signed into law. I was also an original cosponsor of the Voices for Veterans Act, which would expand the membership of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans to include veterans who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, and a cosponsor of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, which extends agent orange disability benefits and health care to veterans who served in territorial waters off the coast of Vietnam.
In addition, last year I launched the bipartisan Suicide Prevention Task Force to raise awareness of the rising numbers of suicides in the United States. Over 45,000 people die of suicide each year and veterans comprise approximately 20 percent of that horrific figure. We must change this trend. I also helped secure an increase in funding for an array of federal suicide prevention programs.
Protecting veterans once they come home is an essential duty. In 2014, a Senate report found that of the top 10 institutions receiving GI Bill dollars, eight were for-profit schools. That is why I strongly opposed the Trump administration’s rollbacks of Obama-era rules that protected veteran students from the predatory practices of certain for-profit universities.
Lastly, my district office has worked on and resolved over 400 veterans' cases since I was elected to office in 2015. I remain deeply committed to assisting all my constituents, and especially veterans. Please know that I will continue to work to support the nation’s veterans and will stand up against policies that eliminate veteran’s protections. On this Veterans day, please join me in honoring veterans and thanking them for their service. 
Yours,
￼

Dear Friend,  On Veterans Day and every day, we honor all veterans, those who have served in wars past and those who are still serving. It’s an opportunity to express our gratitude as we reflect on their service and sacrifices. 
I’ve had many important titles in my life. Son, husband, father and Congressman, but one title holds a special place in my heart – Lieutenant Commander, US Navy – a veteran.   President Ronald Reagan once said, ""We remember those who were called upon to give all a person can give, and we remember those who were prepared to make that sacrifice if it were demanded of them in the line of duty, though it never was. Most of all, we remember the devotion and gallantry with which all of them ennobled their nation as they became champions of a noble cause."" 
America just held a peaceful national election where every citizen had a voice in selecting new leaders. That process is possible thanks to the veterans who leave their families and go into battle to defend the ideals of self-governing we hold dear.  
It was an honor to serve in our military along-side brave men and women, and it’s an honor to represent our veterans and all Americans in Congress. Happy Veterans Day to those who have served in our armed forces.  If you or a veteran you know need assistance, please call my Sugar Land office at (281) 494-2690. My staff will be more than happy to help in any way possible.  I’m honored to represent you in Congress. For more information on current legislation, constituent services or to sign up for my E-newsletter, please visit my website, www.olson.house.gov.   Very respectfully, Pete Olson

Congressman Smith's E-news: November 11, 2018 
￼
I recently enjoyed meeting with representatives of the Aurora Cooperative to discuss trade, tax reform, and other ways we can grow the agricultural economy.
Saluting Our Veterans 
Veterans Day, which was originally known as Armistice Day, marks the anniversary of the end of World War I, which ended at the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918. 2018 represents its 100-year anniversary. In 1954, Congress expanded the holiday to honor not only the sacrifices of those who fought in World War I, but all of our veterans, and renamed it Veterans Day.  We sometimes confuse it with Memorial Day, which takes place in May, but the purpose of Memorial Day is to remember specifically those who lost their lives in service to our country. Given the sacrifices of so many brave men and women on our behalf, it is important that we do our best to honor and serve them, which is why I serve as co-chairman of the Rural Veterans Caucus in the House of Representatives.  We look for ways to support our veterans such as the VA Accountability Act, which was passed by Congress and signed into law last year. This landmark legislation provides the VA Secretary increased flexibility to remove VA employees for poor performance or misconduct, while also strengthening whistleblower protections. Creating a culture of accountability at the VA is the first step to bringing lasting reforms to the department. We need to rebuild veterans’ trust in the VA and make it clear we’re putting them first.  We also passed the HIRE Vets Act to incentivize companies to hire veterans. Those who put their lives on the line to defend our freedom should not struggle to find employment when they return home. With this bill, employers large and small will be recognized for their efforts to hire and retain veterans.   A third, the Forever GI Bill, eliminated the 15-year time limit for veterans to use their GI bill benefits and cut down on red tape. With the ability to attend college at any time in their lives, veterans will have greater opportunities for professional development. It also provides flexibility for veterans to make the best education choices for themselves and their families.  Additionally, my office participates in the Veterans History Project, whose purpose is to chronicle the stories of Nebraska veterans to be included in the Library of Congress for the education of future generations. If you’d like more information on this program, please let my office know so we can get you connected.   My grandfather was a U.S. Navy Seabee in World War II, and his service inspired me to serve my community. He was one of 325,000 Seabees recruited in World War II to build naval bases throughout the globe. Many of us call the United States the “land of the free and home of the brave,” but I prefer “land of the free because of the brave.” Be sure to thank a veteran for their sacrifice this week.   Mobile Offices with My Staff

Honoring All Who Served
 
 
It is only appropriate that our election falls near Veterans Day in the United States. For centuries, hundreds of thousands of men and and women in uniform have fought and defended our homeland. They fought and sacrificed to preserve and protect the freedoms we have today.  America's veterans have much to be proud of and we have much to be thankful for.   As a Marine veteran of the Persian Gulf War and a member of the Mississippi National Guard, I do not take lightly my responsibility to ensure our veterans receive the best service and appreciation. During the 115th Congress, we have passed significant legislation that works to improve the care and service our veterans receive.   My position on the House Appropriations Committee allows me opportunities to pass bills that upholds promises to support our veterans. In September, we passed a Department of Veterans Affairs funding bill that specifically benefits Mississippi's veterans by funding rural health initiatives and dedicates $64.3 million for the Armed Forces Retirement Home that is located in Gulfport. That legislation also funded the VA MISSION Act which gives veterans an alternative to the Veterans Choice program by consolidating confusing programs into one streamlined community care program.   While we recognize the service, dedication, and sacrifice tomorrow, we should remember to be thankful every day of the year. This year, I have had the privilege to travel all over south Mississippi and pay tribute to Mississippi veterans who served in the Vietnam War by presenting them with the book ""A Time to Honor.""  I am so appreciative of this opportunity to meet so many who have served and hear their service stories. 
￼
￼
￼

If you are a veteran, thank you for answering the call to serve in our military or if you know a veteran, make sure you take the time to simply say thank you. 
Today, and every day, we honor all who have served. 
￼


In your service,
￼
Steven

Happy Veterans Day

￼   
I want to wish a Happy Veterans Day to our nation's heroes, those who have served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Merchant Marines, Air Force, and Coast Guard. These fine men and women have given this great country the greatest sacrifice and they deserve our respect and honor. I will continue to work and do all I can as a public servant to ensure their needs are being met. 
Veterans Day is a special time of year, when our nation comes together in remembrance of the brave men and women who answered the call of service to our nation. Dating back its origins to the end of World War I, the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month forever marked the crossroads of history.
To the over 55,000 in Illinois’ 12th Congressional District and 22 million nationwide, I say thank you. Let us all take some time to thank our veterans this weekend and honor them. And when the day is over, let’s continue the fight to ensure they receive the care and support they deserve.
I hope you have a great week ahead, 
Mike

11/11/18 13:09,Unwavering support:,"￼ 
Lindsey – Today, we join together as Americans to celebrate Veterans Day. 

To all of Sacramento County’s veterans, I want to thank you for your service. Our veterans have made incredible sacrifices for our country, and we owe them nothing less than our unwavering support.

If you or someone you know is a veteran who needs help with backlogged benefits, health care, or other federal government issues – please know my office is here to serve you.

Please call us at (916) 635-0505 or visit bera.house.gov/helpforvets to learn more.

￼

As a doctor who has cared for veterans, I’ve seen their sacrifices firsthand. We must do a better job of ensuring they have access to the health care and support services they’ve earned. No one who has risked his or her life for our country should be unemployed, homeless, or lacking medical care.

That’s why I’ve directed my local office to help area veterans and service members however we can. We’ve now helped more than 2,600 veterans and service members and we’d be honored to help you too.

It’s an honor to serve you in Congress. If you have any questions or concerns, please always feel free to contact me.

Be well,
￼
Ami Bera, M.D.
Member of Congress

THE SCALISE CAPITOL REPORT
Honoring our Veterans this Veterans Day This year marks the 100th anniversary of Veterans Day – a day we recognize the service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform, as well as the 100th Anniversary of the WWI Armistice. In Louisiana, we honor the nearly 300,000 veterans that call our state home and we recognize the continued service of Louisianans in the military. Every day that we live freely and safely in this country, we owe that freedom to these brave men and women who answer the call to serve and protect our way of life. That is why it has been a priority of this Congress to ensure the highest quality of care for our veterans as well as our full support for those currently serving.  One of our most important achievements this Congress was to enact comprehensive reforms with the VA MISSION Act. This law modernizes the Veterans Health Administration by combining the best parts of the VA and the private sector so that veterans have greater access to quality health care without long wait times. It also requires a review of VA infrastructure, so that work can begin to update our veterans’ care facilities for the 21st century. Finally, this bill improves the family caregiver program to empower caregivers, and improve the support offered by the VA to these family members.  Also of note, the Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System (SLVHCS) is continuing to improve on the services they provide our veterans. This past year the New Orleans VA Medical Center expanded services by offering 24/7 operations in the Emergency Department and an expanded cardiac rehabilitation program. They also received critical 3-year accreditations for new and existing programs including the Compensated Work Therapy Program for clinical vocational rehabilitation and the Homeless Program. Further, through the use of telehealth technology, the SLVHCS has partnered with regional facilities to better deliver specialized virtual care so that veterans don’t have to travel long distances to get treated. These are all important improvements, and I’m committed to continuing to work with our local veterans’ health care providers to further improve services and care to the men and women who have sacrificed so much to ensure our freedoms and our way of life.   This country and our state especially have a proud history of dedicated military service. Today, I am grateful to honor these men and women who, from the founding of this country till this day, dutifully answer the call to preserve our freedoms at great risk to themselves.  It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more information please visit my website, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook pages.
 God Bless,
￼

A Week of Change
Dear Friend:

I appreciate you taking the time to read this brief update. It remains an honor for me to serve as your representative in the U.S. House of Representatives.

No doubt, as you all know, this was a very eventful week both for the future of the 6th Congressional District and for me personally. On Tuesday, the result of the election was not the one I had hoped for. Now my time as your Representative will end at the close of 2018. I want to emphasize how much I have appreciated your confidence in me and the opportunity you provided me over the past ten years to serve as your member of Congress. I pledge that I will continue to do my very best to represent you all the way up to my very last day in office. I will also ensure that my office cooperates fully with your U.S. Representative-elect Jason Crow so that the transition has as little impact on you as possible.

As I continue to work for you through the end of my last term in office, this week involved far more than just the election. In fact, today is Veterans Day and I participated in various events related to recognizing and honoring our veterans and active service members. These activities included:
	•	Attended the 24th Annual Aurora Veteran’s Salute at the Wings over the Rockies,
	•	Participated in a local event in Denver to commemorate the 243rd Birthday of the U.S. Marine Corps,
	•	Spoke on Saturday at the Veterans Day Remembrance Ceremony at the Colorado State Capitol, and
	•	Speaking on Monday in Littleton at the Re-dedication of the Operations Red Wings Monument.
￼

In other activities around the district, on Thursday I had the honor of presenting the Comitis Crisis Center with a Congressional Record in recognition of all it has done in the Denver Metro Area to combat homelessness. The Comitis Crisis Center does amazing things for those in our community who are most in need, including providing 138,000 meals, assembling 11,000 hygiene kits, and providing 50,000 overnight beds. I have wanted to recognize the Comitis Crisis Center for all it does for quite a while and since this week is National Homelessness and Hunger Awareness Week, it was the perfect time to do so. Mayor Bob LeGare of Aurora joined me for this presentation at the Aurora Municipal Center.

￼

Next week, I will return to Washington D.C. as Congress begins its “lame duck” session to finish out the business of the 115th Congress. Key items I expect us to address include, reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, voting on the floor on the final conference report on the Agriculture Bill (which includes food stamps), a Tax Extenders bill, and most importantly, finishing up the annual appropriations process. To date, we have approved appropriations bills that cover 75% of the federal government’s discretionary funding, but the balance is presently on a continuing resolution through December 7th. The key remaining appropriations bill is for the funding of the Department of Homeland Security. Getting this bill approved is of particular importance to me because H.R. 392, the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2017, is included in it. This bill would update and revise, in important ways, the H1-B visa program under which highly skilled and educated foreign workers are authorized to come and work in the United States, filling positions companies cannot find U.S. citizens to fill. The shortage of high skilled workers is particularly acute here in Colorado and important to maintaining the growth of our state’s economy, as well as our nation’s economic growth.

Finally, I invite you to stay in contact with me via my website, facebook or twitter account. See you around the district!

Sincerely, 
￼

Dear Friend,
Today, November 11, 2018, is Veterans Day, a day that offers us the chance to show our gratitude to those who have bravely served our country in the military.  Their service in defending our country and protecting our rights provides all of us the wonderful opportunities that come from being Americans.   This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Armistice that ended World War I.  The war ended on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918.  The centennial gives us the chance to reflect on the sacrifice and also the aftermath of the most destructive war the world had seen so far. 
In September 1917, the ranks of the 359th Infantry Regiment was organized, along with the 90th Division, and filled with Texans and Oklahomans, many of which were from our area.  One of those soldiers filling the ranks was Sergeant George Splawn.
Sergeant Splawn was from the small area of Greenwood, Texas, in Wise County.  Before his 23rd birthday, he registered for conscription and ended up with the 90th Division of the United States Army.  They deployed to France in June of 1918.  The 90th Division participated in the successful Battle of Saint-Mihiel.  
Like many warfighters in the “Great War,” some of his records were lost once he landed overseas.  Sergeant Splawn died of disease in Paris after the Armistice ended the fighting.  This year, I had the honor of visiting Sergeant Splawn’s grave to lay a wreath and show my gratitude for his service to our country.
Our military men and women risk their lives for our country, and many of those people are our friends, family, and neighbors.  Today is a day to remember the wars of our nation’s past and to thank those who fought to keep us safe from adversaries across the world.  It is a day to remember those who fought for our country to give us the freedoms we enjoy.  And today is a day to remember that we must continue to prepare our veterans for life after war and to support them when they return home.
Our veterans have provided an invaluable service to our country, and our country owes them the best in return.  As friends, family, and neighbors we are tasked with listening to their needs and stories and learning from the past, making sure their service and sacrifice is not wasted.  As you know, after World War I America withdrew from Europe, refused to join the League of Nations, and a little more than 20 years later was again drawn into a world war that was even bigger and more destructive.  After that, we stayed engaged, and the world has benefitted from America's leadership and the continued service and sacrifice from more recent veterans. 
Sally and I thank our veterans and our servicemembers, not only today, but every day.  Thank you and your families for your sacrifices and for making our American way of life possible.
Sincerely,
￼

Southwest Washington veterans: Thank you for your service
 
One of the greatest privileges I have as Southwest Washington's Representative is to assist veterans all over this region who have answered the call to serve our nation in some of the greatest moments of peril and need.

To all those who have worn the uniform and selflessly sacrificed for our freedom, I humbly and gratefully say ""Thank you for your service!""
Working to give our veterans 
the care they have earned
￼
You can learn so much from those who have served on the front lines, like these two WWII vets I had the 
honor of meeting at a fishing event for veterans earlier this year in Vancouver. 

In Congress, we provided the VA with the largest funding in history -- $86.5 billion. The majority of this goes to funding VA medical care, including mental health services, suicide prevention outreach, opioid abuse prevention, and rural veterans' health initiatives.


It's my honor to serve our nation's heroes in Congress
￼
Recently, Congress approved the largest pay raise in almost a decade for our military service members -- a much-needed boost for our men and women in uniform to be able to better care for their families.

Part of my job is also to help individuals who are encountering problems with federal agencies -- like the VA. My knowledgeable staff and I will help individuals receive military ID cards, claim benefits they have earned and deserve, and clear up issues that stand in the way of getting VA medical treatment. 

Are you a veteran living in Southwest Washington who needs help with the VA? 

While we can't guarantee an outcome, we will do our best to assist you. Please contact my office at jhb.house.gov or 360-695-6292.

Dear Friend,   Today, all across America, we pause to celebrate Veterans Day. On this day, we are reminded of the sacrifice and service of all those who have served our country and their families. We particularly remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our beloved nation.  We owe our veterans and their families an enormous debt of gratitude. These are men and women who left their loved ones to serve our country and protect our freedoms. They truly represent our country’s best ideals of service and sacrifice.   As you know, Rhode Island is home to more than 71,000 brave veterans who have served in our Armed Forces. This Veterans Day, please join me in thanking all these heroes who have worn the uniform of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. And let us continue our shared work to honor them with the care and services they have earned, and by living lives worthy of their sacrifice.   Warm Regards, ￼  David Cicilline Member of Congress

Friends,
Today, on Veterans Day, we honor our veterans for their patriotism, love of country, and willingness to serve and sacrifice for the common good. To those who have served, we owe you a debt of gratitude for your selfless service in protecting our great nation. 
Our men and women in uniform, past and present, are strong. They are caring. They are our protectors and they are our nation's real heroes.
My dad was a Purple Heart recipient who served in WWII. He showed me first-hand the perseverance, altruism, and resourcefulness that many veterans possess. 
￼
We are forever thankful to our veterans for their service. I believe we have a moral obligation to care for our veterans who are in need of assistance - many of whom have faced devastating injuries because they were willing to sacrifice themselves for safety and security of their fellow soldiers and the American people. 
The 115th Congress made a plan to ensure service members receive the care they have earned by modernizing the institutions that serve them, improving the military retirement and health care systems, strengthening mental health research, and enhancing transparency and accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This includes making sure service members, veterans, and their families receive quality care and services in a timely, convenient, and quality manner. 
Here are some of the 115th Congress's accomplishments to honor our veterans: 
	•	Ensuring Veterans Have Access to Timely, Quality Care  The VA Mission Act, signed into law on June 6, 2018, gives our veterans the choice to receive the medical care they have earned from the doctors they want, where they want, and in a timelier manner. This legislation streamlines the VA's duplicative community care program into one cohesive program, creates a non-partisan process for reviewing the VA's assets to ensure veterans can access the care they have earned, expands the VA's Post 9/11 Caregiver Program to all eras, and extends the Veterans Choice Program. 
	•	Bringing Accountability to the Department of Veterans Affairs  The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, signed into law last year, created a streamlined and efficient process to remove, demote, or suspend any VA employee for poor performance or misconduct. The law ensures due process with a clear, timely process for appealing disciplinary actions; expands protections for whistleblowers; and bars VA from removing an employee who has an open whistleblower complaint/case with the Office of Special Counsel.   
	•	Expanding and Preserving GI Bill Benefits  I was proud to support the Harry G. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act, which was also signed into law last year. The legislation removes time restrictions to use the GI Bill, enabling future recipients to use their GI Bill benefits their entire lives, earning the bill the nickname, ""The Forever GI Bill."" The Forever GI Bill also increases GI Bill funding for Reservists and Guardsmen, surviving spouses, and dependents. It also provides 100% eligibility to Post-9/11 Purple Heart Recipients.   
	•	Modernizing the Appeals Process for Disability Claims   Last August, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act was signed into law, in response to VA data that showed nearly half a million veterans were still waiting for a decision from VA on their disability claims appeals. This bill creates compartmentalized avenues for veterans' appeals to be processed in a more timely manner. 
Our veterans and their families have given so much to this country, risking their lives on behalf of our freedom. Taking care of them should be a priority and I was proud to support the above measures. To all our veterans, thank you again for your service and Happy Veterans Day!
Dave

November 11, 2018
Dear Friend,  
I am humbled you have given me the privilege to represent you in the United States Congress for another two years.  Doing so is the greatest professional honor of my life.  You have my commitment that I will continue to serve you to the best of my ability while tackling the serious issues facing our nation.  There has been a great deal of speculation about the gridlock that may occur in Congress with the majority parties shifting in the House of Representatives.  I pledge to you that I will continue my bipartisan work to accomplish the things that are most important to you and to our community.   I will continue build upon recent efforts to:  strengthen school safety, reform our mental health and substance abuse system, preserve Medicare and Social Security, lower the price of prescription drugs, ensure national security, foster economic growth and, of course, support our nation’s heroes.  
In honor of Veterans Day and the fact that  this year we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day, this week’s e-newsletter is a special edition dedicated to my work on behalf of Veterans.   
￼ 
It is often said that “A hero is someone who dedicates his or her life to something bigger than oneself.” As we celebrate Veterans Day today, we are mindful that there is no greater example of heroism than those among us, both past and present, who have bravely answered the call to serve our nation.   We understand that the price of the freedom is not free, but rather is paid by the men and women who have and continue to defend our country and the sacred ideals we cherish. Some of these heroes never return and others live with wounds, both visible and invisible, that they carry with them throughout their lives.  Their families also pay a high price so that all of us may enjoy the blanket of security that is too often taken for granted.  It is not enough to recognize their service one day out of the year, but rather we must continuously seek ways to honor their service and sacrifice.
President Washington once insightfully noted that “The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve shall be directly proportional to how they perceive that Veterans of earlier wars are treated and appreciated by their nation.”  As Vice-Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee in the House of Representatives, I have made it my primary mission to ensure that our Veterans understand the full weight of our collective gratitude—working to make sure they receive the best possible care and all of the benefits they have earned through dutiful service to our nation.  
While we have made progress in recent years, there is still much work to be done.  I am proud of the many initiatives I have spearheaded in Congress to address some of the problems that have been affecting our Veterans.   
What We’ve Accomplished 
Most notably, I was very concerned about the lack of diversity of treatments available to Veterans suffering with post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injuries.  
One size does not fit all, especially when it comes to an issue as sensitive as the mental health needs of our Veterans, which is why I sponsored the PROMISE and the COVER Acts, which were signed into law in 2016 and are now being implemented.  
These bills require the VA to use best practices when prescribing opioids and pave the way for the VA to provide alternative and complimentary treatments, such as service dog therapy, hyberbaric oxygen treatment, Accelerated Resolution therapy and other evidenced based practices that have proven effective.  
￼ 
 The Veterans Affairs Committee has worked in a bipartisan manner to address many issues within the Veteran community.  More than 30 bills designed to improve the lives of Veterans have been signed into law since January of 2017.   

Improving access to care and benefits within a timely manner has been our priority.  Our work to finally rectify the injustice that kept Blue Water Navy Veterans from accessing care and benefits due to their Agent Orange exposure is something that will make a tangible difference in the lives of many Veterans.  The Senate needs to take immediate action, as these Veterans cannot afford to wait any longer. 
￼  
With half a million Veterans waiting on a VA decision about their disability claims as of 2017, modernizing the appeals process for disability claims was extremely important.  It has been a little over a year since this critical legislation was signed into law.   I believe we still have more work to do in this area because in my opinion Veterans are still waiting way too long, however, this law is a huge step in the right direction.  
￼ 
The MISSION Act is another important victory for Veterans who were struggling to navigate the VA CHOICE and community care programs.  This new law ensures Veterans receive timely and convenient access to care, whether through the VA or a community provider- a decision which will be made by the Veteran and his or her doctor.  
Improving educational benefits for Veterans has been another important theme for our Committee.  Through the Forever GI Bill, we expanded educational benefits and removed the time restriction for use.  My SITREP bill, which was also recently signed into law, will also ensure Veterans are not penalized when a bureaucratic system results in delays of processing the GI payment.  
￼ 
It is important to note that in recent years, Congress has provided substantial increases in VA funding-- more than a 70% increase since 2009.  However, we have seen that more money doesn’t always translate into better results, which is why we remain committed to providing ongoing oversight and accountability.  The VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which was signed into law last year, helps achieve this goal by streamlining the process of firing or disciplining senior VA employees while expanding protections for employees who report wrong doing. 
With respect to ending Veteran homelessness, we are making significant strides, especially with the HUD VASH voucher program and the local efforts of St. Vincent De Paul, which does an outstanding job throughout the Tampa Bay area of linking homeless and at-risk for homelessness Veterans with resources.  We recently provided over $2 million to augment the work of this agency and others like it within Tampa Bay.  After all, even one Veteran being homeless, given what they have sacrificed for our country, is completely unacceptable. We must continue to eradicate homelessness among the Veteran community.  
￼ 
One additional measure we worked on which is very near and dear to my heart is the Transition Improvement Act.  It was signed into law earlier this year.  We spend a minimum of 6 months preparing service personnel for their military assignments and a maximum of one week preparing them for successful reintegration into civilian society.  Our new law changes that because we owe these men and women more support. Local Veterans in our community had the opportunity to travel to DC and help make important changes to this bill before it became law.  
￼ 
This year’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) was also recently signed into law. It reflects a real win not only for active duty military personnel and Veterans, but for all Americans who can have great confidence that this legislation will make our nation more safe. It supports necessary increases in topline funding to support our troops and readiness recovery in accordance with the full request by Secretary Mattis. It allocates funding to provide the largest pay raise for our troops in 9 years, and it advances innovative technologies that will reform the way our nation will fight and win wars.
￼ 
I am proud that the NDAA included language I authored which extends the travel benefit of riding on military aircraft whenever there is space available-something which is currently enjoyed by active duty and military retirees to those Veterans who are 100% disabled.
More Work to Be Done 
We will not rest until Veterans have access to high quality care and the benefits they have earned.    
I am focused on ensuring Veterans who were exposed to toxic burn pits during their service in the middle east, and as a result are suffering illness and disease have access to medical care and disability benefits the need.  As depicted in this recent article, toxic burn pit exposure is the agent orange of era –and we have to learn lessons from the mistakes that were made and the countless Veterans that suffered and died while the government took almost three decades to do right by our heroes. We can’t let that happen again, which is why I’ve filed legislation to address this issue immediately.  
Additionally, I have heard countless heartbreaking stories from Veterans who are in pain and suffering with dental pain because they do not have access to oral healthcare. Many people do not realize that very few Veterans receiving healthcare through the VA qualify for dental care.  
In response, I filed the VET CARE bill, to expand Veterans’ access to dental care, while saving the VA money. Oral health is an important part of overall wellness and studies show that preventative dental treatment of patients with certain chronic illnesses provides long-term savings in health care costs for treating the medical illness.  I hope to demonstrate those potential savings in a pilot project that can be replicated for all Veterans in the years to come. 
President Kennedy once said that, “As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.” Today, as we thank all Veterans for their service, I renew my pledge to continue serving as the voice of the Veteran community in Washington and to always ensure that my actions and record of service reflects my heartfelt gratitude for their service.

Carper's Connection
November 11, 2018
Dear Friend,
Having served 23 years in the U.S. Navy and Naval Reserves, I understand the sacrifices that the brave men and women of our military have made to defend our country’s freedoms. We owe it to our veterans and their families to ensure they have access to high-quality health care, a place to call home, the opportunity to obtain an education and the skills they need to lead a successful life as a civilian.
Today, The News Journal featured a piece I wrote on our obligations to our veterans who have sacrificed so much in service to our country. I hope you’ll take a moment to read my Veterans Day message, and join me in honoring our fallen soldiers and saying “Thank You” to all of our veterans in Delaware and around our great country. 
“Let’s make good on our promises to veterans”
On Veterans Day, we honor all of America’s veterans who have served, or are currently serving, our country with courage and commitment. Those who have served in times of peace and in times of war. Those who have protected and made real the principles enshrined in our Constitution. 
￼
We didn’t always have a day dedicated to our men and women in uniform. While World War I officially ended in June 1919 with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, fighting had ceased months earlier when an armistice went into effect on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month – November 11, 1918. One year later, on November 11, 1919, President Woodrow Wilson commemorated the very first Armistice Day.
In 1954, Congress replaced “Armistice” with “Veterans” to better ensure that all future generations of veterans would feel the gratitude of their country and its citizens.  
My first Veterans Day in Delaware was November 11, 1973, shortly after I had completed nearly five years of active duty as the Vietnam War was beginning to wind down. That fall, with the help of the GI Bill, I enrolled in the University of Delaware’s MBA program.
Along with other Vietnam veterans who were furthering their education, I received a $250 monthly benefit along with some dental benefits at the state’s only VA medical facility in Elsmere.
That medical facility was a World War II relic of a hospital then with 16-bed wards, almost no care for female veterans, poor morale and an equally poor reputation for providing health care. Veterans in Kent and Sussex counties had to find a way to get Elsmere to receive care from the VA and often had to travel all the way to Philadelphia to find it.
Additionally, there were no VA Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC’s) in Delaware, no veterans cemeteries and no veterans home.
Just as the Constitution would, in the end, largely be words on a piece of paper without the generations of Americans who have risked, and in many cases given, their lives to protect our freedoms, so too would Veterans Day be an empty gesture if we are not making good on the promises made to our veterans.
Thankfully, since 1973, we have continued to make significant improvements that help demonstrate our appreciation for Delaware veterans every day of the year. 
Encouraged by our congressional delegation, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) opened two state-of-the-art CBOC’s a decade ago, one in Georgetown and the second in Dover. The Georgetown CBOC doubled in size and staff last year. Planning for similarly expanding the CBOC in Dover has begun, and ground will be broken next year. 
Halfway between Dover and Georgetown, in the town of Milford, is the Delaware Veterans Home, where 150 elderly and/or disabled veterans have resided since it opened a decade ago. Beginning this fall, dental care will become available there for the Veterans Home’s residents and for non-residents alike. 
Two magnificent veterans cemeteries opened in Delaware some time ago, one near Glasgow in 1989 and the other just outside of Georgetown in 1999, to provide a final resting place for thousands of our veterans and their eligible spouses. 
And, under a law initially passed by Congress in 2014, and improved in 2018, health care is now more accessible for veterans outside of the VA system when the care that is needed is not available within that system in a timely way.
The GI Bill has also undergone a major transformation and expansion. Today, it looks little like the one awaiting those of us who served in the Vietnam or Persian Gulf Wars.
Today’s GI Bill enables veterans to attend colleges like the University of Delaware, Delaware State University, Delaware Technical Community College and Wilmington University tuition-free, while also receiving a $2,000-a-month housing allowance for as long as 36 months. If eligible GI’s don’t use their benefit, their spouses or children may use it. 
The Preamble of our Constitution, first ratified by Delaware in Dover 231 years ago, does not promise to form “a perfect Union.” Rather, it pledges to form “a more perfect union.” Our Founding Fathers wisely anticipated that future generations would improve on their work, and they were right.  
As I reflect on more than four decades of Veterans Days in the First State, I’m reminded of the remarkable progress that can be made when we work together to care for those who have borne the battle. Our work is not yet finished, but we’ve come a long way.
This Veterans Day, we once again honor our nation’s veterans and their families for their sacrifice. I am also renewing my commitment to continue improving the quality of services and benefits for Delaware veterans and their families so that when we say, “Happy Veterans Day” to a veteran, he or she will know we really mean it. 
Happy Veterans Day to all!

Fighting for our Joint Base
Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst is  vital to our country’s national security  and to New Jersey’s economy 
￼ 
I recently visited to discuss the future of our base. I thanked service members during lunch, toured installations with commanders and received an update about the preparations for the arrival of the new KC-46 fleet. 
  
Friend,  
Thank you never seems like enough.  
We wouldn’t be here without the brave Americans who answer the call to protect us day in and day out. And we must show our thanks to our service members not just on days like Veteran’s Day, but in the services we provide for them every day.
I’ll always fight for veterans' access to healthcare, education and employment opportunities. 
I participate in a town hall meeting around South Jersey regularly - and, every time, I honor a hometown hero. Please take a look at some of the outstanding public servants I had the pleasure of honoring this year...
  
Gloucester City Veteran and Community Leader 
Gloucester City native Ed Walens served in the US Airforce since 1952.  During the Korean War, he worked on refueling plans and was then on a Bomber crew in Okinawa.  After the Airforce, Walens served in the NJ Army National Guard for 14 years then serving as a volunteer firefighter.  He has helped put together the historical museum that honors every man and woman from Gloucester County that served our country.

Honoring our Veterans

Dear Neighbor,

Veterans Day offers a chance for us to give thanks to the dedicated men and women who have served our country in uniform, as well as their families who sacrifice so much to support them. Their courage and selflessness is unmatched, and we must never forget the great debt we owe our veterans. 

Our district is home to more than 80,000 veterans and my door is always open to assist these heroes. We have helped veterans obtain Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, assisted bereaved families in cutting through red tape to schedule burials of fallen servicemembers at Arlington Cemetery, resolved VA claim problems, and secured medals and honors that our veterans rightfully earned but never received.

My engagement with veterans throughout our community shapes my legislative priorities on Capitol Hill. I am proud that my bill, the Families of Fallen Servicemembers First Act, which authorizes the payment of military death gratuities in the event of a government shutdown, was enacted through the 2019 Department of Defense Appropriations bill. During the previous government shutdowns, grieving families were denied these vital payments. Thanks to the Families of Fallen Servicemembers Act, this will never happen again. 

I take great pride in representing the brave men and women of the United States military, as well as their families, and believe there is no greater responsibility in Congress than to make sure those who put on the uniform are taken care of, both during and after active duty service. 
If you know someone who would benefit from our assistance, please encourage them to contact my district offices:

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CLXXXVII

Monday, November 5, 2018:  I’m excited to begin my week by visiting Ms. Carvey’s first grade classes at Martha Rawls Smith Elementary School in Jesup in Wayne County where I have the opportunity to read to this attentive group of students.  The book chosen for me to read, The Very Stuffed Turkey, is most appropriate for this time of year as it is the story of a turkey who visits five of his barnyard friends who are hosting Thanksgiving dinners and, not wanting to disappoint anyone, eats at each dinner until he almost bursts.  We can all look forward to a similar experience soon!  Afterwards, I head to Brunswick in Glynn County where I meet with Larry Herrington, owner of A Bit of Tack Feed Store, a small business providing feed and supplies for horses.  Like many small business owners, Larry has more than one specialty as he also builds all types of trailers including those that he sells hot dogs out of that he claims are “the best anywhere.” 
￼
Rep. Carter touring A Bit of Tack Feed Store
Next, I head back up to Savannah and later in the afternoon attend the Investiture Ceremony for U. S. Magistrate Judge for the Southern District Benjamin Cheesbro.  Afterwards, I head to our Savannah district office where I meet with representatives from the National Apartment Association before heading to Southside Savannah for the open house celebration of Heads-Up Guidance Services (HUGS).  
￼
Rep. Carter at the Heads-Up Guidance Services open house
HUGS is a non-profit organization run by volunteers and funded by community donations that provides mental health counseling and addiction recovery services at an affordable price.  
Tuesday, November 6, 2018:  Today is Election Day!  Like early voting, turnout is extremely heavy for a mid-term election and I experience that myself as I stand in line for 3½ hours at my precinct in Pooler before I cast my ballot.  
Wednesday, November 7, 2018:  After a very late night waiting for voting results to come in, I’m back at it bright and early this morning as I’m at the Voter Registration Office in Savannah for a live interview with WTOC TV to comment on yesterday’s elections.  A link to the interview can be found here.  Afterwards, I have a radio interview with my friends Bill Edwards and Laura Anderson on WTKS in Savannah to talk about yesterday’s elections and later head to Black Creek in Bryan County for the groundbreaking ceremony of yet another business in this booming area.  AGCO Corporation is the company that builds Massey Ferguson tractors and will be opening an assembly center in the new 75,000 square foot facility that they are constructing here.  This $8 million project will employ 31 people and is another example of the results that great teamwork between the Development Authority of Bryan County and state and local leaders and agencies has produced.  
￼
Rep. Carter at the AGCO groundbreaking
Afterwards, I head to Savannah for the Veterans Day Salute and Military Luncheon sponsored by the Savannah Area Chamber’s Military Affairs Council where the keynote speaker is Brigadier General Jennifer Buckner, Commander, U.S. Army Cyber Command.  This great event is a prelude to the many Veterans Day celebrations that will be taking place next week.  Next, I head to the Landings on Skidaway Island for their annual roundtable where they invite county, state and federal representatives for an update on the area.  Afterwards, I head to Jesup in Wayne County where I have the opportunity to meet with the 10-0 Wayne County Yellow Jackets football team.  Each Wednesday night during football season supporters of the team, led by Jesup Mayor David Earl Keith, provide the players with dinner and have a special guest address the team. 
￼
Rep. Carter speaking with the Wayne County football team
I am truly honored to be the special guest this week and have the opportunity to address this fine group of young men that our community is so proud of.  
Thursday, November 8, 2018:  Each year our office participates in the Congressional App Challenge for middle school and high school students throughout the First District, encouraging them to learn to code and pursue careers in computer science.  Today I’m at Richmond Hill Middle School in Bryan County to surprise this year’s winners, Joanna and Kayden, who developed the app InstaList, and their teacher, Ms. Thompson, to inform them of their selection.  With balloons, certificates and cameras to record the event in hand, I successfully surprise the winners and inform them of their prizes including a trip to Washington, D.C. for a #HouseofCode Capitol Hill Reception.  Afterwards, I head to Nahunta in Brantley County where I meet with representatives with Archer Forest Products and local officials to be updated on the progress of their wood pellet plant.
￼
Rep. Carter touring Archer Forest Products
 A few months ago, I participated in the groundbreaking of the renovation of the plant and am back today to see the tremendous progress they have made.  Afterwards, I join the group of local officials for a visit to the site of a planned Burger King restaurant in this growing area before heading to Statenville in Echols County for their annual Farm Bureau meeting. 
￼
Rep. Carter speaking at the Echols County Farm Bureau dinner
Echols County is a very rural area east of Valdosta and on the Florida state line and is one of only a few counties in the State of Georgia with no incorporated communities.   The town of Statenville was named for James Watson Staten but was incorrectly registered as Statesville in 1859 and later changed to Statenville in 1965.  While Echols County may only have a population slightly over 4,000, they are without question the nicest 4,000 people anywhere.

November 11, 2018
Dear Friend,
One hundred years ago, on November 11, 1918, soldiers on both sides along the Western Front laid down their arms, ending World War I. Since then, we have taken time to reflect on the service of the men and women who have served the United States in uniform. 
I am immensely proud of New Mexico's rich history of defending our nation-from the Navajo Code Talkers and Bataan Death Marchers to Vietnam GIs and Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. That legacy carries forward to today through the service of the men and women stationed at our military installations around the globe. We must be unwavering in our commitment to our servicemembers and their families. They deserve not just words of gratitude, but also the best care, benefits, and opportunities our nation can provide when they come home. 
My office has helped hundreds of veterans across New Mexico. Whether you or a family member is having trouble filing a claim, receiving benefits, accessing health benefits or military records, replacing medals, or other veterans issues, my office is here to help. Please contact my office by calling (505) 346-6601 or visit the Veterans Resources Center on my website.
Today and every day, I join communities across New Mexico in honoring our veterans for their service, and their courage and devotion to defend the American principles we all hold dear. 
Sincerely,
￼

Dear Friend, 
It is difficult to even imagine what the United States would be without the service and sacrifice of America’s veterans. We owe our freedom, our security and our way of life to them and it is a debt that can never be fully repaid, but that must always be remembered. 
Veterans Day is one of the most important holidays on the calendar and is an important time for us to reflect on the valor, heroism and dedication of our men and women in uniform. It’s a time for all of us to express our gratitude. It’s a time to reaffirm our commitment to veterans and their families. 
The Sixth District is home to a large veterans community and I have made veterans’ issues one of my top priorities in Congress. Earlier this fall, I was extremely proud to see that our efforts to increase federal support for Fisher House were successful. Fisher House is a nonprofit that provides free temporary lodging near hospitals so military and veteran families can be close to their loved ones while they seek medical treatment. Founded in 1990, Fisher House has served over 335,000 families, provided over eight million days of lodging and saved military families more than $407 million in out-of-pocket expenses. On any given night, up to one thousand families are staying in one of the 76 Fisher Houses across the country.
The appropriations bill signed into law in September included my amendment to double federal funding for Fisher House from $5 million to $10 million. This will allow Fisher House to expand their operations, build more facilities and serve more military families. For six straight years I introduced my appropriations amendment to increase their funding, and finally, this Congress, it made it all the way through the long legislative process in both the House and Senate and to the President’s desk where it was signed. 
Earlier this year, legislation I authored to protect veterans’ credit scores was also signed into law. My office is also finalizing new legislation to make sure that veterans are not financially punished due to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) processing errors. Overall, there is a lot more work to be done to make sure that America’s veterans receive the benefits they’ve earned, have prompt access to high-quality medical care and can thrive when their service is completed. I hope that the next Congress focuses on these issues. 
As you may know, I am leaving Congress at the end of this current legislative session and my offices will be closing. Should you or someone you know need help working with the VA or any other federal agency, please contact Senator Cardin or Senator Van Hollen’s offices – they would be happy to help. 
Sincerely, 
John

We had an excellent discussion at the School Safety Summit.  I look forward to taking what we discussed back with me to Washington.
￼
Over fifty students, teachers, parents, school officials, and law enforcement officials participated in my office's School Safety Summit
￼
As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, school safety is a priority of mine.  My office recently hosted out third School Safety Summit.

Veterans Day
Today is Veterans Day.  We honor our veterans for their service and the freedoms that they fought for.  The men and women in our armed services are at the front lines of defending freedom.
On November 11, 1918 at 11:00 am the proclamation was signed signaling the end of World War One.  Which is why President Wilson and the US Congress choose November 11 to honor our veterans.  This year marks the one hundredth anniversary of the end of World War One.  The United States World War One Centennial Commission has collected the stories of American service during World War One, including Hoosiers stories.  Though the veterans of that war belong to the ages now, their service protected the liberties we have today.
￼
While visiting Frankfort I saw a copy of the Frankfort Morning News declaring the end of fighting in WWI.
If we are to truly honor our veterans, we must protect the liberties that they fought for.  These liberties are enshrined in our Constitution and established from the values found in the Declaration of Independence.  Our veterans fought and sacrificed to protect our nation and as long as we continue to preserve and protect our American Exceptionalism, those sacrifices were not made in vain.  Keeping our Republic is how we honor our veterans and their service.
School Safety Summit
My office hosted our third School Safety Summit on Thursday.  The event brought together law enforcement officials, superintendents, principals, vice principals, teachers, and students.  Senator John Crane moderated the event and we had three great speakers, Noblesville Police Chief Kevin Jowitt who lead the response to the shooting at Noblesville West Middle School earlier this year, Richard Hogue of ISP who oversees their active shooter response program, and Jason Brames who is part of the Hendricks County School Safety Commission.  A special thanks to every participant for attending and contributing.
￼
Thanks to all attendees of the School Safety Summit for your contributions! Beth Walker is a competitive shooter and a student, who offers a unique persepctive. Senator John Crane moderated the event.
As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, school safety is an absolute priority of mine.  Follow-up reports from the first two events are available on my website.  Bringing together experts and the education community to have honest and open discussions, away from sensationalism and focused on the facts, was extremely productive.  I look forward to taking what we learned from our discussion back with me to Washington.
Trump Stands Up For Life
On Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) made two big announcements to protect the unborn.  I have a strong record of standing up for life and will do so whenever I can.  
The administration announced a final rule that would protect the rights of conscience for both religious and moral objectors from the Obama-era abortifacient drug mandate.  Those who object to abortion should not be expected to pay for them.
The administration also announced a new rule to enforce the law on Obamacare's abortion coverage.  The rule directs insurers selling Obamacare plans that cover abortion to collect a separate payment for enrollees that want abortion coverage.  The Obama Administration had violated the statute and allowed these payments to be collected together.  Now Americans will be able to more easily know if the plans they are considering will cover abortion and how much it costs.
These new measures are important victories for life.

Dear Neighbor,

This Veterans Day weekend, we wanted to take a moment to highlight the service of Western New York veterans and the work being done for those who have sacrificed so much for our country. In 2018 we've had the honor to present veterans with over 70 medals, protect veteran services, preserve military history, help the next generation of military leaders and more. Today and every day we say thank you by doing everything we can to care for, remember and pay tribute to those who served.

Remembering the Sacrifices Made 
At the Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park we broke ground on the African American Veterans Monument, the first of its kind in the nation to pay tribute to the contributions of African American veterans in defense of our country in each conflict throughout its history.  In July, I highlighted the project and work of the organizing committee in remarks on the House floor.
￼

On October 30th, the Buffalo Naval Park welcomed the Captain and crew of the USS Buffalo Los Angeles Class attack submarine. The third ship named for the City of Buffalo, it was decommissioned after 35 years of service, and some of its components will be featured at the Naval Park at Canalside.

Paying Tribute to Those Who Served
We've been joined by local leaders and veteran organizations to present veterans and their families with medals earned during service. One of those was the family of Private Walter Rydzewski, who earned the Purple Heart and other medals 100 years ago, during World War I.  We also honored Vietnam War Navy veteran James Williams alongside members of the Jesse Clipper Post, and gave Dermot Golden, who traveled to Buffalo from Ireland, the Purple Heart his Great Uncle Private James Tymon was owed for laying down his life while serving in the Army during World War I.

An Overdue Thank You and Welcome Home to our Vietnam Veterans
During a gathering of Western New York Military Order of the Purple Heart members, I honored wounded veterans who served during the Vietnam War including a special presentation of a Bronze Star and other medals to Chapter 187 Chaplain Robert Segool.  We were also honored to present Vietnam War 50th Anniversary Commemorative Lapel Pins to more than a 40 veterans during a ceremony at the Veteran One-stop Center of WNY. If you are a veteran of the Vietnam War era and would like to receive a 50th Anniversary pin please go to our website and fill out this form.

Caring for Those Who Risked Their Lives for Us
Kids Korner opened at the Buffalo VA in 2011 as one of three pilot projects nationwide to provide child care services to veterans visiting the hospital for medical appointments related to physical health or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) treatment. It is popular among parents and grandparents who visit the Buffalo VA for health and mental health appointments, providing care to over 1,000 children annually. In September, we announced legislation approved by the House of Representatives includes language that extends the Kids Korner childcare program at the Buffalo VA Medical Center through 2019.  The Buffalo VA also unveiled their newly renovated inpatient unit 9D in August. The $3.9 million project includes 20 beds and updated utility systems to support modernized capabilities.

The Next Generation of Servicemembers
 Along with Senator Gillibrand, we hosted a Service Academy Night, an opportunity for high school students, families, school administrators, and counselors to learn more about service academy institution, programs, and the application process. Representatives from the U.S. Military Academy, Naval Academy, Coast Guard Academy, Merchant Marine Academy, Air Force Academy, and R.O.T.C programs were present to share information about their institutions.

100 YEARS AFTER THE ARMISTICE, AMERICA CONTINUES TO HONOR VETERANS
￼
At the 11th hour, on the 11th day, of the 11th month, 100 years ago, World War I ended with Germany signing an armistice agreement with the allied forces.  Once thought to be “the war to end all wars,” World War I took the lives of nine million soldiers, in addition to millions of innocent civilians. 
As a Brigadier General in the Ohio Army National Guard and veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Veterans Day has always been a personally important day to remember and thank all of those who came before me in service to the United States. This year being the 100th Anniversary of the Armistice is even more meaningful, as my grandfather served in World War I. Because of this, from a very young age, the importance of honoring our veterans was instilled in me.   That’s why, since coming to Congress, I have worked to ensure veterans receive the recognition and benefits they have earned and deserve. 
I was proud to lead the effort with Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (D-OH) to support and secure the national designation for the National Veterans Memorial and Museum in downtown Columbus.  This Memorial and Museum will allow Americans from across the country to hear the stories of veterans from all eras, conflicts and branches of the military throughout the year. This project represents America’s continuing commitment to honoring our veterans.   
I have also worked on other bipartisan initiatives to help veterans, such as legislation to provide therapy dogs to veterans, help veterans struggling with homelessness, and ensure veterans receive the mental health care they need. Moving forward, I remain committed to supporting efforts like these to assist veterans.   As we observe Veterans Day again this year, I hope that you will join me in thanking veterans in your community, and commemorating those who paid the ultimate price for our freedoms. To veterans across the country: THANK YOU for your service and sacrifice, and Happy Veterans Day.

A mere 1 percent of our population serves in our military to defend 100 percent of our freedoms. This Veterans Day, I hope you will join me in recognizing the men and women of our armed forces who have courageously put their lives on the line for ours.
Starting in 1954, our country has observed Veteran’s Day as a time to give our veterans the recognition they have both earned and deserve. They are committed to protecting Americans like us from evil. They sacrifice holidays with their families to serve overseas. They dedicate entire careers of service for the nation that we all love. They serve in times of war and in times of peace. These men and women deserve our unwavering support and gratitude.
Will Rogers once told us: “We can't all be heroes because somebody has to sit on the curb and clap as they go by.”
Will is right. There is no better way to celebrate Veteran’s Day than to show your support for the veterans that protect our freedoms. 
There are several events happening across Oklahoma this weekend where you can personally support and thank our veterans.  Events are taking place in Muskogee, Miami, Wilburton, and Norman.  Click on the links of the town names to see what Veteran's Day events are happening near you. Veterans can also visit the Tulsa Zoo on Sunday free of admission.
Additionally, my office is always ready to help and serve our veterans. If you are a veteran in need of assistance regarding the Department of Veterans Affairs, health care, compensation, or any other veteran related issue, my team can help. Please call my Muskogee office at (918) 687-2533 to speak with one of my veterans caseworkers.  
This Veteran’s Day, I’ll be clapping my hands in recognition and eternal gratitude for our heroes as they go by. Join me in saying ‘thank you’ to a veteran today.

Dear Friend,  Each year, on the eleventh day of the eleventh month, we come together to remember and honor those who have answered the call in defense of our nation. We pay tribute to the Americans who, for generations, have given everything so that we may live in peace here at home.     I am moved by the unwavering patriotism of all those who served. These American brothers and sisters often see the worst conflicts in world and have to look evil directly in the eye, but somehow never lose sight of the principles they fight for. On Veterans Day, we gather to honor those who served our nation in the wars and conflicts that span our nation’s history.     And that is why we pause to pay tribute. We pledge to never forget. On this most hallowed day, we pay tribute to the memory of the fallen, renew our commitment to the values they fought to defend, and recognize the unimaginable sacrifices made by their families. As the parent of two Marine children, we honor all those who have served, as well as those who are serving today. Today, we honor America’s heroes.     The responsibility we have to them and to all of our servicemembers and veterans is to not only remember their contributions – but to live up to the responsibility we have to uphold the freedom and principals they fought to defend.   The men and women deployed all across the globe defending us today volunteered to do so. The responsibility we have is to thank them, but as individuals, communities, and as Americans, our responsibility is also to stand behind them as a grateful nation united in ensuring that they return home to a country worthy of their sacrifice.    Words and thanks are not enough – they are just the start of how we must show our gratitude and fulfill our promise to America’s bravest men and women.   That fundamental responsibility means providing jobs for our veterans when they return home, welcoming military families into our communities and ensuring that every servicemember and veteran receives the care and respect they deserve.  That is why I have worked to introduce the Veterans Employment Training (VET) Act, which would provide grants to encourage local businesses and community colleges to offer our veterans the training needed to be successful in newly created jobs. I am also proud to be a member of the Congressional Military Family Caucus and a former member of the House Armed Services Committee.   This Veterans Day, and every day, we will keep those who made the ultimate sacrifice, their families, our veterans, and our servicemembers around the world in our thoughts and in our prayers.     To all of the servicemembers, veterans, and military families– thank you for your service to our country.   Sincerely,  
￼  Dave Loebsack Iowa's Second District

Congressman Warren Davidson has been working in Ohio as Congress is not in Session.  
Before the polls closed on Tuesday, Congressman Davidson was invited to join Alisa Chang of NPR’s All Things Considered to share his viewpoints on the election and the path he sees for the Freedom Caucus. 
On Friday, Congressman Davidson reacted to the President's Proclamation Addressing Mass Migration through the U.S. Southern Border, calling the proclamation a measured, just, and likely effective at striking the balance of security and opportunity that makes America the envy of the world. Read his post on Facebook here.

Dear Friend,
This week, the American people made it very clear that they want a House of Representatives committed to American values and government accountability. A Democratic majority in the 116th Congress will restore checks and balances, reinstate oversight, and renew our promise of opportunity and equality for all.
I am honored to be re-elected to represent Illinois’ Fifth District and the great city of Chicago for another term, and in my work on both the Appropriations Committee and Intelligence Committee, I will continue my efforts to keep our state prosperous and our nation safe. I am thankful for the opportunity to serve you over the next two years, and I am optimistic that as we work together we can help steer our country back on track and in a positive direction.
Now, I want to hear from you. There’s a lot of work to be done, and I am eager to hear what issues matter most to you and your family. I value your feedback and look forward to learning more about your legislative priorities for 2019.

Dear Friends,
 
￼
I was honored to participate this year in the Art Institute of Atlanta’s Veterans Day Program, where we honored our military veterans, active personnel and of course those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. I was joined by USMC Sgt. Thomas H. P. Carroll, a Vietnam War veteran, and Chef Carl S. Redding, a student at the Art Institute of Atlanta and former Marine.
 
Carl said: “Veteran’s Day is a time for us to take time and remember those who have fought for the freedoms that we hold so dear. We should not take their sacrifice for granted.”
 
I agree. As President Obama once said: Whether our veterans fought at Normandy or Falluja, Mogadishu or Helmand, in the Persian Gulf or in the Tet Offensive or simply provided support here at home, our veterans represent the very best men and women who have served our country in battle. 
 
On Veterans Day this Monday, let’s all express our deepest gratitude and thanks. Their sacrifices are the foundation of more than 240 years of American security and progress. Their legacy shows us that no matter what confronts our nation or what adversity we face, there is no challenge we cannot overcome together, and because of their sacrifice and commitment our best days as a nation lie ahead.
 
Our men and women in uniform teach us duty, strength, enterprise, passion and dedication – the bedrock of a commitment to safeguard and shield – that has kept our nation secure for more than two centuries. 
 
In war and in peace, their service has been selfless and accomplishments singular.
 
As a grateful nation, it is our solemn duty to make that transition possible — to ensure our returning heroes can share in the opportunities they have fought so hard to protect. The freedoms we hold dear exist and persist because of their commitment, and our nation must work much harder to honor our veterans by fulfilling our promise to them and upholding the sacred bond we share with all Americans’ veterans.
 
On this Veterans Day celebration, we are called to commemorate the boundless burdens that have been endured by so few. We honor our wounded warriors, our missing in action, our fallen, and their families — men and women who have borne the ultimate costs of war and deserve our deepest respect, not just Monday but every day.
 
Thank you,

Dear Friend,
This Sunday, November 11th is the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day, which marks the official end of World War I. Today we call the anniversary celebration Veterans’ Day, but the meaning is the same – a day where our country expresses its sincere gratitude for everything our nation’s veterans have done to defend us at home and protect our way of life...KEEP READING HERE 


WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH

￼
Some people think the government creates jobs, but they're wrong. It's small businesses that create 7 out of 10 new jobs in the United States. I was honored to receive NFIB's Guardian of Small Business Award for supporting pro-growth policies and my work to cut red tape.
￼

Did you know the first road into Missouri came to Madison County? I had the honor of helping Madison County celebrate their 200 years of rich history and presented a copy of my remarks in the House of Representatives recognizing this special achievement.

￼
Congratulations to the ladies of Advance High School on capturing the school's first ever state volleyball title! They ended an incredible 37-2-1 season with a win over Calvary Lutheran to bring the championship home. Go Hornets! 
￼
I appreciate the St. Francois County Rotary Club hosting me for a legislative update and a great discussion about the work President Trump and I have accomplished in the last two years.  
￼
Adult rifle hunting season starts today in Missouri. Did you know the deer you take down could be used to support wounded veterans? Check out this program by the Elks, where you can donate deer hides to be used to make gloves for veterans in wheelchairs.  
￼
I swung by the Reynolds County Library in Centerville and donated boxes of books from the Library of Congress that will be split up between the branches in Oates, Bunker, Lesterville, Ellington, and Centerville. It'll take them a few weeks to process the new arrivals, but be on the lookout for some new reads!
￼
Can you let me know what priorities you'd like to see Congress focus on moving forward?

Dear Friends,

What the Working Class Is Still Trying to Tell Us
And how we can make a difference in their lives.
By David Brooks, The New York Times Opinion

I was ready for massive Democratic turnout for the election on Tuesday. But I was surprised how massive the Republican turnout was in response.

The Republicans who flooded to the polls weren’t college-educated suburbanites. Those people voted for Democrats this year.

They weren’t tax-cut fanatics. Half of the Republican members of the House Ways and Means Committee either left Congress, ran for other offices or were defeated.

They weren’t even small-government Republicans. The same red states that elected conservatives to office also  in Nebraska, Idaho and Utah  approved ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid. The same red states that elected conservatives also approved initiatives  in Arkansas and Missouri  to raise the minimum wage.

These were high-school-educated, working-class Republicans.

A lot of us pundits said Donald Trump should run a positive campaign bragging about all the economic growth. But Trump ran another American carnage campaign. That’s because American life still feels like carnage to many.

Trump Administration Spares Corporate Wrongdoers Billions in Penalties

By Ben Protess, Robert Gebeloff and Danielle Ivory, The New York Times
In the final months of the Obama administration, Walmart was under pressure from federal officials to pay nearly $1 billion and accept a guilty plea to resolve a foreign bribery investigation.

Barclays faced demands that it pay nearly $7 billion to settle civil claims that it had sold toxic mortgage investments that helped fuel the 2008 financial crisis, and the Royal Bank of Scotland was ensnared in a criminal investigation over its role in the crisis.

The three corporate giants complained that the Obama administration was being unreasonable and stood their ground, according to people briefed on the investigations. After President Trump took office, they looked to his administration for a more sympathetic ear  and got one.

Federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission have yet to charge Walmart, and the Justice Department reached a much lower settlement agreement with Barclays in March, for $2 billion. R.B.S. paid a civil penalty, but escaped criminal charges altogether.

U.S. Law Enforcement Failed to See the Threat of White Nationalism. Now They Don’t Know How to Stop It.
For two decades, domestic counterterrorism strategy has ignored the rising danger of far-right extremism. In the atmosphere of willful indifference, a virulent movement has grown and metastasized.
By Janet Reitman, The New York Times Magazine
The first indication to Lt. Dan Stout that law enforcement’s handling of white supremacy was broken came in September 2017, as he was sitting in an emergency-operations center in Gainesville, Fla., preparing for the onslaught of Hurricane Irma and watching what felt like his thousandth YouTube video of the recent violence in Charlottesville, Va. Jesus Christ, he thought, studying the footage in which crowds of angry men, who had gathered to attend or protest the Unite the Right rally, set upon one another with sticks and flagpole spears and flame throwers and God knows what else. A black man held an aerosol can, igniting the spray, and in retaliation, a white man picked up his gun, pointed it toward the black man and fired it at the ground. The Virginia state troopers, inexplicably, stood by and watched. Stout fixated on this image, wondering what kind of organizational failure had led to the debacle. He had one month to ensure that the same thing didn’t happen in Gainesville.

Congressional Report

Dear Friends, 
This week, I attended various meetings and events with different individuals and organizations, including the Water Infrastructure Projects Funding Announcement, a grant announcement at the Laredo Gateway Community Health Center, and the weekly Laredo Daybreak Rotary Club meeting. I also attended a memorial service to remember and honor the innocent lives lost in the Sutherland Springs shooting in the wake of its one-year anniversary.

In the district, my staff attended several meetings and events, including an informational tour of the World Trade Bridge in Laredo as well as the Airman Heritage Foundation Annual Membership Meeting in San Antonio.

Lastly, I have included a video from the National Park Service that expresses thanks to all the US veterans who have risked their lives for the betterment of our country in honor of Veteran’s Day this Sunday.
As always, please contact one of my offices if you need assistance with any federal agency.


Rep. Cuellar Announces $5.8 Million for Border Water Infrastructure Projects 
￼

On Wednesday, October 31, the City of Laredo and I announced more than $5.863 million in federal funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s U.S.-Mexico Border Water Infrastructure Program (BWIP) that will assist the border region with a number of water infrastructure projects. Specifically, this funding will be used to cover a number of major water infrastructure projects, including two affecting the 28th District, in Tamaulipas, Mexico, and Palmview, Texas. These projects will benefit thousands of local residents throughout Laredo and Nuevo Laredo by decreasing waste water discharge into the Rio Grande River and enhancing wastewater collection and treatment. Pictured from left are South Central Deputy Regional Director for U.S. Senator John Cornyn's office Henry Juvera, Congressman Henry Cuellar, U.S. Consul General in Nuevo Laredo Kathryn Flatchsbart, Mayor of Nuevo Laredo Enrique Rivas Cuellar, Mayor of Laredo Pete Saenz, Deputy Managing Director of North American Development Bank Calixto Mateos, Rio Grande International Study Center Executive Director Tricia Cortez, and Rio Grande International Study Board Member Edward D. Garza. 


Rep. Cuellar Announces $395,000 for Gateway Community Health Center, Inc. 
￼

On Thursday, November 1, I announced $395,000 in funding for the Gateway Community Health Center, Inc. These funds will be used to increase confidentiality within the Health Center’s filing system and the number of staff within the Center to meet the demand for mental health treatment. It is my hope that these funds will improve the level of treatment that an underserved population has experienced. 


Rep. Cuellar Provides Legislative Update to Laredo Daybreak Rotary Club Members 
￼

On Friday, November 2, I attended the Laredo Daybreak Rotary Club weekly meeting to provide the members with a legislative update and discuss important issues impacting the community such as federal grants, trade, and immigration. Pictured from left are Daybreak Rotary Club Member Hendrik Limarta, Congressman Henry Cuellar, Daybreak Rotary Club Vice President Roberto Garza, and Assistant Governor Laredo District 5930 Lupita Zepeda. 


Remembering the One-Year Anniversary of the Sutherland Springs Shooting 

￼

On Monday, November 5, I released a statement of remembrance honoring those who tragically lost their lives in the Sutherland Springs Shooting one year ago. Though the grief of these losses is still felt by those closest to the victims, the spirit of compassion reared from this tragedy exemplifies the determination of humanity to rise from darkness. No one will forget those who lost their lives, and everyone will remember the love that a community can bear when it comes together in the face of deep pain. Pictured are Congressman Castro (TX-20) and Congressman Henry Cuellar visiting with Sutherland Springs Hero Stephen Willeford during the memorial service on Sunday. 


Honoring Community Service in Laredo
￼

On Thursday, November 1, my staffer Nina Andrews attended the Volunteers Serving The Need 3rd Annual Banquet and presented Congressional Certificates of Recognition to LBV Co-Trustee Joe “Pepito” Martin and LBV Co-Trustee Jim Pearl for their dedication and service to veterans and to our community. Pictured from left are Congressional Intern Mia De Llano, LBV Co-Trustee Joe “Pepito” Martin, Volunteers Serving the Need Founder and CEO Gigi Ramos, LBV Co-Trustee Jim Pearl, and Congressional Staffer Nina Andrews. 


Congressional Staff Tours World Trade Bridge 
￼

On Monday, November 5, my Washington, D.C. staff and my Laredo staff joined representatives from Customs and Border Protection and the City of Laredo to receive a tour of World Trade Bridge in Laredo. They discussed the economic impact in the state and the country, as well as infrastructure and expansion for the bridge.

￼

Democracy is Hard: On the eve of another national election, let me say the obvious - and that is we’re remarkably blessed to live in a country that allows for the degree of self-determination that collectively we hold in our hands.
Democracy is hard. It’s often messy and cumbersome. It’s certainly inefficient…but it is pure genius for the way that the Founding Fathers designed a system that would be responsible for the collective will of We, The People.
It doesn’t take many glances through the papers to see the chaos and confusion that surrounds so many places around the world. We’ve even occasionally seen some of that here. In fact, more than we’d like given the political atmosphere is as polarized as I’ve ever seen it.
But this doesn’t mean that we should give up on the genius of what the Founding Fathers created. It means that every one of us needs to take our natural born right to vote and use it tomorrow.
I go back to two simple thoughts. Click here to read more.
￼

November 6

Midterms - What's at Stake: In yesterday’s post, I talked about the importance of taking the time to vote….how every one of us should appreciate the sacrifices that have been made so that we might have the ability to vote as we do.
But let me dig a little deeper today and talk about what’s at stake. They say every election is the most important election, but this one really has amazing ramifications with regard to the trajectory of our country.
So I will continue a tradition that began over 20 years ago for me in staying up late into the night and watching election returns and trying to discern what they mean and where they suggest our country goes from here.
It will certainly be a different election for me. I’ve been an active participant in the process over the years, and to watch these returns from a less personal and more tranquil spot will be new ground. At some level, it will be bittersweet. I had an old friend come up to me at lunch and proclaim, “free at last, free at last!” While that’s true and I am certainly freed from past electoral obligations, I will miss the heightened sensitivity and focus that comes with having your name and head on the electoral chopping block!
Outside of the normal tug-of-war that comes with politics and the normal debate on whether Republicans or Democrats control the House and the Senate, I think that there are three mega-trends that we should watch very carefully tonight. Click here to read more.
￼

November 7

Jeff Sessions' Departure: I will come back with a whole host of thoughts with regard to Tuesday night’s election and its implications going forward for our country...but tonight, I wanted to circle around to something that Republicans and conservatives have been amazingly quiet on - Jeff Sessions’ departure.

I could pull one hundred clips similar to the one linked below that not so many months ago describe the spectre of Sessions’ departure as something that would have been seen as a close cousin to constitutional challenge. Yet today’s departure by Sessions was met with eerie silence.

I am neither a lawyer nor a constitutional scholar, but what I do know is Sessions’ time in the Senate was marked by principled stands, adherence to limited government and the rule of law, and, prior to this chapter, he had always been highly respected within conservative circles.

My point here is that I don’t think that Sessions woke up wanting to leave the administration two years into it, but given reports that he was asked to resign this morning and in deference to the president, he took the gentlemanly and quiet way out. His doing so doesn’t make right certain obvious wrongs that have taken place in the investigative process. But neither does it absolve us of our duty to watch very carefully what comes next on what the Founding Fathers prescribed in creating an independent judicial system - and a law enforcement mechanism that traditionally has been viewed in professional rather than political terms. It also invites every one of us to stop for a second and not look at the vilified version of Jeff Sessions’ service to our country - but rather for the stands he so consistently made over his many years in the United States Senate. Click here to watch the clip.

November 8

Tariffs' Effects on South Carolina: With all the focus on election results, you may have missed the sobering news that just came out about BMW in the Upstate.
In The Post and Courier yesterday, there was news of BMW’s announcement that they have stopped exporting the South Carolina-made X3 SUVs to China. That’s a big deal, given they build around 150,000 X3s a year in Spartanburg. The unintended consequence of our tariff scuffle with China is that BMW may now be forced to move production to China. That may mean not only cars for Chinese domestic production, but given the way production lines work, it could well mean X3s exported from China to the likes of India or America.
Production from Spartanburg has already been hit, given BMW is reporting lost earnings of almost $350 million this year alone. This latest hit from China imposed a 40% tariff on BMWs headed that direction…and it goes without saying that a 40% increase can make a lot of things uncompetitive.
Let me reiterate my concerns over escalating tariffs and trade tension for South Carolina. Our state is the 3rd most reliant state in the Union on imports and exports. We are the state highest in per capita foreign direct investment of any state in the continental United States. In English, that means BMW and Volvo and Bosch and a whole host of international companies have chosen to invest in the Palmetto State versus other places. Almost 580,000 jobs in South Carolina are tied to trade, over 6,000 companies export goods globally from the state, and about $30 billion in goods are exported from the state annually. Out of all the 50 states, we pay a higher price than most for protectionist policies like tariffs. Click here to read more.

Celebrating Veterans Day



Dear Friend:  
Welcome to your weekly update. As always, you can learn more about these and other legislative issue at my website: upton.house.gov. 
Celebrating Veterans Day  
￼
I am honored each day to have the opportunity to serve the men and women who served our country with bravery and dedication as a Member of Congress. But Veterans Day is always a particularly special day where we as a country set aside time to honor, to express gratitude to, and reflect on the sacrifices of those who have worn our country’s uniform. In honor of them, this is a special Veterans Day edition of my weekly e-newsletter.
One of my top priorities since coming to Congress is helping veterans and their families receive the care and benefits they have earned. With U.S. troops defending our nation in around the world, it is more important than ever that we provide our soldiers and their families the resources they deserve both on the battlefield and here at home.
Key Veterans Legislation
This Congress, the House of Representatives has been working diligently to pass legislation that would improve programs and treatments available to veterans, increase career and educational opportunities, and hold the VA accountable. I appreciate the opportunity to highlight some of this important work:
Healthcare 
	•	H.R. 5674: VA Mission Act: This important legislation, signed into law, will improve our VA healthcare system by streamlining the VA’s Community Care programs into one cohesive program, create a non-partisan process for reviewing the VA’s assets, and expand the Post-9/11 Caregiver Program to all eras.
	•	H.R. 299: Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act: Nearly 90,000 veterans served in ships off the coast of Vietnam and face challenges claiming benefits for their exposure to Agent Orange. This legislation, which passed the House, would extend the presumption of exposure to Agent Orange to veterans who serviced in the Blue Water Navy.
	•	H.R. 2123: Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support (VETS) Act: The VA has served hundreds of thousands of veterans, particularly in rural areas, through telemedicine services. But a limitation for doctors to practice telemedicine across state lines has impeded the VA’s ability to utilize telemedicine. This legislation would improve veterans access to care by allowing the Secretary of the VA to authorize VA medical providers to practice telemedicine in any state. 
	•	H.R. 918: Veteran Urgent Access to Mental Healthcare Act: This legislation helps ensure veterans who need treatment or help with mental illness are not turned away. It would allow veterans who are discharged under other-than-honorable (OTH) conditions to receive a mental health assessment and treatment from the VA during a crisis. These services would apply to certain former servicemembers, including those who participated in combat or who were the victim of military sexual assault.
Career Opportunities
	•	H.R. 3949: Veteran Apprenticeship and Labor Opportunity Reform (VALOR) Act: Under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, companies may offer apprenticeships for veterans, which offer many opportunities for veterans to broaden their skills. However, the application process for a company to have their apprenticeship approved is burdensome, as each state requires an application. To help make sure companies are not deterred from providing these opportunities for veterans, the House passed the VALOR Act to streamline the application process through one agency. 
	•	H.R. 244: HIRE Vets Act: This bill, signed into law, requires the Department of Labor to establish a HIRE Veterans Medallion Program to recognize companies for their efforts to employ veterans. 
Accountability and Reform
	•	H.R. 1066: VA Management Alignment Act: The VA Management Alignment Act would require the VA to report to Congress on changes that will be made and steps to improve organization issues, as well as specific roles, responsibilities, and accountability of staff offices and leaders.
	•	H.R. 2288: Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act: This legislation, signed into law, addresses the VA’s backlog in appeals by modernizing the process and creating three ""lanes"" for appeals.
	•	H.R. 27: Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act: This bill would require the VA to keep a copy of any reprimand or admonishment by a VA employee in the employee’s permanent record. Currently, the VA only keeps disciplinary actions in an employee’s file for three years. The VA a uses a tiered system of disciplinary action and most employees are disciplined at a lower level because their actions were not permanently part of the employee’s file. 
Educational
	•	H.R. 3218: The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Education Assistance Act: This removes time restrictions to use the GI Bill, enabling future eligible recipients to use their GI bill benefits for their entire lives, as opposed to the current 15-year timeline.
	•	H.R. 3262: Grow Our Own Directive (GOOD): Physician Assistant Employment and Education Act: would direct the VA to carry out the GOOD pilot program to provide educational assistance to certain former members of the Armed Forces with medical or military health experience for education and training as VA physician assistants.
Protecting Veterans from Scams 
	•	H.R. 3122: Veterans Care Financial Protection Act: Signed into law, this bill directs the VA to work with federal agencies and states to develop and implement standards that protect individuals who are eligible for this increased pension from dishonest, predatory or otherwise unlawful practices.
	•	H.R. 3705: Veterans Fair Debt Notice Act: would also instruct VA to use plain language in its debt notices to provide a clear explanation of why VA is alleging that the veteran owes such a debt.
Increasing Quality of Life
	•	H.R. 4958: Veterans Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act: This increases the rates of compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities as well as the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the survivors of certain disabled veterans as of December 1, 2018. 
Helping Veterans in Southwest Michigan
In addition to hearing from veterans directly throughout Southwest Michigan, my office has the ability to help veterans schedule appointments with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or assist in receiving previously awarded service medals. 
￼
Here I am with Robert Shepard, a Vietnam veteran from Kalazmazoo, presenting him with his overdue service medals. Our office was able to help Mr. Shepard with a records request and assistance with the Veterans Benefits Administration.   
￼
I was honored to present Richard Clark, a WWII Merchant Marine veteran, with his medals at the Kalamazoo County Veterans Stand Down event.
If you or your family needs help with a federal agency, including the VA or Department of Defense, please call my St. Joesph office at 269-982-1986 or my Kalamazoo office at 269-385-0039.

FRAME Act
Uncertainty is one of the only constants in farming. The agriculture industry is subject to weather inconsistency, market fluctuation, and trade disruptions. Farmers have long relied upon the food security system to help mitigate risk and ensure income despite setbacks, which I have proudly supported as your Congressman. However, farmers also need a tool to allow them to be in charge of their own personal safety net. That is why I have long championed the Farm Risk Abatement and Mitigation Election Act (FRAME Act), which would establish tax-deferred farm savings accounts that allow farmers to prepare for challenging years by saving in advance.
This year’s soybean harvest has underscored the importance of this legislation. Arkansas farmers would have benefitted from having a rainy-day fund to help them get through this year of trade, weather, and price uncertainties. In order to encourage initial investment into this savings mechanism, farmers would be eligible to write-off FRAME account contributions on their tax bill. Contributions would be tax deductible up to $50,000 per year, and farmers would retain 10% of their contributions in the form of a tax credit during the first few years after opening the account.
For several years we have seen situations in which farmers would have benefitted from having their own personal safety net to draw upon without having to wait for a disaster declaration or special USDA program to be developed. Farmers need several tools for meaningful risk aversion, and the freedom to invest in a personal account dedicated to disaster relief is one of these tools. I will continue to work to make the FRAME Act law and help our farmers persevere during hard times.
FAQ (What folks have been calling/texting my office about this week)
Q: With Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigning, what will you do about the Russia investigation being conducted by the DOJ?  A: Despite Former Attorney General Sessions resignation, the DOJ hasn't indicated whether the investigation will or will not continue. Mr. Mueller is currently serving as a DOJ Special Counsel, and is subject to incredibly limited Congressional oversight. Based on the year long investigation I participated in, we didn't see any evidence of the Russians colliding with the Trump campaign. I personally see this investigation as a waste of taxpayers dollars and I have called for Mr. Mueller to put an end to it many times. However, checks and balances must be adhered to.

Arkansas Lawmaker Aims to Help US Agribusiness Boost Sales to Cuba 

HAVANA (AP) — Representatives from the United States' agricultural sector, include U.S. Congressman Rick Crawford of Arkansas, arrived in Cuba on Thursday for a conference aimed at promoting sales, one of the few U.S. business areas allowed to deal with the island under a half-century-old trade embargo that Cuban leaders blame for most of its economic troubles.

Arkansas congressional aides attend farm, research tour

Most recently, Division of Agriculture administrators and researchers, along with several industry leaders, hosted nine congressional aides for a tour of both research and academic facilities, as well as working farms and production facilities, in central and northwest Arkansas.

U.S. agribusiness representatives travel to Cuba

HAVANA - Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Jonesboro, didn't waste any time. He traveled to Cuba right after voters re-elected the military veteran to his fifth term representing Arkansas' 1st District -- the largest rice-growing district in the country. 
Crawford, 52, was among the Americans with the U.S. Agricultural Coalition for Cuba, or USACC, who were in Havana on Thursday to participate in a three-day conference aiming to increase trade with Cuba. They will remain there until Saturday.

McKinley Thanks Veterans For Their Service
Veterans Day is about remembering and honoring the lives of the men and women who have served our country. Veterans represent the very best our country has to offer. Many of our own loved ones have served, and they will always hold a special place in our hearts and minds. While we remember those who have given many years of their lives to protect our nation, we also thank those who are currently serving at home and abroad. To all of our veterans, thank you for your dedication, sacrifice, and commitment to country.

Wall Street Journal: A Consequential Congress 
The economy is booming thanks to the tax cuts and red tape we have removed. The tax reform has lifted the United States economy to a higher growth plane and again has made it the most competitive. We are rebuilding the military to keep us safe, and much more. While this is good news for West Virginia, there is still more work to be done.   Click here to read more

Q&A: Veterans Day 2018
Q. As we observe the centennial anniversary of Armistice Day, what is your message to Iowans? Q. How many veterans call Iowa home? 
Quick Links
Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa and I sent a letter to the secretary of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to better understand why veteran homelessness in Iowa has increased in the past two years. These brave men and women have given so much to our country through their service and sacrifice and they should have the security of a place to live. It's vital for the federal government to partner with states and local communities to find the most effective solutions to combat homelessness, especially among our veterans.
Jeff Sessions resigned as Attorney General. Jeff is a dedicated public servant and man of honor. I was proud to serve alongside him in the United States Senate for over twenty years. His leadership, integrity and dedication to our country as Attorney General are admirable and commendable. I look forward to working with Matt Whitaker as he takes the helm of the Justice Department. A fellow Iowan, who I’ve known for many years, Matt will work hard and make us proud. The Justice Department is in good hands during this time of transition.
Following my request last week seeking information on potential national security threats relating to the migrant caravans headed toward the southern border, the Departments of State and Homeland Security briefed the Senate Judiciary Commttee's staff. I appreciate the engagement of both the State Department and DHS officials who quickly responded to my request. Keeping Congress apprised of any information relating to national security threats with respect to such a large group of individuals attempting to enter the country remains critically important. This information will help the committee address the needs of legitimate asylum-seekers who need humanitarian relief.
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and I sent a letter to the President urging him to support our bipartisan Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act, which would help limit anticompetitive “pay for delay” settlement agreements that can delay the availability of affordable generic drugs for years. Our legislation would increase prescription drug competition in U.S. markets, driving down prices and improving the quality of life for patients across the country.

A Note from Congressman Butterfield 
Dear Friend-  
It is all thanks to you. 
It has been a privilege and honor to serve North Carolina’s First Congressional District, and I thank you for your vote of confidence for me to continue serving you in Congress.  I look forward to getting back to work in Washington and right here at home to make health care more accessible and affordable, build an economy that works for everyone, and push forward a positive agenda that will benefit the Triangle and eastern North Carolina. Thank you.
On Tuesday, Democrats won control of the U.S. House of Representatives and made historic gains in other critical races, from governorships to statehouses to ballot initiatives.  I look forward to a Democratic Majority that will fight for the issues constituents tell me they care about most- lowering health care costs, increasing pay, and investing in our country with an infrastructure package that will address our roads, bridges, dams, and rural broadband to connect the 23 million rural Americans who don’t currently have access to high speed internet.
While we have so much to be proud of and energized by, it is clear that our work is not done.  President Trump seems determined to continue on with his business as usual.  Already, President Trump has fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions- which could be the start of an effort to undermine Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s attacks on the 2016 election.  Democratic control of the U.S. House will be a crucial check on President Trump’s attempts to undermine or interfere with that investigation.  I continue to support Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation, and I support Congressional measures that will ensure Mr. Mueller is able to follow the facts wherever they may lead.
As always, I remain committed to continuing the fight for our shared priorities in North Carolina’s First Congressional District. 
I can’t thank you enough for your vote of confidence, your engagement, and your support.
As we prepare for Veterans Day, I hope you will join me in remembering and honoring the sacrifice of our country’s brave veterans.  Over 20 million men and women have worn our nation’s uniform and put their lives on the line for the cause of freedom.  Their sacrifice and dedication will never be forgotten.  Today and every day, may God bless each of our courageous veterans and their families.

With gratitude, ￼  G. K. Butterfield Member of Congress, NC-01

Dear Friend, 
This past August, at a town hall in Norfolk, an older gentleman raised his hand.  After he rose from his seat with difficulty, I asked him whether he was a veteran and of what war.  He said he served in World War II and Korea.  Although I do not remember his question, I cannot forget the feeling of the encounter. 
As the Greatest Generation recedes further into our memory, it is deeply humbling and gratifying to see veterans like this man engaged in the civic life of their local communities and our nation.  Soon enough, with the passing of time, we will lose our last living links to pivotal wars in our nation’s history: severe, brutal conflicts when our men and women in uniform sacrificed to save the world from tyranny.  As the great Jewish scholar, Jacob Neusner, once wrote:  
“Civilization hangs suspended from generation to generation, by the gossamer strand of memory. If only one cohort of mothers and fathers fails to convey to its children what it has learned from its parents, then the great chain of learning and wisdom snaps. If the guardians of human knowledge stumble only one time, in their fall collapses the whole edifice of knowledge and understanding.”
Amidst the loud national political conversation, it can be easy to forget quiet little moments like the veteran who participated in the Norfolk town hall.  But we must carry his legacy forward.  On Monday, we will pause for a moment to say “thank you” to our veterans.  Veterans Day is a time to gather in gratitude, and reflect on our common bond, our narrative as a people, and our shared notion of nationhood.  In so doing, we find our unifying principles. 
Support for our veterans must remain at the forefront of our efforts in Washington.  One example of real progress is Lincoln’s historic Veterans Affairs (VA) campus, which has been chosen as the location for a new state-of-the art VA clinic.  This is an important victory for the economic regeneration of a unique historic property.  It arrives on the heels of a similarly successful public-private partnership to expand, improve, and innovate at the Omaha VA Medical Center.  Nebraska continues to inspire the nation with creative public-private partnerships to assist our veterans.  
Another project that I hope to pursue shortly involves an unfolding opportunity with the international community to create an historic center at the site of our D-Day battles in Normandy.  A new institute could reestablish for the 21st century a renewed understanding of the pivotal battle and its consequences for the war and the institutions that emerged afterwards.  
The spirit of selflessness that lives on in so many of our veterans—and the military men and women serving our nation today—reveals America’s inherent nobility.  They gave and continue to give—for one simple reason: it is their duty.  Veterans Day is a reminder of the shared sacrifices that are needed to keep what we value.  And it is a reminder to thank the men and women who keep the world safe and our nation strong. 
Politics ebbs and flows.  Majorities become minorities and minorities become majorities. Yet some things remain constant, some things endure, and some things unite.  On Veterans Day, we remember that humble veteran at a town hall in Norfolk and the millions of others who fought valiantly in lands far from home—for our security, for our values, and for the nation we hold dear.  
  Sincerely, ￼  Congressman Jeff Fortenberry

Celebrating veterans

As the CNMI continues to recover from Super Typhoon Yutu and Typhoon Mangkhut we take a moment to celebrate and thank veterans and their families across the nation. Veterans are employed in critical fields such as EMTs, law enforcement officers, firefighters, while others are private and government employees, and in some cases veterans go on to serve as lawmakers. Veterans have become an integral part of our community by applying their skills and ethics learned throughout their military career. Today we celebrate and thank these men and women who have hung up their military uniforms, and continue to serve the community. For all that you have done and continue to do, thank you for your service.
 

VA will expedite appeals

Veterans who have benefits claims or appeals with the VA will receive an expedited process. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said: “Just as it did with hurricanes Florence and Michael, VA’s Board of Veterans’ Appeals is prioritizing the benefits appeals claims process [for Super Typhoon Yutu] because it is the right thing to do.” Making sure the Marianas gets the same level of federal response as given to states impacted by hurricanes Florence and Michael is my priority.  
 

Lowey to help with extra funding

Incoming Democratic Chair of the House Appropriations Committee Nita Lowey (New York) spoke with me today about providing supplemental disaster funding for recovery in the Marianas. Although the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund gives substantial assistance to individuals and to rebuild public infrastructure, there are other federal programs that can help us and may need special appropriations. I wrote Governor Torres this week requesting that we work together to formulate a request and I remain hopeful that he will agree. Among programs and agencies from which I think we can reasonably expect assistance and/or which may require supplemental funding are:

	•	Community Development Block Grant Disaster Relief (CDBG-DR) (Department of Housing and Urban Development). To address unmet needs in housing and infrastructure and to support economic recovery and tourism.
	•	Medicaid. Yutu will reduce Commonwealth resources to match federal funds or make up for loss of Obamacare funding in 2019.
	•	Army Corps of Engineers. With only half of Saipan’s water capacity now restored the need to strengthen the system is apparent. Funding a $20 million authorization in the recent America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 could help.
	•	FEMA Cost-Share Waivers. A waiver of the local matching requirements for FEMA funding.
	•	Nutrition Assistance (Department of Agriculture). See next story. 
	•	Immediate Aid to Restart School Operations, Temporary Emergency Aid for Displaced Students, and Project School Emergency Response to Violence (SERV) (Department of Education). Funding to help PSS restart school operations, reopen schools, and re-enroll students.
	•	Emergency Assistance to Institutions of Higher Learning (Department of Education). Funding to assist Northern Marianas College restart operations and reopen to students. 
	•	Resiliency Provision (FEMA). Request for authority to rebuild Marianas infrastructure to incorporate resilient design.
	•	Federal Highway Administration Emergency Relief Program. Funding for repair and reconstruction of federal-aid highways.
	•	Small Business Administration Disaster Loan Program. Assurance of adequate funding for this program, already approved for Marianas recovery.
	•	Office of Insular Affairs (Department of the Interior). Funding for technical assistance and Capital Improvement Project grants beyond the ability of other federal agencies to provide.
	•	Department of Veterans Affairs. Assistance to provide veterans medical services, including transportation and medical supplies.
	•	National Dislocated Worker Grant (Department of Labor). Additional funding as necessary. 
	•	Disaster Unemployment Assistance (Department of Labor). Report language urging administrative flexibility for the Commonwealth to comply with the stringent requirements of the program given the lack of an unemployment insurance system.

I will be returning to Washington immediately next week to pursue these disaster funding requests and look forward to working with Ms. Lowey and other members of the new Democratic leadership to ensure the Marianas receives rapid and robust support.
 

Seeking food aid

The United States Department of Agriculture has disaster related programs I have asked Secretary Sonny Perdue to use to help our recovery from Typhoon Mangkhut and Super Typhoon Yutu. Foremost, I asked for Disaster Nutrition Assistance to be quickly available for Saipan and Tinian, as it is for Rota. This will allow current beneficiaries of the Commonwealth’s food stamp program to replace food lost in the storm and and also help those not presently receiving benefits to get assistance feeding their families. It is important that the cost of this disaster assistance not drain away the $32.5 million that I secured in the last Farm Bill, but comes from new money. The Farm Bill funds are supposed to move us toward income eligibility standards similar to the national Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP. I also asked Secretary Perdue for help restoring forest areas and crops wiped out by the storms. And I requested a moratorium on payments for USDA Rural Loan borrowers, which he granted the next day. The moratorium is good for up to 24 months. Borrowers whose accounts were in good standing prior to Yutu will be receiving moratorium letters shortly or you may call the USDA at 671.472.7490.
 

Expedite construction H visas

We do not want a lack of construction workers to slow down our recovery efforts. So, I have asked Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta to expedite H-2B visa applications for these workers, while at the same time respecting preferential hire for U.S. workers. The Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act, enacted on July 24, gives the Marianas unlimited access to H visas through 2029. And the H-2B visa should be available to hire temporary construction workers, when there is a special, short-term demand, as that caused by Super Typhoon Yutu. I asked Secretary Nielsen to confirm that reading of the law, so construction companies can apply for the visas with confidence. H-2B visas are renewable for up to three years, giving us plenty of time for rebuilding. And no visa may be issued without certification from the Secretary of Labor that no U.S. worker is able, willing, qualified, and available for the job. I also used the opportunity to thank Nielsen for the work FEMA, one of her agencies, is doing in the Marianas and to thank Acosta for a grant of $2.8 million to employ workers who lost their jobs because of Yutu.
 

Yutu Recovery Updates
 
 
 

FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers are now open. Representatives from the Commonwealth, FEMA, and the U.S. Small Business Administration are available to meet face-to-face and answer your questions about disaster related needs. 
 

Transitional shelter
The shelter population continues to decrease. 684 survivors are in shelters in Saipan, and there are no persons remaining in the Tinian shelter. The Tinian shelter is closed as of Friday ChST.

Food
Red Cross continues to provide food for shelter residents on Saipan, and they also provided 2,700 hot meals on Tinian. Salvation Army and MyPros provided 3,200 hot meals on Saipan, as well.

The CNMI Public School System Child Nutrition Program will begin distributing meals to children on Saipan and Tinian beginning November 14. All children 18 years of age and under are eligible. For more information, click here.

Tenting program
The Temporary Emergency Tent and Roofing Installation Support (TETRIS) program helps storm-impacted residents return to or remain in their homes while permanent repairs are completed. Because TETRIS is a short-term, non-cash, in-kind emergency disaster relief program, all affected residents may be eligible for this program, regardless of citizenship. According to the Emergency Operations Center, the fastest way to register for a tent or roof repair is to go to a Disaster Recovery Center (see above for locations and hours), sign up, and fill out a right-of-entry form. On Tinian, the last day to register for the tenting program is Sunday, November 11. 

Water
Saipan: As of Wednesday evening, 53 percent of water capacity and 58 of 130 water wells have been restored.

The CNMI government will be exchanging full five-­gallon water bottles for empty or damaged bottles on Saturday, November 10 at San Antonio Basketball Court. Distribution starts at 3 p.m. Residents must bring empty or damaged five-­gallon water bottles to exchange for new bottles. There is a limit of one five‐gallon water bottle per family.  

Tinian: The Office of the Mayor reports that water was fully restored on Tinian at 3:30 p.m. ChST Friday, November 9. The reverse osmosis system at Jones Beach was shut down on the same day. 

Power 
Saipan: 56 generators have been installed. The downtown commercial district is now operating on 90 percent CUC power. 

Tinian: 11 generators have been installed. All feeders remain offline as of Tuesday, Nov. 6. 797 downed power poles and 105 transformers damaged.

Transportation
Saipan: Airport navigational aids are being installed in the mobile air traffic control center, and more parts are en route. Grid power is expected to be restored to the airport by November 17.

The Commonwealth Office of Transit Authority Call-A-Ride Demand Response shared ride service phone number is now working again. Call 664-2690 for reservation requests, inquiries, or questions. Reservation hours are between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday to Saturday until further notice.

Tinian: All transportation infrastructure is functional. Runway lights and fuel station dispenser need repair.

Schools
Damage assessments have been completed. The focus is now on restoring power and water to schools, cleaning campuses, fixing repairable classrooms, and identifying temporary facilities to ensure that all schools are operational as soon as possible for the students. Schools that sustained minor damage are expected to open within two weeks. Some will be on a double session schedule with instructional time set at four hours for each session. Some schools may be relocated or share campuses. Public schools in Rota continue normal operations. Additional information will be made available as soon as possible.

Health
Uninsured citizens of the Northern Marianas are eligible for no-cost replacements of critical medications lost or damaged by Super Typhoon Yutu. This relief comes from the Emergency Prescription Assistance Program, managed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. For more information, click here.

Disaster Legal Services
Individuals needing legal assistance with issues arising from Super Typhoon Yutu may be eligible for free legal assistance through the Disaster Legal Services (DLS) program. The American Bar Association Young Lawyers Division operates DLS under agreement with FEMA. The DLS Hotline Number is 234-6243. For more information, click here. 
 
 
 
 

How to help

The FEMA website for Super Typhoon Yutu provides information for anyone wanting to help the recovery effort. Donation and volunteer information, as well as a list of Marianas-based nonprofits responding to the typhoon can be found under the “How To Help” section at www.fema.gov/disaster/4404. 

For Guam residents, the Government of Guam Offices of Homeland Security and Civil Defense has extended its donation drive to November 21. For hours, locations and list of items being accepted, click here.
 

Democrats take House majority

By working in a bipartisan way, I have been able to do well for the Marianas over the last eight years even with a Republican-majority U.S. House of Representatives:

	•	the CW bill, 
	•	extra food stamp funding, 
	•	increased annual Title I money for schools, and 
	•	return of our submerged lands. 

But when Democrats had the majority in my first two years in Congress: 

	•	We got $109 million for Medicaid and lowered the local match requirement.
	•	We increased Pell grants and made more students eligible. 
	•	The Marianas became eligible for a state-share of domestic violence grant money. 
	•	The troop store expansion began. 
	•	We changed the funding formula that led to 24-hour water for Saipan. 
	•	And we got over $1 million in earmarks for NMTI, the Garapan Public Market, and Refaluwasch and Chamorro language programs.
 
Those were good years for the Marianas. And I am looking forward to good years ahead with Democrats back in the majority. With my 10 years’ seniority, we are also in line for a chairmanship in the Education Committee or the Natural Resources Committee, which has jurisdiction over insular affairs. After Tuesday’s election, I sent congratulations to all the new Democratic members, especially Michael San Nicolas, the new Democratic Delegate from Guam. 
 
 

Tuesday, November 13 is election day and your polling place may have changed. Some of the schools that previously served as polling sites were destroyed during Super Typhoon Yutu, so the Commonwealth Election Commission has had to identify new voting locations. Be sure you know where to vote on Tuesday. Under Commonwealth law, voters can take up to two hours off work to vote. Make sure your voice is heard. Go out and vote. 
 

Scott agrees to fix Wagner-Peyser

Republicans blocked efforts to get the Marianas and American Samoa into the Wagner-Peyser jobs grant in 2014, when the program was last up for reauthorization. But with Democrats in control—and the possibility I could chair the subcommittee responsible for Wagner-Peyser in the next Congress—that could change. The program is up for reauthorization again in 2019. And the incoming Chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, Rep. Robert Scott (D-Virginia), agreed to make this fix part of our agenda for the 116th Congress. “Please know that you have my commitment to work with you to make the Marianas an eligible entity for Wagner-Peyser Act assistance when Congress takes up the reauthorization of [the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act],” Mr. Scott wrote to me on October 22. And he pledged “to explore other opportunities to increase and strengthen the U.S. workforce in the Marianas.” The annual Wagner-Peyser grant, about $300,000, would provide referrals to training for job seekers and match employers to workers with needed experience and skills.
 

Shark fin, climate, fisheries...
Planning environmental Agenda 116

Environmental issues will get serious attention when the new Democratic majority House of Representatives convenes in January. I am already working with the likely Chairman of the Subcommittee on Water, Power, and Oceans, Rep. Jared Huffman of California, on our agenda for the next two years. At the top of the list, legislation that bans the sale of shark fins nationwide. I introduced the bill, modeled after Commonwealth law, in the 114th Congress and then handed it over to Republican Ed Royce as H.R. 1456 in the 115th Congress to give it a better chance of success. But even though we now have 259 cosponsors, more than enough votes for passage, the Republican leadership in the House refuses to move the bill. I think that will change, once the new Democratic House gets started. Rep. Huffman said the people of the Marianas “should be proud that they had the foresight and the political will to protect shark population in the waters of the Marianas.” Huffman, a former member of the California Assembly, co-authored legislation there that banned the sale, trade, and possession of shark fins in California. He is also an original co-sponsor of H.R. 1456. The bill bans the commercial sale of shark fins, but protects noncommercial subsistence use. 

Rep. Huffman and I are also both interested in keeping the Magnuson Act strong, protecting fish stocks from overuse. And we share a concern about climate change. Jared represents areas of California that were hard hit by wildfires over the last years. The Marianas, of course, are just beginning to recover from typhoons Mangkhut and Yutu. The accelerated intensification of Yutu and of Hurricane Michael that hit Florida last month happens because the ocean is warmer and storms rapidly pick up energy as they pass over those waters. Huffman pledged to work together with me to “address the significant impacts of climate change on ocean ecosystems and coastal and island communities.

 

$475k for coral reef conservation

The CNMI Bureau of Environmental and Coastal Quality is getting $475,000 under the FY17-18 Coral Reef Conservation Agreement, NOAA announced this week. Congress provides the funding to NOAA for this program to help with protecting coral reefs against the harmful impacts of global warming, ocean acidification, degradation of water quality, and other changes in the marine environment. The Commonwealth will also benefit from a $335,000 grant to the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council for their work assessing and managing coral reef system fisheries. Congratulations to BECQ.

Americans Deserve Action


￼
Shooting in Thousand Oaks   Our nation awoke to news on Thursday of a mass shooting of staggering tragedy and heartbreak.  It is particularly wrenching that this attack was carried out at a bar hosting a college night, targeting innocent young people enjoying an evening of music and community. 
We are all humbled and grateful for the swift response of law enforcement and first responders, and we are heartbroken by the loss of Sheriff’s Sgt. Ron Helus, a 29-year veteran of the force.  His courage represents the best of America, and his heroism is a blessing to our country. 
The American people deserve real action to end the daily epidemic of gun violence that is stealing the lives of our children on campuses, in places of worship and on our streets.  House Democrats will fight to pass bipartisan, commonsense solutions to prevent gun violence in communities across the country. 
May it bring some measure of comfort to all who have been hurt or have lost loved ones that so many grieve and pray with them during this time.

Congresswoman Pelosi held a press conference in the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. 
Firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions  This week, President Trump bragged that he could destroy the Special Counsel investigation any time he wanted.  The President is now making good on that boast with the firing of Attorney General Sessions and the appointment of a partisan Acting Attorney General who has publicly advocated for the curtailment of the Russia investigation.  Acting Attorney General Whitaker must be recused from any involvement from the Russia investigation, and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein should be allowed to continue to oversee the investigation, unhindered. 
There is bicameral legislation to protect Special Counsel Mueller and preserve the documents of the investigation, which has passed in a bipartisan manner in the Senate Judiciary Committee.  House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jerry Nadler and House Democrats have introduced an identical bill in the House. 
The President’s threat of firing Mueller or Rosenstein is extremely dangerous and discouraging, and must be addressed with highest level of seriousness and purpose.  What is encouraging, though, is the public’s commitment to protecting the Constitution and their opposition to the President’s interference in the Special Counsel investigation.

My office recently assisted a Section 8 Project-Based Voucher recipient who was experiencing an issue in her apartment operated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). She had contacted our office because her housing unit had serious habitability issues that included mold, raw sewage, asbestos, dust, and debris, which had caused her to become sick. She had requested to move to another unit but did not receive any response from her landlord or property management. Therefore, our office contacted HUD on her behalf and conveyed the details of her situation. As a result, the property owner and management were notified, and she was offered relocation to two available units.

November 9, 2018 
WEEK IN REVIEW 
To start off this week's From the Front... I would like to thank the Schmidt family from Fort Smith and all the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nation’s capital. Safe travels back to the Natural State. 
Our district work period continued this week. 
￼
I joined The Boys Shelter to celebrate the organization’s 40th anniversary. It was a pleasure to spend time with foster families and advocates to talk about the importance of helping children in need. Every child deserves to grow up in a healthy, safe, and loving home. Whether it’s a family or a shelter, committed members of our district are lending a helping hand. Together, we will work to ensure that every child has a chance at the full and healthy future they deserve. The dedication of The Boys Shelter and families throughout our state to helping and providing safe havens to Arkansas’s children truly enriches our community. 
￼
On Tuesday, I spoke to law enforcement officers, workplace security personnel, school officials, mental health professionals, and other public safety leaders who were receiving threat assessment and risk management training. The National Threat Assessment Center, which is part of the U.S. Secret Service, led the conference and shared their expertise on how stakeholders can prevent and identify targeted violence risks. Safety, security, and preparedness are issues important to Arkansans and all Americans. It is necessary to ensure that people in our community have the tools needed to assess security vulnerabilities, identify and implement the most effective safeguards, and support our first responders to the greatest extent possible. A special thank you to the NTAC, Secret Service, and Walmart for organizing this important training.
￼
Leadership is vital to all aspects of life. I spoke to representatives from Arvest Bank about the importance of being a leader who guides, inspires, and motivates their team. I shared my experiences as a platoon leader and the skills that were important to delivering results. I was the man responsible for my unit, and it was critical that my soldiers knew they could rely on me. Whether it’s a business decision, moving legislation or executing a military operation, leaderships skills are essential to success
￼
I then headed over to Cross Church for its weekly summit event, which brings together Northwest Arkansan business leaders, professionals, and entrepreneurs to hear stories and insights from community members. I had the privilege of interviewing two amazing WWII veterans. Pat Patterson and Chuck Hurl of Bella Vista shared their wartime experiences. It's remarkable to hear about the bravery and courage of the Greatest Generation firsthand. They lived through a time when democracy was at threat and the future was uncertain. They fought back, and we owe our freedom to their service. God bless our veterans. Read more about the event here: link. 
￼
As many of you know, I am the Chairman of the United States Military Academy (USMA) Board of Visitors (BOV). Today, I am at West Point for a BOV meeting to discuss institutional objectives and issues of note. The USMA BOV is charged with inquiring into the morale and discipline, curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal affairs, academic methods, and other matters relating to the academy that the board decides to consider. It’s truly a privilege to serve as a voice in guiding this exemplary institution.
I look forward to getting back to Washington next week to continue fighting for the people of Arkansas’s Third District. Remember to keep an eye on my website or check out my Twitter and Instagram pages to stay up-to-date with the latest news from the Third District and Washington. 
  

VETERANS DAY MESSAGE
Each year since 1919, our nation pauses to remember and honor the courageous men and women who have defended freedom and democracy. Throughout history, Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines have taken an oath to defend America's interests and ideals, all while establishing a legacy as the finest fighting force in the world. Our veterans embody the ideals that have made America great – valor, honor, and love of country.
I am also humbled to have had the privilege of wearing a uniform and standing with America’s best defenders. I had the honor of serving our nation and Arkansas for more than 30 years in the Arkansas Army National Guard. I have seen firsthand the selfless commitment and bravery of our fine Arkansas Guards members while deployed overseas in Sinai, Egypt. Through every challenge and conflict that has tested the fabric of our nation, the service of our military has never wavered. 
It is because of our veterans that our flag flies high and remains a sign of hope and liberty throughout the world. Our soldiers, have been – and continue to be – the greatest force for freedom and democracy ever. May we always honor the military members who have put their lives on the line, or paid the ultimate sacrifice, to protect our country. To our heroes: Thank you.  
Happy Veterans Day! May God bless our veterans, those currently serving, their families, and the United States of America.  
""We remember those who were called upon to give all a person can give, and we remember those who were prepared to make that sacrifice if it were demanded of them in the line of duty, though it never was. Most of all, we remember the devotion and gallantry with which all of them ennobled their nation as they became champions of a noble cause."" – Ronald Reagan

Dear  , 
This weekend, our nation pauses to honor all those who have served our country as we celebrate Veterans Day. Like many of you, I will spend the weekend thanking all those who serve and have served in the past and remember those who gave the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our nation.

According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, eastern Connecticut is home to nearly 53,000 veterans – about one-third of all veterans in the state. I am proud to work in Connecticut and in Washington to help support our veterans – advocating for the policies and funding they need in Congress and helping to address individual constituent issues for veterans needing assistance. Every day, my Veterans Representative Manny Meneses, a thirty-one year veteran of the Navy, works to help veterans access the benefits and support they need and deserve. If you or someone you know needs help with veterans benefits or support, please reach out to Manny at my Norwich District office, (860) 886-0139. 

￼
According to the VA, eastern Connecticut has the highest concentration of veterans in our state

Centennial of the “Great War” 

This year’s celebration of the centennial of the end of World War I is particularly notable. While November 11 is known today as Veterans Day, it was originally established as “Armistice Day,” marking the end of the Great War on the ""eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month"". Connecticut played a key role in the war, helping to provide supplies and industrial production to help with the war effort. Some 67,000 Connecticut soldiers also fought on the front lines in Europe – with nearly 1,100 lost in the conflict.

In 2015, I helped Mary Knapp of Enfield secure the long overdue medals for her uncle, Private Patrick O’Brien, honoring his service in the war. Private O'Brien, who immigrated to Hartford from Ireland, was killed in action on October 6th, 1918 in Meusse-Argonne, France, after being wounded just five days earlier on October 1st. He was born in Ballyferriter, Kerry, Ireland on February 16th, 1896, and was just twenty-one years-old when he was killed in action.  

￼ 

New Support for Agent Orange Coverage

This week, I was honored that the American Legion lent its strong support to my efforts to eliminate onerous barriers to veterans seeking care for medical conditions caused by exposure to Agent Orange. As you may know, under current law and regulations, veterans must demonstrate that the symptoms of certain diseases developed within a year of exposure in order to receive the care and compensation they deserve. My bill, the Agent Orange Exposure Fairness Act (H.R. 6566), eliminates these exclusive and unfair requirements to include all servicemembers who were exposed to the pesticide, granting them access to the benefits they’re entitled to.

I introduced this bill in July 2018 after working with Gerry Wright, a Vietnam veteran from Andover, Connecticut who has traveled across the country to raise awareness of Agent Orange exposure and has gathered thousands of signatures in support of making changes to these requirements. Gerry has worked hard to build strong support for this effort, including getting a resolution passed in support of his initiative at the recent national convention of the American Legion.

Ensuring fairness for all veterans exposed to Agent Orange is not just good policy – it’s the right thing to do for those who served in harm’s way. The support of the American Legion sends a powerful message about the need for action to get veterans like Gerry Wright and so many others the long overdue care and support they deserve.

Recognition for our WWII Cadet Nurses

Roughly 180,000 women served in the United States Cadet Nurse Corps during World War II. These women addressed a critical nursing shortage on the home front and provided 80% of domestic nursing care. Read more in the New London Day about the role of cadet nurses. 

Despite the important role they played in the war effort, Congress has yet to recognize them for their service to our country. To date, the United States Cadet Nurse Corps is the only uniformed World War II group without veteran’s status. I am a co-sponsor of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps Equity Act (H.R. 1168), and I will continue to advocate for a long-overdue honorable discharge to every qualifying corps nurse. They were an integral part of the war effort and deserve the proper recognition and benefits for their service to this country.

￼ 

Thank you, as always, for taking the time to read this update. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or need assistance.

Veterans Day Ceremony
This week in the district, I had the pleasure of speaking at the Veterans Day Program at Brandon Elementary School. Veterans Day is such a significant holiday for our nation, our armed services, and all active and retired military personnel. It is essential that young students are aware of the importance of this federal holiday and the sacrifice that is made by members of our armed services.

Veterans Day serves as a reminder of the constant gratitude we owe to retired military members and the brave men and women overseas who are protecting our freedom on a daily basis. Our country relies on the courage and efforts of active and former military personnel who make it possible for all Americans to enjoy the freedoms and rights granted to us as citizens of the United States. 

Please join me in celebrating Veterans Day on November 11th by paying respects and gratitude for the service that our veterans and active military members have provided to our great country. Additionally, feel free to call into my offices on Monday, November 12th.

Review of 115th Congress
As the 115th Congress comes to an end over the next couple months, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the actions taken and progress made throughout this session. The 115th Congress made huge strides for the well-being of our citizens and nation as a whole. 

Historic legislation such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law providing millions of Americans with new job opportunities, higher wages, and hope spurred by our thriving economy. As we transition into the 116th Congress, I am eager to continue our progress and momentum to help move Wisconsin and the country in the right direction.

This Week: Granite Staters Shared their Experiences with Surprise Medical Bills

This week, I sat down with Granite Staters at Restoration Café in Manchester to hear about their experiences with surprise medical bills. 
It is unacceptable that people face massive surprise bills from medical care that they thought was covered by their insurance. Granite Staters like Josh, who spoke with me about a $3,500 bill he received for going to the hospital after cutting his finger (the hospital was in-network, but he was later told one of the doctors he saw was out-of-network). Or Donna, who saw a doctor for five minutes in the emergency room, had some X-rays taken, and received a bill for $1,648 because she also later found out the doctor she saw was out-of-network.  
￼  
Stories like theirs are why I have introduced legislation to help protect patients from these ridiculous surprise medical bills. You can read more about it here.  
This weekend, we honor the service and sacrifice of our veterans on Veterans Day. 
￼ 
Ahead of Veterans Day, I joined students at Windham High School for their National Honor Society's Veterans Day Assembly. It is so important that our young people learn about -- and appreciate -- the sacrifices made by our selfless veterans and their families. 
￼ 
I also participated in a ceremony at the NH Veterans Home to commemorate Veterans Day. Because of our veterans, our country is safer and our freedom is stronger. We owe them a debt of gratitude that we can never fully repay, but we must try. I hope you'll take a moment this weekend to thank our veterans and their families for their service and sacrifice. 
Earlier this week, President Trump removed Attorney General Sessions from office and selected Matthew Whitaker to serve as acting Attorney General and to oversee Special Counsel Mueller's investigation. I am deeply concerned with the President’s action. Neither the President nor his appointees should interfere with the Special Counsel’s investigation— which has already resulted in indictments of or guilty pleas from three companies and 32 people, including four senior leaders in the President's campaign and Administration. The investigation must be allowed to continue and to follow the facts wherever they may lead. Mr. Whitaker's comments that support defunding and restricting the Special Counsel's investigation are extremely troubling and demonstrate that he is not suited to provide neutral oversight of the investigation.
In addition, there are legitimate and serious questions being raised by bipartisan constitutional scholars about whether President Trump had the constitutional authority to appoint Mr. Whitaker to the post, given that he has not been confirmed by the Senate. There are other Senate-confirmed senior deputies at the Department of Justice -- who were nominated by President Trump -- who would be constitutionally qualified to serve as acting Attorney General. 
It is my hope that consistent with our duty to the constitution and the American people, Republicans in the Senate and House will join with us to pass bipartisan legislation to protect the Special Counsel. 
Don’t forget, open enrollment has begun. 
Even if you have already have a plan, it’s still important to shop around because plans and costs may have changed. Go to healthcare.gov now to take advantage of open enrollment from now until December 15.

Dear Friend:
Here are some of the ways in which I'm fighting hard to keep Lower Hudson Valley communities safe, healthy, and secure:  
	•	Governing Responsibly and Putting Best Interests of Americans First  
	•	Securing Posthumous Purple Heart for Family of WWI Veteran  
	•	Condemning Anti-Semitism and Standing in Solidarity with Jewish Communities  
	•	Fighting to Preserve the Integrity of the Russia Investigation 
New Democratic Majority: Governing Responsibly and Putting Best Interests of Americans First
Americans have spoken and they have empowered a Democratic House Majority to fight for the people. We are ready and prepared to take action that raises wages, lowers health care costs, and cleans up corruption. 
	•	From keeping the government open, to putting a check on the Trump Administration's actions that hurt American families, our democracy, and our standing around the world, to bolstering small businesses and investing in economic growth, House Democrats will put the best interests of all Americans first and will fight tirelessly to deliver results for the American people. 
Securing Posthumous Purple Heart for Family of WWI Veteran 
￼ 
Rep. Lowey presents a posthumous Purple Heart Certificate and Medal to the family of World War I veteran Francesco Bastone. 
As the nation prepares to mark Veterans Day and the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, it was my honor to pay tribute to a hero of the Great War by presenting a posthumous Purple Heart Certificate and Medal to the New City family of World War I veteran Francesco Bastone at a ceremony in my New City office. 
	•	The Purple Heart Certificate and Medal are a testament to Mr. Bastone's distinguished service to our country, and I know the Bastone family will be enormously proud and inspired every time they look at them and think about his service and sacrifice.  
	•	To learn more about Mr. Bastone's service to our country, click here.
Condemning Anti-Semitism and Standing in Solidarity with Jewish Communities
Along with the other Co-Chairs of the House Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism, I joined Congressman Mike Doyle (D-PA) in introducing a resolution to condemn the anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue building on October 27, 2018.  
	•	""This heinous attack, which took the lives of 11 innocent people, simply because they were Jewish, was a horrible reminder that this age-old bigotry is alive in the 21st century,"" we wrote in a statement upon introducing the resolution.  
	•	Click here to read the full statement from the House Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism.
Fighting to Preserve the Integrity of the Russia Investigation 
￼ 
Rep. Lowey, in White Plains, denounces the President's firing of former AG Jeff Sessions and pledges to protect the Special Counsel investigation. 
I joined elected officials and community members this week in White Plains to speak out against the President's firing of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions: 
	•	Democrats will not stand by while Special Counsel Mueller's investigation is tarnished by back-door dealings and cover-ups from President Trump and his administration.  
	•	The President didn't even wait 24 hours after the election before announcing Attorney General Sessions' resignation. We know that move is an attack on the sanctity of the Mueller investigation.  
	•	We won't allow that to happen. We will preserve the integrity of the Mueller investigation and make sure we get to the bottom of President Trump's ties to Russia and the security of our elections. The American people deserve no less.

Friends, 
I would like to thank each and every one of you for your support this election. I am humbled to have your trust in representing the Big First. 
This Congress has made landmark steps toward reviving American industries by slashing harmful government regulations that were once suffocating Kansan businesses, and unleashed our economy by modernizing our tax code so American consumers have more money in their pockets. I congratulate our new freshman legislators, and I look forward to working with them across the aisle. 
In other news, nonfarm payroll employment rose by 250,000 jobs in October, smashing economists' expectations once again. This makes for the longest consecutive streak of positive monthly job numbers in American history. With monthly job gains averaging 213,000 per month, the economy has added 4.5 million jobs since November 2016. These employment gains are widespread, as we see over 40,000 jobs created in the hospitality, education, and health service sectors. Manufacturing and construction services also grew by 32,000 and 30,000 jobs respectively. According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, American workers are being pulled off of the sidelines and unemployment across all demographics is at a record low.

Trade with Cuba
With net farm income resting at a 12-year low, it is imperative that the United States seek new export outlets for American agriculture. With one of these new markets just 90 miles offshore. Cuba, with its population of 11 million people, imports $2 billion of agricultural products each year from faraway producers in Vietnam, China, and the European Union. This could present a huge opportunity for the United States.

Veterans Small
Business Week
On Thursday, the Kansas Small Business Development Center (SBDC), in collaboration with the Veterans Business Resource Center and the U.S. Small Business Administration, hosted a networking event in Manhattan for military veterans who double as small business owners. Veterans pitched their entrepreneurial ideas each other and developed closer business relationships. I would like to thank the organizations responsible for organizing such an event. With over 22,963 veteran owned small businesses in Kansas alone, I am proud to see our country giving back to those who risked it all.

November 9, 2018 
Dear friend,  This week the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) postponed amending the Bay Delta Water Quality Control Plan until December 12. Thanks to our collective efforts – from the federal, state and local level – we continue fighting against Sacramento to halt their dangerous water grab. The delay will allow all parties to work towards a compromise that keeps Stanislaus and San Joaquin County water right here, with the people who paid for it.  Over the last month, I have rallied tremendous support from Administration officials around our fight for Valley water. Last week, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler sent a letter to the SWRCB expressing concern over several aspects of the proposed Bay-Delta plan and questioned the effectiveness of unimpaired flows on improving native fish species when studies show that several additional factors contribute to their dwindling populations. In October, President Trump signed a presidential memorandum to bring more storage to the Valley and address hydroelectric relicensing at Don Pedro – requiring agencies to consider local plans like the Tuolumne River Management Plan developed by Modesto and Turlock Irrigation Districts – and he signed into law my New WATER Act as part of America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (WRDA), authorizing financing of new water storage projects. My fight for Central Valley water will continue until we have the storage and infrastructure our farmers and neighbors need to thrive. Learn more at Denham.house.gov/water.  Continuing the fight for water storage Today I, along with Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and many in the California Delegation, sent a letter to the Bureau of Reclamation requesting federal funding for water storage projects in California. Specifically, we are requesting funding for Sites, Los Vaqueros, Temperance Flat, raising Shasta, and repairing the Friant-Kern Canal. All these are integral parts of the Central Valley project – critical to both storing water and moving it across the Valley. These projects have been studied for decades but with no action taken to get them done. Now, we are finally getting things moving to actually bring more storage to the Valley. My priority in Congress remains delivering more water storage and I look forward to Reclamation’s response.  In honor of Veterans Day, in case you missed it: Local vets honored by Library of Congress, 21 new Veterans History Project videos submitted I recently hosted a reception at the Manteca VFW Hall to honor the 32 veterans who shared their stories of service as part of the Library of Congress Veterans History Project. Karen Lloyd, director of the Veterans History Project for the Library of Congress, was present to accept the most recent installment of 21 videos and meet the Central Valley veterans featured in them. As a veteran myself, it’s been an honor sitting down to hear these stories from local men and women who have worn the cloth of this nation. This event was about saying “thank you.” To view all of my #TVT tributes, click here. For photos from the event, click here.

In This Edition 
Tuesday’s election was historic—particularly for women and minorities—as Native Americans, Muslim Americans, and members of the LGBTQ community won congressional races and governorships across the country. It is a tremendous honor to continue to serve California and the 47th District, and I look forward to representing the district again for the next two years.
This week, I joined 77 of my congressional colleagues to oppose a rule proposed by the Trump Administration that would undermine the Flores Settlement. This 1997 settlement ensures that children apprehended at the border are treated humanely and released from detention without unnecessary delay.
It was an honor to attend the annual Award of Valor Luncheon in Lakewood this week, which honored the city’s sheriff’s deputies, firefighters, paramedics, and public safety volunteers for their service.  
In this edition of Alan’s Inbox, see my response to constituents who have contacted me to express their support for the 3D Printed Gun Safety Act.  
In Congress U this week, I talk about “congressional sessions.” The 116th Congress is scheduled to begin on January 3rd, 2019.  
Lastly, don’t forget to take this week’s poll in the right-hand column.

Looking ahead to the 116th Congress 
The 116th Congress, which will be sworn in this January, is set to be a historic one marked by many firsts--particularly for women and minorities. New Members of Congress include Native Americans, Muslim Americans, and members of the LGBTQ community. In fact, more women will serve in Congress beginning next year than ever before.  It is heartening to know that come January, more of those elected to lead our great nation will look, speak, and worship like so many of the Americans who have long felt overlooked. 
It is a tremendous honor to serve California and the 47th District, and I look forward to representing the district again for the next two years. The American people sent a clear message at the ballot box on Tuesday, and now it is time to roll up our sleeves. We have a lot of work to do.
Defending Immigrant Children and the Flores Settlement  
This week, I joined 77 of my congressional colleagues in submitting a comment in response to a rule proposed by the Trump Administration, which would undermine the 1997 Flores Settlement. This settlement, which resulted from more than a decade of litigation, ensures that children apprehended at the border are treated humanely and released from detention without unnecessary delay. The Trump Administration’s proposal would effectively gut the Flores Settlement by eliminating crucial protections for children in detention and permit the U.S. government to detain children indefinitely. 
  
￼ 
Attending the Award of Valor Luncheon in Lakewood 
It was an honor to attend the Award of Valor luncheon in Lakewood this week. Each year, this event brings together over 400 people, including public safety professionals and volunteers, civic and business leaders, and local residents. The event is one of Lakewood’s ways of saying thank you to the sheriff’s deputies, firefighters, paramedics, and other public safety officers for their heroism and outstanding service to the community. I am proud to represent a district that is home to so many outstanding public servants, first responders, and volunteers!  
  
￼ 
Each week hundreds of constituents contact my office to share their views on a variety of topics. I have recently received many messages from constituents expressing their support for the 3D Printed Gun Safety Act. Below is a portion of my response to those messages:  
“This bill would prohibit the publication of 3D printer plans for the printing of firearms.  I am concerned with the potential for harm that could result from the publication of these instructions.  Unlike standard firearms, 3D printable guns are mostly made of plastic and cannot be detected by metal-detectors.  Further, unlike store-bought firearms that require background checks, these homemade firearms are untraceable, and do not require the serial numbers that allow law enforcement to trace ownership.  For these reasons, I am a cosponsor of this bill.  
Releasing the instructions for firearms online would provide individuals who may not pass a background-check the ability to obtain a firearm without any regulation.  In an era in which mass shootings have become all too common, I believe that releasing these instructions poses a serious threat to our national security and oppose their publication online. 
In July of 2018, I joined my congressional colleagues in sending a letter to the Chairmen of the Judiciary and Foreign Affairs Committees requesting a hearing on the settlement between Defense Distributed and the Departments of Justice and State.  
As a member of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, I believe that Congress must pass bipartisan, comprehensive, and evidence-based legislation to deal with the recent tragedies of gun violence in our country.  The safety and well-being of my constituents is my top priority.  I believe that common-sense reforms to regulate the sale of such firearms are necessary to protect the public and our children.” 
  
If you have written in to me, please continue to do so. If you have not, I encourage you to share your views and concerns with me, as it is the best way for me to find out which issues you care most about.   You can find out how to contact me on my website by clicking here.

Congressional Sessions 
A Congressional session is the period during which Congress assembles and carries on its regular business. Each Congress has two regular sessions, based on the constitutional mandate that Congress assemble at least once each year.
The current Congress, the 115th, began its First Session in January of 2017. The Second Session began on January 8th, 2018. The 116th congress is scheduled to begin on January 3rd, 2019. 
In addition to regular session, the Constitution gives the president the authority to recall Congress for special sessions. A Special Session of Congress may be convened after that Congress has already adjourned for the close of either the first or the second regular session, but before the next session begins. Typically, this is done in an emergency situation. Since the first Congress met in 1789, 27 special sessions have been held. The most recent was called by President Harry Truman in 1948.

Veterans Honor Flight in May
 
Dear Friends,
 
Veterans Day is on Sunday, November 11, and it is a day to thank and honor the brave men and women who have served in the United States armed forces. I hope you will take a moment to acknowledge military veterans in your community for their dedication to protecting our national security and values. Over the past year, I have met with veterans in Washington and across Minnesota and I will highlight some of those great meetings here. This week, I am also honored to have been reelected to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. I look forward to representing the values of everyone in western Minnesota during the 116th Congress.
 
Sincerely,
￼ Congressman Collin C. Peterson
Minnesota 7th District
 
Meeting with Veterans in 2018
￼
Top Row: St. Paul Army Corps of Engineers, World War II veterans Henry Tweten and Bernie Lieder, David Kivisto’s (DASSEL) appointment to the Air Force Academy 
Middle: Sioux Falls Veterans Town Hall
Bottom: Minnesota Veterans of Foreign Wars, American Legion
 
I have met with many veterans organizations this year to stay up to date on the important issues affecting our nation’s servicemembers and veterans. This Congress, I have supported legislation to ensure our veterans have access to quality health care including the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, the CARE for All Veterans Act and the Improving Oversight of Women Veterans’ Care Act. Local officials and I have been working to secure federal funding for new veterans homes in Montevideo and Bemidji, and I will continue to monitor those projects until they are completed. Our veterans have sacrificed a great deal in the service of this country, and I am proud to advocate for them in Washington. 
 
￼
 
This year, my office joined as a Commemorative Partner to the Vietnam War 50th Commemoration, a Congressional initiative meant to thank our Vietnam veterans. Vietnam veterans fought in some of the worst conditions imaginable, but many were not welcomed home in the manner they deserved. Minnesota has 125,800 Vietnam Era veterans that need to be properly honored for their service. As a symbol of appreciation, I have been presenting special Vietnam Commemoration Pins to Vietnam veterans who served on active duty between 1955 and 1975.
 
￼
Mr. Kermit Paananen (OLIVIA)
 
I was honored to send Kermit a Vietnam Commemorative Lapel Pin and letter to honor his sacrifice and service during the Vietnam War. Kermit was presented this special Pin at his retirement party after 34 years of military and civilian service. I was glad to send this special recognition to him and I wish Kermit the best in his retirement.
 
Blue Ribbon School Awards
￼
Top Row: Principal Nathaniel Messick and Heidi Benson (Fertile-Beltrami Elementary School) / Superintendent Ryan Nielsen, Marylee Glese, Principal Ryan Arndt (Canby Elementary School)
Middle Row: Jody Weis, Melanie Rudeen and Principal David Hansen (Buffalo Lake-Hector-Stewart Elementary School) / Principal Phil Goetstouwers (Red Rock Central School)
 
Representatives of the 7th District’s 2018 Blue Ribbon Schools were in Washington this week to accept their awards. The prestigious distinction recognizes public and private elementary, middle, and high schools for their overall academic performance and progress in closing achievement gaps among students. I sincerely thank each school for investing in student development and productive school environments.
 
Livestock Hauling Petition
I recently led a bipartisan letter with Representatives Ted Yoho (R-FL) and Roger Marshall (R-KS) to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) in support of a petition to waive livestock haulers from certain provisions of Hours of Service (HOS) rules. The letter, which was signed by 57 of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, requests increased driving hours for livestock haulers in exchange for additional training designed by FMCSA. Current hours of service regulations do not accommodate the unique needs of livestock haulers, and I’m confident that this petition will allow them to deliver agricultural products to market more effectively while maintaining their proven record of safety. 
 
Farm to Table Dinner in Crookston
￼
 
The University of Minnesota Crookston (UMC) invited members of my staff to experience a Farm to Table dinner. The experience began with a student horse show at the Equestrian Center and then a dinner featuring foods grown by University of Minnesota students, alumni and friends. This inaugural Farm to Table dinner featured local ingredients prepared by talented chefs and was served with wine from Fantesca Estate and Winery, which is owned by Duane and Susan Hoff. Duane is the son of longtime Crookston residents and UMC faculty Dave and Irene Hoff. 
 
The different courses of dinner were highlighted by several students talking about their UMC experiences. Currently, UMC delivers 35 bachelor’s degrees, 22 minors, and 40 areas of emphasis on campus as well as 16 online degrees.
 
Grow Our Own Summit in Marshall
￼
 
My staff aide Jacki Anderson joined the Southwest Initiative Foundation at their Grow Our Own Summit in Marshall. Speakers from around the country talked with leaders in southwest Minnesota about disparities among youth and what we could do to give our children a better start in life. We know that family, geography and community dynamics directly impact a child’s potential for success. I will continue to work with local organizations and do everything I can at the federal level to create more opportunities that help our kids succeed.
 
UMC Campus Advisory and Advancement Board Meeting
￼
 
The University of Minnesota Crookston (UMC) Campus Advisory and Advancement Board met new members and heard a campus report from Chancellor Mary Holz-Clause this week. There were several other presentations including federal and state legislative updates and a report on UMC’s delivery of online programs. UMC was one of the first campuses in Minnesota to give students laptops and online programs. 
 
Retirement Plan and IRA Contribution Limits Increase for 2019
￼
 
Each year, cost-of-living adjustments are made to contribution limits for 401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts. For 2019, the 401(k) contribution increases to $19,000, and the IRA limit increases to $6,000.

This Week in American History

The Kensington rune stone
 
On November 8, 1898, the Kensington rune stone was discovered on Olof Ohman's farm, near Alexandria. The stone tells of a group of Vikings who traveled to Minnesota in 1362, but its authenticity has long been the subject of debate.
 
The English translation of the stone’s text is as follows:
 
“Eight Goths (Swedes) and twenty-two Norwegians upon 
a journey of discovery from Vinland westward. We had a 
camp by two skerries one day's journey north from this stone. 
We were out fishing one day. When we returned home we 
found ten men red with blood and dead. A V M (Ave, Virgo 
Maria), save us from evil. 
 
(We) have ten men by the sea to look after our vessel four- 
teen days' journey from this island. Year 
1362.''
 
What’s the Story?
￼
 
In 2005, I performed for American servicemembers with my band The Second Amendments during a congressional delegation tour across Europe and the Middle East. The band was made up of a bipartisan group of my fellow Congressmen and we were happy to show our support for our troops at military bases in Germany, Kuwait, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan. I have the shirt shown above hung in my Washington, D.C. office to commemorate the tour.

Dear Lindsey,  
Safeguarding Our Elections 
Like so many Americans, I am deeply concerned by the firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and what this means for the future of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections. President Trump’s pick for acting Attorney General, Matthew Whitaker, has indicated in past statements that he does not support Mueller’s probe, and therefore he must immediately recuse himself from overseeing it. It’s critical that the new Attorney General understand the importance of this investigation, so we can get to the bottom of what happened in 2016 and help safeguard future elections and our democratic process. This is not a partisan issue, and Democrats and Republicans must come together and push for legislation that will protect this investigation and the institutions we hold dear. 
Reducing Gun Violence 
I was devastated by the shooting at the Borderline Bar in California late Wednesday night. I extend my deepest sympathies to the family and friends of the 12 people killed in this senseless attack, among them a sheriff’s deputy, and I thank the first responders for bravely stepping in to help protect others from harm. It’s imperative that Congress take action and pass commonsense gun safety legislation that will keep our communities safe and work to increase access to mental health treatment and resources for people who are struggling.   
Birth Control is a Fundamental Right 
The Trump administration’s ruling this week that lets some employers deny insurance coverage of birth control is unacceptable. Birth control is basic healthcare and a fundamental right for women and their families and making it harder to access is a threat to women’s health and economic security. I will continue to stand against these partisan attacks on women’s rights and fight for contraceptive coverage. 
Here to Serve You  
As your Representative, my most important job is supporting Granite Staters when they need help with federal agencies. I was contacted by George Sackley of Windham, who had an issue of concern regarding his Social Security benefits. My staff worked with the Social Security Administration and helped resolve George’s concern. If my office may be of assistance with a problem you are experiencing, please reach out to my staff at 603-226-1002 so we can learn how we may help. 
Making Your Voice Heard 
I encourage you to make your voice heard on the issues that are important to you. If you have a question, comment or concern, please don’t hesitate to reach out to any of my offices—I love hearing from you! Thank you as always for the wonderful contributions you make to our great state, and I hope you enjoy your weekend!

Long’s Short Report – Giving veterans the attention they deserve
By: Rep. Billy Long
Before I was elected to Congress, I co-hosted a morning talk show on KWTO in Springfield, Missouri. We had a frequent caller named Ruth who enjoyed telling us stories of her time serving our country during WWII. Ruth was always upbeat, friendly and one of my favorite callers to listen to. Each time she called it reminded me again of the sacrifices made by our veterans.
This Veterans Day is yet another reminder of those sacrifices made by the men and women who served in our military. President Trump ran on the promise of ensuring our veterans have the skills and resources they need before returning to the workforce. During the 115th Congress, my colleagues and I have worked hard to make sure this promise becomes a reality. Over the past two years, President Trump has signed several bills into law that addresses this issue ranging from ensuring veterans never lose their G.I. benefits to offering career-related programs that allow them to use their benefits for on-the-job training and apprenticeships.
Some of those bills include the Forever G.I. Bill, the VALOR Act and the HIRE Vets Act. Both the VALOR Act and HIRE Vets Act target businesses by incentivizing them to increase and continue their outreach recruiting, hiring and training veterans. The Forever G.I. Bill, on the other hand, provides veterans with additional resources through the G.I. Bill.
Previously, the G.I. Bill expired after 10 years, leaving some veterans behind who wanted to go to college. The Forever G.I. Bill finally allows veterans to use their G.I. benefits at any point during their lifetime as well as their spouses and dependents. This bill also expands the benefits of the G.I. Bill to cover distant learning courses and technical and career educational schools. It also increases funding for veterans working towards careers in the science, technology, engineering and math fields.
Similar to the Forever G.I. Bill, both the VALOR Act and the HIRE Vets Act aim to help veterans in the workforce, but target businesses instead. Both of these bills eliminate unnecessary paperwork for businesses and offer incentives to companies who recruit, hire and train veterans. Under the previous system, businesses were required to fill out excessive paperwork, which in turn discouraged many companies from even offering apprenticeships to veterans. Now, thanks to these bills, businesses will be more encouraged to participate, which will lead to veterans being represented in more industries.
These three bills are just a glimpse of the hard work Congress has done to ensure our veterans are taken care of after they return home. The skills these men and women learn while serving are invaluable and should not be overlooked. We need to continue to ensure they have the resources they need to make the transition into civilian life as easy as possible.

Honoring Our Veterans 
￼ 
This upcoming weekend, we observe Veterans Day in honor of the brave men and women who serve to defend our liberty. Thank you to the veterans and their families who sacrifice their lives to protect our freedoms. 
My office has helped over 400 veterans settle disputes or receive benefits from the Veterans Administration, retrieve earned medals or service records, and more. If you or a loved one is a veteran that requires assistance, please contact my office. Find more information here. 
Deadline Approaching 
￼ 
The deadline for Military Academy Nominations is November 14. If you are a student interested in a congressional nomination to one of the Military Service Academies, be sure to complete your nomination application before the deadline. You can find more information about the process here. If you have questions, please contact my Yakima Office at (509) 452-3243.  
As a Member of Congress, I have the privilege of nominating students to the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy, and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. The application process is rigorous, and I have been extremely impressed by the academic, extracurricular, and leadership accomplishments of previous nominees from Central Washington. I encourage students interested in serving our country to get in their applications as soon as possible. 
Momentum in the Face of Challenge 
￼ 
I had the honor of speaking at the Columbia Basin Development League Annual Conference in Moses Lake. The theme of the conference, ""The Columbia Basin Project: Momentum in the Face of Challenge,"" provided an excellent opportunity to discuss the necessity for progress on the Odessa Ground Water Replacement Program and other critical water infrastructure in Central Washington. I have been working hard with the Administration and my colleagues in Congress to advocate for federal investments in water resources in the Yakima Valley and Columbia Basin.  
Progress on H-2A Modernization 
This week, the Department of Labor proposed rulemaking that would significantly improve the H-2A agriculture guest worker program for employers. The rule would allow employers seeking temporary workers to post employment opportunities online, rather than costly newspaper ads with limited reach. The Trump Administration has remained committed to modernizing the H-2A program and make it more workable for farmers. This change was long overdue, and I applaud this positive step to streamline regulations and modernize the H-2A program to ease burdens on small farm operations struggling with scarce labor. Click here to read more. 
More Visitors, More Jobs 
￼ 
I participated in an exciting groundbreaking for a new Courtyard by Marriott at Tri-Cities Airport Business Park. The addition of 99 hotel rooms will bring more jobs and allow our region to welcome more visitors to boost local businesses and tourism. Tri-Cities tourism supports more than 6,100 jobs and $444 million in visitor spending annually. Our area has been put on the map as a prime destination for visitors who want to taste the finest wine produced anywhere and enjoy the beautiful Mid-Columbia. This new project is another sign of a thriving economy. Strong hiring, low unemployment, and rising incomes are giving a boost to American workers, families, and companies - and businesses right here in Central Washington are sharing in that success.
Better Off Now 
￼ 
The October jobs report demonstrates continued economic success nation-wide. The economy added 250,000 jobs, and low unemployment rates continue. On top of that, average hourly earnings increased by 3.1%. When Congress passed the historic tax reform bill last December, we promised more jobs, higher wages, and more money in taxpayers' pockets. I am pleased to see these promises fulfilled. Read more on CNBC.  
Thank you for reading this e-news update. It is an honor and privilege to represent you in Congress. 
Sincerely, ￼  Dan Newhouse Member of Congress 
DEADLINE APPROACHING 
The deadline for Military Academy Nominations is November 14.

We Pause to Remember Veterans New Jersey Takes the Lead to End Homelessness Among Veterans Salute: Leon Xie and Natalia Luzuriaga, winners of the 2018 Congressional App Challenge   
We Pause to Remember Veterans 
For almost 100 years, since the end of World War I, our nation has taken pause to honor our veterans and their families for their service and sacrifice to keep the United States free.
Over this weekend, at gatherings in schools, churches, clubs and American Legions, VFW and other veteran service organizations, millions of Americas will stand to pay tribute to the 20 million veterans living among us.
As a Vietnam Veteran myself, I have been honored to participate in such tributes, across New Jersey’s 11 Congressional District, as they are a powerful reminder of how our nation’s liberty has been preserved by the dedication of those men and women who have worn our nation’s uniform.
It is also important to remember, tens of thousands of members of the active military, Guard and Reserves – all volunteers – are currently deployed in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and around the world.  Many have already served multiple deployments.
Of course, for many veterans who have survived engagement with the enemy, their war is not over.  Their silent battle against pain and injury speaks of the heavy burden that is borne by those who stood ready to sacrifice in defense of liberty. 
So let us all take a moment this weekend to pause and thank our veterans and remember them!
 
Taking the Lead to End Homelessness Among Veterans 
Recently, the Wall Street Journal reported the number of homeless veterans fell to approximately 38,000 representing a 5.3% decline from last year and a 50% reduction from the 73,367 homeless veterans tallied in 2009.
While we clearly have more work to do to end the scourge of homelessness among our men and women who served, this report demonstrates that the dedicated effort of Congress, the federal government, and local partners like Community Hope in Parsippany, is working.
In New Jersey, I was pleased to help lead the effort to develop the ‘first of its kind’ HUD-VASH (Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing) housing community for homeless veterans on the Lyons VA Medical Campus, known as Valley Brook Village. Officially opening its doors in October 2013, this three building, 62 unit housing facility provides permanent housing funded through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) paired with case management and clinical service provided to at-risk veterans through the VA. This combination of services and permanent housing has allowed veterans to establish independence in their new homes.
Through my role on the House Committee on Appropriations, I was able to direct critical resources to support Community Hope during the planning and construction of Valley Brook Village. Today, as Chairman, I have worked to increase funding for the program so the successes of Valley Brook Village can be reproduced across the country. In fact, my Appropriations Committee has increased funding to this program, year after year, to support more than 90,000 VASH vouchers across the country!
Because of the tremendous successes of Phase I, Community Hope has been planning an expansion of Valley Brook Village. Similar to Phase I, I was pleased to again support this effort ensuring the necessary resources where provided. In August 2018 Community Hope broke ground on Phase II.  Expected to be completed in the fall of 2019, this expansion will provide an additional 50 new units of housing for homeless veterans. The veterans who will live in the new units will also be supported by HUD-VASH vouchers funded by my Committee.
We owe our men and women veterans everything for their service and sacrifice! And yet, homelessness among veterans is still persistent across America.  I commend Community Hope and other local organizations and elected officials for supporting this project. These efforts, to create and grow Valley Brook Village, are paramount to the overall reduction in homelessness amongst veterans in New Jersey and across the nation.  
I would encourage you to watch the video “Welcome Home to Valley Brook Village”detailing the creation of Valley Brook Village here. 
 
Salute: Leon Xie and Natalia Luzuriaga, winners of the 2018 Congressional App Challenge 
Congratulations are in order for Leon Xie of Mountain Lakes High School and Natalia Luzuriaga of the Morris County School of Technology who won the 2018 Congressional App Challenge. Their app, “sPeach,” assists hearing impaired individuals and English language learners with pronunciation. You can watch a demonstration of their app here.
I have been highly impressed by the STEM education expertise displayed by almost 40 students of New Jersey’s 11th Congressional District who made a submission. Examining their entries, and the winning app, “sPeach,” one can only come away with renewed confidence that the future is bright for American technology innovation through the developments made by our students!
More information about the competition can be found here.

Dear Friend, 
This week, I celebrated the change to come to “the People’s House,” the U.S. House of Representatives, when the new Congress convenes in January. I also expressed concern about the integrity of justice with the leadership of the U.S. Department of Justice in flux and the Special Counsel’s probe of Russian interference in jeopardy, reminded constituents that open enrollment for 2019 HealthCare.gov plans has begun and ends December 15, called for an end to unnecessary military deployments at the border to thwart innocent asylum seekers, suggested a way to get to the bottom of journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder, expressed concern about the President’s renewed attacks on the press, planned to commemorate Sunday’s Armistice Day anniversary and Monday’s Veterans Day, planned to hold a November “Congress On Your Corner,” offered constituents U.S. Capitol Historical Society calendars and suggested a health tip about diabetes. Keep reading to learn more about my week and follow me on Twitter and Facebook to see more updates as they happen.   
Celebrating Change for “The People’s House”  Protecting the Integrity of Justice  Flagging Open Enrollment Now Available at HealthCare.gov  Calling for an End to Military Deployment at the Border Getting to the Bottom of the Khashoggi Murder  Again Expressing Concern about the President’s Attacks on the Press   Celebrating Veterans Day on Sunday and Monday  Appearing on MSNBC About the New Congress  Holding My Next “Congress On Your Corner”  Offering U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars  Signing Up for “Congress On Your Corner” and this e-Newsletter  Weekly Health Tip  Quote of the Week  


Celebrating Change for “The People’s House” 
￼ 
On Tuesday, the people spoke with their votes and changed the House of Representatives for the 116th Congress that gets under way in January. It will once again be what the Founders intended it to be, “the People’s House,” and no longer “the House of Trump.” This puts Congress in a good place to begin addressing the people’s needs long sidelined by gridlock, such as improvements to the Affordable Care Act and protecting people with pre-existing conditions, protections for safety net programs, protection for the integrity of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of the 2016 elections, protecting voting rights by updating and strengthening the Voting Rights Act, and oversight of the suspicious patterns of corruption we’ve seen but were powerless to investigate in this Congress. I look forward to playing an active role in that oversight as a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee. As a senior member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I am hopeful that we can work in a bipartisan way to improve our crumbling highways, bridges, pipelines, transit systems and rail lines while creating jobs. 
Protecting the Integrity of Justice 
￼ 
On Wednesday, President Trump fired U.S. Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III and replaced him with loyalist Matthew Whitaker, who has been publicly skeptical of the ongoing investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 elections undertaken by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Not only was Whitaker an anti-Mueller, anti-Clinton political commentator on CNN after a failed bid for the U.S. Senate from Iowa, but worked for a now defunct patent marketing firm that the Federal Trade Commission accused of running a scam that bilked thousands of consumers out of millions of dollars, and the firm was ultimately forced to pay a more than $25 million fine.  The only reason he was selected is that he will be a hatchet man, employing an open, notorious and blatant effort to stifle and control the Mueller investigation and have its final report shielded from the public.The predictable but perilous Constitutional crisis requires Congress to step up and protect Mueller’s probe by passing the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act (H.R. 5476) that I have cosponsored. Congress must act.I will attend a rally to protect Mueller’s probe at the downtown Federal Building on Saturday, beginning at noon.    
Flagging Open Enrollment Now Available at HealthCare.gov 
￼ 
Open enrollment for 2019 HealthCare.gov insurance plans is now under way. This year, open enrollment runs only through December 15. I will be making use of every possible means to make my constituents aware that the time available to sign up has been limited again this year compared to the enrollment periods during the Obama Administration -- six weeks shorter than it was in 2016. For more information on signing up for health care, see Healthcare.gov.     
Calling for an End to Military Deployment at the Border 
Sending thousands of military troops to the border to protect against a so-called “invasion” -- a political stunt meant to scare the Trump base ahead of the midterms – was inappropriate and wastes taxpayers’ money. I joined my colleagues in sending a letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis expressing my opposition to sending additional troops. The troops should be called back and the migrants seeking asylum should go through the routine legal vetting procedures without unnecessary drama.  
Getting to the Bottom of the Khashoggi Murder 
￼ 
As I told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, I think the bipartisan Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as the Helsinki Commission, on which I serve, should look into credible allegations from Turkey that the journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in Istanbul by Saudi Arabian agents. I will be pursuing this in the days ahead. This grisly affair has deep repercussions for U.S.- Saudi relations and the stability of the region. 
Again Expressing Concern about the President’s Attacks on the Press 
￼ 
CNN’s reporter Jim Acosta routinely asks hard questions of the current President, as he did the previous President  and other elected officials, because he represents the Fourth Estate and is obliged to inform the public. When he did so at Wednesday’s presidential news conference, the White House decision, for the second time this year, was to curtail CNN’s access to White House officials, breaching First Amendment rights. The press is not “the enemy of the people,” and the public knows it, but the President continues to say it is. Such behavior is both dangerous and un-American and should be condemned.  
Celebrating Veterans Day on Sunday and Monday 
￼ 
Sunday is the 100th anniversary of the Armistice that ended the horrific trench warfare that killed millions in World War I, including 116,708 Americans, 231 of them from Shelby County. I’ll be at the Doughboy Statue in Overton Park on Sunday to read the names of our fallen. 
Monday is Veterans Day, when we honor all who have served in uniform. It is an appropriate time to remember Army Air Forces Second Lieutenant Martin F. O’Callaghan of Memphis, shot down over what is now Slovenia in the waning weeks of the Second World War, whose remains were buried this week. His sacrifice and that of those who fell on battlefields in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere around the world should never be forgotten.  
I look forward to my 10th annual Veterans Day Meeting on Monday to hear their concerns. 
Appearing on MSNBC About the New Congress 
I’m scheduled to appear on Lawrence O’Donnell’s MSNBC show Friday night and on Alex Witt’s show on MSNBC on Sunday morning in the 11 o’clock a.m. hour to talk about the new Congress convening in January and its agenda.  
Holding My Next “Congress On Your Corner” 
My Memphis staff and I will hold an evening “Congress On Your Corner” for those who can’t make our daytime events, on Monday, November 26, at the Benjamin Hooks Central Library, 3030 Poplar, from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m.  As your representative in Congress, part of my job is making sure your concerns and issues with federal agencies and federal benefits are dealt with fairly and expeditiously. We can help with Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits and military service issues, Small Business Administration (SBA) loans and services, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) home loans, federal grant applications, visas and passports, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issues and more.   
Offering U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars 
￼ 
My office will soon have a limited number of 2019 U.S. Capitol Historical Society calendars available. If you would like to receive a calendar, please complete this form on my website. Due to the rules of the House, I can mail calendars only to residents of Tennessee’s 9th Congressional District. Please feel free to share this email with other residents of the 9th District who may be interested in receiving one but who do not receive my e-Newsletter.  
Signing Up for “Congress On Your Corner” and this e-Newsletter 
￼ 
I enjoy meeting regularly with constituents in the district and helping get answers for them to questions about dealing with federal agencies. If you are interested in attending one of my “Congress on Your Corner” events, you can sign up hereto receive notification as soon as the next event is scheduled. 
For those who haven’t participated in a telephone town hall, it’s easy to sign up for them by using this form.   
If you would like to receive this weekly e-Newsletter, or share it with others, you can do that with this form. 
Weekly Health Tip 
￼ 
Each week, I share a health tip in the hope of promoting a healthy lifestyle for residents of the 9th Congressional District. As always, it is best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine or lifestyle. 
According to the National Diabetes Association, 806,000 Tennesseans have diabetes and 1.7 million have prediabetes. November is National Diabetes Awareness Month and next Wednesday is Diabetes Awareness Day. Many don’t know that they have diabetes, which is problematic because diabetes can be managed or prevented with active measures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advice on preventing pre-diabetic patients from developing the condition. See that information here. 
Quote of the Week   
￼ 
“We have men of science, too few men of God. We have grasped the mystery of the atom and rejected the Sermon on the Mount. The world has achieved brilliance without conscience. Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants. We know more about war than we know about peace, more about killing than we know about living. If we continue to develop our technology without wisdom or prudence, our servant may prove to be our executioner.” -- U.S. Army General Omar N. Bradley, Armistice Day speech, November 11, 1948. 
As always, I remain Most sincerely,

I never thought I'd be here for the longest tenure of any Republican Senator in history. But Utah has been so good to me and I'm just so proud to have been able to represent my state and my constituents. 
This week, ABC4 Utah has been airing special coverage of my final months here in the United States Senate.
￼ 
Video and story via ABC4 Utah 
As I reflect on my decades here in DC, the court has been one of my top priorities. I’ve worked hard to ensure that the Supreme Court of the United States reflected the same values you all hold dear in Utah.
The ABC 4 team was in Washington during the final days of Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings last month, and on Wednesday night aired a short special on my role in shaping the United States Supreme Court over the last four decades.

Rep. Connolly’s 10th Annual Open Season Event For Federal Employees, Retirees, and Veterans

Dear Neighbor, 

I hope you will join me on Saturday, December 1, 2018, for our 10th annual Federal Employee and Retiree Open Season Workshop. This is a great opportunity for federal employees and retirees to review changes to Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) plans, and dental and vision insurance programs. We will have a panel of experts on hand to answer your questions, including representatives from the various health care plans.

Two major changes for 2019 directly affect active duty and retired service members. The Tricare Retiree Dental Program will be discontinued effective December 31, 2018, but those who were eligible under that plan will be able to enroll in one of the FEDVIP dental plans available to all federal employees and retirees. In addition, for the first time ever, the families of active-duty service members may be eligible to enroll in vision coverage through FEDVIP if those family members are currently enrolled in a TRICARE health plan. Those wishing to participate in either of these plans must enroll during open season. 

Our workshop will take place at the Fairfax County Government Center, 12000 Government Center Pkwy, Fairfax, VA 22035, from 10 am to 1 pm. 

This year, Open Season runs from November 12, 2018 through December 10, 2018. Federal employees seeking further information about FEHB plans can visit OPM’s website at https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/. Current TRICARE participants can obtain additional information on dental and vision plan options by visiting: TRICARE.benefeds.com.

For more information, please contact my District Office at 703-256-3071. 

Sincerely,
￼

News from Representative Seth Moulton
￼ 





Dear friend, 
On Saturday, November 10th, our office will host his fourth annual Veterans Town Hall. The first Vets Town Hall was held on Veterans Day 2015. Veterans Town Halls give veterans of all wars a chance to address their community directly and without intermediaries. A veteran speaking at a Veteran Town Hall will look out over a crowd that has many familiar faces in it, as well as complete strangers. These are the people he risked his life for. These are the people she went to war for. No one goes to war and returns home unaffected. It’s not fair—or healthy—for veterans to be left alone with these burdens. They belong to all of us.
WHAT:  Veterans Town Hall 
WHEN: Saturday, November 10,11:00 AM 
WHERE: Abbot Hall, 188 Washington St, Marblehead, MA 01945 
 
Please do not hesitate to reach out to my District Office at 978-531-1669 if you have any questions. 
I look forward to seeing you on Saturday, November 10th! 
  
Sincerely,

Newsroom

￼
Grateful for a chance to catch up with the Oklahoma delegation during Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue’s visit last week. We enjoyed a lively Q&A with agriculture producers from around the state over a great lunch at the famous Cattleman’s Steakhouse. 
  
￼
A tour of the innovative Amazon delivery facility in Oklahoma City. 
  
￼
I am honored to receive the 2018 NFIB Guardian of Small Business award. I will continue to fight for small businesses around our state and work to roll back burdensome federal regulations that impede growth and stifle our economy. 
  
￼
A helpful conversation with the Broken Arrow Chamber of Commerce to discuss trade and tariffs and their impact on Oklahoma businesses. Tariffs were a frequent concern from many companies and consumers as I traveled across Oklahoma the past month.     
  
￼
I enjoyed the opportunity to tour the Pelco facility in Edmond during October and learn more about the issues facing manufacturing facilities in our state.
  
￼
I enjoyed meeting and thanking personally the patriotic leaders who serve our veterans at the Catoosa Disabled American Veterans. These talented caseworkers and volunteers provide wisdom and a place to serve those who served us. 
  
￼
Cindy and I had a great time working with other volunteers to load weekend food “backpacks” at the Regional Food Bank. Please consider volunteering and supporting your local food bank to ensure needy Oklahoma families have enough to eat. 
Dear Oklahoma Friends and Neighbors: 
Though elections can divide us, it is important to remember that we are all Oklahomans and Americans first. I am grateful for the work of states, like Oklahoma, that helped ensure this week’s midterm elections were not affected by foreign or domestic cybersecurity threats. Leading up to the election and during the long election day, the Department of Homeland Security was intensely protecting our election infrastructure, and I received updates all day about any potential threats. 
I continue to press my colleagues in the Senate and House and work with the Trump Administration toward a vote on my election security bill, the Secure Elections Act. I remain hopeful that we can work out any final details in the days ahead and bring this much-needed legislation to a vote in the Senate. We can and should have this legislation in place to help protect the integrity of our elections in 2020 and beyond.  
In late October and early November, I had the opportunity to meet with and hear from Oklahomans around the state to discuss tariffs and international trade, immigration, federal budget reform, health care, and issues facing veterans and their families. I am grateful to take these ideas back to Washington to come up with practical solutions that will benefit all Oklahomans.
UPDATE: Remaining Legislative Work in 2018 
The 115th Congress will end in early January 2019, and the first session of the 116th Congress will begin with new faces from around the country joining us to work through the many legislative priorities Americans sent us to Washington to solve. In 2018, the Senate has worked diligently to confirm 84 federal judges, but work remains this year to process remaining Executive and Judicial Branch nominees.
Bills are also pending for Coast Guard authorities, criminal justice reforms, and a few minor changes to the tax law. Of course, Federal Fumbles, the annual report—and corresponding commonsense solutions—is also coming out from my office just before Christmas. Nothing says “Merry Christmas” quite like my detailed report on federal waste and inefficiency.    
We also have seven of the twelve appropriations bills that have not been approved yet. Currently, part of the federal government is funded through December 7, 2018, by a Continuing Resolution (commonly referred to as a CR). So, the final seven appropriation bills must be completed in the next month. 
For seven months, I have actively worked to reform the way Congress creates the budget. The outdated 1974 Budget Act has only worked as it was designed four times since its creation. The bipartisan, bicameral, 16-member Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform has the opportunity to present non-partisan recommendations of ways to fix the broken federal budget process. We will not have a better budget product until we have a better process. Please remain connected with my office to learn more about our work to hopefully bring practical, common-sense changes to our budget process. 
To hear more about my thoughts on reforming our federal budget process, please CLICK HERE to watch a video in which I discuss some of the issues.
Initial work will also begin on the new US/Mexico/Canada trade agreement. While the vote will probably be early next year, the review of the agreement will be over the next three months. There are also major problems with the increased tariffs on China for Oklahoma businesses and consumers. We need to resolve our problems with China in a way that punishes bad trade practices but does not damage our economy even more.  
UPDATE: Immigration 
As we continue to monitor the group(s) of individuals coming to our southern border largely from Central America, I remain convinced that Congress’s lack of action for years has weakened our federal immigration policy. Congress has prevented our nation from fully securing our borders and has looked the other way as courts have complicated enforcement issues and reforms across multiple presidential administrations. Our border security personnel work hard to keep our borders as safe as possible, and we must ensure they have the resources and personnel they need to do their job. We should prevent illegal immigration and ensure legal immigration is safe and efficient and serves our national interests as often as possible. I remain committed to keeping families together whenever possible.
I am hopeful in the days ahead that we can break through the existing policy disputes preventing a bipartisan solution to the immigration issues we face. 
Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue in Oklahoma City 
I was honored to welcome Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue when he visited Oklahoma on October 31 to host a lunch and town hall with the Oklahoma delegation and tour agriculture sites in our state. His visit to our great state coincided with an announcement of new USDA grants, including one for St. Anthony Hospital, in time to expand opportunities for telemedicine in rural Oklahoma in Beaver, Blaine, Custer, Garvin, Harper, Kiowa, Lincoln, Major, McClain, Washita, and Woods Counties. 
To learn more about the USDA’s Distance Learning and Telemedicine grant program and opportunities, CLICK HERE. 
Rural healthcare options are very important to Oklahomans who live sometimes several hours from a major medical facility. Telemedicine gives doctors and patients a chance to utilize technology to provide preliminary diagnoses and help answer questions without requiring patients to drive hours to a clinic. Competitive federal grants offer health providers an opportunity to expand into new, and in this case remote and rural, areas, which will ultimately benefit more and more people in our nation. We should continue to seek to streamline healthcare-related federal grant programs to ensure we can utilize limited federal dollars on direct healthcare access, not multiple overlapping or misplaced grant programs.
Pastor Andrew Brunson Released from Turkey and Returned to the US 
On October 12, 2018, I was overjoyed to welcome Pastor Andrew Brunson and his family when he was finally able to return home to the US following his release from Turkish custody. Dr. Brunson endured two years of imprisonment and house arrest for completely unjust charges. I am grateful this long journey ended with the Brunson family able to begin the next season of their life reunited on American soil. 
Turkey is a long-time US ally, and we have worked to maintain our partnership over the last two years while pushing for Pastor Brunson’s release. Turkey and the US have many areas of agreement and some areas of disagreement, but it was unexplainable why Turkey would hold an American citizen to negotiate any differences we have between our countries. Countries cannot use hostage American citizens as bargaining chips.

Two Oklahomans Selected for the 400 Years of African-American History Commission 
The Department of the Interior honored two Oklahomans, Mr. Hannibal Johnson and Dr. Myron Pope, by selecting them to participate in the 15-member 400 Years of African-American History Commission. Established through bipartisan legislation on January 8, 2018, the panel will help coordinate the commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first enslaved Africans to the English colonies in 1619. We should study and learn from our history, the good, the bad, and the ugly.

SERVING YOU  |  MEDIA CENTER  |  LEGISLATIVE WORK  |  OUR DISTRICT
 
November 9, 2018
 
 
 Dear Friend,   On Tuesday I was given the opportunity to serve the people of Rhode Island for two more years in the U.S. Congress. I’m incredibly honored and promise to continue to work hard every day on the issues most important to Rhode Islanders.   The American people used this election to deliver a clear message to Washington. They are fed up with the Republican Party’s reckless agenda to cut taxes for the rich, sabotage health care, and let corporate money influence our political system. And they want a Congress that works for them, not the powerful special interests.   In January, when Democrats come back in the majority for the 116th Congress, we will immediately get to work advancing our agenda for the people of this country. On Day One we will start working to raise family incomes, create good-paying jobs rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, lower the skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs and health care, and crackdown on corruption in our government. We’re ready to deliver for working families.   I hope President Trump and his administration will work with us on this agenda. If he does, we can make real progress on some of the most challenging issues of our time, and it will be an opportunity to truly move America forward.   THOUSAND OAKS  On Thursday morning, we woke up once again to headlines of a horrific shooting.   In a matter of weeks, we have lost dozens of innocent lives, leaving families and loved ones heartbroken. I will keep the families of those affected in my thoughts and prayers.   We must face the truth, we have an epidemic of gun violence in this country. The most recent incident in Thousand Oaks, California should compel Congress to act immediately. When Democrats come back in the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives next year, we need to take immediate action to reduce gun violence in our country. We need universal background checks. We need to ban bump stocks. We need to improve reporting requirements regarding individuals with serious mental illness who pose a threat to themselves or others. We need to move ahead with other common sense gun safety proposals.  Congress needs to enact real solutions that reduce the epidemic of gun violence in our communities. I will not give up. I will continue fighting in Washington to advance legislation that will put an end to this senseless violence.   SESSIONS RESIGNATION  Immediately after the midterm election, President Trump requested the swift resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.   The Attorney General of the United States swears an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution and the laws of our country. President Trump, however, seems to think this office is there instead to protect him from the consequences of his own actions.   The next Attorney General needs to be a strong, independent prosecutor who can stand up to this President, not shelter him from oversight and enable his misconduct. If the President uses this resignation to further politicize that office or to attempt to undermine the Office of the Special Counsel or his on-going investigation, there’s no question the incoming House will hold him accountable.  It is imperative that we protect Mr. Mueller’s investigation and let him complete his work.  VETERANS DAY  This Sunday is Veterans Day, a day for Americans to acknowledge the selflessness and sacrifice of the heroic men and women of our Armed Forces, and those who gave their lives to protect our nation. We also recognize our living veterans who reflect the finest values of our country. These heroes risked everything, and we owe all of them an eternal debt of gratitude.   Everyone who serves our nation in uniform deserves to be able to return home, get the education they need, find a good-paying job, and provide for their families. The federal government offers a wide range of benefits and services to our veterans, and my office can help veterans and their families access the resources they have earned. Please do not hesitate to contact the office at 729-5600 with any questions or requests for assistance.   INVESTING IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE   Reliable, effective transportation systems connect our communities. Last week, I joined numerous elected officials and community members for a groundbreaking ceremony for the new Pawtucket-Central Falls Commuter Station. This new development will serve as a hub for both commuter rail and RIPTA’s statewide bus networks, and will service hundreds of Rhode Islanders.   Investments like this in our infrastructure are exactly what we need to be making. House Democrats have outlined a $1 trillion federal investment that will create 16 million new jobs rebuilding America. When we come back in the majority in January, we are going to get to work on advancing a bold and comprehensive infrastructure bill.   Investments like this create good-paying jobs and support economic growth by allowing people, products, and ideas to move more easily through our economy.  This commuter station will make Pawtucket and Central Falls even stronger. It will give residents in both cities more economic power. And that’s something that will benefit folks across our state.   I look forward to seeing the completion of this project and will continue to advocate for federal investments in infrastructure in our state and nation.  PROTECTING COASTAL COMMUNITIES  This morning I joined Senator Whitehouse, to help celebrate an award of over $280,000 to the Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) in Rhode Island. This award was the direct result of Senator Whitehouse's legislation that created the National Coastal Resilience Fund.  CRMC will use this funding to complete an inventory of potential shoreline adaptation projects within areas in our state identified as vulnerable to coastal erosion, flooding, and storm surge. The CRMC is already doing great work in our state and this award will allow them to do even more to protect our coastal communities.  Coastal communities are vulnerable to severe weather and the worsening impacts of climate change. Last year, our country spent over $306 billion on 16 weather events, breaking the previous record set in 2005. The impacts of climate change continue to get worse and we need to make resources available now to prepare.

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 11.9.18
Friday, November 9, 2018 –                                 
Honoring Our Veterans
Each November 11, our country honors Veterans Day. It is a way we can show our gratitude for those brave men and women who put on the uniform to protect us and the freedoms we cherish.
This year’s observance holds a special significance, for it is the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. At the eleventh hour on the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918, the combatants stopped fighting.
World War I is less remembered by Americans than other conflicts, and its last American veteran, Frank Buckles, died in 2011. It was nevertheless a momentous event in our history, and one which inflicted a painful toll.
The bloodiest battle in all American history was not Gettysburg or Iwo Jima but the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, fought in France from September 26, 1918 to the end of the war. Even on the last day, when the fighting stopped at 11am, more Americans died than would fall on D-Day in World War II.
In its time, World War I was sometimes referred to as “the war to end all wars,” but we know now all too well that this wasn’t the case. But while there are still wars, there are also still men and women who step forward to protect us, even to make the highest sacrifice if necessary.
So on Veterans Day 2018, we remember those who fought in the war that ended a century ago, as well as in all our wars. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that over 40,000 veterans currently live in the Ninth District; if any are part of your family or live in your neighborhood, take the time to thank them.
Unfinished Business for the 115th Congress
Americans have cast their votes in the 2018 midterm elections and members of the next House of Representatives have been chosen. There is still work for the current House to do, however, before the next Congress takes office in January.
Funding for parts of the Federal Government expires on December 7. Congress had previously passed several spending bills, including Energy and Water, Labor/Health and Human Services/Education, Veterans Affairs, and Defense, and President Trump signed them into law. Remaining spending bills include Agriculture, Interior and Environment, and Homeland Security.
As part of funding the rest of the government, President Trump has insisted that money for a wall protecting the southern border be included. I agree that this funding should be provided. When referring to a wall, I don’t mean only a physical wall but other tools, such as technology, to enhance border security. More border security is important for the integrity of our immigration system.
Funding the government will be a major focus for the remainder of this Congress, but not the only one. I urge action on other priorities for the American people and the residents of the Ninth District.
Many farmers in the Ninth District benefit from programs such as crop insurance in the farm bill, which is reauthorized roughly every five years. Both the House and the Senate have passed their own versions of this important agriculture legislation, but it is important that a final version be agreed upon so we can send the 2018 farm bill to the President.
The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) affects Ninth District residents who live in areas subject to flooding. It expires on November 30. The NFIP needs to be extended, and I hope that a bill to do so will also include reforms to improve the program for the future.
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has led to economic growth, higher wages, and more jobs. President Trump has suggested another round of tax cuts for middle-class households. I am ready to work with my colleagues to find ways that let middle-class Americans keep more of their money.
I also hope for further action on my bill reforming the New Source Review (NSR) permitting program. This legislation, which has already passed the Environment Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, streamlines overly-complex regulations governing how some facilities update equipment that causes air pollution. If passed, it would promote efficiency while still protecting the environment.
As the 115th Congress nears its close, we will continue working on these priorities for the safety and well-being of Americans.
If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.  You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671.

BLAINE'S BULLETIN

As a lifelong Missourian, it is such an honor to have the opportunity to represent the great folks of Missouri’s third district for another two years. This would not have been possible without the support of my family and my fellow Missourians. With November 6th behind us, it’s now time for us to look towards the future. 
 Over the last two years, Congress has worked alongside the Trump Administration to keep our nation safe, ensure our economy continues to grow, and provide Americans from coast to coast the opportunity to achieve the American dream. With a shift in the balance of power, it is my job to continue to fight on your behalf.

President Trump has made homeland security a priority since he took office. Alongside the President, Congress has passed historic legislation to ensure we responsibly fund essential functions such as border security and national defense. This includes the largest pay raise for our troops in more than nine years and additional funding to close the critical readiness gap. We also passed Kate’s Law, legislation in honor of Kate Steinle which increases mandatory penalties for criminal aliens who illegally re-enter the United States.

In addition to protecting the homeland, Congress and the Trump Administration are working to protect our communities. One in three Missouri families have been affected by the opioid crisis that is sweeping the nation, but we have passed historic legislation to combat the ongoing crisis. President Donald Trump signed into law H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act. This law is the latest in a string of comprehensive solutions constituting the most significant congressional effort against a single drug crisis in history. 

Not only have we made historic progress combatting the opioid crisis and securing the homeland, but we have consistently hit economic records over the past two years. Americans are currently enjoying the lowest unemployment rates since 1969 and the highest wage and salary increases in a decade. With our growing economy finally back on track, Congress is working alongside the Trump Administration to ensure Americans across the nation see more money in their paychecks and can take advantage of these positive economic times. 

It is my job to represent the third district of Missouri well, and I value this responsibility. I will always fight for you, continuing to oppose government overreach, ensuring each and every person in Missouri’s third district can take advantage of our growing economy and protecting Americans at home and abroad. Thank you for your support and I cherish the opportunity to represent the great state of Missouri!

For 50 years, Tambrands has been a vital part of our state’s economy, and I visited their Auburn facility to meet with the staff who make that possible. Here I am, meeting with new hires, It was a pleasure to meet so many of the bright, eager people who will help the company, the Auburn community, and our state for years to come. Their hard work makes sure that the phrase ‘Made in Maine’ reflects the dedication and hard work of our state.

 Maine Voices Driving Opioid Legislation in Washington
￼
Part of my responsibility as one of Maine’s senators is to regularly travel across Maine and hear from people who live in every corner of our state. I hear about their achievements, their successes, their work to improve their communities – and far too often, I hear about their heartbreaks, particularly those related to the opioid epidemic. I’ve met with Maine people in recovery, family members of those struggling with substance use disorders, treatment providers, and law enforcement officials to learn about their experiences with this terrible disease. Each of these groups has offered unique insights on the challenges opioids pose to our state, but in each of these individual perspectives there has been one common thread: everyone agrees that in order to fully respond to these problems, we need a stronger federal effort to end the opioid epidemic.
These stories from Maine people have stuck with me – from the sheriff who lost his daughter to opioids and talked about the need for increased access to treatment, to the medical providers who worry that this epidemic is growing rapidly while their resources are not, to the people in recovery who are living proof that treatment can work. These stories, shared with me at roundtables and meetings across the state, have motivated me to keep fighting for a more aggressive response to this epidemic  – and as I was fighting, I shared these stories with my Senate colleagues so they would understand the human impact this epidemic was having on Maine people. We’re talking about a disease that kills more than one person per day in Maine – hundreds of lives lost every year, leaving holes in families, friends, and communities. I’ve pushed and pushed on this issue, and I’m glad to share a positive update – earlier this month, the Senate passed a sweeping, bipartisan bill to help the families and communities affected by this crisis. I was proud to vote for this legislation, which included a number of provisions I introduced and worked on based on conversations I’ve had with Maine people.
One of these provisions I advocated for was to permanently allow nurse practitioners and physician assistants (PA's) to provide medication-assisted treatment (MAT). Throughout my conversations about how to respond to the opioid epidemic, I’ve regularly heard that MAT is among the most effective treatments to help people enter recovery – and at the same time, I’ve also heard that there are not enough providers to administer this life-saving treatment. The solution to this problem is right in front of us: empowering nurse practitioners and physicians assistants, who are the unsung heroes of our healthcare system. These men and women are ready, willing, and more than able to make a difference in the lives of Maine people struggling with substance use disorders. When this provision was not included as part of the original legislation, I took to the Senate floor to advocate for its addition to the final version – and it worked! This is a major win for our talented medical professionals who will now have the tools they need to do their job, and for the patients across Maine who will have increased access the care they need.
Also included in this opioid legislation were major pieces of the CRIB Act, a bipartisan bill I’ve introduced to help newborn babies suffering from neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Approximately 1 in every 12 babies born in Maine enters this world with drugs in their system – 1 in 12. That is a heartbreaking statistic, and one we can’t accept without a strong response. This provision of the CRIB Act would allow Medicaid to recognize residential pediatric recovery facilities as providers, making sure that children have access to the specialized care they need to develop and lead healthy lives. The bill will make our children healthier, our families stronger, and won’t cost the taxpayers any additional money – it’s a no-brainer, and a major victory for communities across Maine.
These are just a couple of the important provisions in this month’s sweeping opioid legislation; for example, the legislation also includes language to help catch illegal drugs being sent through the mail, reauthorize grant programs to help states and tribes respond to the opioid epidemic, and remove an arbitrary limit that prevented residential treatment facilities from expanding their efforts to save lives. These are all important components in the fight to increase the availability of treatment, crack down on drug trafficking, and support those who need help, but there is so much more work to be done. This isn’t about partisanship – it’s about supporting our friends, neighbors, and loved ones who need our help. It requires all hands on deck, and I’ll keep fighting – both in Washington and on the ground, side-by-side with Maine people – to end this scourge that is hurting Maine people, families, and communities.
Report from Maine
October 
At the New Balance plant, we celebrated a recent bipartisan legislative victory to extend the Berry Amendment — which requires products for military personnel to be made in America — to athletic footwear for recruits like the kind made right here in Norridgewock. It’s always good to celebrate  bipartisanship, especially when it helps both Maine workers and American service members.
Hundreds of Maine people manufacture New Balance athletic footwear, and now that the Berry Amendment applies to athletic footwear for military recruits, these Maine-made shoes will, quite literally, continue to support our military. Today, as we celebrate this legislative achievement, we should really thank the men and women who make these high-quality footwear. They are the heart and soul of New Balance and they’re what make Maine such a special place to live.
￼ ￼ 
September 
There’s never a bad time to be in Acadia – especially not when you’re with the Acting Director of the National Park Service (by the way, a Maine native) to highlight the important maintenance work our state’s natural treasure needs to continue operating. Acadia has a maintenance backlog of $60 million, and it’s not alone – national parks across the country have fallen behind on maintenance to the tune of $12 billion nationwide. This is unacceptable. 
That’s why I’ve introduce the Restore Our Parks Act with a bipartisan group of colleagues. Our bill would drastically cut this backlog and make sure that we can fulfill our promise to leave behind these treasures for future generations of Americans. Read more about my visit HERE. 
￼  
August 
‪Exciting happenings in Rumford — Congress Street is getting all new sewer and water lines! In August, I met with business and community leaders in Farmington and Rumford to discuss their efforts to invest in their local communities. I also toured Origin Maine’s manufacturing facility in Farmington, met with new leadership at the former Catalyst Paper Mill in Rumford, and made several stops along Congress Street, which (as you can see) is getting a makeover. 
These exciting investments in rural Maine communities, and not just investments in the region’s history of invention and innovation – they’re investments in Maine people. Rural Maine people are hardworking, innovative, and dedicated – they’ll make any investment worthwhile, and create a superior product in the process. Infrastructure projects like the one in progress at Congress Street in Rumford will allow rural Maine communities to grow, thrive and pursue new opportunities for economic growth. 
￼      ￼ 
July 

In July, I met with leaders at the Leavitt’s Mill Free Health Center in Bar Mills, a volunteer-based facility that provides free healthcare to Maine people without insurance – all funded by private donations and grants. This visit inspired my speech on the floor of the Senate on the impact of ACA sabotage against Maine people. WATCH HERE. 
It was truly inspiring to see Maine community leaders stepping up to fill a local need – but the visit was in some ways disheartening. It hurts to see just how many people in York County have fallen through the cracks of our healthcare system. Unfortunately, this problem will get worse before it gets better. The Administration’s continued efforts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act have made health insurance more expensive and harder to access for many Maine people.   The volunteers at Leavitt’s Mill are stepping up to fill in the gaps, but not every community is so fortunate; this is why Congress must not only defend the ACA, but find ways to improve it to ensure our healthcare system works for all Americans. 
  
￼ 
 
Scenes from Washington 
￼ 
Undeniably, the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing received an overwhelming amount of global media coverage. For me, I considered the Kavanaugh nomination to be among the most important vote that my colleagues and I will ever take. Unlike most of our decisions, which can be amended, repealed, or otherwise corrected over time, this was a one-time vote on a lifetime appointment which will likely profoundly affect our country for the foreseeable future. There are no do-overs or second chances on this one.
For this reason, I spent a great deal of time and energy on this decision; I read many of Judge Kavanaugh's opinions, attended a substantial portion of his initial hearing (even though I am not a member of the Judiciary Committee), read every article on his background I could find, talked to my colleagues (in both parties), and listened to the views of thousands of Maine people, both in communications to my office and direct conversations over the past two months. After this intensive process and given the stakes as well as what we do know of his record, I had no choice but to vote no. 
Though Judge Kavanaugh was ultimately confirmed, we cannot give up hope. The work for myself, my colleagues and the many Maine people - like the group pictured above - who voiced their opinions and shared their stories with me, is not over. 

￼
Serving on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is some of the most important work I’ve ever done, and it’s incredibly important to the safety and security of Maine people. In September, our committee held hearing to question top executives of Facebook and Twitter about their companies’ response to foreign influence operations on social media platforms, and how Americans can best defend themselves against future attacks. Learn more about this hearing, and the work on the Intelligence Committee HERE. 
￼ 
In July, I had the privilege of welcoming John Druce, a 96-year-old World War II veteran of the Marine Corps and a longtime community leader in Boothbay Harbor, to Washington, D.C. It was a true honor to sit with him, learn about his experiences, and thank him for his service. I've been strongly advocating for veterans issues since arriving in Washington, as Maine’s veterans answered the call to uphold our freedoms and keep our nation safe. Last week, I attended Messalonskee Middle School's Veterans Tribute Assembly to give a speech that honored our nations veterans, and highlighted the sacred responsibility of caring for those who have served. Learn more about this event, and my work on veterans issues HERE. 
Combating the Heroin and Opioid Crisis
￼ 
I've made combating the opioid crisis one of my top priorities in Washington. I've has held roundtables throughout Maine – from Portland to Bangor to Milo to Paris, signed in support of multiple bills, and advocated to improve treatment and reduce stigmas surrounding Maine people in recovery. 
Here's a recent opioid policy update from my office: 
	•	In early October, I voted for sweeping opioid legislation that included many provisions that I authored which will help Maine families and communities affected by the opioid crisis. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act passed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support.   
	•	In October, I met with Maine people in recovery and treatment providers at the Bangor Area Recovery Network (BARN) in Brewer to discuss the importance of pre-existing condition protections for those seeking to recover from substance use disorders (SUDs).  
	•	Also in October, I voted for the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, sweeping opioid legislation which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support and multiple King-backed provisions that will help Maine families and communities affected by the opioid crisis. The legislation was the result of months of bipartisan hearings and discussions on the opioid crisis.  
	•	In September, I spoke on the Senate Floor in support of the Addiction Treatment Access Improvement Act, which would permanently authorize nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders. 
Legislative Update
￼ 
Be sure to check out the Press Release page on my website, and follow me on Facebook and Twitter for more information and more frequent updates.
	•	For decades, pharmaceutical companies have been able to sell their drugs to the public without disclosing their prices, and all the while, the prices have continued to rise. These costs are hurting Maine people who rely on prescription medications, and they deserve transparency. Following my legislative push, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced they would implement a rule that requires the disclosure of drug prices in advertising. Learn more HERE. 
	•	I voted in favor of legislation that would overturn the administration’s final “junk insurance” plan rule, which would expand the number of insurance plans that are not required to provide health care coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. The legislation, cosponsored by me, fell one vote short of the 51 votes needed for passage.   
	•	With Senators Maggie Hassan (D - N.H.), Bob Casey (D-Penn.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), I introduced the Invest in America Act, legislation that will create competitive grant programs to expand the workforce, modernize training tools, and promote job creation.  
	•	I joined Senator Collins to applaud the passage of legislation to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for five years. The legislation—which passed with strong bipartisan support—authorizes funding for all FAA programs, including: FAA operations, research and development; aviation programs; extension of expiring authorities; and airport planning and improvement. 
	•	The Senate Agriculture Committee unanimously passed the Improving Child Nutrition Integrity and Access Act with provisions I authored. This unanimous vote of approval from the Agriculture Committee will help provide healthy food for our students and flexibility for our schools. 
Good News from Around Maine
￼ 
	•	The Forest Opportunity Roadmap (FOR/Maine) Initiative released an action plan to grow Maine's forest economy by 40%.  
	•	In late September, I joined the Maine delegation to announce that Bath Iron Works (BIW) has been awarded four ships, in the amount of $3,904,735,559, over the next five years pursuant to the Navy’s multiyear procurement contract.  
	•	In October, Senator Collins and I applauded an announcement that Our Katahdin has been awarded $5.3 million from the Economic Development Administration. The funding will help the nonprofit build critical infrastructure, including roads, water, sewer, power and broadband in rural Maine.  
	•	In late October, Maine's congressional delegation announced that the Sanford-based Flemish Master Weavers prevailed in its application for an exemption from a tariff on yarn it uses to manufacture area rugs in Maine. The ruling by the Foreign-Trade Zones (FTZ) Board helps to level the playing field for Flemish Master Weavers to compete against foreign competitors and places the company in a strong position for continued growth.   
	•	In addition to the FOR/Maine initiative, I applauded an announcement from Sappi North America, Inc that the company has completed an investment project at the Somerset Mill in Skowhegan. The investment of more than $200 million will help the mill diversify its output, while retaining its leadership position in the graphic paper market. The mill currently supports about 1,300 Maine jobs overall. 
Maine People Spotted in Nation's Capitol
Every Wednesday morning that the Senate is in session, from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., my office and I host Capitol Coffee with Angus, an opportunity for Maine people who are in the area to stop by my office, say hello, and talk about issues important to them. Along with coffee, we are proud to provide homemade blueberry bread made with real Maine blueberries. Our office is located at 133 Hart Senate Office Building. RSVPs are not required. If you have any questions, please feel free to call my Washington, D.C. office at (202) 224-5344. I hope to see you there!
A few shots from Capitol Coffee: 
￼          ￼ 
I welcomed Tom and Sheila of York, ME and their two daughters into my office for Capitol Coffee in September. Often times I've spoke about the need for experiential learning -- meaning that sometimes the best learning doesn't take place in the classroom at all. The next photo is my signing a note for the girls, excusing them from their school classes for their visit. 
￼ 
Another guest at Capitol Coffee in September was a recent graduate from the University of Maine in Farmington. Madison recently moved to Washington from Mount Desert Island and has recently begun an internship on Capitol Hill. I congratulated her on her recent graduation, wished her the best of luck as she begins her career. 
￼ 
I welcomed this talented and kind couple to Washington in September. Don and Cindy of Gorham were visiting Washington perform on behalf of and to be celebrated by the National Endowment for the Arts.

Another Voice: Volunteering for Hospice is a True Labor of Love -- The Buffalo New  Congressional report says insulin market benefits drugmakers and insurers, not patients- The Hill  Lawmakers target insulin rebates, pay-for-delay for future reform- ModernHealthcare.com  In Congress, the representatives who don't see compromise as a dirty word- Yahoo 
Bipartisan group of lawmakers targets schemes drugmakers use to keep insulin prices high- Washington Examiner

Dear Neighbor,
I wanted to share with you my recent opinion piece I authored in the Buffalo News where I discuss the importance of being a hospice volunteer.  Hospice care is personal to me. 
When my mother became sick, there was nothing I wouldn’t have done to cure her, but she taught me that what truly mattered to her was comfort and time spent with her family. Surrounded by a wonderful team of hospice care providers, we watched as her wishes were met. 
One of my bill's, which recently passed the House, will ensure our aging loved ones have access to the proper and comfortable care they deserve as they reach those crucial final days with their family. 
The Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act will:
	•	Increase palliative care and hospice training for healthcare professionals.
	•	Enhance research on improving the delivery of palliative care.
	•	Launch a national campaign to inform patients and families about the benefits of palliative care.
Not only does hospice care improve our loved ones quality of life in their final day, but hospice care lowers health care cost making this legislation a win win we should all support.  As we head into this next Congress I will continue to seek out and support different ways to work here in Washington to help people.  If you have an idea or need that you feel Congress should know about or work on please do not hesitate to contact my office.  Best,  Tom

 Veterans Day 
￼  
This weekend, our nation will pause on Veterans Day in gratitude for the service and sacrifice of all who have served. Our district has more military veterans than any other district in New York State, and it is a tremendous honor to represent thousands of heroes and their families.  
Throughout the month of November, I’ll be sharing stories from veterans around our district. The following story is a touching tribute written by U.S. Army Veteran Ronald E. Klusacek for his son, Sergeant Erick. J. Klusacek of Brownville, who lost his life serving our nation. I am humbled to represent families like Ronald’s, and the North Country is eternally grateful for Sergeant Klusacek’s sacrifice.
“My second son is assigned to the Rakasan Cav Unit in Ft Campbell, KY alongside his brothers. Unfortunately he will always be assigned there. Sergeant Erick J Klusacek was killed on his 2nd deployment. Sergeant E.J. Klusacek's first deployment was to Iraq, his 2nd deployment was to Afghanistan, and we received him home through Dover AFB after he was killed in the line of duty on June 8th, 2010.”
To read the rest of Sergeant Klusacek’s story, and the stories of other North Country veterans, click here. For information on how North Country veterans can share their stories of service with my office, click here. 
In honor of Veterans Day, I wanted to take a moment in this week's eNewsletter to update you on my work in Congress to support our North Country Veterans. 
Protecting Veterans' Healthcare 
￼ 
We must continue working to ensure our heroes have access to the care they need. I was pleased to support the VA MISSION Act, which is now law. When I speak with our district's veterans, they continue to struggle with access to the healthcare benefits they deserve. This important legislation will improve our VA healthcare system and expand access to the Family Caregiver Program that I have long advocated to strengthen. In Congress, I'll continue working to ensure that our veterans receive the care they've earned. Click here to read more about the VA MISSION Act. 
Ending Veteran Homelessness 
￼ 
This Congress, I was joined by a bipartisan group of colleagues as we introduced the Keeping Our Commitment to Ending Veteran Homelessness Act. Our veterans risk everything to serve their nation and protect our way of life. This critical legislation will ensure they have access to housing, financial assistance, and mental healthcare. Click here to read more about this legislation. 
Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans 
Our offices know firsthand the frustrations that the Blue Water Navy Vietnam veterans are facing trying to get the benefits they need and deserve. Our brave veterans served heroically and we should never leave them behind. I am pleased that the House passed the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act to ensure our Blue Water Navy veterans receive the benefits they have earned. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to swiftly pass this legislation. Click here to learn more about this important effort. 
Honoring our North Country Heroes 
Over the course of his service with the U.S. Army’s 83rd Infantry “Thunderbolt” Division, Ross Bouyea played a role in some of the most pivotal moments of the Second World War. Mr. Bouyea landed on Omaha Beach following the allied invasion of Normandy and saw 244 total days of combat that stretched across Europe. During this time, Mr. Bouyea fought in the Hurtgen Forest during the Battle of the Bulge and faced the harshest conditions of war. Mr. Bouyea was also part of the division that liberated the Langenstein sub-camp of the Buchenwald concentration camp in 1945. I am humbled to introduce legislation to designate the post office at 10 Miller Street in Plattsburgh as the Ross Bouyea Post Office Building. Click here to read more about Mr. Bouyea's incredible service and life. 
￼ 
It was an honor to present a Congressional Proclamation to recognize Lieutenant Col. (ret.) Nicholas M. Laiacona for being named Veteran of the Year at the New York State Military Museum in Saratoga. Mr. Laiacona served our country in the Army for 24 years, which included service in Vietnam. We’re grateful for his distinguished service and his continued advocacy for our veterans. Click here to read more about the Veteran of the Year event in the Saratogian.  
Senator John McCain Day in Saratoga Springs 
￼ 
I am greatly appreciative for the City of Saratoga Springs’ efforts to remember and honor the late Senator John McCain. Senator John McCain was the embodiment of service and sacrifice above self. His indomitable spirit taught his fellow Americans to never waver in their commitment to our country and our values. During my time in Congress, I was honored to work with Senator McCain on many important national defense issues. I was especially grateful for his help securing the transfer of ten Apache helicopters for the Army National Guard to Fort Drum. I am forever thankful for his work to help the North Country and provide for our national security. Thank you to everybody involved in helping to organize Senator John McCain Day in Saratoga Springs. Click here to learn more. 
Assistance with Veterans Benefits 
￼ 
I’m proud that my offices have helped NY-21 veterans recover over $2.8 million in VA benefits. If you’re having issues accessing your VA benefits or know a veteran who is, don’t hesitate to contact us with your specific casework needs. Click here for more information.

Boozman Bulletin: Salute to Veterans 
On Sunday, November 11, bells across Arkansas will ring 11 times at 11 a.m. in commemoration of the end of World War I. Ever since November 11, 1918, we’ve set aside this day to celebrate the men and the women who selflessly served in our nation’s uniform.
Veterans Day is an important time to pay tribute to the men and women of our Armed Forces, who have stood in defense of our nation, our cherished values, and our way of life. As our servicemembers have risked their lives to protect the interests of our nation, so must we honor our commitment to support them.
As a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs and chairman of the Senate Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, I continue to fight for improvements to veterans’ benefits and services, and will remain a strong a voice for those who selflessly served our country. 
￼
The Arkansas Military Veterans’ Hall of Fame recently celebrated its class of 2018 inductees in Hot Springs. I was honored to join Congressman Bruce Westerman to recognize this distinguished group of men and women who have demonstrated selflessness in uniform and continued service to their communities.  
We made great progress this year with  landmark legislation President Trump signed into law to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs’ current health care delivery system and provide veterans with more choices while reducing barriers to care. The VA Mission Act streamlines and strengthens VA community care programs to ensure veterans receive efficient, timely and quality care. We’ll be closely monitoring its implementation in the coming year to ensure veterans are getting the treatment and care they earned. 
Our Armed Forces are made up of patriots from all corners of our nation who are called to a higher service in defense of our freedoms. I encourage all Americans to use this day as a time to thank our veterans for their courage, commitment and honor. It’s because of their dedication and sacrifice that we are the greatest, freest country in the world. 
To all of our veterans, thank you and may God bless you, your families, and the United States of America.

TX-25 Veterans: We Want to Hear From You
Dear Texans, 
Veterans Day is Sunday, November 11, and is a time for our country to honor and remember those who served our nation. 
￼ 
The 25th District of Texas is home to the active duty Fort Hood military installation, as well as thousands of this nation’s bravest veterans. Our district is made up countless American heroes who have put their lives on the line for us, and as the representative of a military-rich community, our veterans hold a special place in my heart. The servicemen and women in this country have sacrificed a great deal, and I am humbled to represent them in Congress. Please join me in honoring those this month, and every month, who answered the call to serve.
For those residents in Texas 25th who have served in the military, or know someone who has, I'd like to invite you to share your memories by submitting photos and stories from your time in service. I will be sharing these stories and photos on my official website and Facebook through the month of November.  
Please submit your stories and photos by clicking here or emailing TexasCD25@mail.house.gov. Please do not mail the office original photos.  
Those who are submitting content are asked to include a short description of:
	•	Branch
	•	Title
	•	Assignment 
Lastly, those who are submitting on behalf of another individual are asked to be sure they have permission to share photos and stories before sending. 
It is an honor and privilege to represent the people of Texas’ 25th Congressional District and as always, please reach out to me with any issues and concerns that are important to you. 
In God we trust,

Dear Lindsey: 
As I reflect on the next two years representing you in the United States Congress, I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate the responsibility of being your Member of Congress.  In the past four years, we have accomplished a lot for Contra Costa County. Together, we have expanded the John Muir National Historic Site in Martinez, provided additional recreational spaces for East Bay families, saved the Nevin Avenue Post Office in Richmond from closing, passed a law to decrease fraudulent opioid prescriptions, increased investment in transportation projects, created an agenda for increasing opportunities for working people while preparing for the future, and much more.  All of this would not have been possible without your input and engagement. Representing you in Congress is my greatest honor, and I look forward to continuing to work on your behalf for the next two years.

Dear Friend, 
A record number of Americans came out to the polls this week for our nation’s midterm elections. Voting is a privilege denied to many, and I am proud of our nation for exercising their right to vote. I am honored to continue serving the people of San Antonio and Bexar County in the 116th Congress.
Sutherland Springs Anniversary 
On Sunday, I attended a ceremony at First Baptist Church to mark the first anniversary of the horrific shooting in Sutherland Springs that took the lives of 26 and injured dozens more. 
￼ 
You can watch coverage of the ceremony on KENS5 or read about it in the San Antonio Express-News. 
￼ ￼ 
Keeping Families Together 
I opposed the proposed changes relating to the apprehension, processing, care, custody, and release of unaccompanied minors. In a letter sent on behalf of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I warned Debbie Seguin, who serves as Assistant Director of the Office of Policy for Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Department of Homeland Security, that these proposed changes to the Flores Settlement Agreement would allow the Trump Administration to indefinitely incarcerate immigrant families. You can read about it here.  
Honoring our Veterans 
As we near Veterans Day, it was an honor to present medals to Navy and Coast Guard Veteran, Petty Officer 3rd Class Steven H. Valadez. We thank PO3 Valadez for his service to our nation. 
￼ 
It was also great to join San Antonio Veterans and their families at the 3rd annual You Are Not Forgotten Mural Rededication. 
￼  ￼ ￼
Russia Investigation 
We must have answers immediately into why Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned and whether or not there has been any nefarious dealings that would qualify as obstruction of justice by the President. Given Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker’s previous statements on Mueller investigating the President’s finances and advocating for less funding, I have serious concerns and believe this investigation is in immediate jeopardy. 
Congress has a duty to protect Mueller and relentlessly defend our nation’s democracy at all costs. This is the type of oversight and accountability the incoming Democratic Majority will assert. You can read my full statement here. 
You can watch my interviews on MSNBC and CNN here. 
District Update 
Team Castro joined fellow San Antonians at the 10th Annual Diwali Festival of Lights, celebrating Indian culture and traditions, and attended the American GI Forum’s 2018 Stand Down, which focused on homeless veterans by offering VA assistance, job resources, and health screenings.
￼ ￼ ￼ 
Team Castro also attended the City of San Antonio’s Climate Action and Adaptation Plan Open House at Hardberger Park, and joined EnrollSA at their Open Enrollment Period 6 Kick off. 
 ￼ ￼ ￼ 
As Congress continues to address issues that directly affect San Antonians’ daily lives, I want to hear from you. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or questions for me by calling my office at 210-348-8216 or reaching out online through my website, castro.house.gov.

Dear Lindsey,   
The election offered both joy and disappointment.  I am thankful for the important vote of confidence on my service.  And I am especially thankful that in January, I return to a Congress with a Democratic majority and speaker. Even that is not soon enough. 
Only a few hours after the election, Trump undertook far-reaching meddling into the Mueller investigation.  He found someone with a very narrow view of Mueller’s authority, who is not recused from interfering in that investigation.   Please join us today, Thursday, Nov. 8, as we gather across America in defense of the rule of law and in opposition to Trump’s interference with the Mueller investigation.  I will be speaking today at Austin City Hall at 5:00 p.m. and another member of our team will speak in San Antonio at Travis Park at 5 p.m. At 5 p.m., concerned citizens will also gather at the historic Williamson County Courthouse in Georgetown and at 6 p.m. on the Square in San Marcos.  We will be sending a message that rejects Trump’s threats and reminds him that more watchdogs will be replacing his lapdogs in the U.S. House, ready to hold him accountable.  
In a new and much improved House of Representatives, we can begin to demand accountability from Trump.  We can secure the oversight ignored by the current Republican-controlled Congress, overflowing with the enablers for his worst excesses. Trump may clean house at the Department of Justice, but our U.S. House must demand accountability and prevent further obstruction of justice.
With the Senate under greater Republican control and the President clearly out of control, our work remains very challenging.  Certainly, we need to protect access to healthcare, educational opportunity, and Social Security and Medicare.  There is a clear yearning among many for us to come together, to find common ground to resolve important national concerns, regardless of party.  While I share that desire, true bipartisanship will require a President, who tweets less, rallies less, and reasons more.  On infrastructure, trade, and prescription drugs, there is the potential for bipartisan achievement, but only if the President is willing to seize that opportunity. 
If instead, Trump continues to impede the Mueller investigation, demonize immigrants, and attack freedom of the press, we will need to intensify our resistance every day in every nonviolent way.  I will not back down from defending our values and advancing reasonable alternatives to the many outrageous policies that Trump seeks to impose. 

Especially now, with all the challenges that await, both in the waning days of this Congress and the new one still about two months away, I hope to see you and let me continue to hear from you. Also, please take this opportunity to visit my Facebook page, follow me on Twitter, follow me on Instagram, or send me an e-mail at Lloyd.Doggett@mail.house.gov. 
Sincerely, 
￼         Lloyd Doggett

Lipinski: Democrats Should Focus on Workable Solutions That Improve Everyday Lives, Starting with Infrastructure
 
Congressman Dan Lipinski (IL-3) released following statement today:
 
“The Democratic takeover of the majority in the U.S. House provides the opportunity for Congress to reassert its Constitutional role of conducting oversight of the Executive Branch and the President.  This is part of Congress’ role in providing checks and balances in the federal government, but something that both parties often fail to do when there is one party in control.  We also await the conclusion and publication of the Mueller report; it is critical that this investigation be allowed to move forward unobstructed and that Congress seriously consider the findings and act if necessary.  
 
“But this does not mean that we should spend the next two years doing nothing but conducting investigations in Washington.  House Democrats should focus on finding workable solutions on the issues that are most important to improving the everyday lives of families across the Third District and our nation.  These include bringing down sky-rocketing drug and hospital costs, keeping our children and our communities safe from violence, protecting our air and water, reforming our immigration laws, and improving education and making college more affordable.  
 
“As Illinois’ senior member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I am hopeful that one of the first major pieces of legislation we pass next year will be a robust infrastructure bill that makes investments in our roads, public transit, airports, and other transportation systems, as well as in other aging infrastructure.  This infrastructure investment is crucial for the district, our region, and the country, and I believe it is an issue that we can find agreement on across parties and between Congress and the President.  
 
“Two of the most productive legislative years that I have been a part of in Washington were 2007-2008 when Democrats controlled the House and George W. Bush was president.  I know the current political divide makes cooperation much more unlikely today, but I remain hopeful that 2019-2020 can be productive in Washington.  With so many problems faced by Americans today, it is critical that we work together on solutions and not just spend the next two years campaigning for 2020.  It’s just common sense.”

The Hastings Monthly Report

November 2018


Dear Friend,

Last month, we witnessed despicable acts of hate and violence, which this country is still processing. As America copes with tragedies such as the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh and the bombing attempts against critics of the Trump Administration, my heart goes out to the families and communities who have been affected. 

Over the past two years, our country has witnessed a resurgence of openly aired racism and hate, including a dramatic increase in acts of Anti-Semitism, nativism, and bigotry. We must remember that we are better than this, and we need to act now before this disturbing trend of hateful and fear-mongering rhetoric begins to define us. Each of us – from the President down – needs to play their part to restore respect and civility within the political atmosphere. In the final months left of this session, Congress should be enacting common-sense gun legislation in order to avoid the senseless tragedy after tragedy that we continue to be faced with.
U.S.-Israel Relationship 
In October, the New York Times published an editorial suggesting that a “new wave” of Democrats are challenging the party’s support for Israel. Although it is true that some incoming Democratic Members of Congress have been openly critical of Israel, generalizing their criticisms as the future of the Democratic Party is as misleading as suggesting that fringe white nationalist Republican candidates are representative of their party.   As a Co-Chair of the Democratic Israel Working Group, I work hard to educate my colleagues about the importance of a strong U.S.-Israel relationship. I take this role very seriously and frequently work behind the scenes with colleagues not deeply involved in foreign affairs to contextualize the daily challenges Israel faces, whether it is the deeply flawed boycott movement or the unfair treatment Israel receives when it is singled out by multilateral bodies. I look forward to working with my new colleagues in the same way, and hope that they join the Working Group so that they too can meet with foreign policy experts from across the political spectrum and Members of the Knesset to learn about Israel and the region.  Of course, there will always be some who are skeptical of Israel and those who rely on hyperbole in their criticism. I would be shocked if any of those who are quick to criticize Israel have ever stood in a Hamas Terror tunnel designed to enable the murder of Jewish civilians. I would be surprised if any of them have stood in playgrounds in Sderot that double as bomb shelters, or heard from mothers who are forced to decide which of their children they will carry to safety when the sirens give them 20 seconds notice of incoming rockets. I doubt any of them have experienced stepping onto a bus or into a café and considered the chances that a suicide bomber or a lone-wolf terrorist would follow close behind.   Perhaps more importantly, they likely have never stood in Hadassah hospital and seen Israeli and Palestinian doctors treating patients without consideration for their ethnicity. They likely have never seen the bilingual and multicultural Hand in Hand school, initiatives like Roots that works to build trust, empathy, and support between the communities, or EcoPeace, at the front of the environmental peacebuilding effort. They probably know little of the joint American-Israel research into lifesaving medical technologies, clean energy, or agriculture that will feed the future while keeping our water clean and air clear.   These are the real stories of the U.S.-Israel relationship, and Democrats overwhelmingly support them. It is my sincerest hope that my future colleagues will too. The U.S.-Israel relationship is paramount, and although the complex and deeply rooted challenges sometimes evoke frank debate, the Democratic Party will always support Israel and Jewish communities across the globe. Members of Congress like me will ensure that our relationship will continue to grow stronger.     For more information on the various issues that I am working on, visit my official website at www.alceehastings.house.gov. With warm personal regards, I remain, 
    Sincerely,
￼

WHILE OUT IN GEORGIA'S 12TH DISTRICT...
 Robin and I are continuing to pray for the innocent lives that were tragically taken at the Tree Of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. 
￼
Places of worship are sacred, and senseless acts of violence such as this are acts of pure evil. Our thoughts remain with the victims, their families, as well as the Jewish community and entire city of Pittsburgh.
In Grovetown, I had the opportunity to host a World War II veterans’ appreciation event alongside my friend and colleague, Congressman Jody Hice (GA-10). 
￼

￼

￼
Our World War II veterans are amongst the bravest heroes this nation has ever seen and they truly represent the Greatest Generation! Thank you to all of those in attendance and Grovetown High School for opening their doors to our community and our local World War II veterans.
During the 115th Congress, my colleagues and I have been working hard to pass meaningful legislation aimed at improving the lives of our veterans. With over 20 bills signed into law and nearly 50 more passed in the House of Representatives, we will continue our efforts to ensure that those who have defended our country receive the best possible care. 
I also spoke at the Augusta Lions Club meeting to give an update on my work on behalf of Georgia’s 12th District, our plan for successfully tackling our “Better Way” agenda, and how we are “Better Off Now”. 
￼

Thanks for having me!
The October Jobs Report was recently released by the U.S. Department of Labor, and the U.S. economy added 250,000 jobs last month alone, significantly exceeding expectations! 
￼

We are continuing to see positive results like this all over the country thanks to tax reform and pro-growth policies taking effect.
To keep the good news rolling, Georgia has been named as the best state in the country to do business in for the sixth consecutive year by Site Selection Magazine. 
￼

A big congratulations to Governor Nathan Deal for his tremendous leadership on behalf of our great state.
In Claxton, I attended the Evans County Farm Bureau meeting where I gave an update on the 2018 Farm Bill. 
￼

￼

As a conferee on the Farm Bill Conference Committee, I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and advocate for Georgia-12 priorities throughout this process. It is imperative that we complete a bold and effective farm bill that provides a stronger safety net for our farmers and ranchers.
I also stopped by the Augusta Rotary Club meeting to say hello to some familiar faces. 
￼

￼
With such a rich history, the Rotary Club of Augusta is constantly giving back to our community and I thank them for all of their hard work.
Ongoing recovery efforts are still in progress during the aftermath of Hurricane Michael, and a Disaster Recovery Center (DRC) opened earlier this week in Laurens County. This DRC will provide residents an opportunity to meet face-to-face with representatives from the State of Georgia, FEMA, and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), as well as other federal partners.  
￼
Eligible applicants can register for assistance by calling: (800) 621-3362, or applying online at: disasterassistance.gov. The TTY number is 1-800-462-7585 for those who are speech or hearing-impaired. Survivors who are unable to register for assistance before visiting a DRC are welcome to use the center’s phone banks and computers. 
I was thankful for the opportunity to spend some time with a few of our family’s little trick-or-treaters on Halloween. 
￼
I hope you had a great day with you and yours.
Are you or someone you know interested in learning more about the legislative process and the many other functions of a congressional office? I just announced my 2019 Spring Internship Program for my Washington D.C. and Augusta offices and I encourage all interested candidates to take a look at the application HERE. 
￼
With Veterans Day approaching, please take some time this weekend to thank one of our brave veterans who have served in the United States Armed Forces for all they have done to protect our nation and the freedoms we all hold so dear. 
Share your thoughts with me! You can email me ⇒  HERE, contact any of our offices or join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.

Consumer Alerts From the Federal Trade Commission
Hang up on spoofed SSA calls
by Lisa Weintraub Schifferle | Attorney, FTC, Division of Consumer & Business Education

If you get a call that looks like it’s from the Social Security Administration (SSA), think twice. Scammers are spoofing SSA’s 1-800 customer service number to try to get your personal information. Spoofing means that scammers can call from anywhere, but they make your caller ID show a different number – often one that looks legit. Here are few things you should know about these so-called SSA calls.

These scam calls are happening across the nation, according to SSA: Your phone rings. Your caller ID shows that it’s the SSA calling from 1-800-772-1213. The caller says he works for the Social Security Administration and needs your personal information – like your Social Security number – to increase your benefits payments. (Or he threatens to cut off your benefits if you don’t give the information.) But it’s not really the Social Security Administration calling. Yes, it is the SSA’s real phone number, but the scammers on the phone are spoofing the number to make the call look real. 

What can you do if you get one of these calls? Hang up. Remember:

• SSA will not threaten you. Real SSA employees will never threaten you to get personal information. They also won’t promise to increase your benefits in exchange for information. If they do, it’s a scam.

• If you have any doubt, hang up and call SSA directly. Call 1-800-772-1213 – that really is the phone number for the Social Security Administration. If you dial that number, you know who you’re getting. But remember that you can’t trust caller ID. If a call comes in from that number, you can’t be sure it’s really SSA calling.

• If you get a spoofed call, report it. If someone calls, claiming to be from SSA and asking for information like your Social Security number, report it to SSA’s Office of Inspector General at 1-800-269-0271 or https://oig.ssa.gov/report. You can also report these calls to the FTC at ftc.gov/complaint.

For more tips, check out the FTC’s How to Stop Unwanted Calls and Government Imposter Scams. If you think someone has misused your personal information, go to IdentityTheft.gov to report identity theft and find out what steps to take.

11/6/18 14:37,Honoring our Veterans,"￼ 
November 6, 2018

Dear Friend, 

We are free because millions of Americans have answered the call to serve our nation since the first citizen-soldier fired the ""shot heard around the world"" on the Lexington Common.  Then and now, our fighting forces have been willing to lay down their lives to preserve all that we hold dear.

During the month of November, our state and nation will recognize the bravery of our men and women veterans who have served our nation.  Veterans Day ceremonies will be held across Mississippi and America to remember their service and the quiet sacrifices their families have made to support them back home.

￼
Cooper Tire veterans Jeff White, Jon Elliott, 
John Keaton, George Walker, and Cliff Johnson
                                
Recently, I had the opportunity to recognize veterans who are team members at Cooper Tire and Rubber Company in Tupelo.  The company employs a total of 2,100 people.  238 of their team members are U.S. Military veterans.  It was an honor to thank them for their service and to recognize a special anniversary for America and our allies.  November 2018 marks the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Armistice between the allies of WWI and Germany on the eleventh hour on the eleventh day during the eleventh month of 1918.  It was the end of WWI and a time to celebrate our victory in Europe.  

￼

Throughout the month of November, be sure to attend a Veterans Day event to personally thank them for their service.  They deserve our respect and gratitude.
      
MAKING HISTORY
                                            
As your Representative, there is nothing more gratifying than to see our work in Washington have a positive impact on the quality of life for my fellow Mississippians.  Optimism is soaring throughout the First District and across our great state.  In June, The Mississippi Department of Employment Security said the number of nonfarm jobs in the state were the most on record - 1,168,300.  That record was broken again in September as the number of nonfarm jobs rose to 1,170,100.  Mississippi's unemployment rate for September 2018 was 4.8%, the fourth lowest level of unemployment ever recorded in Mississippi.

The numbers are great and we plan to keep them that way.  We need a sustainable workforce that will continue to attract new businesses and industry to the First District.  Last week, I appreciated the opportunity to discuss a number of issues, including our workforce, at the Itawamba Community College State of the District Address.  

￼

There is a concentrated effort to supply the demand for skilled workers.  Taking the lead in a multi-pronged plan to grow the workforce are our community colleges - our greatest workforce developers.  Together, with economic development agencies and employers, they are working to meet the demand with the skills needed to help businesses and industries achieve continued success.  
                                            

PACCAR ENGINES, INC.

One of many successful industries in the First District is PACCAR Engines, Inc.  In 2010, the company started building engines at their Golden Triangle Industrial Park facility.  Over the years, their team has grown to 600 employees.

￼

During a tour of the plant, I appreciated the opportunity to talk with some of their employees.  These men and women take great pride in the diesel engines they build for Peterbilt and Kenworth Trucks.  Plant Manager Lance Walters said the company has invested $650 million during their eight years in Columbus.  
                                           

WORKING FOR OUR FARMERS

Farming is the top industry in Mississippi.  It is important that we make sure farmers have our support through meaningful legislation.  Last week, it was an honor to receive the Friend of Farm Bureau award at the ""D.C. Fly in to the Farm"" event held in Jackson.  I will continue to advocate for policies that will help farmers feed and clothe our nation.

￼
Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation 
President Mike McCormick


I-269 

Our fast-moving economy in Mississippi will continue on a successful path through improved infrastructure.  One of the most anticipated project completions was celebrated in DeSoto County last week.  The ribbon was cut on the final nine-mile segment of Interstate 269, from Interstate 55 in DeSoto County to State Route 305.  

￼

The full project, launched in 2011, consists of approximately 26 miles of four-lane, controlled-access highway in north Mississippi.  Drivers are now able to take I-269 from I-55 near Hernando for nearly 60 miles in a loop to Millington, Tennessee.
                                                                                     

HERITAGE COMMUNITY PARK DEDICATION

Recently, Farmington residents gathered to pay tribute to all those who have served in the United States Air Force, Army, Marines, Navy, and the Coast Guard.  A monument has been dedicated in their honor in the new Heritage Community Park's Veterans Memorial Garden.                                       

￼

In 2005, Mayor Dale Fortenberry began an effort to gain support to open a park that would also include a walking and bike trail.  A crowd of local residents turned out for the dedication ceremony.  ""It has been a long journey,"" Mayor Fortenberry said.  ""I can't describe it.  It was a dream come true.  I'm so proud of it and that it is already being used by people from Farmington and well beyond.""

Dear Friend, 
National Adoption Month always reminds me of Eida, a young girl from the Democratic Republic of Congo who was adopted by Justine from Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District. 
After running into issues with an adoption freeze and no exit visas, Justine turned to our caseworkers in Otsego to help bring Eida home. Our team did just that. Eida’s adoption was finalized and Justine was able to welcome Eida home to Minnesota. When the family stopped by our office it was a special moment for everyone. 
￼
(From left to right) Justine, Eida and Barbara Harper, our caseworker who helped bring Eida home.
Knowing that our team has helped bring families together brings me incredible joy, especially with seven kids of my own. At the end of the day, Jacquie and I know that is what it really is all about: family. 
I know not every American enjoys the same good fortune. So many couples and children long for the blessing Jacquie and I have. Today over 117,000 children in the U.S. patiently wait in our foster care system for a family of their own. 
During National Adoption Month, you can help raise awareness about adoption, specifically those kids in foster care waiting for a permanent and loving family. Mark your calendar for National Adoption Day, November 17, and click here for information about events, adoption resources and ways to get involved. 
 Sincerely,  ￼

BRADY BRIEFING: We must keep this momentum going

November 5, 2018 -COLUMN
SHANA TEEHAN
ISABELLE GWOZDZ
(202) 225-4901

CONROE, TX - “Jobs smash estimates with gain of 250,000, wage gains pass 3% for first time since recession”  What an amazing headline from CNBC last week and there is no doubt about it—the American economy is booming. Across the nation, we are seeing measurable results and real improvement for the paychecks of America’s workers and families. 

Wages and salaries increased by 3.1 percent, the highest level in a decade. Unemployment has dropped to the lowest level since 1969. Consumer confidence has jumped to an 18-year high. And because of our stronger economy, Medicaid enrollment fell for the first time in over a decade. And those are only a few of the examples.

Since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed by President Trump, more than 2,100,000 jobs have been created. With all the great economic news, you must ask yourself, why anyone would want to change course and go back to the bad old days of more burdensome regulations, higher taxes and stagnant growth?
***

We’re seeing improvement in the Lone Star State too. Since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, Texas median wages have increased by $4,792. The unemployment rate has dropped to 3.8 percent—the lowest rate in four decades. Manufacturing jobs have increased, and the number of Texans living below the poverty line is at the lowest level in recorded history.

These numbers don’t lie. Our goal has been, and always will be, to make our government and our economy work for the people. American workers deserve to keep more of what they earn. We promised economic change, and we’ve delivered it. But we’re not done yet. To keep this momentum going, we are focused on making the tax system better for hardworking middle-class families each and every year.
***
The recent acts of political violence in our nation are unacceptable. I fully condemn these despicable actions and the hatred that fuels them. Physical violence should never be the way to settle our disputes, and we will stand united against anyone who seeks to use violence and terror against us. ***
We celebrate Veterans Day every year on November 11th, the anniversary of the day when the guns fell silent -- ending WWI, a war in which the loss of life was so horrific it was referred to as “the war to end all wars.” Unfortunately, wars did not end and the world has remained a dangerous place, made safer by those who volunteer to go in harms’ way so that we can live in peace in America. This week I encourage everyone to reflect on our veterans, their families and their sacrifice, and to take a moment to thank the brave men and women who have risked their lives while serving in uniform to protect our nation.

Come and Read It Report
Dear Texans, 
Nine years ago today, Fort Hood was devastated when a gunman opened fire on a Soldier Readiness Processing site that was filled with hundreds of deploying and returning soldiers. 13 people lost their lives and over 30 were injured. This is a day we must never forget, and I will continue to pray for those who had to say goodbye to loved ones too soon during this tragic event.
Help for Central Texas 
The flooding in Central Texas in the past few weeks has been absolutely catastrophic to families, businesses, and infrastructure. I visited the site of the FM 2900 bridge that collapsed, as well as the folks in Marble Falls, and while their spirits were high, their community was devastated. I applaud the efforts of local and state officials who have shown true leadership throughout this difficult time. Unfortunately, this severe weather is ongoing, and I agree with Governor Abbott that the state has exhausted its options and a federal response is necessary. I have sent President Trump a letter urging him to quickly fulfill the Governor's request for a major disaster declaration for the State of Texas, and I will continue to support Texans in any way that I can. 
$61 Million for Fort Hood 
After a combined effort with the Fort Hood community, I am pleased to announce that ‘The Great Place’ has been awarded $61 million for the renovation of five barracks. 
Including this funding, I have worked to secure nearly $200 million towards improving living conditions for our soldiers this year. While there is still much to do, this action demonstrates that Congress is committed to providing for our men and women in uniform. I am proud of our work so far, and I will continue to fight on their behalf to secure additional funds for Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20) and beyond. 
October Jobs Report 
The numbers are in, and our economy is continuing to thrive thanks to Republican's pro-growth and pro-American agenda. We're working towards more jobs and higher wages for every American, and we're just getting started! 
✔ 250,000 new jobs added in October 
✔ 3.7% unemployment (lowest in 49 years)
✔ 3.1% wage growth = fastest rate since 2009 
Curious about the jobs that were added? Click here to read more or take a look at the numbers below: 
	•	Large businesses added 102,000 
	•	Mid-sized companies added 96,000 
	•	Small employers added 29,000 
I have included some articles and releases you may find interesting located on the right side of this newsletter. It is an honor and privilege to represent the people of Texas’ 25th Congressional District and as always, please reach out to me with any issues and concerns that are important to you.

Securing our borders is critical to securing our communities


￼

What’s New:
President Trump recently ordered more than 5,000 U.S. troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to bolster our security in Operation Faithful Patriot. These troops will provide logistical support to U.S. Border Patrol agents and help keep our country safe and enforce the rule of law.
The migrant caravans that originated in Central America are still making their way up toward our southern border. The first caravan is estimated to have over 3,500 migrants and the second has over 3,000. According to the Department of Homeland Security, there are over 270 individuals with criminal histories – including gang members – along the caravan route.
Considering the threat to our communities, I believe President Trump is right to send our troops to the southern border.
Why It Matters:
These caravans have already demonstrated violence against security forces in the countries they have entered. Between Honduras and Guatemala, the caravan violently pushed past Guatemalan security forces. The caravan entered Mexico by nearly causing a riot on a border crossing bridge and then illegally crossed a river into Mexico.
The United States is a nation of laws and strength. We cannot, and will not, allow caravans of thousands of migrants to abuse our asylum program and threaten our security. The approaching caravans also demonstrate why we must end catch and release and stop funding sanctuary cities.
What’s Next:
One caravan is reportedly about 700 miles from our border. I will continue to support the President in his effort to protect our borders and keep our communities safe.  
Survey:
Do you support President Trump’s decision to bolster our security by sending troops to the U.S.-Mexico border? 
Yes
No

￼
Friends, 
This morning, President Trump approved a major disaster declaration for the State of Alabama, ordering federal assistance to supplement state & local recovery efforts in the areas affected by Hurricane Michael. Thank you, Mr. President — we will rebuild together. 
SUPPORTING BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS 
October was Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and last week I sent a letter to the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requesting that they review their current coverage options for breast cancer survivors. 
￼ 
As of now, CMS offers only two choices for women following a mastectomy: surgical breast reconstructive surgery or a prefabricated breast prosthetic. The latter have been described as shapeless, heavier than the normal breast, and both hot and cumbersome to wear.   It is my belief that CMS should provide coverage for women who wish to have a custom fabricated breast prosthetic, which is significantly less expensive than reconstructive surgery and would be a custom fit to a woman’s unique body shape and needs. Survivors should not be subjected to a one-size-fits-all approach.

MEETING WITH ELMORE COUNTY EMA 
￼ 
Last week I sat down with Keith Barnett, the new Elmore County EMA Director, and other leaders in the community. We had a productive discussion about infrastructure, rural broadband, prison reform, and economic growth in the region. I also appreciated the group giving me an update on Elmore County’s priorities. Thanks for your time!
TALLASSEE LIONS CLUB 
￼ 
It was a privilege to speak to the Tallassee Lions Club during their lunch meeting last week. I appreciated this opportunity to give them an update from Washington and hear their ideas and concerns. Thanks to all who attended! 
MAXWELL RECEIVES $18 MILLION 
I'm pleased to announce that Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base in Montgomery will receive $18 million from the Air Force’s Fiscal Year 2019 military construction account for a new air traffic control tower. 
Updating the Air Traffic Control Tower at Maxwell is long overdue. I have personally climbed up the antiquated tower and can attest to how dangerous it is and how badly it needs to be replaced. I am very pleased that this issue is being addressed through the recently passed military funding bill, and I look forward to seeing this improvement become reality as Maxwell continues to support the needs of the Air Force in the River Region, including the 187th Fighter Wing’s missions. 
The construction is expected to begin June 2019 and conclude December 2020. 
MEDAL OF VALOR 
AL-02 resident George Partridge of Prattville received the Medal of Valor this weekend for his bravery in Vietnam. Join me in thanking him for his courage, service, and patriotism. Congratulations, Mr. Partridge! 
MAYER VISIT IN DOTHAN 
￼ 
I stopped by Mayer in Dothan last week to meet with employees. The Dothan location has been extremely busy assisting those affected by Hurricane Michael in the Florida Panhandle, SW Georgia, and SE Alabama. I was glad to have this opportunity to thank them for their hard work in person. My office stands ready to assist them in whatever ways we can.
SECOND CONGRESSIONAL DINNER 
￼ 
It was an honor to speak at the Second Congressional District dinner in Dothan last week. Each year, this event provides AL-02 community leaders an opportunity to get together and discuss the ways we can better serve our shared constituency. I appreciate all the hardworking people who stepped up to be leaders in our region, and I enjoyed visiting with friends old and new.
TROY UNIVERSITY HOMECOMING 
￼ 
Margaret and I had a blast being on campus for Troy University’s homecoming last weekend! Many thanks to everyone to took the time to visit with us. It was awesome to have the opportunity to be on the field. Go Trojans!

Kansas Common Sense  November 5, 2018
Hello,
 
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
 
Standing with the Jewish Community
The tragic shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh was carried out by a domestic terrorist who seeks to destroy the idea of America. The shooter was driven by anti-Semitism, among the most disgusting constants throughout modern human history. Kansans know this all too well: in 2014, a white supremacist shot and killed innocent people in Overland Park at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City and Village Shalom. We must be better.
I met on Tuesday with leaders from the Jewish Federation of Greater Kansas City to listen and learn about how I can better support our Jewish community in Kansas during this worrisome time, and to offer my condolences for those who were killed. We also discussed ways to help our nation recover and heal, and how I can support the Federation’s efforts to keep their people and places of worship safe.
We must collectively recommit ourselves today to supporting our Jewish friends and neighbors. We should not need another tragedy to remind us of the importance of standing together for people of all faiths and religions.  
Participating in the Midterm Elections As Americans, one of the most fundamental elements of our system of government, and at the foundation of who we are as a nation, is the ability and freedom to cast a vote in democratic elections. Tomorrow, people across the state and country will head to the polls to make their voices heard in the 2018 midterm elections – I encourage all Kansans who haven't voted already to vote on Election Day. To look up your polling location and find more information about the election, click here.  
Hosting Acting EPA Administrator in Kansas City This week, I hosted Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler at the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Region 7 lab in Kansas City for a meeting with lab employees, a roundtable with Wyandotte County community leaders and a tour of the lab. We discussed the importance of the lab being located in Kansas and the services it provides to our state, including testing water samples to ensure safe drinking water, research on reducing algae blooms in our lakes and efforts to promote clean air for our citizens. The discussion included my priority to see the lab stay in its current location beyond the expiration of the current lease in 2023. I appreciated the many officials who were at this discussion, including General Services Administration officials Michael Copeland, Judy Dungan and Kelly Juarez, Kansas City, Kansas Mayor David Alvey, Wyandotte County Administrator Doug Bach, Unified Government of Kansas City and Wyandotte County Director of Economic Development Katherine Carttar, Wyandotte Economic Development Council President Greg Kindle, Kansas City Chamber Executive Director Daniel Silva and Kansas Secretary of Agriculture Jackie McClaskey. 
During the visit, I also had the chance to discuss a number of past and present projects specific to Kansas, including research to better understand algae blooms, research on pesticides and herbicides used by Kansas farmers and their responsible use, as well as water testing in Neodesha during a recent contamination where EPA lab employees were readily available to assist with various efforts.  
While at the lab, Acting Administrator Wheeler signed a proposed rule clarifying that normal, low-level emissions from animal waste are exempt from certain EPA reporting requirements. Farmers and ranchers continue to face numerous challenges, and the removal of this unnecessary and burdensome regulation is welcome news for producers across our state. It was never the intent of Congress for normal odors from animal waste on farms to fall under our nation’s emergency hazardous waste reporting requirements, so I appreciate Administrator Wheeler taking definitive action to provide certainty to the livestock industry. The resources of our emergency responders ought to be focused on protecting the public from true environmental and chemical emergencies, not odors from animal waste. 
Thank you to Administrator Wheeler for visiting the lab and to the dedicated staff at the lab who provided us with the tour. 
￼ 
Touring the Atchison Airport I joined a group of community leaders in Atchison on Monday afternoon at Amelia Earhart Airport for a discussion about the importance of aviation to small communities and the economic value it brings. We discussed the runway expansion, rehabilitation of buildings and the construction of the Amelia Earhart Airport Museum. The Museum will showcase “Muriel,” a Lockheed Corp. Electra Model 10E, which is the same model that was flown by Earhart. I appreciate and commend the efforts of Karen Seaberg and her family to make ""Muriel"" a reality for the Atchison community. 
Thank you to Vice-Mayor David Hausmann, City Commissioner Shawn Rizza, Chamber President Jacque Pregnot and members of the Airport Advisory Board for joining me. Thanks also to City Manager Becky Berger for setting up the meeting. 
 ￼
Speaking at the National Institute on Aging Regional Meeting I was in Overland Park on Thursday to share my support for our nation’s medical research effort with new and prospective medical researchers at the 2018 National Institute on Aging (NIA) Director’s Regional Meeting hosted by the University of Kansas. The NIA is our nation’s lead agency supporting research on diseases of aging, including Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. The purpose of this meeting was to provide information on research opportunities, training and other forms of support offered by NIA to new and prospective researchers, as well as to facilitate recruitment of diverse and underrepresented students and investigators to pursue research on aging. Students and researchers from throughout the region came to Overland Park to take part in these events. 
During my visit, I met with NIA officials and University of Kansas Medical Center representatives, including leaders of the KU Alzheimer’s Disease Center (ADC). We discussed progress being made toward finding cures and treatments for Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, the importance of attracting young people to careers in medical research, the efforts of the KU ADC to extend the reach of its services and support to Kansans in every corner of our state, and how NIA has supported and may continue to support those efforts. One of my top priorities is to advance policies that enable students who are interested in STEM and research to pursue those careers in Kansas. I'm proud to see that our nation's investment in biomedical research is having that effect here at home. 
Thank you to NIA Director Dr. Richard Hodes and his team for coming to Kansas to provide information, resources and support for emerging and prospective medical researchers. Thank you also to KUMC Executive Vice Chancellor Robert Simari, KUMC Vice Chancellor for Research Richard Barohn and Vice Chancellor of KU Edwards David Cook for hosting the event and for inviting me to address those in attendance. 
 ￼ 
Meeting with K-State Ag Students and Ag Secretary Perdue On Thursday afternoon it was a pleasure to welcome back Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to Kansas. Secretary Perdue visited Manhattan to deliver a Landon Lecture at Kansas State University. Secretary Perdue and I then had a discussion with K-State Agriculture students that primarily focused on the importance of rural development, hunger initiatives, trade and passing a new farm bill. 
This visit gave Secretary Perdue the chance to see the talent and dedication of our state's young people who work in agriculture and at our research and academic institutions. I will continue advocating to the secretary and the United States Department of Agriculture that the USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the Economic Research Service, who will soon be moving out of Washington, D.C., have access to this talent and that they call Kansas home. 
Visiting Veterans and Staff at the Topeka VA
I’m always glad to spend time with our veterans, and I am committed to providing the VA with the resources and oversight it needs to accomplish its mission through legislation like the John McCain VA MISSION Act, passed earlier this year. On Thursday, I visited the Colmery-O’Neil VA Medical Center in Topeka. On behalf of Kansans, I thanked Associate Director of Patient Care Service Nelson Dean and the many caregivers of the VA Eastern Kansas Healthcare for their service to our veterans and our communities.
￼
Touring the Fort Hays State University Farm On Friday, I visited Fort Hays State University (FHSU) to learn more about its university farm. Located on the west side of the university, the 3,825 acre farm operates primarily as a commercial farm, affording students the ability to take what they have learned in the classroom and apply it in a practical agricultural setting. The university farm focuses on beef, swine, sheep and crop production. During my visit, I received an update from Biology Professor Dr. Bill Stark on the university’s precision agriculture program.
Concluding my visit, Agriculture Department Chair Dr. Clyde Cranwell provided me a tour of the university farm. The FHSU Department of Agriculture is seeing significant growth in its student population and after having toured the farm and learning more about what the department has to offer students, it is apparent why the program is so successful. Thank you to Dr. Cranwell, Dr. Stark and Werth College of Science, Technology and Mathematics Dean Dr. Grady Dixon for hosting my visit. 
￼ 
Speaking with General Vincent Brooks I had the pleasure of speaking with General Vincent Brooks, former Big Red One Commander and the outgoing commander of U.S. Forces Korea on Friday. General Brooks and I briefly discussed the issues and challenges related to the U.S. Military posture on the Korean Peninsula and increased uncertainty since he took command in 2016. I also thanked General Brooks for his nearly 38 years in the Army serving our nation and wished him well as he soon departs his current position. Starting as a young Cadet First Captain at West Point, General Brooks has had the distinct honor of leading and commanding soldiers in foreign lands and all across our country, including calling Kansas home as a two-star Army general. The Big Red One and Greater Flint Hills region appreciates his time and leadership in Kansas and inspiring thousands of troops for generations to come. 
Visiting with Residents in Solomon
On Saturday, I visited with local residents, community leaders, business owners and elected officials in Solomon. Community visits like this allow me to hear directly from Kansans on issues most important to them, and also allows me the chance to offer updates on the work I'm doing in Washington, D.C. and across Kansas. Much of my work is shaped by what I hear from people across our state, I appreciate the many community leaders, business owners and local elected officials who took time out of their day to visit with me.
 
Honored to Serve You in Washington
It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard. 
Please let me know how I can be of assistance. You can contact me by email by clicking here. You can also click here to contact me through one of my Kansas offices or my Washington, D.C., office.

Friends -  
     Over the last 22 months, my office has established itself as one of the most conservative offices and built a record of success that ranks 2nd amongst all first-term members of Congress. We have passed 12 significant pieces of legislation and helped more than 2,000 families overcome bureaucratic red tape and resolve issues they have been facing, sometimes for decades.
  
 ￼ 
  
     The legislation that my office has authored and passed reduces the size and scope of the federal government, improves health services for veterans, authorizes resources for border enforcement agents, and enhances school safety assets. Many of these bills have received broad, bipartisan support from my colleagues.
     We have also delivered major wins for South Louisiana by delivering federal funding and securing construction permits for critical infrastructure projects. This includes historic levels of funding for dredging and water management projects across the 10 parishes. We have helped secure permits for projects like the Bayou Bridge Pipeline, new LNG exporters, and local infrastructure that create jobs and drive investment in our communities.
     My office has consistently prioritized South Louisiana values and voted to cut taxes, repeal bad regulations, create new jobs, secure the border, and keep our communities safe. I will continue working with President Trump to place American interests first and to enact conservative policies that benefit all Americans. Our mission to restore a stable and strong America continues.
     As your Congressman, I am committed to transparency and open communications. Please visit my website, clayhiggins.house.gov, for all recent news from my office. It is an honor to serve you, and by extension, the Nation we all love. If there is anything that I can do to assist you, please contact my office.
 
Sincerely,

Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends: 
Friday’s jobs report we learned 250,000 jobs were added in October, which was more than the 190,000 some had predicted. Private-sector wages increased by the biggest jump we’ve seen since 2009! 
As our nation’s economy prospers, we are also seeing improvement in the job market for Floridians. 
	•	Total manufacturing employment in Florida has increased over 5 percent since President Trump was elected, rising to 377,700 total employees.
	•	Year-over-year job growth in Florida manufacturing reached the fastest pace ever recorded in September. 
	•	Florida’s mining, logging, and construction industry has led employment growth since the President was elected, increasing by over 12 percent. 
There is more work to be done, but this is encouraging news for hardworking Floridians. 
￼

It was great visiting with friends old and new at the 23rd Annual Government Day in The Villages and sharing how my office can help those having issues with federal agencies. If you need assistance finding answers, solutions, or simply attempting to cut through the red tape, please contact my office.

Crystal River is home to the second largest springs group in Florida. Kings Bay is fed by more than 70 springs scattered within 600 acres. While in Crystal River, I visited the new Welcome Center at the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge, the only refuge created specifically for the protection of the Florida Manatee. Thank you to the staff and volunteers of the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge for educating the public on wildlife and plant life conservation.

New businesses opening in the district are another indicator we have a healthier economy. While in Homosassa recently, I stopped by the new Crystal Harley Davidson dealership to meet the managers and staff and hear about their success and challenges as a newly-opened franchise.

I was honored to participate in the grand opening and dedication for an organization that is setting the example for serving the community and helping our fellow Americans who are struggling – New Church Without Walls. Under the leadership of Dr. Doug Alexander, this church is making a difference every day in the lives of Citrus County residents.

Thursday, I joined the Glen Lakes Veterans Club meeting. I shared that nearly $4.5 million has been returned to veterans in my district in compensation, pension or retroactive payments since January 2017. I also heard their testimonies of experiences with the VA, as well as their concerns and ideas for policy changes and improvements. 
￼ 
_______________ 
In addition to visiting every VA service center, another priority this Congress was to visit each public school in my district. Last week I visited two more schools – Fox Chapel Middle School and Brooksville Elementary. In addition to speaking with teachers and school leaders, I was able to spend time chatting with and answering questions from students. I always come away from these meetings encouraged for our future and inspired by the dedication of our teachers and school leaders.

_______________ 
Friday, President Trump announced he was reimposing all the sanctions that had previously been lifted under President Obama’s terrible Iran deal. These sanctions target the Central Bank of Iran and other key financial institutions.  This will cut off Iran’s access to funds they use to bankroll terrorist groups, support nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and enrich their leaders. The sanctions also target key Iranian-related individuals who have known ties to Iran’s terrorism support, weapons program, engage in human rights abuses and other criminal activities. 
I applaud President Trump for once again keeping a campaign promise and taking seriously the responsibility to protect our country.

As we approach Veterans Day, I am humbled by and grateful for the sacrifices that have been made by our Armed Forces. Our men and women in uniform have shown a level of courage and commitment to their nation beyond any measure – thank you for your service to our country, and for protecting the values that have made the United States of America the greatest nation in the world.

Constituent Corner
A constituent from Hernando contacted my office after working with Social Security to release her mistakenly withheld benefit check for several months without success. My office sent an inquiry to the processing center and requested an update on issuing of the payment. A few days later, we called the constituent with good news that her benefit check had been deposited. 
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.  
District Update
My Service Academy Coordinator, Laura, and Service Academy Nomination Board hosted interviews of eligible candidates who are interested in attending a United States Service Academy. It’s encouraging to see so many of our young men and women pursuing their dream of serving our great country. 
  
We owe our veterans a debt we can never repay for sacrificing and serving our country with honor and courage. My Community Relations Representative, Pam, visited The Vietnam Traveling Memorial Wall while it was in Lady Lake. The Traveling Memorial Wall serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made during the Vietnam War and is helping heal and rekindle friendships. 
Legislative Update
In late September, the House passed S. 1595, the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act of 2018. This bill imposes more sanctions on foreign persons and agencies that provide assistance to the terrorist organization Hizballah. S. 1595 is an excellent example of our commitment in Washington to stamp out international terrorist groups and all their supporters. Recently, President Trump signed S. 1595 into law, bringing us one step closer towards eliminating this terror threat to our great nation and the rest of the World.

November 5, 2018
Hello friends, 
It has been a difficult few weeks since I last reached out. Between a spate of pipe bombs targeting elected officials and the press, and then a cowardly act of violence at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, there has been a lot of soul-searching going on across the country.   It is occasionally tempting to feel overwhelmed with bad actions like these. Having said that, we can also choose to feel consistently overwhelmed by the good that Americans are capable of. It says a lot about our country that, when the synagogue shooting suspect was brought into a Pittsburgh hospital spewing hateful things, he was treated professionally by Jewish hospital staff. Check out this article and watch the video associated with it.  What Dr. Cohen says in this video is both heartbreaking and profound. I think the care team’s actions on that day are a glimpse at our nation’s true soul.  Another thing Dr. Cohen said stuck with me too: “Words mean things.”   There’s no place in our society for anti-Semitism, bigotry, violence or hate.  I’ve recently used this newsletter to talk about civility and bipartisanship, and I’m going to keep banging that drum, because our republic functions best when we all work to dial down the toxicity and do our best to solve problems together. 
￼ 
Fixing Congress   This week, I spoke at the South Sound Summit about the need for more civility in our political system. In that regard, Congress can model good behavior or bad behavior. We’ve seen far too much bickering in DC - and far too little progress. That’s caused folks to lose faith in the idea that we can solve problems civilly. 
￼   The rules Congress sets for itself are part of the problem. Last Thursday, I penned an op-ed with Rep. Ken Buck, a Republican from Colorado, about the changes Congress should make to encourage bipartisan problem solving. 
The two of us are co-chairs of the Congressional Reformers caucus. Over the last few months, we organized more than 130 meetings with more than 60 members of Congress from across the country and political spectrum.  Through those conversations, we developed a series of reforms that will help Congress work better. In the coming months, we will raise them with members of the House Rules Committee and leaders of both parties.  We outlined some fixes here. 
￼(A few months ago, I had Rep. Buck on my podcast. Get to know him here.) 
While you’re reading The Hill, check out the op-ed from Rep. Steve Womack, who I recently hosted for an exchange. He’s the Chairman of the House Committee on the Budget, and he’s the co-chair of the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform, a temporary committee tasked with fixing the way Congress funds the government.   I was appointed to be a member of this temporary Committee because so many folks in our region depend on Congress doing its job and passing budgets and appropriations bills. Whether you’re a government employee or someone who works for a small business adjacent to the National Park, you likely feel it when there’s a government shutdown. The servicemembers in our region depend on Congress to fund the training and equipment they need. Tens of thousands of families in our region make a living working for the federal government - whether for the Naval Base, JBLM, the Veterans Administration, the Park Service, the Forest Service, the Postal Service, or someplace else. Their incomes and our economy are directly affected by the dysfunction.   Stay tuned over the next few weeks. The committee will be trying to work out a bipartisan plan when Congress is back in session.   I’ll keep working to fix Congress. 
￼
Standing Up For Veterans   One place where Congress should continue to focus is on the Department of Veterans Affairs.   Last week I was able to drop by UW-Tacoma for an update from student veterans, including some who have not received their GI Bill housing stipends on time. 
￼ 
More than a year ago, Congress passed the Forever GI Bill. It included a housing stipend increase for veterans, and I was proud to cosponsor it. Despite having a year to roll out the increase, the VA hasn’t gotten the job done. That’s left hundreds of thousands of student-veterans with financial hardships and no GI Bill payments. At least 340,000 veterans nationwide have not received the increase, and about 140,000 veterans have filed claims for missed payments - a 50 percent increase from this time last year. 
This is unacceptable. If you serve our country, the government should have your back, and you shouldn’t have to fight for benefits you’ve earned and deserve. The House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs will hold a hearing on this issue November 14th, and I’m going to keep pushing the VA’s leaders to be more accountable. 
This week, I also hosted a pinning ceremony for Vietnam veterans in Port Ludlow. Thank you to all who came and to all who served. 
￼ 
My team and I will organize more of these ceremonies in the months ahead. If you’d like to help us put on an event or if you’re a veteran who would rather seek recognition privately, please reach out to Rob from our team. He’s in our Tacoma office, and you can reach him at 253-272-3515.  Speaking of ceremonies honoring our veterans... More than 260,000 Filipinos and Filipino-Americans bravely served in World War II. Yet for far too long those efforts were never properly recognized. I joined an effort to award Filipino and Filipino-Americans the Congressional Gold Medal, and I had the chance to speak at the APCC Filipino American History Month Celebration. To all who served, thank you. 
￼ 
Helping First Responders   Congress should keep working together to fix the opioid crisis.  I recently did a ride-along with the Tacoma Fire Department’s CARES team, a group that is on the front lines responding to mental health and addiction crises. 
￼
Congress needs to keep stepping up for communities as they work to expand mental health accessibility and address the opioid crisis. It should also provide more access to medicines that reverse overdoses like naloxone. I’ve worked to secure funding for this life-saving drug through my service on the Appropriations Committee. 
Working For You 
Here are some of the highlights from my last two weeks.  Promoting a Healthy Community   When it comes to health care, Congress should follow the same rules as doctors: first do no harm. I spoke with folks at the Coordinated Care Community Leaders Breakfast about ways to improve health care and the importance of protecting patients with pre-existing conditions. 
￼ 
Checking in With Local Businesses   I had another Kilmer At Your Company visit with Bradken Atlas, a local steel manufacturer that produces parts for the US Navy. 
￼ 
Lifting Families Up   Travelling around our community, I’ve seen how the United Way of Pierce County is building a coalition that’s united in its goal to lift 15,000 families out of poverty by 2028. Thanks to Dona Ponepinto for meeting with me! Count me as a partner in the work to create more economic opportunities for more people. 
￼ 
That’s all for now folks. As always, don’t hesitate to reach out if I can ever be of assistance. I’m honored to represent you.  Derek

Election Day is Tomorrow
￼
Tomorrow is Election Day in America, and I hope that everyone takes time to vote if you have not already. We are fortunate to live in a country with free elections and founded on the principle of governance by the people and for the people. We are also thankful for the brave men and women in the Armed Forces who have fought and sacrificed to protect our right to vote. On Election Day we are reminded of their service and we can honor it by exercising our voting rights.

Last Week in Congress
Wages and Salaries Post Fastest Growth in Decade
￼ ￼ Click here to read more from CNBC
The latest wage report shows that wages grew by a 3.1% annual rate last quarter - the largest jump in 10 years! This is outstanding news for the American worker, demonstrating how our booming economy is paying dividends for everyone. As the unemployment rate remains low, economists predict this wate growth will continue to accelerate. All of this success has been fueled by the tax reform and regulatory reform that I've supported in Congress, and I'm excited to see it helping workers in the Third District.
￼
Stellar October Jobs Report
￼ ￼ Click here to read more from the Associated Press
On top of the wage growth, the recent October jobs report showed that our economy gained a robust 250,000 jobs last month. This means that we've added over 4 million total jobs since the beginning of 2017! The unemployment rate remains at a 49-year low of 3.7%, and workers are making more money in those jobs. This is what the Great American Comeback looks like, and I am excited to see the heights that our economy will grow to as we continue this trend.

Community Vigil at Kehilath Israel Synagogue
￼ Kevin with community members at the vigil
Last Tuesday, we stood against Anti-Semitism at a community vigil at Kehilath Israel Synagogue in Overland Park to honor the Pittsburgh Jewish community who tragically lost 11 members in a hate-fueled attack. With many different faiths represented, we all prayed for peace, unity, and acceptance in our country.

Heart of America Veterans Stand Down
￼ Kevin greeting a veteran at the Stand Down
Last week I joined Heart of America Stand Down in KCK to support services to help homeless veterans. In Congress over the last two years, we’ve made important progress to support those who served. We’ve allocated a record amount of money for health programs at the VA, we’ve increased accountability measures to make sure no one falls through the cracks, and we’ve paid special attention to mental health services and opioid abuse prevention among veterans. Plus, we’ve updated veterans education and jobs programs so that the transition to civilian life can be as smooth and successful as possible.
Thank you to all the volunteers and organizations that came out to assist our veterans, and I especially want to congratulate Art Filmore and Bob Waechter for the support and services they have provided to homeless veterans over the years.

Yoder Visits Amazon in KCK to Discuss Wage Growth, Jobs
￼ Kevin touring the floor of the Amazon facility
As the economy booms, high quality jobs are increasing in our community. A great example is the Amazon Fulfillment Center in KCK, which just opened earlier this year. The KCK distribution center employs more than 2,000 people, and will add another 1,000 employees during the holiday season. Recently, Amazon announced that it will raise the minimum wage to $15/hour for all employees, including part-time and temporary employees. This is great news for the Third District workers employed here, and a prime example of how companies are using our growing economy to invest in American workers.

Chairman Yoder Conducts Infrastructure and Safety Tour of KS and MO Rivers
￼ Kevin on the tour with Mayor Alvey and USCG Capt. Stoermer
Last Wednesday, I toured the Kansas and Missouri Rivers with KCK Mayor David Alvey, the Fairfax Drainage District, the Kaw Valley Drainage District, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Kansas and Missouri Rivers are the lifeblood of our region, and I was pleased to see firsthand the impacts that federal investment in these rivers has on the Kansas City metro area.
The levees in Kansas City protect billions of dollars in assets and many lives from disastrous floods. Currently, hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding through the Army Corps of Engineers are being invested in raising and improving these levees, providing safety and peace of mind for the residents and businesses of our community. The Missouri River also fills a crucial role in our region’s transportation infrastructure, moving massive amounts of grain from Kansas farmers and helping our producers get their products to market efficiently. I would like to thank the Coast Guard and the Corps of Engineers for the insightful tour, and for the outstanding work they do every day to keep our rivers safe from floods and operational for commerce.
￼
New Century AirCenter
￼ Kevin touring the New Century AirCenter
It was a great visit to the New Century AirCenter in Gardner last week to see their operations and talk about the FAA Reauthorization Act, which Congress recently passed. This long term bill represents the longest funding authorization period for FAA programs since 1982. It will provide critical funding for the Airport Improvement Program, which provides federal grants for airport infrastructure projects to keep airports like this safe and up to date.
￼
New Roof for Local WWII Veteran
￼ Kevin with Terry Franz, Garen Armstrong, and WWII veteran Frank Giles
I'm thankful for the service and sacrifice of our nation's veterans, and on Tuesday I was honored to help Shamrock Roofing and Construction and Cars 4 Heroes surprise Frank Giles, a 93 year old WWll Veteran from Overland Park, with a new roof. Shamrock Roofing's ""Roof 4 a Hero"" program provides a free roof to a veteran who has served our country with honor and who deserves a new roof, and Frank was more than deserving. Our nation is safer as a direct result of the service of men and women who are willing to place themselves in harms way. Frank, thank you for your service.
Taking care of our veterans is a top priority for me. Earlier this month, I met with my Military and Veterans Affairs Advisory Committee to discuss the opioid crisis and treatment among veterans, improvements to the VA Choice program, Tricare benefits, and suicide prevention measures within the veteran community. I will continue to work and ensure veterans receive the care they deserve.
￼
Tour of Leawood Justice Center
￼ Kevin with Captain Finger and Mayor Dunn
Thank you Captain Dale Finger and Leawood Mayor Peggy Dunn for showing me around the Leawood Justice Center last week. This facility provides the Leawood Police Department with some of the best training and technology available. Thank you to all the brave men and women who put their lives on the line to protect and serve our community every day.

Olathe Public Schools Foundation Annual Breakfast

I always enjoy attending The Olathe Public Schools Foundation's annual breakfast benefitting the Olathe School District. I'm so proud of our local schools! Thanks to all the students, parents, teachers, staff, and community leaders for visiting with me. I'm working hard in Congress to promote local control and provide funding that helps our teachers and students thrive.
￼
Honoring Quindaro Historical Site
￼ Kevin presenting the bill to local Quindaro leaders
It was great meeting with local stakeholders like Freedom's Frontier National Heritage Area and my friend Marvin Robinson in KCK to celebrate the passage of my Quindaro Townsite National Commemorative Site Act through the House. This legislation will help Quindaro receive the federal recognition that it deserves. I presented a formal copy of the bill to go in the Quindaro Underground Railroad Museum.
￼
A&K Railroad in KCK
￼ Kevin touring the facility with A&K employees
Our economy is the healthiest it has been in a generation, and the tangible impacts of that fact are seen in high quality jobs at strong local businesses like at A&K Railroad in Kansas City, Kansas. Railroads are vital to Kansas City, which is home to the second largest rail hub in the United States, and it was great to tour A&K and visit with company leaders and some of the more than 120 employees to discuss positive impacts of the new tax code and the BRACE Act. This bill would leverage private sector investment in rail infrastructure by providing a tax credit of 50 cents for every dollar spent on track improvements, and will incentivize investment in short line railroads, which are critical in connecting Kansas businesses to the thousands rail customers in the national rail network. I will continue to support policies to help keep this economic momentum going.
￼
Celebration of Diwali
￼ Kevin at the Diwali celebration
Diwali, the festival of lights, celebrates the victory of good over evil. During this time, people celebrate by putting lights in their homes and enjoy games and food with family and friends. I was thankful to be included in the festivities Saturday night in Leawood. Happy Diwali!

Dear Lindsey:  
We are pleased to unveil the new look of our weekly newsletter. This new design features a cleaner, modern design that will better serve constituents by connecting you with the latest news and issues impacting our community, providing new opportunities to directly share your opinion with me, and sharing the services my office provides. This new streamlined design will better serve residents who are reading updates on-the-go on their mobile devices, while still connecting with those using desktop.  Additionally, we are releasing a set of issue one-pagers that summarize my work. In addition to the ones provide below, you can view these documents under our issues section on our website.  My hope is that this new design will facilitate greater engagement with the community, and I look forward to incorporating the feedback we receive into our work in Congress. The first edition is a snapshot of what we have accomplished thus far.
Sincerely, ￼ Mark DeSaulnier Member of Congress

Dear Friends, 
As a fourth generation Texan and the Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I know we must secure our southern border and fix our broken immigration system. That is why I introduced a very strong border security bill. It closed legal loopholes, which would prevent bad actors from entering our homeland, reformed our immigration system to a merit-based system, and found a legislative solution to DACA. Sadly, every Democrat voted against that bill.
As this migrant caravan approaches our southern border, we are painfully aware of the ramifications of their obstruction. But, I am continuing to do everything in my power to ensure these migrants do not illegally enter the United States. I have had multiple conversations with the Mexican Ambassador about how we can work together to stop these individuals while they are still in Mexico. The Ambassador has informed me they have offered the caravan members asylum in Mexico. Therefore, if they are truly fleeing persecution from their country, they have now found that safe refuge in Mexico. Unfortunately, Mexico has made it clear the majority of those who have been offered asylum, have turned it down. It is hard for me to comprehend why anyone would turn down this safety of asylum when fleeing violence.
I talked with Harris Faulkner on Fox News' ""Outnumbered Overtime"" to discuss the latest on the migrant caravan and the President's response. You can click here or on the image below to watch my full interview. 
￼ 
Earlier this week, I spoke with Bill Hemmer on ""America's Newsroom"" to give an update on the migrant caravan and the importance of border security. You can click here or on the image below to watch my full interview.

I applaud Attorney General Jeff Session’s announcement last week creating the China Initiative to combat China’s economic espionage. This initiative will “identify priority Chinese trade theft cases, ensure that we have enough resources dedicated to them, and make sure that we bring them to an appropriate conclusion quickly and effectively.” The Attorney General also highlighted that China is targeting our research labs and universities, even disseminating their propaganda across our college campuses. These are threats that I have been talking about for a long time. I am glad we finally have a President who is willing to take bold action and stand up to Chinese aggression. I look forward to working with the administration to accomplish these goals.

The U.S. Does Not Tolerate Hate 
I had the unique opportunity last week to fly in a B-17, the same plane my father flew as a bombardier during WWII. I even got to sit in the nose of the plane, the same place my dad sat as a young solider when he bombed the Nazis on D-Day. It was a powerful reminder about the work required to defend our freedoms and the responsibility we all have to secure a better America for our children. 
To ensure we never forget the absolute evil my dad's generation fought, I cosponsored the Never Again Education Act. This is a bipartisan piece of legislation that gives our teachers and students the resources to improve their learning of the Holocaust and the consequences of intolerance and hate. It is imperative that we stand united against this hateful ideology.

I'm sitting in the nose of a B-17, also known as the ""Flying Fortress.""

Here I am standing in front of the bomber just prior to takeoff.  
Back the Blue 
My heart continues to break for the Waller County Sheriff’s Office and the friends and family of Deputy Loren Vasquez, who died last week in a crash while she was responding to a call. Deputy Vasquez had served with the Waller County Sheriff's Office for only five months and was on her third shift after completing field training. This is such a tragic loss and my gratitude goes out to all of our law enforcement officers who serve as our thin blue line.

Double Dose of #TaxCutsandJobsAct Update 
Last year I voted for the first comprehensive tax reform package in over 30 years because I knew the American economy could do better. In less than a year, we have seen the economy growing once again and that means more jobs and more opportunities for hardworking Americans. The economy is booming and the good news keeps pouring in. Make sure to follow me on Twitter so you can keep up with the latest news resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  
Here is the news about consumer spending hitting an 18-year high.

11/5/18 17:29,Results for Eastern Washington,"
 
￼

Hello, 

My focus is, and always has been, on getting results for you and your families in Eastern Washington. This Congress, I've worked to pass 10 bills in the House, and 6 of these bipartisan bills have been signed into law. 

Because of my 6 bills that are now law: 
	•	People with ALS and other degenerative diseases have permanent access to speech-generating devices under Medicare.  
	•	People living with disabilities can now explore the workforce and save more of what they earn in ABLE Accounts.  
	•	Parents can now rollover 529 account funds for their children into ABLE accounts.  
	•	The Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program is extended and funding is more than doubled. This will help us bring more doctors to rural areas, where we face a shortage.  
	•	The Secure Rural Schools Program is extended to provide affected counties with essential services, funding for public education, and infrastructure maintenance.  
	•	More jobs and economic development are coming to Whitman County.  
In addition, I helped secure 12 additional tankers and the largest pay raise in nearly a decade for our troops serving at Fairchild. I have also worked to make college more affordable for our children, led to protect our dams, invested in our communities' infrastructure -- including our airports in Spokane, Pullman, and Walla Walla -- and more. For a comprehensive look at the results I've delivered for Eastern Washington, visit McMorris.house.gov/wins. 
Thanks, ￼ Cathy McMorris Rodgers Member of Congress

Friend-  At the beginning of the 115th Congress, Republicans set out to enact a bold policy agenda to leave folks better off now than they were two years ago. From every piece of my legislation that was signed into law to every vote I’ve taken, I’ve put the interests of the First District first as this Congress has worked to improve people’s lives. By countless metrics, we’ve delivered results. Our economy is thriving. We’re beginning to rebuild our military. We’ve fought back against the opioid crisis. We’re working to connect students with good-paying jobs.  That’s not all though. Here are some highlights from the 115th:
Built A Thriving Economy Reformed the Tax Code Cut Wasteful Spending Supported Our Defense Industrial Base Federally Recognized 6 Virginia Indian Tribes Repealed Burdensome Regulations Directed Federal Resources To Broadband Expansion Fully Funded Our Military Delivered a Pay Raise for our Service Members Improved Veteran's Health Care Expanded Veteran’s Access To Benefits Improved School Safety Provided Relief For Community Banks Passed Landmark Legislation to Fight the Opioid Epidemic Strengthened Career and Technical Education (CTE) and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Education Programs Increased Resources For Border Security Fought Against Human Trafficking Improved Resources For Mental Health Challenges Held the VA Accountable Supported America's Farmers
During all of the conversations I’ve had with constituents, I have seen the tangible impact these policies are having in the First District. This is what this job is about, providing results through my service to you. 
It's an honor to serve you and Virginia's First District in the People's House.
Sincerely,
Rob

Your October Recap
From Rep. Rod Blum
It has been a busy month in the First District. The Social Security Administration announced that benefits will increase in 2019, E15 sales will now be year-long, better trade deals are being negotiated, our economy continues to improve, and I had the opportunity to visit with hundreds of constituents to discuss issues ranging from immigration and criminal justice reform to tax credits and over-regulation on small businesses. 

  In the District

I support Governor Reynolds' appeal of FEMA's decision to deny individual assistance funds to those affected by the tornadoes in Marshalltown and extreme weather in other areas. I hope FEMA reconsiders this decision and our communities receive the needed assistance.
￼

￼
Congratulations to the Eastern Iowa Airport and the City of Cedar Rapids for beginning construction on the airport expansion for increased cargo and commerce. I am happy to have recommended this project for the FAA's $8.84 Million grant used toward this infrastructure investment. 
￼
￼
Some youth in my district don’t know of the tremendous opportunity they have in applying to the five esteemed U.S. Service Academies: United States Military Academy (West Point), United States Naval Academy, United States Coast Guard Academy, United States Merchant Marine Academy, and the United States Air Force Academy. This month, we brought the information, and representatives from each of the academies, straight to the students at high schools throughout the first district (like Linn Mar High School pictured below)! If you, or someone you know is interested in attending a service academy, click here for more information about the application process. My office is here to help. 
￼
￼
Thank you to the Northeast Iowa Food Bank in Waterloo for allowing me to serve 181 of my constituents healthy groceries. They run an efficient but compassionate program with the client at the center of your mission—commendable work! 
￼
￼
I checked on the rebuilding efforts in Marshalltown earlier this month. Public relief from FEMA will assist with infrastructure. As you saw in my letter above, Governor Reynolds and I are appealing to FEMA seeking individual assistance program dollars for the families impacted.
￼
￼
It was an honor to welcome police officers and the Iowa State Police Association to the City of Dubuque for their annual conference. I am so thankful and impressed by their incomparable professionalism and commitment to the Rule of Law.
￼
￼
A quick stop at Culvers in Marion for lunch on the road. I ran into Melissa with Dupaco, who’s working hard to advance financial literacy in the First District. Keep it up!
￼
￼
The Freedom Foundation is an amazing volunteer operation doing important work for our veterans in Cedar Rapids and throughout the First District-- all without using taxpayer dollars. It was an honor to speak with these veterans and serve lunch. Thank you for your service.
￼
￼
A grateful nation thanks U.S. Navy Vietnam Veteran, Mr. Steve Smith, for his service. It is my honor to present him with his service medals—a symbol of duty and sacrifice. If you, or someone you know would like help tracking down military medals or records, please reach out to my office. 
￼
￼
Senator Chuck Grassley and I had lunch with HiRail in Lisbon, IA to discuss their impressive products made from recycled tires. We also talked about the many small businesses that are thriving thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and reduced regulations that Senator Grassley and I were proud to support.
￼
￼
I ran a booth at the All The Way Home Tri-State Veterans event in Dubuque to talk with veterans about ways my office can assist in tracking down medals or records, and helping to solve issues with the Department of Veteran Affairs. Please contact my office if you, or a veteran you know is in need of assistance with the federal government. 
￼
￼
I interviewed with The Daily Iowan from the University of Iowa at the esteemed University of Northern Iowa dome. Good prospective journalists and insightful questioning!
￼
￼
 This month we held my second opioid informational conference at the Grout Museum in Waterloo. We discussed with healthcare professionals and legislators about the efforts being taken to create a fabric of solutions at the local, state, and federal level to solve this epidemic.
￼
￼
Thank you to the farmers of Mitchell and Worth Counties for joining me for an agriculture townhall in Osage, IA. Exciting things are happening with the announcement of E-15 year-round, and China is now moving our way on much-needed improvements to trade agreements.
￼
￼

￼
￼
A visit with trainees at New York Life in Hiawatha who are working as contractors, serving 17,000 eastern Iowans. We had an important discussion on the impact of various regulations on the insurance industry.

￼
￼
A big thank you to the Fountain of Youth in Dubuque and the leadership of Caprice Jones to help those facing barriers. Your curriculum of personal responsibility and positive influences is inspiring. I’m working to partner in this work through authoring bills like the Clean Slate Act in Congress.
￼
￼
An incredible declaration from Alliant Energy on the certification of 1300 acres of land as a “Mega Site”—now ready for development near the Eastern Iowa Airport- the only certified site this size in Iowa. Looking forward to the economic development, jobs, and growth which will occupy this space.

￼
Thank you to the Cedar Rapids Metro Optimists Club for hosting me earlier this month- great to talk with you all and answer questions about healthcare, political civility, and our booming economy.

TCS is a global insurance processing firm- recently relocated in Cedar Rapids- which employs nearly 1000, with plans to expand. It was my honor to tour, meet with the employees, and serve as the “honorary ribbon cutter” for the opening of their new training center. 
Congratulations to all!

￼


In Washington, D.C. 

I was very proud to introduce this legislation with Congresswoman Judy Chu to provide women with coverage of more options after a mastectomy. As breast cancer rates rise and we work towards a cure, it is important to help women fighting this battle and ensure they have options following this life-changing procedure.

Dear Friends,

October marked another important month of traveling across almost every county in the 10th District, visiting local businesses, attending forums to discuss the pressing policy areas facing our Nation, and helping constituents and veterans with casework issues. 

On Wednesday, it was great being in Walton County, where I spoke with community leaders about the outstanding work being done here at home, running for public office, and getting things done in Washington. I always enjoy meeting our future influencers, and these folks provided important feedback as we work to build a better tomorrow. Thanks for having me!
￼
￼
￼

Afterwards, I made my way over to Meggitt Training Systems for a site visit and learned about some of its new initiatives. Back in August, the company announced the testing and evaluation of the FATS 300LE training system for the Gwinnett County Sheriff's Office, which delivers virtual scenarios that train police officers in split-second, use-of-force situations, as well as de-escalation tactics to deploy in real-world settings. I was grateful to get a firsthand look at the different systems and software in place that train our law enforcement officers. 
￼
￼
￼

On Thursday morning, it warmed my heart to join my colleague, Congressman Rick Allen (GA-12), in presenting certificates of special recognition to local World War II veterans. After viewing the Honor Flight documentary, it was incredibly inspiring to see the students of Grovetown High flood the front of the auditorium to express their gratitude to the three WWII veterans who were present – bringing one of our heroes to the point of tears. 

Their dedication to the uniform has clearly encouraged young people today to follow in their footsteps to risk everything on behalf of the American people, and I’m forever grateful to those who fought to maintain our values and strengthen the freedoms that we enjoy each and every day. 
￼
￼
￼

Then, I spent that afternoon getting a tour of the growth in Columbia County and hearing about plans to develop a downtown Evans. The Plaza at Evans Towne Center will be a walkable multi-use downtown area anchored by a cultural arts center, the local library, and Evans Towne Center Park. A huge thanks to Reagan Williams, the New Homes Sales Manager at Meybohm Real Estate, and Robbie Bennett, the Columbia County Economic Development Executive Director, for taking time to show me around. Click here to see a virtual tour of the exciting developments coming our way. 
￼
￼

Later that evening, I joined members of the Clarks Hill Association for a legislative update and highlighted our robust economy, a renewed commitment to our military and veterans, and immigration policies. While there, I also took questions pertaining to the Army Corps of Engineers and its management of Clarks Hill Lake. Thanks for sharing your thoughts and providing feedback.

Manufacturing Legislative Excellence Award
So much of Georgia’s achievements in the manufacturing sector stem from the business-friendly environment and phenomenal workforce that has been cultivated and supported by our state officials and lawmakers. Republicans in Congress are building on those efforts by putting our manufacturing workers and companies on a level playing field with foreign competitors. From cutting burdensome and unnecessary regulatory red tape to simplifying the tax code with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, this Congress has undeniably moved the needle forward in helping our manufacturers succeed, and I am honored to be a recipient of this year’s Manufacturing Legislative Excellence Award for the 115th Congress.

I am constantly hearing from manufacturers right here in the community about how the actions taken by Congress have propelled their businesses forward, and I want to thank the National Association of Manufacturers for their hard work and partnership on behalf of our Nation’s manufacturing companies and workers. I certainly look forward to delivering more successes for these hardworking women and men! Learn more here.
 
Jobs, Jobs, Jobs
October turned out to be another booming month for the U.S. labor market, adding a whopping 250,000 jobs to the field, besting economists’ expectations and outpacing the yearly average. It's no surprise that consumer confidence is at its highest levels in nearly 18 years, and Americans all across the country are better off now than before. 

What’s more is the fact that wages have grown by 3.1 percent, the highest yet since the recession. With household incomes rising, increased consumer spending will continue to feed the growth of businesses, hiring, and wages moving forward. The U.S. Department of Labor’s October Jobs Report gives us clear evidence that we are on the right track. Learn more here.

By interning in my D.C. office, students will gain the opportunity to work closely with legislative staff, provide tours of our Nation’s capital, and learn about the inner workings of Congress. Being a part of one of my district offices gives local interns a chance to personally serve 10th District constituents with casework and other local projects of importance.

Our Nation and community are blessed to have courageous warriors who served in order to protect our freedom and our democracy, and I invite these patriots to come by 100 Court Street as we celebrate and honor their service to America.   As always, I’m here to serve you.

WJBF News Channel 6 @ 7 Augusta, GA – 11/1 Honor Flight Event  Editorial: Keep that momentum Augusta Chronicle – 11/3 Jody Hice has heard it and heard it and heard it. The Republican representing Georgia’s District 10 in the U.S. House of Representatives keeps getting lectured to by critics, telling him supposedly how bad things are. But when Hice spoke to a group in Columbia County a couple of weeks ago, he let the audience in on his response to those critics. It’s the ultimate comeback. He asks them: Are you better off now than you were two years ago? Even if folks don’t like President Trump, and even if they don’t like his policies, “the answer always is yes,” Hice said.
POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: Voters hit polls for general election, special municipal votes Tuesday Gwinnett Daily Post – 11/3 Hice receives award from manufacturers group: The National Association of Manufacturers recently named U.S. Rep. Jody Hice as the recipient of its Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence. Hice’s office said the congressman received a 100 percent score on the association’s 115th congressional Voting Record. The award is designed to recognize members of Congress who support issues that are important to manufacturers. “A thriving manufacturing sector puts people to work, drives growth and bolsters our economy and I am proud to be associated with the outstanding work the NAM is doing on behalf of manufacturers in Georgia and across the nation,” Hice said in a statement.  Congressman visits with veterans at Jefferson County Leisure Center Augusta Chronicle – 11/1 U.S. Congressman Jody Hice (Ga.-10) visited the Jefferson County Leisure Center in Louisville Saturday, Oct. 27. This was the second Annual Helping Our Heroes Hice has held in the county. The event is a show of appreciation for veterans. There was a continental breakfast and turkey giveaway. There were representatives from a variety of organizations providing veterans with information on topics such as filing claims, veteran housing, employment, benefits and suicide prevention. “If anyone deserves red-carpet treatment, it’s our service members, veterans and their families,” Hice said in a press release.
KIRBY: Battlefields, book deals and church choirs Augusta Chronicle – 11/2 One of the most successful regional military victories of the American Revolution took place in February 1779 when a force of 350 Patriots routed 800 British Loyalists at the battle of Kettle Creek. The long effort to preserve that site in present-day Wilkes County got a recent boost when Congressman Jody Hice asked the Secretary of Interior to evaluate it for consideration as a designated unit of the National Park System. Earlier this year Hice joined former coach Vince Dooley and representatives from the American Battlefield Trust, to announce the acquisition of 180 acres for the battlefield park.
Here's how politicians celebrated Halloween The Hill – 11/1 Other lawmakers sharing Halloween costumes included Reps. Susan Brooks (R-Ind.), Jody Hice (R-Ga.) and Sean Duffy (R-Wis.). Retiring Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), who was born in Cuba, dressed up with multiple generations of her family, and shared a sweet message about her first Halloween in the U.S.
Hice: Congressman says he's stood up for local values Walton Tribune – 10/28 It’s been an incredible honor to represent the 10th District of Georgia in Washington, D.C. Upon running, I said I would stand for the values of this district, the values of this state, and I’m proud to say I’ve stood firmly for life, for the Constitution, for the Second Amendment, for religious liberties. I’ve stood firmly behind the president to lower taxes, to lower health care costs, to defend our military, to fund our military, so that we are once again the most powerful nation on the earth, capable of defending ourselves against any foe that we many face.
Congressional candidates weigh in on health care, immigration Gwinnett Daily Post – 10/30 But Hice said that while health care is the nation’s biggest issue, the system established under the Affordable Care Act “failed miserably” and that individual and employer mandates should be eliminated. On the immigration topic, he said border security is the top priority. “I believe that building the wall on the southern border is crucial to the well-being and safety of our country,” Hice said. “I am opposed to granting amnesty to the over 12 million illegal aliens currently residing in the United States. Our nation is guided by a set of core principles and the rule of law, and we cannot reward illegal behavior with any form of amnesty or citizenship.”

Dear Friends, 
Last week the nation found a thread of unity as people of all faiths joined to mourn the deaths and honor the memories of the 11 people murdered as they worshiped in a Pittsburgh synagogue.  In our own local community, I attended a city-wide gathering of more than 1,000 people in the Loop, and a beautiful interfaith community gathering in Glencoe, both with faith leaders of different religious traditions.  On Friday evening and Saturday, I was proud to join millions of Jewish-Americans, and Americans of all faiths, gathered in prayer and standing up to anti-Semitism, racism, xenophobia and hate.  Throughout the week, it was inspiring to see Americans of different religious backgrounds come together and embrace every American’s right to freely practice their faith. We must continue to foster unity in our nation, denounce divisiveness, and preserve the uniquely American ideal of ""E Pluribus Unum” (From Many, One).  
In other news, this first week of November brings two very important dates to be aware of: 
	•	Election Day is tomorrow, Tuesday, November 6 
	•	Open Enrollment for 2019 health plans through the Affordable Care Act began on November 1 and lasts until December 15
Last, but not least, on Friday, November 9th, I am pleased to host a breakfast honoring veterans at Cristo Rey  St. Martin College Prep High School in Waukegan. The breakfast is free and open to all veterans in Illinois’s Tenth Congressional District. I hope to see you there.
Please read on below for more information on both of these topics and updates my work throughout our district over the past week.  
  
ELECTION DAY IS TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 6  
Election Day is this Tuesday, November 6. Polling places in Illinois are open from 6:00am until 7:00pm CT. 
Voting is among our most important rights as citizens in a democracy, and a way to make your voice heard about the direction of our country. If you have not already voted early, I encourage you to use the Illinois State Board of Elections website to check your Election Day polling precinct ahead of Tuesday.
Check your registration status and polling place location here.  
  
SIGN-UP NOW FOR 2019 HEALTHCARE DURING ACA OPEN ENROLLMENT 
￼ 
  
For most people, the open enrollment period is your only chance to pick or make changes to the health insurance that works best for you and your family for the next year. In 2018, open enrollment lasts from November 1 to December 15. 
You can find plans with no-cost preventative care – like flu shots and mammograms. You may also be eligible for help – most people using HealthCare.gov qualify for financial assistance. 
If you have any questions – our office is here to help. Call us anytime at (847) 383-4870. 
  
WORKING TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH IN WAUKEGAN AND GURNEE 
Every family should have safe breathing air, and we need strict and enforceable environmental standards to guarantee our public health. Like many constituents, I am concerned by recent reports in the Chicago Tribune about emissions from two facilities in Waukegan and Gurnee. I’ve joined Sens. Durbin and Duckworth seeking more information and monitoring of these sites to ensure we have the facts and that emissions are reduced to non-threatening levels. The EPA needs to take steps to embrace transparency by making all test data publicly available and holding a public meeting so residents have confidence in the safety of their community. We must also ensure EPA’s regulations reflect the most up-to-date research and public health data on the dangers of ethylene oxide and other industrial chemicals.
Read a letter I sent to the EPA with Sens. Durbin and Duckworth requesting these steps.

WEEKLY WRAP-UP 
￼ 
As we head in to Veteran’s Day Weekend, I joined Waukegan Township for their annual luncheon for community members who served our nation. 
  
￼ 
  
I was glad to stop by and make some new friends at the North Chicago Public Library 90th anniversary celebration. Here’s to many more years serving the community! 
  
￼ 
  
This week, we completed a series of #BradAtYourBusiness visits with local employers. It was great to visit Klein Tools in Lincolnshire and learn about their partnership with Project HOOD Communities running a program to help young people from underprivileged backgrounds pursue careers in the trades. This is a great example of vocational training creating opportunity and closing the skills gap.
  
￼ 
  
Good discussions with the team at UPS during another #BradAtYourBusiness visit. Their Northbrook location employs more than 400 people.
  
￼ 
Glad to have a behind the scenes tour of the Deer Path Inn in Lake Forest, which employs more than 140 people. Three out of every five hotels are considered small businesses. #BradAtYourBusiness
  
￼ 
Discussed infrastructure, tariffs, and driver shortages during my visit to Kloss Distributing Co, a beer distributor operating in Lake County since 1973. #BradAtYourBusiness 
  
￼ 
I talked with the Yard Ramp Guy about his small business which rents, sells and buys new and used yard ramps throughout the United States #BradAtYourBusiness 
  
￼ 
I was glad to support the work of Community Youth Network (CYN), a non-profit counseling center, at their 40th anniversary celebration in Waukegan. 
  
￼
  
I was glad to be in Glenview last week for the State of the Village address with President Jim Patterson to keep up on issues affecting the community. 
Thanks for reading!

Dear fellow South Carolinians,  Thank you for subscribing to my weekly e-newsletter, and please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.  
Women Veteran’s Event With Veterans Day approaching next week, I hope you will join me this Saturday, November 10th, in Columbia for a special event honoring South Carolina’s women veterans. All South Carolinians, whether you are a veteran or just a proud American, are encouraged to RSVP and come!  In addition, I recently was happy to announce a special keynote speaker: my friend and colleague, Sen. Joni Ernst. As a combat veteran herself, I am so excited to welcome her back to the Palmetto State and look forward to having her join us at the event. I have no doubt that her passion, story, and mission will resonate with South Carolina’s 43,000 women veterans.  We will be releasing short videos of some veterans we sat down with, as they shared their experiences and stories. You can watch our first clip here. You can learn more about the event here, and RSVP at www.scott.senate.gov/veteransrsvp. 
Sincerely, ￼  Tim

Dear Friend,  Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to read about some of last week’s highlights here in Texas.   Getting An Update On Ellington Operations Recently, I toured Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base with several of the base’s Commanders. We also discussed base updates, National Guard operations and my work in Congress to support our military, including a pay raise for our troops, which was part of the most recent National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). It was helpful to hear about the issues that are directly affecting our troops at Ellington so that I can best represent their needs in DC. ￼  Rep. Pete Olson tours Ellington Field JRB   Sugar Land Mayor Zimmerman Honored For His Work Helping Small Businesses I joined the Fort Bend Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Conference of Mayors and representatives from our local Sugar Land government for their Small Business Day in Sugar Land event. The Small Business Administration's Tim Jeffcoat spoke about how his agency can help local small businesses grow and thrive. Also, Sugar Land Mayor Zimmerman was awarded the 2018 Partner America Small Business Advocate Award. Congratulations Mayor Zimmerman! Thanks for all you do for our Sugar Land community! ￼  Rep. Pete Olson, Sugar Land City Councilwoman Jennifer Lane and Sugar Land Mayor Joe Zimmerman   Honoring A Local Veteran I was honored to attend the Meadowbrook Farms Golf Club Birdies for the Brave Golf Tournament on Saturday. It was a pleasure to thank our veterans wounded in combat and their families for their service and sacrifice. During the tournament, Specialist Tyler Cleghorn was awarded a mortgage free home. Veterans like SPC Cleghorn risk everything to keep us safe and as a veteran myself, it is always an honor to recognize our heroes for their service.  ￼  Rep.

Every Vote Counts 
Dear Friends, 
Tomorrow, November 6, 2018, is Election Day across America.   
This is the most important election of our lifetime.  This election is about what direction we want to go in as a state and country, and who we believe will fight for the issues most important to us.  
My hope is that all North Carolinians will go to the polls tomorrow and let their voices be heard.  So, tomorrow on Election Day, gather your family members, friends, church members, neighbors, co-workers, sorority sisters, fraternity brothers, and everyone you know, and go to the polls to support the candidates you feel will fight for you and your vision for the future of North Carolina.
Five Election Day reminders: 
	•	To cast a ballot on Election Day in North Carolina, you must be registered to vote.  Check your voter registration status here.
	•	Prepare to vote by downloading your sample ballot to view all voting instructions, candidates, and measures that will appear on your ballot.
	•	On Election Day, voters should go to their assigned voting precinct.  Find your Election Day voting precinct location here.  
	•	If you show up to vote and your name is not on the voter list, you may request a provisional ballot which will allow your vote to be counted after your registration is confirmed. If you cast a provisional ballot, about 10 days after the election you may check the status of your ballot here.
	•	If you have a question or concern, contact your county’s board of elections.
Polls are open on Tuesday, November 6 from 6:30AM to 7:30PM (EST).  Remember- any voter in line as of 7:30PM will be permitted to vote.

BREAKING: More good news!

Dear Lindsey,
Month after month since our pro-growth agenda was implemented, we have seen our economy continually grow. Through increased job growth, rising wages, and record low unemployment, Minnesotans and Americans across the country are better off now than they were just two years ago.
Most recently, the Department of Labor reported that wages are growing at the fastest rates since the 2008 recession. Hourly earnings increased by 3.1 percent over the last year, and with more money coming in, individuals and families have more savings to put toward vacations, education, or even an extra grocery run for the month.
Rising wages indicate both a steadily strengthening economy and increased business growth. The economy added 250,000 jobs in October. Including this past month, the economy has averaged an increase of 213,000 jobs per month in 2018 – exceeding the average monthly jobs growth of the prior two years.
This growth means more Minnesotans are finding work, and a wide variety of job fields including construction, manufacturing, and education and health services are expanding. The national unemployment rate dropped to 3.7 percent in September, the lowest level since 1969. In addition, our labor participation rate is beginning to increase, with over a million Americans entering or re-entering the labor force.
Americans are seeing more economic growth and job opportunity than years past and it’s a sign of greater national prosperity. I’m proud to have worked on multiple economic initiatives, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that have benefited residents of the Second District. As I work on this and other issues, I always like to hear directly from you.  Please share any thoughts you may have through my website, and sign up for my e-mail newsletter for the latest updates from Washington, D.C. and around the district. You can also stay on top of my work by following my Facebook and Twitter pages. Please feel free to call my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-2271 or my local Burnsville office at 651-846-2120 with any comments or for assistance with a federal agency.

Sincerely,

Have You Made a Plan to Vote Tomorrow? 
The most important title in America is not congressman, senator or even president -- it’s your title of citizen. This Tuesday, you can exercise the hard-won right to vote. If voting didn’t matter, there wouldn’t be so many voter suppression efforts around the country. Voting equals POWER. Please use your power Tuesday and VOTE!
Do you know where your polling place is? You can find out at www.votespa.com, the Philadelphia City Commissioners’ website or by calling the Philadelphia Voter Registration Office at 215-686-1590. 
Have you planned what time you want to go vote? The polls will be open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday. If you’re still in line at 8 p.m., you have to be allowed to vote. 
I was inspired by a 101-year-old North Philadelphia man and his message this week about voting. He couldn’t vote until he was in his 40s because of the threat of lynching in the South. You can click here to watch a short video of his comments. 
  
Mourning Lives Lost, Condemning Hate, Calling for Gun Reform
The victims of the Pittsburgh shooting, and victims of gun violence in Philadelphia and across the country, are in my thoughts and prayers. They also deserve action from their government to reduce gun violence, including passage of real gun safety reform, which I strongly support.   Both the Pittsburgh shooting and the recent Kentucky shooting of two African Americans in a grocery store should be federally investigated as hate crimes. And all leaders must make clear that hate, including anti-Semitic hate, has no home here.   I saw the unity in our area the day after the Pittsburgh outrage when I participated in an interfaith vigil. I wish the man in the White House would make a clear, unequivocal statement about this -- and, more importantly, stick to it. 
Working for You
I believe you should receive your money in real time! I recently joined with Congressional Black Caucus colleagues to urge the Federal Reserve to require real-time payments. That would help many people avoid overdraft fees, high-cost small-dollar credit and check cashing.
And I’ll keep pushing to increase the minimum wage, even though President Trump’s top economic advisor just publicly denounced the idea of even having a minimum wage. I stand with working people who are overdue for a raise - $7.25 an hour is not enough to live on!

GOP Plans to Cut Social Security and Medicare Are Real - And They Must be Stopped
￼  These seniors clearly understand what GOP leaders fail to recognize: Social Security and Medicare are not “entitlements.” They are earned benefits we pay into from our very first day on the job - and they are not to be used to pay for tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires and wealthy corporations.  
Dear Friend,  
Let’s be clear about Social Security and Medicare. They are not “entitlements.” Social Security and Medicare are earned benefits we pay into from our very first day on the job. No two government programs have done more over the years to lift tens of millions of Americans out of poverty, double the life span over just a few generations, and help build the greatest middle class the world has ever known.
That’s why I’ve introduced legislation to ensure NO CUTS to Social Security or Medicare. No cuts in any bill, resolution or conference report. And why I have joined 173 of my House colleagues and numerous members of the Senate in cosponsoring the Social Security 2100 Act to boost benefits and require those who earn $400,000 a year or more to pay a little more to keep the program solvent. 
Republican Senate GOP Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other GOP leaders have also been clear about their plans for Social Security and Medicare. They’re targeting drastic cuts to both programs. Why? Because they are desperate to find a way to pay for their $1.5 trillion tax cut – 80 percent of which goes to benefit millionaires, billionaires and wealthy corporations – and the $779 billion deficit they racked up in 2018 alone because the rich are paying less in taxes.
Senator McConnell has candidly admitted that after the midterm elections, he and other GOP leaders will try and sell these cuts based on the preposterously false notion that Social Security and Medicare are, in his words, “the real drivers” of the federal deficit.
Speaker Paul Ryan has gone even further, nonsensically terming Social Security and Medicare “giant entitlements” that threaten to “drive our federal government and national economy to collapse.” 
As I have pointed out many times before, the real truth is that neither Social Security nor Medicare are in debt. Quite the opposite – the Social Security Trust Fund is carrying a surplus of roughly $2.8 trillion according to the auditors and accountants in charge. According to many credible studies, simply raising the cap on the amount of earnings subject to payroll taxes - currently $128,400 - by a modest amount would ensure the viability of Social Security for at least 75 more years.  
And Medicare will remain solvent well into the 2030’s. So there’s plenty of time to fix what needs fixing in both programs – without cuts to benefits or resorting to risky Republican privatization schemes to turn Social Security over to Wall Street bankers and brokers, and Medicare over to the costly, for-profit health care insurance industry.
Here’s the bottom line. Social Security and Medicare belong to the American people. We cannot and must not permit these funds to be used to pay for tax cuts to millionaires, billionaires and wealthy corporations.
We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email. 
Sincerely,  ￼

The Social Security 2100 Act - This is What Protecting and Expanding Social Security Looks Like 
￼  Our old friend Steve Sack, Pulitzer Prize winning cartoonist for the Minneapolis Star Tribune, nailed GOP efforts to privatize Social Security way back in 2004. Our Social Security 2100 Act would expand benefits and ensure the integrity of the fund without a risky privatization scheme to turn Social Security over to billionaire Wall Street bankers. 
As noted in the letter above, in response to the attack on Social Security being planned by the President and GOP leaders, I’ve joined 173 of my House colleagues and numerous others in the U.S. Senate in cosponsoring the Social Security 2100 Act. Here’s a quick summary of what our bill would accomplish: 
The Social Security 2100 Act Expands Benefits 
	•	Bumps up benefits for current and new beneficiaries – Provides a 2% increase for all beneficiaries.  
	•	Protects against inflation – Improves the annual cost of living adjustment (COLA) formula to help seniors who spend a greater portion of their income on health care and other necessities.  
	•	Protects low-income workers –The new minimum benefit will be set at 25% above the poverty line.  
	•	Cuts taxes for beneficiaries – Over 10 million Social Security recipients would see a tax cut.  Presently, your Social Security benefits are taxed if you have non-Social Security income exceeding $25,000 for an individual or $32,000 for couples.  Our measure would raise that threshold to $50,000 and $100,000 respectively.  
	•	Holds SSI, Medicaid, and CHIP Beneficiaries Harmless – Ensures that any increase in benefits from the bill do not result in a reduction in SSI benefits or loss of eligibility for Medicaid or CHIP.
The Social Security 2100 Act Strengthens the Trust Fund   
	•	Millionaires and billionaires would pay the same rate as everyone else – Presently, payroll taxes are not collected on wages over $128,400. This legislation would apply the payroll tax to wages above $400,000.  This provision would only affect the top 1% of wage earners - and ensure the viability of Social Security for many decades to come. 

Minnesota Grants Key Permits for PolyMet Mining Project 
More reason to be optimistic that PolyMet will bring hundreds of good-paying union jobs to northern Minnesota, advancing 21st Century mining, our nation’s “green” economy, and the battle against climate change and global warming
￼  According to industry sources, every new wind turbine contains at least 335 tons of steel and 4.7 tons of copper. And America has one of the fastest growing markets for wind power in the world – about 30% of all global wind-based electricity is generated here in the U.S.A. Wind turbines like these dot the skyline across southern and western Minnesota. 
After 14 years and the longest, most rigorous environmental review process in state history, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) issued several key permits last week to move PolyMet’s proposed NorthMet copper-nickel mining project forward in northern Minnesota.
For the last several years, my staff and I have been working behind the scenes to bring all the federal and state agencies involved together on a regular basis to keep the process moving. And now, the issuance of these permits gives us even more reason to be optimistic that PolyMet will bring hundreds of good-paying union jobs to northern Minnesota, advancing 21st Century mining, our nation’s “green” economy, and the battle against climate change and global warming. 
For example, as I have pointed out many times before, new, clean, hybrid cars require more than a ton of iron, steel, copper, nickel, and nickel-based aluminum. Wind turbines, which reduce carbon-based air pollution and our dependency on fossil fuels, contain enormous amounts of copper and steel. And every computer, smart phone, iPad and printer contain precious minerals found in great abundance across Minnesota’s Iron Range. 
The simple fact is, we have limited choices on how we get these strategic minerals. While we can recycle a certain percentage, the experts tell us recycling will never take the place of mining – not even by half. 
So we are left with two options: Either import the lion’s share of our strategic minerals from foreign nations such as China and many poor developing countries, where environmental standards and worker protections barely exist. Or, we can mine them right here at home, where we control the process, create good-paying American jobs, and strictly adhere to the most rigorous environmental rules and regulations in the world. 
In my judgment, the latter choice makes the most ethical, moral, and economic common sense. So I commend Governor Mark Dayton, the Minnesota DNR, PolyMet, and all the other state and federal agencies involved for their cooperation and hard work in moving this process forward. 

President's Plan to Send 15,000 Troops to the Mexican Border Could Carry $110 Million Price Tag
￼  A great many of the people traveling on foot toward the U.S. to seek legal asylum are women and children fleeing from violence in their native Honduras. 
It would cost U.S. taxpayers up to $110 million for the President to carry out his announced plan to deploy 15,000 active-duty troops to the Mexican border in response to caravans of Central American migrants making their way northward toward the U.S. 
That’s the word from the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a highly regarded Washington, D.C. think tank specializing in defense policy analysis and planning. If the deployment lasts beyond mid-December, that $110 million figure would increase significantly as time goes on, the Center also reported. 
Think about it. There are already roughly 23,000 federal enforcement officers on the border. Add to that 15,000 troops, and the number of military and enforcement personnel jumps to 38,000. If we assume that all 7,000 migrants will actually reach the U.S. border, which they won’t, we would have about five U.S. enforcement officers dedicated to stopping each and every man, women and child attempting to cross - including the majority who will seek asylum legally. 
Quite frankly, that verges on insanity - a crazy and tragic waste of human resources.  
Now consider what might also be done with $110 million. We could, for example:
	•	Triple funding for cancer research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for 2019.  
	•	Rebuild at least 10 of the 69 Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schools assessed to be unsafe and in urgent need of replacement.  
	•	Boost 2019 funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) by 33%.  
	•	Reduce 44 million student loans by an average of 10% each.  
	•	Buy 36 million school lunches for students in need.
And that’s just to name a few.
Obviously, we must protect and secure our border with Mexico. But the Administration has yet to make a convincing case to Congress or the American people that spending $110 million taxpayer dollars to deploy 15,000 troops is the best way to do it. These migrants, most of whom are fleeing from violence and poverty in Honduras and intending to seek legal asylum in the U.S., are still weeks away and traveling on foot. And at this point, they are unlikely to pose anything resembling a military threat to the Homeland. 

Our Week in Duluth
￼  Last week I met with several members of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund in Duluth where I learned more about the importance of supporting advocacy efforts in Congress for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). I am proud to be a member of the Congressional Diabetes Caucus and will continue to support efforts to battle this terrible disease. 
￼  My wife, Mary, and I had a great time visiting with friends at the Duluth Area Chamber of Commerce Annual Dinner last night at the beautiful DECC - Duluth Entertainment and Convention Center. I was thrilled to listen to my good friend Al Hodnik, Minnesota Power ALLETE Company CEO, who was the keynote speaker. The Duluth Area Chamber of Commerce is a great resource and advocate for businesses and is doing their part to make Duluth’s economy even stronger.
Our Week in Mora
￼  The East Central Housing Organization (ECHO) held their monthly meeting last week to address housing needs in the southern five counties of the 8th District. This month's meeting was held at the new MYSA House in Mora, which has 24 beautiful housing units. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen attended the meeting.  
Our Week in Brainerd 
￼  The City of Brainerd and its Downtown Businesses celebrated the completion of the Business Highway 371/ South Sixth Street reconstruction project. The project improved the road surface, sidewalks, underground water and sewer utilities, and railroad crossing. In this picture, Brainerd Mayor Ed Menk cuts the ribbon. Nolan Field Representatives Tiffany Stenglein and John Schrader attended the event on my behalf.

Supporting Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst 
￼
Congressman Chris Smith and I joined leadership from Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst for a ribbon cutting at the 87FSS Flight Deck Community Center. This new facility will give our service members and all employees of the Joint Base an area to gather and enjoy arcade games, and a movie theater, among other activities. I will continue to vote for robust military funding and policies that support the Joint Base.
  
Elderfest: Helping Seniors 
￼ 
My staff and I held a mobile office at Elderfest in Toms River. My office is always here to help. In fact, we’ve helped return nearly $5 million to South Jersey seniors from the Social Security Administration. If we can ever be of any assistance please don’t hesitate to contact me:  https://macarthur.house.gov/services/help-with-a-federal-agency  
  
Thank you to our First Responders  
￼
It was great meeting with the Mount Laurel Fire Department to discuss issues facing firefighters. I’ve been a consistent supporter of SAFER grants and worked to ensure that there were no changes to the World Trade Center Health Program. Thanks to all first responders for their service.
 
Federal Tax Cuts Empowering Workers 
￼ 
I recently visited with local UPS employees in South Jersey. We had a great discussion on how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has allowed UPS to increase their employees’ pension program and expand investment by $12 billion. Small business optimism is the highest it has ever been, wages are rising, and unemployment is at a near 50-year low.
  
Small Businesses are the Backbone of our Economy 
￼ 
Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and I always enjoy visiting local restaurants and shops when I travel throughout the district. I stopped in Toms River to meet with staff at a great new Italian restaurant, and they showed me around the kitchen. Their optimism and excitement were incredible--as was their food!
  
I won’t ever be blinded by partisanship and I refuse to take part in the partisan dysfunction that prevents progress. The nonpartisan Lugar Center at Georgetown University recently named me again among the most bipartisan members of Congress, because I work against Washington dysfunction and stand up for Burlington and Ocean Counties. If I can ever be of any assistance, please visit my website or contact my office: http://macarthur.house.gov.      Sincerely,   ￼

Friends, 
I hope you are enjoying the transition to fall; it seems like the weather is planning to give us all four seasons in just the span of one week. 
I’ve definitely enjoyed the spring-like weather, and have spent the past few months traveling around the Second District and speaking with families about issues that matter to them. I’ve had many important conversations about healthcare access, the high cost of prescription drugs, local economic development, corruption in Washington, the raging opioid epidemic, and gun violence. Across the board, nearly everyone has raised the same issue: Congress isn’t working for families.
Sadly, too many in Congress have catered to special interests instead of working for the people. That means that many of the things that families care about, like affordable healthcare and stopping gun violence, have been put on the back burner or completely ignored, especially under Republican House leadership.
Despite these challenges, I’m proud that I’ve found effective ways to work across the aisle and get things done in this tough environment.  In fact, three bipartisan bills that I’ve led have become law this Congress and another is on the cusp of passing soon. Regardless of what party controls Congress, I plan to keep working for you –  because Illinois families are what matter.
Best,  
￼  Robin 
PS – Election Day is November 6th. Polls in Illinois are open from 6am to 7pm. You can find more details at the State Board of Elections’ website. 

More than 300 Attend 6th Annual Hiring Event                                                        
￼
A few weeks ago, I hosted my 6th Annual Hiring Event. The event featured more than 50 employers looking to hire right now and it helped connect them with 300 of our neighbors who are looking for a job, a career or a career change. After six years, this program keeps getting better and better and I’m proud that my team and I can help people find opportunities to grow, thrive and succeed. 
  

Open Enrollment Is Now Open
￼
The 2019 open enrollment period has begun. Families have until December 15th to purchase insurance, compare prices and coverage options and make sure they remain healthy in 2019.  Illinois families can visit www.getcovered.illinois.gov and others can visit www.healthcare.gov. Be sure to get covered! 
  

Action for Dental Health Act Passes U.S. Senate 
￼
I’m proud to announce that my bipartisan Action for Dental Health Act has passed the U.S. Senate. The bill will better target existing federal resources and programs to deliver early and comprehensive oral and dental healthcare, especially to children, seniors and veterans. Since the Senate slightly amended the bill, it will receive one final House vote before moving to the President’s desk.

Dear Lindsey, 
Our economy and job market just keep getting stronger. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, 250,000 jobs were created in October. This marks over 2.1 million jobs created since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act became law! In the House, we built on this landmark legislation with Tax Reform 2.0, which makes your tax cuts permanent. There is still more work to be done to strengthen our economy, and we will continue rolling back regulations that burden hard-working Americans and Main Street businesses.
￼
Since my first day in Congress, supporting the most vulnerable in our society has been my mission. November is National Adoption Month, and I believe we can make a difference in the lives of precious children in Missouri who are in need of foster and adoptive parents. There are many ways that members of our community can help care for these children. For more information, contact the Foster and Adoptive Care Coalition located in Brentwood. 
 ￼
October 27th was the Drug Enforcement Administration’s National Drug Take-Back Day. People from across St. Louis County, St. Charles County, and Jefferson County came together and did their part to dispose of unused or expired prescription drugs. The St. Louis County Police Department alone collected 815 pounds of medications. This was a fantastic opportunity for folks to pitch in and combat the opioid epidemic.   Last week, I had the pleasure of visiting with a couple of our region’s outstanding law enforcement officers, Eureka Police Chief Mike Wiegand and Chesterfield Police Captain Mike Thompson. I always enjoy discussing how best I can serve our community. Thanks for stopping by the office!

Securing our borders is critical to securing our communities


￼

What’s New:
President Trump recently ordered more than 5,000 U.S. troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to bolster our security in Operation Faithful Patriot. These troops will provide logistical support to U.S. Border Patrol agents and help keep our country safe and enforce the rule of law.
The migrant caravans that originated in Central America are still making their way up toward our southern border. The first caravan is estimated to have over 3,500 migrants and the second has over 3,000. According to the Department of Homeland Security, there are over 270 individuals with criminal histories – including gang members – along the caravan route.
Considering the threat to our communities, I believe President Trump is right to send our troops to the southern border.
Why It Matters:
These caravans have already demonstrated violence against security forces in the countries they have entered. Between Honduras and Guatemala, the caravan violently pushed past Guatemalan security forces. The caravan entered Mexico by nearly causing a riot on a border crossing bridge and then illegally crossed a river into Mexico.
The United States is a nation of laws and strength. We cannot, and will not, allow caravans of thousands of migrants to abuse our asylum program and threaten our security. The approaching caravans also demonstrate why we must end catch and release and stop funding sanctuary cities.
What’s Next:
One caravan is reportedly about 700 miles from our border. I will continue to support the President in his effort to protect our borders and keep our communities safe.  
Survey:
Do you support President Trump’s decision to bolster our security by sending troops to the U.S.-Mexico border? 
Yes
No

Dear Friends,  
It's been a busy fall in the Fifth Congressional District. I traveled around the district to meet with high school students as a guest speaker for the ""Pathways to Opportunity"" government outreach program. The annual summit is one of my favorite events because I get to speak with our next generation of leaders about how they can become involved in their communities. Seminars were hosted this year at Lock Haven University, Pitt Titusville and Pitt Bradford. After meeting so many talented and dynamic students, I know our future looks bright. 
I was also proud to welcome the 19th Chief of the U.S. Forest Service Vicki Christiansen to the Allegheny National Forest in Warren. The ANF is Pennsylvania's only National Forest and it is vital to the region. I was delighted to show Chief Christiansen just how much we've accomplished. 
Thank you for reading this brief update, and please don't hesitate to contact me if I can assist you with a federal issue. 
Sincerely,  ￼  U.S. Representative Glenn 'GT' Thompson 


U.S. Forest Chief Visits Allegheny National Forest
￼ 
Congressman 'GT' Thompson welcomed U.S. Forest Chief Vicki Christiansen to the Allegheny National Forest (ANF), and they underscored the need to keep the forest healthy and build upon past successes in the region.   Congressman Thompson, Chief Christiansen, ANF Acting Supervisor Chris Cook and local leaders toured the forest and discussed the Good Neighbor Authority Master Agreement, timbering and forest management in the ANF, and the stalled Farm Bill. Chief Christiansen is the 19th Chief of the Forest Service.   “I appreciate Chief Christiansen’s willingness to come to Warren County today and meet with us,” said Congressman Thompson, Vice Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. “We all know how vital the forest is to the region and I am grateful we have an experienced leader in Chief Christiansen. She has an impressive background and I am delighted to welcome her to the Allegheny National Forest.”   “I am thankful for our partners and work we have accomplished together on the Allegheny National Forest,” Chief Christiansen said. “I look forward to strengthening those relationships and building upon past success for the economic benefit of our rural communities and the sustainability of our national forest.”   Established in 1923, Allegheny National Forest is Pennsylvania’s only National Forest. Situated in the foothills of the Appalachian mountains, the ANF is composed of plateau tops with elevations up to approximately 2,300 feet and valleys down to approximately 1,000 feet above sea level. The forest is approximately 517,000 acres and includes land in Elk, Forest, McKean and Warren counties in the northwestern corner of Pennsylvania. 

Jobs Report: Wages Increasing at Fastest Rate Since 2009
￼ 
The U.S. Department of Labor’s October 2018 jobs report issued Friday shows American jobs have grown and wages have expanded at the greatest rate over the past decade. 
""The U.S. added more than 250,000 jobs in October, while many employers admit challenges to finding employees with the skills they need,"" Congressman Thompson said. “This is tremendous news, but it also continues to show the importance of a highly-skilled workforce to meet modern employment demands. This why I continue to advocate for career and technical education for learners of all ages. As the Strengthening Career & Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, which was signed into law in July, is further implemented we need to ensure that workers are obtaining the skills they need to remain competitive.  “I remain committed to supporting pro-growth policies that will unleash the true potential of America’s workforce and our national economy.” 

High School Students Participate in Annual ""Pathways to Opportunity"" Program
The ""Pathways to Opportunity"" government outreach program is an annual summit for high school students in Northwest Pennsylvania. The program hosts area students at three local colleges in order to provide them with the opportunity to be involved in the process of government, and to discuss current and national issues with the event’s speakers.   Panels of local business people and public officials also give students a chance to think about their future roles in the community. An advocate for education and greater community engagement, Congressman GT Thompson participates every year as a main speaker. This year, seminars were hosted at Lock Haven University, University of Pittsburgh at Titusville and University of Pittsburgh at Bradford. The seminar is completely funded by the community from corporate sponsors that want to invest in the next generation’s leaders and local community.

Thompson Meets with Trout Unlimited Members in State College
 ￼ 
Congressman Thompson recently met with Trout Unlimited members at Spring Creek Park in State College. Those who attended included members of the Spring Creek Chapter of Trout Unlimited, Allegheny Mountain Chapter of Trout Unlimited, Troutbitten, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, and the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. 
They discussed the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and their commitment to our cherished natural resources. 

Thompson Tours PA Wilds Sonshine Factory
￼
Congressman Thompson recently visited the Wilds Sonshine Factory in McKean County. 
""Sonshine"" is a noun meaning a distilled product made from the sunflower plant exclusively grown and produced in the PA Wilds. It will be the only distillery where the product is made 100 percent from the sunflower plant. The glass bottles will bear labels with the Pennsylvania state colors.   The PA Wilds, a 10-county area including Cameron, Clarion, Clearfield Elk, Forest, Jefferson, McKean, Potter, Tioga and Warren, is one of the largest green areas between New York and Chicago, with 2.1 million acres, two national rivers and an abundance of wildlife and recreational opportunities.   The factory's mission statement is ""to establish a commercial supply and distribution of sunflower spirits and other agriculture products while supporting the education and development of agriculture, manufacturing and tourism in the PA Wilds.""

Dear Friends,  

￼ 
The American economy is booming, and the October Jobs Report has the numbers to prove it.  Just last month, 250,000 jobs were created, which means there are now more opportunities for our people to get back to work.  More jobs available, lower unemployment rates, and higher wages for workers is just the latest of exciting news on the state of our economy and strong labor market. 
Around the Eighth District
It has been a busy few weeks here in West Tennessee.  During my time at home, I have had the pleasure of visiting businesses, schools, and organizations throughout the Eighth Congressional District to hear directly from those I represent.  These meetings and visits help me understand the best ways I can serve you in Congress.  Here's a look at a few of the highlights: 
￼ 
I visited Arlington High School alongside Mayor Mike Wissman and met with Principal Chris Duncan for National Principal Shadowing Week. Principal Duncan runs an impressive school with engaged faculty, sharp students, and top-notch academic programs. Thank you for your hard work and dedication to our students! 
￼ 
During a stop in Jackson, I had the pleasure of touring Spire Rehabilitation Hospital. The staff does great work providing a wide range of inpatient services to help get people back on their feet. What an impressive facility! 
￼ 
I also received an impressive tour of the brand new Collierville High School. This is the first school year for the Dragons on this campus, and I was so impressed by the emphasis on student engagement and preparing our students for their future. Thank you to Superintendent John Aitken, Principal Chip Blanchard, and School Board member Wright Cox for the tour! 
￼ 
The Kellogg's plant in Jackson was in full swing when I dropped by for a visit. I enjoyed learning about the plant’s day-to-day operations and seeing the hard work Plant Manager Jason Climie, Senior Manager Bryan Sparks, and the team put in each day to deliver quality products. We are lucky to have this impressive facility right here in West Tennessee. 
￼ 
I took a tour of the Bodine School in Germantown, where I learned all about the extensive programs designed specifically for students with dyslexia. During my tour, I was joined by State Rep. Mark White, District Attorney General Amy Weirich, and U.S. Attorney Mike Dunavant. Thank you to John Murphy, as well as the faculty, staff, and students for showing me around! 
￼ 
Thank you Chancellor Keith Carver and SGA President Devin Majors for hosting me on campus at The University of Tennessee at Martin. I was pleased to hear about the exciting things happening on campus this semester. Go Skyhawks!  
What's Next in Washington
￼  
This week, the House is not in session, which means there are no votes scheduled in Washington.  During this district work period, I look forward to traveling around the Eighth Congressional District of Tennessee. 
As always, I am committed to working for you and the Eighth District of Tennessee.  My staff and I are always available to answer questions you may have and address any concerns about what is happening here in Washington.  Please feel free to send me an email by clicking here or visiting my website at Kustoff.House.Gov.  
Have a great week!

Dear Friend,

Together, with President Trump, I have worked to bring much needed change to a system that has been failing our citizens for too long.  Over the last two years, Congress and the President have worked together to implement an agenda that puts the American people first, a distinct contrast to the big government policies of the previous administration. We’ve achieved many of our shared goals, including providing our service members with the largest wage increase in nearly a decade, advanced an agenda centered on strengthening our security and putting our nation back on a path toward prosperity.  There is still more work to do, but great progress has been made.  
The Economy 
Among my top priorities is promoting job creation and economic growth so all Americans can prosper.  That is why I was proud to support comprehensive tax reform and actions to reduce burdensome regulations.  Combined with the hard work of the American people, these policies unleashed economic growth and put more money back in the pockets of taxpayers like you - who can better decide how to spend it.  As a result, 4.6 million jobs have been created, the number of Americans filing for unemployment has fallen to a 49-year low, the U.S. economy is the world’s most competitive economy for the first time in a decade, wages and benefits are up, and over $300 billion came back into the United States from overseas.  Families in our district have experienced those results, with Census data showing that the median income for households in our district has risen by nearly $5500. 
Border Security is National Security 
One of my consistent positions, that border security is national security, has been echoed by President Trump in his actions in response to the migrant caravans that are traveling through Mexico.  There are now three distinct groups of people, numbering in the thousands, that have been making the journey.  They have received significant media coverage and in some cases material support from U.S. and international immigrant rights groups that have even filed suit on behalf of some of the migrants to challenge the President’s asylum policy.  Border Patrol agents are our first line of defense in protecting the border and currently their numbers are down by 1,500 agents.  That is why I support the President sending more troops to the border to provide infrastructure and surveillance support to the Border Patrol to allow them to protect areas that are more vulnerable and conduct apprehensions of individuals who intentionally cross the border illegally.  I’ve also cosponsored the Build the Wall, Enforce the Law Act of 2018, which would fund construction of the southern border wall and ensure compliance with current Federal immigration law.  I supported the legislation because it clearly takes action against sanctuary cities, goes after criminal illegal aliens and gang members, and builds the wall!
Improving Safety  Drones have become a big problem for our area, directly affecting Border Patrol Agents. It is for this reason, I authored a provision that was included in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, which directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to work with the Department of Defense (DoD) to streamline the deployment of counter unmanned aircraft systems (UAS).  In light of this issue, I sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) urging them to leverage the DoD counter UAS systems to address threats here at home.  
Save Our Seas Act of 2018  As your Congressman, I work across the aisle, and with members of my own party, to find common ground and bipartisan solutions.  With that said, President Donald J. Trump recently signed the Save Our Seas Act into law.  The bill includes my bi-partisan legislation the Maritime Safety Act of 2018 which improves the safety of our mariners in response to the tragic loss of the American cargo ship SS El Faro and its 33 crewmembers during in 2015. The required safety improvements include better safety equipment and timely weather forecast charts, and that voyage data recorders float free after an accident.  And I’m confident that the new measures in place will improve the safety of our merchant mariners and U.S.-flagged ships they sail.  
Social Security   Finally, I want to remind Social Security recipients that the monthly Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits will increase 2.8 percent in 2019.  The 2.8 percent cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) will begin with benefits payable to Social Security beneficiaries in January 2019 and increased payments to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries will begin on December 31, 2018. For more information about how the COLA is calculated please visit www.socialsecurity.gov/cola. Information about Medicare changes for 2019 will be available at www.medicare.gov. 
Serving You   As we approach the end of the year, my team remains dedicated to delivering high-quality constituent services--working to help residents of the 50th Congressional District.  In the 115th Congress alone, my Washington, D.C. office led 777 tours of the U.S. Capitol and fulfilled 161 flag requests that had been flown over the Capitol to honor a person, organization or event.  If you would like to order a U.S. flag from our office, please visit my website.    If you’re planning a trip to our Nation’s capital this holiday season, or anytime in the future, my Washington, D.C. office can help in scheduling Congressional Tours at some of the city’s most beloved historical sites.  I recommend that you submit your tour request 3-6 months in advance of your visit.  While you are in Washington D.C., I encourage you and your family to stop by my office.  If you have any questions, please contact my staff at (202) 225-5672.  They will be happy to help you with any further requests you may have.
Aside from meeting with constituents, my El Cajon Office has caseworkers that can help you navigate the bureaucracy of the federal government.  So far, my team has helped constituents obtain millions of dollars in benefits from the Social Security Administration, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA).  My team has also issued 658 Certificates of Special Congressional Recognition; completed thousands of requests for assistance with federal agencies; and helped hundreds of Veterans with benefits at the VA.  If you or someone you know is experiencing problems with any federal agency, please contact my district office at 619-448-5201 and ask to speak with a caseworker for assistance.
Internship  Are you a college student interested in getting an internship in my office? Interns play an important role in constituent service, research projects, and more.  To apply for full or part-time internships at my El Cajon and DC offices, please visit my website: https://hunter.house.gov. 
Social Media   If you would like to stay up to date on my work in Congress, please subscribe to my newsletter by clicking here, or by liking my page on Facebook, or following me on Twitter at @Rep_Hunter.

Home     Serving You     Contact     District     Legislation     Newsroom     About Bob 
Friends,
 Thanks to policies that have provided needed tax relief, cut government red tape, and put more money in the pockets of Americans, we're seeing an economy that is rolling. I wanted to provide a look at where the economy is now and what it has meant for Ohio families. It's important to understand what pro-growth policies have meant for the hardworking people in the Buckeye State. 
Here's a snapshot to put everything in perspective:
 
National Economy:
Lowest Unemployment in 49 Years - The national unemployment rate currently sits at 3.7%, the lowest it's been in nearly half a century. In fact, only 11 months since 1970 have seen unemployment below 4% - 6 of those months have been in 2018. Americans are getting back to work after years of a sluggish economy. In September, the unemployment rate for women was 3.6%, the lowest it's been in 65 years. 
Highest Wage Growth in a Decade- Wages grew by over 3.1% since a year ago in the latest jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's the best wage growth we've seen in a decade. It's not just that Americans are working, they're making more money as well. 
GDP on Pace for 3% Annual Growth; Best Since 2005 - When the economy is growing, it's good news for everybody. Under the previous administration, many economists said that 3% annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth was unrealistic in this day and age, and that Americans should accept the ""new normal"" below 3%. Well, with back to back quarters of 4.2% and 3.5%, there is a good chance that 2018 ends up with 3% annual growth for the first time since 2005. 
Manufacturing Optimism at an All-Time High - According to the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), 95.1% of manufacturers, an all-time high, reported feeling confident about their business's future. This has been reflected by strong job growth in manufacturing, including 32,000 new manufacturing jobs created in October. I was honored to receive an award from the NAM recognizing my 100% pro-manufacturing voting record.  
Small Business Optimism at All-Time Highs - A study by the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) found small business optimism just 0.1% off it's top record. This is good news as small businesses are the engines of our economy, creating two out of every three news jobs. I was named a ""Guardian of Small Business"" by NFIB because of my pro-small business voting record.  
More Americans Join the Workforce - One of the issues we saw under the sluggish economy in the previous administration was that people were giving up looking for work. The labor participation rate continued to shrink as less people were seeking employment. We've reversed this trend. Last month, the participation rate ticked up 0.2%, defying economists' predictions. This means the economy is doing so well it's enticing people who had stopped looking for a job to get back into the workforce. 
Consumer Confidence Highest in 18 Years - Consumer confidence, which measures the optimism of consumers about the economy, recently hit its highest mark in 18 years.
 
Ohio Economy 
Family Incomes on the Rise - According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and Council of Economic Advisers, median household incomes in Ohio have risen by 8.4% since President Trump took office in January 2016. That's more than $4,000 (and growing) of additional money every year that an Ohio family can you use to pay bills, fill up the tank, save for their children's college education, or put aside for retirement. 
Jobs, Jobs, Jobs - Ohio now has more total jobs filled across the state than at any point in its history. The highest number before this year was in 2000. 
Dramatic Drop-off for Unemployment Filings- Monthly initial claims for unemployment insurance in Ohio have fallen by 24.2% since the 2016 election. That's a drastic change and shows how the economy is booming in the Buckeye State. 
Ohioans Below the Poverty Line Drops - The best way to get people out of poverty is to grow the economy. It puts more money in people's pockets and makes it easier to find work. The percentage of Ohioans living below the poverty lines decreased by one percentage point to the lowest rate since 2006 this year. 
Unemployment Rate Dropping - Ohio’s unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest rate since 2006. 
Manufacturing Jobs Returning to Ohio - Manufacturing employment in Ohio has increased by 2.5% and is now over 700,000 employees across the state. There are more than 60,000 manufacturing jobs in Ohio's 5th District. When manufacturing is doing well, Northwest Ohio is doing well.    I'll continue to work hard to move forward economic policies that help create an environment for job creation and higher wages. Please don't hesitate to reach out to my office if I or my staff can be of service to you. 

Sincerely,
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
From a visit from the Acting FTA Administrator to highlight bus grants for Bloomington-Normal, to landmark legislation to combat the opioid epidemic, to a visit at the Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport, where I saw the progress made on terminal upgrades, it has been a busy week in Illinois' 18th District! Please continue scrolling along to read about a review of last week across central and west-central Illinois.  
Around the District 
Illinois Soybean Association
￼ 
The State of Illinois is the top soybean producing state in the nation and with 30% of soybeans from the state being exported to China, the soybean industry is ground zero in the ongoing trade war. Last week, I met with the Illinois Soybean Association to discuss how trade relations with China and other nations around the world are vitally important to the success of our agriculture community and family farmers. While farmers I have met with applaud the President for standing up to China, we are encouraging the Administration to conclude trade negotiations to allow freer, fairer trade for our agriculture industries. Additionally, it was great to discuss how advancements in biodiesel and renewable fuels are benefiting the soybean industry.
HSHS St. John's Fighting Opioid Epidemic with Latest Grant
￼ 
HSHS St. John's Hospital System was awarded a $429,008 Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grant from USDA Rural Development last Friday that will help fight the opioid epidemic.   These funds will help HSHS St. John's Hospital address opioid misuse through the purchase and installation of interactive telemedicine equipment. A telehealth network will be implemented at 14 health care facilities in 13 central Illinois counties.  
Our 18th District is comprised much of rural communities across central and west-central Illinois and grants such as this will further help combat the ongoing opioid epidemic that is striking communities of all sizes, all while connecting residents in rural areas with quality healthcare providers in a more prompt and efficient fashion. Once again, I applaud the USDA Rural Development for understanding the needs of our district and I will continue to advocate for methods that help curb opioid abuse across central and west-central Illinois and provide better access to healthcare to all individuals.

Stopping by WLDS AM 1180 in Jacksonville
￼ 
I had the pleasure of stopping by the studios of WLDS last week in Jacksonville to sit-down with Gary Scott, Roger Ward, and Blake Schnitker to talk about many of the current issues facing Jacksonville, the State of Illinois, as well as our nation. Among the many topics covered, we focused on how we're working to bring more jobs to the area after the positive effects of a booming economy, how we're fighting for our farmers to improve trade relations and pass a Farm Bill, and also being a resource for constituents needing help navigating federal bureaucracies. 
Acting FTA Administrator Visits Bloomington to Celebrate Grant Award
￼ 
I was pleased to join my friend Rep. Rodney Davis to welcome Federal Transit Administration (FTA)'s Acting Administrator K. Jane Williams to Bloomington to recognize Connect Transit on receiving a $6 million grant award from the FTA. With the money provided from the FTA, Connect Transit will be able to invest in ten new buses, ensuring their top-notch service to the Bloomington-Normal remains. I was pleased to advocate alongside Rep. Davis on behalf of Connect Transit to the Acting Administrator and will continue to lend my support for projects that support infrastructure improvements in our community. Special thanks to Acting Administrator Williams for taking the time to come to Bloomington and witness what their grant will provide for our community.

This month, I was honored to be the keynote speaker at the Law Enforcement Officer's Ball put on in Tazewell County to recognize and celebrate the brave law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty. Law enforcement officers in our communities are the hidden heroes of our country. Each day, officers leave their families with no certainty they will return home safe. Yet, they are willing to face these risks to keep our communities safe. Ensuring our law enforcement has the proper resources has been a goal of mine since coming to Congress.
I was proud to support legislation that expanded the use of narcan and naloxone for officers responding to drug overdoses, encouraged the creation of alliances between police and communities to enhance collaboration, and I have held roundtables with law enforcement officials to raise awareness for both the human trafficking and opioid epidemics so we can better address these national problems. I am grateful for the courageous men and women who button up the blue uniform each day and thank you for protecting our families and communities in central and west-central Illinois so bravely.
Welcome Relief for Families Ravaged by the Opioid Crisis
￼ 
Great news! President Trump signed H.R. 6 into law, which included my legislation, the Opioid Addiction Action Plan. The opioid crisis has ravaged families and communities across central and west-central Illinois, and I have made it a priority of mine to address this epidemic since coming to Congress. While we still have work to do, the legislation signed into law today will incentivize the development of non-addictive painkillers, expand grant funding for local law enforcement to combat the flow of fentanyl, and provide additional funding for rehabilitation opportunities. I was proud to work in a bipartisan manner with my colleagues in Congress and the Administration to provide resources and solutions to families impacted by this epidemic.

Supporting Our Local Airports
￼ 
I was pleased to join my colleague Rep. Cheri Bustos, the General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport, local elected officials, and community business leaders to discuss the importance of the Peoria International Airport to our local economy. In Washington, I will continue to fight for funding for our local airports to ensure they have the necessary resources to succeed in a growing economy. 
Recognizing Breast Cancer Awareness Month
￼ 
In October, we recognized Breast Cancer Awareness month and Central Illinois is birthplace to one of the premier organizations on the front lines fighting this horrible disease. The Susan G. Komen foundation, founded in honor of Peoria native Susan G. Komen, has been at the forefront in supporting breast cancer patients and survivors, finding breakthroughs to preventative care and raising money so we can end breast cancer for good. October is an important reminder that early detection and increased awareness can save lives. I am grateful to the Susan G. Komen foundation and the thousands of brave women and men who have fought this disease and worked to find a cure.
A Strong GDP Report
￼ 
With 3.5% GDP growth in the last quarter, Americans are continuing to see the results of pro-growth policies that have reduced taxes and expanded the job market. 
Business Insider: ""A healthy job market— with the lowest unemployment rate in 49 years — coupled with strong consumer confidence to support consumer spending, the biggest driver of the US economy."" 
US economy grows at fastest back-to-back pace in 4 years, boosted by solid consumer spending 
The Importance of Civic Engagement
￼ ￼
I stopped by New Berlin Elementary School to join the 4th and 5th graders as well as Juniors from New Berlin High School for an assembly. We had a great discussion about the importance of civic engagement, my job as their Representative, and fielded some great questions! 
An Upgraded Terminal for Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport
￼ ￼
I joined Mark Hanna, the Executive Director of the Springfield Airport Authority, and Ken Martin, the Deputy Director of Aeronautics at IDOT, to tour the Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport in Springfield. I was proud to advocate on behalf of the airport to the Federal Aviation Administration for a grant award to allow the final phase of terminal reconstruction to begin. The upgrades to take place will not only modernize the airport terminal but also expand the terminal to allow a more effective flow of passenger traffic during check-in and at security. 
National Prescription Drug Take Back Day
￼ 
Last week, we recognized National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. With the majority of abused prescription drugs coming from home medicine cabinets and family members, National Prescription Drug Take Back Day serves as a reminder that disposing of unused or expired prescriptions can prevent drug abuse and save lives.

Dear Friends,
I have had the privilege of serving the people of this great state for 12 years. From the Capitol in Boise to the halls of Congress in Washington, I can spot a bad deal for the Gem State from a mile away. That is why I am voting “no” on Proposition 1 this November and you should too.
After reading the measure, I can tell voters that Prop 1 is about the legalization and expansion of gambling throughout Idaho, not about saving horse racing, providing money to our schools or helping our communities. What the sponsors don’t want you to know is that Prop 1 legalizes Historical Horse Racing (HHR) terminals, which are nothing more than slot machines, at locations throughout the state.
These machines have very little to do with traditional horse racing, which has been and continues to be legal in Idaho. Truthfully, horse racing in Idaho has been in decline for years - an unfortunate reality across America. But that’s no excuse to provide this one industry special treatment. Especially at the cost of expanding gambling across Idaho.
Also, the promises being made about education funding by proponents just don’t add up. These gambling machines are lucrative and promoters of this measure are set to take home at least 18 times more money than schools. In fact, the sponsors of Prop 1 made similar promises back in 2013 that turned out to be untrue – a state auditor’s report found that money didn’t go to schools and was spent illegally.
In an effort to blunt some of this criticism, the promoters recently announced the establishment of a foundation to which they plan to donate all of their profits. Let’s explore this claim carefully. Their ads do not make it clear that they are talking about “net” profits. We don’t know what this means and how they will interpret it because there is no language in Prop 1 that would require the establishment of said foundation or clarifies what this promise means. Also, this promise only applies to the track in the Treasure Valley and does not apply to the many other tracks throughout the state that will have gambling machines as well. Clearly, the idea of the foundation was merely an afterthought when the promoters realized the unpopularity of their proposal.
Finally, Prop 1 stands on questionable legal grounds and could pose a real burden to taxpayers if passed. As highlighted in Attorney General Lawrence Wasden’s review of the measure, the legality of HHR terminals is not clear. Therefore,Prop 1 will likely draw a lengthy and costly legal battle at the expense of Idaho taxpayers.
Don’t be fooled - Article 3, Section 20 of the Idaho Constitution clearly bans “slot machines” or “any electronic or electromechanical imitation” of casino gambling in Idaho. In fact, the Idaho Legislature determined HHR terminals were illegal and banned them in 2015 after seeing that the spinning cherries, bells, and whistles of the HHR terminals mimicked slot machines found in a Las Vegas casino. I agree with legal experts who believe the Idaho Supreme Court is likely to look at the addition of HHR terminals as an expansion of gambling and rule that it violates our state constitution.
Not only does Prop 1 expand gambling across Idaho while proponents make dubious claims about how it helps Idaho communities, but it will pull taxpayers right into the middle of a costly legal battle that can and should be avoided. It is for these reasons that I am voting “No” on November 6 and ask that you join me.
Thank you,
￼

A Thriving Economy
Beginning in the fall of 2008, America suffered through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of Americans lost their jobs and their life savings, and the economy was stuck in reverse. In the 10 years since, progress has been made in bringing jobs back, but in the last two years the recovery has finally started to boost confidence in East Tennessee. This is the first time since I can remember that we’ve had more jobs openings than job seekers, and earlier this year we hit a statewide low unemployment rate of 3.3 percent, below the national average. Last week, we learned that the economy grew at 3.5 percent in the third quarter. There’s no denying the roll we are on right now.  
In addition to the economy growing at a rate of 3.5 percent, consumer spending grew by 4 percent in the same period accounting for more than two thirds of U.S. economic activity. In early October, the Council of Economic Advisors announced the national unemployment rate was 3.7 percent, its lowest level since 1969. A thriving economy depends on a strong job market and ours is proving to be on a steady rise. These positive job and economic numbers are helping all Americans. The unemployment rate for Hispanic Americans has fallen to 4.5 percent, the lowest rate ever recorded for this demographic; and the unemployment rate for women has fallen to its lowest rate in nearly 65 years at a 3.6 percent. To put these numbers in perspective, September was the first month since December 2000 that the number of people who are unemployed fell below 6 million. In Tennessee, the number of unemployed persons is 117,359, which is 215,293 less than in June 2009.  
As I traveled around the First District in 2016, you could feel it then: businesses and entrepreneurs were ready to expand and take risks, but the regulatory environment was so uncertain it caused many folks to stay on the sidelines. In the following two years, we repealed 14 regulations through the Congressional Review Act and the Trump administration promised to repeal two regulations for every new one created. In fact, the administration repealed 22 regulations for every new one in fiscal year 2017. Improving the regulatory environment was the first step, and the second step was passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law last year, we’ve seen more jobs; a healthier consumer market; better wages; and more opportunities for all Americans. I was proud to vote for this legislation and was pleased to see it signed into law by the president. This was the first meaningful reform we’ve had to our tax code in over three decades, and it has resulted in more opportunities for all Americans. 
Our actions have opened doors for more businesses and families all over, and have particularly helped our businesses here in the First District. Small business plays a vital role in our local economy in East Tennessee and businesses now have the flexibility to hire more individuals to continue this growth. I have now seen optimism of job creators and job seekers in the First District, and I know this optimism exists all over the nation with hundreds of thousands of jobs being created in the United States each month.  
Make no mistake, there’s still a lot of work to do. We have to permanently extend the tax relief for individuals from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which the House voted to do in September. We also need to protect businesses in the future from overregulation, which is why the House passed legislation called the REINS Act to require congressional approval for the adoption of any legislation that would cause over $100 million in economic activity. I plan to continue working with my colleagues on tax and regulatory relief in order to continue helping American families and businesses. 
As economic prosperity continues to grow in our state and country, we should continue to advance a legislative agenda that promotes further economic growth. I’m proud of the work we have done in the 115th Congress, which helped put our economy back on track, and I’m hopeful the 116th Congress will do the same.  


My door is always open to East Tennesseans. Feel free to contact my office if I can be of assistance to you or your family.

Continuing American Progress
 

Over the last 21 months, Republicans have moved our country forward by slashing through regulations that stunted our small businesses, reforming our tax code so hardworking Americans can keep more of their money, and fueling our economy as a result of those policies. 

Liberals would decry these victories, but the results are hard to deny. Since we've passed tax reform we've continued to see unemployment hit historic lows, job openings have skyrocketed, paychecks have grown, and wages are steadily rising. Democrats are doing everything in their power to erase our progress, while Republicans in the House voted to make your tax cuts permanent. 

What other successes have we accomplished working with the President? 
· Confirmed two conservative and qualified Supreme Court Justices
· We've added 4.5 millions jobs
·Hourly wage growth is the highest since the Great Recession 
· Withdrawn from the disastrous Iran Deal
·Consumer confidence hit an 18-year high 
·Rebuilding our military 
· Combating the opioid crisis 
American confidence has drastically increased, because we are putting America and our citizens first. Our President and Republicans in Congress are returning America back to our core values.   Week in Review Last week I toured SABIC industries in Bay St. Louis and had the opportunity to discuss trade and jobs in Mississippi.  
￼

I attended the ""D.C. Fly in to the Farm"" event in Jackson where I received the Friend of Farm Bureau award for my support of federal legislation and policy that is important to America’s farmers and ranchers. While I was there, I was able to check in with SuperTalk Mississippi to share my thoughts on immigration and the economy.

￼

￼

My oldest son Bear played his last regular season game on Friday as a senior. I've enjoyed traveling to watch his senior football season unfold and I am immensely proud of all of his accomplishments. So grateful to be the father of such a fine young man.

￼

Had a great time with my family cheering on the Golden Eagles to a victory over Marshall on Saturday. Enjoyed seeing our friend, Windy Swetman, while we were at the game! 

￼

In your service,
￼
Steven

Wicker Honors Student Veterans
Updates to G.I. Bill, Greater Campus Outreach Help Foster Career Success
The sacrifices made by Mississippians on behalf of freedom are known around the world.  On this Veterans Day, one of those heroes – Columbia native Sam Bond Dale Jr. – will be remembered with a ceremony and plaque in Le Mesnil-Fuguet, France.  The village was where the young pilot lost his life after his plane was shot down by Germans during World War II.
Dale made the ultimate sacrifice, never returning to the United States to start a family or build a career.  For the World War II soldiers who did come home, a new national effort had been launched to help with the transition after the war, enabling veterans to go back to school or buy a home.  That effort became known as the first G.I. Bill.  Since then, the G.I. Bill has helped millions of veterans and their family members obtain a college degree or vocational training.  Some 1.1 million student veterans across the nation are utilizing this benefit today.
Expansion of G.I. Bill Benefits
Although the G.I. Bill’s origins go back to World War II, former Mississippi Congressman Sonny Montgomery is responsible for ensuring that these benefits would not be lost to later generations.  His dedication even earned him the nickname “Mr. Veteran.”  The resulting legislation, commonly known as the “Montgomery G.I. Bill,” has played an immeasurable role in the continued recruitment of the best and brightest Americans into our military.
Over the past decade, I have supported several major expansions to the “Montgomery G.I. Bill,” voting in favor of the “Post-9/11 G.I. Bill” in 2008 and the “Forever G.I. Bill” in 2017.  Today, the benefits of the G.I. Bill extend to more veterans than ever before and no longer have an expiration date, letting veterans control their own educational timelines.
Welcoming University Communities
Such policies are needed at the federal level, but they do not stand alone.  I am glad to see the university support for student veterans growing stronger in our state.  For example, in recent years, our universities have opened new centers on campus where veterans can find support for academic success and a welcoming environment.  Earlier this year, Mississippi State, which has been designated as a “Purple Heart University,” launched a free tuition program for service members in the Mississippi National Guard.  More recently, on November 2 and 3, the University of Mississippi had an opportunity to host VA Secretary Robert Wilkie as part of its Warrior Week to honor the student veterans and faculty veterans within its campus community.
Lessons From the Past
The stories of our veterans will continue to teach future generations, thanks to a special collection of personal accounts and memorabilia at the Library of Congress.  The Veterans History Project, which was created in 2000, encompasses more than a century of primary sources from our military veterans. 
I hope this year’s Veterans Day – which also marks the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I – will inspire others to contribute to the Veterans History Project or to spend some time discovering the many stories that have already been collected.  These snapshots of history are truly a national treasure and a reminder of the American sacrifices around the world that have been made to preserve freedom.  For more information, please visit www.loc.gov/vets.

Dear Friend,
Cooler fall weather is here! I was out and about quite a bit last week, connecting with Minnesota families and hearing what's on your mind. 
 
I also visited Polaris' headquarters in Medina to meet with employees and the leadership team and learn how tariffs are negatively impacting their workers. I also went to Thrifty White Pharmacy headquarters in Plymouth to learn about their continued growth in providing solutions for prescription deliveries in the entire upper Midwest. And, I met with many members of Minnesota's Liberian community to reiterate my commitment to ensuring we permanently protect Liberian families.

Big News on the Jobs Front
The latest good economic news: our economy added 250,000 jobs in October, and even more importantly, private sector wages rose 3.1 percent -- the biggest jump in 10 years. Americans’ paychecks are finally breaking through the ceiling of wage growth that’s held for nearly a decade, firmly establishing that our economy’s strong momentum is boosting jobs and especially worker pay. All in all, it's terrific news for Minnesota families.

￼
 
Meeting Minnesota Seniors
I really enjoy the opportunity to visit with seniors at residences and assisted living facilities. Seniors are well-informed -- they know the issues, they understand the challenges we face, and they ask good, tough questions.

Honduran Caravan

“Honduras is in desperate need of reform and an effective judicial system as it is overwhelmingly true that injustice and violence reign, but that does not mean that the solution is for Hondurans to flee the country. Receiving the immigrants with open arms will only cause more to follow in their path as many are quick to point out the Honduran government's faults, but are not willing to stay in their homeland long enough to be a part of the solution.”

-Jennifer Zilly Canales, reprinted by the Dallas Morning News 11/2/2018

In fiscal year 2018, US workers experienced the largest increase in wages, salaries, and benefits in 10 years. Private sector wages and salaries increased by more than 3% over the 12 month period ending in September, the first time since 2008. Record low unemployment numbers continue to benefit North Texans and American workers, providing jobs and economic stability for families across the country. We need to continue on our current path of lower taxes and reduced regulations that strengthens our economy and Americans' financial future.

Marchant Earns NumbersUSA's Top Grade
For the 115th Congress, NumbersUSA graded my voting record on immigration policy an A+ True Reformer. I consistently support policies that protect our economic and physical well-being, combat illegal immigration, lower immigration numbers, and allow fewer foreign workers so Americans aren't undercut by those willing to work for less. We need to help ourselves before we can help others. It is not sustainable to continue propping up those who migrate here just to take advantage of our resources and look for handouts. Congress must continue to support immigration policies that protect our workers, resources, and neighborhoods.

NTLC Tax Fighter Award

I was honored to receive the Tax Fighter Award from the National Tax Limitation Committee (NTLC) for my work in the 115th Congress. I have consistently fought for lower taxes and reducing government spending throughout my career in Congress. North Texans deserve to keep more of their hard earned money, not see their tax dollars being spent by un-elected bureaucrats and wasted on big government programs. Awarded to those who stand with the principles, policies, and objectives of Ronald Reagan, it's a privilege to be recognized by the NTLC.

Fighting for the Kids

Children's Social Security numbers (SSN) are incredibly valuable to thieves as they are stolen to open phony accounts, an increasingly growing problem in the auto finance industry. This Congress I introduced H.R. 1512, the Social Security Child Protection Act of 2018, legislation designed to help the victims of identity theft which passed the House in April of this year. Too often families struggle to obtain new SSN's for their kids and are met with bureaucratic red tape. These SSN's are targeted because it gives thieves a fresh start and usually for a long period of time, as people don't often check their accounts until they're old enough to open credit cards or become financially independent.

November 4, 2018
Greetings,
Last weekend a horrific act of pure evil took place in Pittsburgh when an anti-Semite murdered eleven Jews who were gathered for Shabbat services at the Tree of Life synagogue. It was the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in the history of our great nation. The ancient hatred that is anti-Semitism has been on the rise all over the world. There is no place for anti-Semitism in our country, and now, more than ever, we must reaffirm our unequivocal condemnation of these heinous crimes and commit to combat all forms of anti-Semitism. Heidi and I stand in solidarity with the members of the Tree of Life community, as well as the entire Jewish community, and are lifting the victims and their families up in prayer during this difficult and painful time.
This week, I was glad to see the Trump administration announce a second wave of sanctions to be enforced against the Iranian regime. As the final policy is developed, it is critical to ensure that it imposes maximum pressure on Iran. Waivers that allow our allies and adversaries to enrich the regime by importing Iranian oil or to bolster Iran's nuclear program through civil-nuclear cooperation should be sharply limited, and ultimately eliminated. The administration should ensure that the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication disconnects designated Iranian banks from the global financial system, otherwise the Ayatollahs will use such access to simply wait out the Trump administration, in the hopes that a future administration will be more appeasing. I also look forward to working with my congressional colleagues in a bipartisan and bicameral fashion to pass legislation that ensures maximum pressure on Iran. 
In August, I was joined by 15 of my Senate colleagues sending a letter to Secretary Mnuchin urging the administration to apply maximum pressure in efforts to cut off the Islamic Republic’s financial ties and businesses from the SWIFT banking network. I look forward to working with my colleagues in both houses of Congress to pass legislation that will ensure maximum pressure on Iran.
Recently, Central Texas experienced devastating flooding which resulted in many Texans displaced from their homes. In support of Governor Abbott’s request for federal disaster assistance following the severe weather and flooding across Central Texas, I joined Senator John Cornyn in a letter to President Trump urging for Governor Abbott’s request to be expeditiously approved.
Our prayers continue to be with those Americans recovering in Central Texas, and from Hurricanes Matthew and Florence. These devastating natural disasters are a stark reminder of the importance of taking all steps necessary to prepare our homes and families for any future weather event. For those seeking preparedness information and resources, please refer to the federal and state resources listed here.
Please read below for an update from this last week.

Walker Weekly Report
Cutting through the noise of Washington, I work fervently everyday to improve the lives of families in North Carolina, always remembering my promises and striving to make a difference, not just an argument. This Congress, I am proud to say we have delivered results – not rhetoric – making strides on the issues that matter to you and your family: our economy, our security, lowering the cost of living, reducing drug and health care costs, and improving education for our next generation.
While the attention is often shifted to the drama and conflict, I am working hard behind the scenes to bridge traditional political and cultural divides. I know that is the only way I can foster policies that help North Carolinians thrive in opportunity and build strong communities with safe neighborhoods.
After historic tax cuts and rollbacks on harmful regulations, unemployment is at historic lows, job openings are at record highs, paychecks are growing, wages are rising, and economic optimism is expanding. North Carolinians are finally having a chance to become full participants in our economy and achieve the American Dream.
Just Friday we saw a new monthly jobs report that MarketWatch said ""wowed"" economists ""as wage growth picks up,"" hitting it's highest level in nearly a decade. Even the former Chief Economist to Vice President Joe Biden is taking note: “Pretty much everything you could want in a monthly jobs report. Payroll gains way better than expected, nice pop in labor force participation, wage growth continues to strengthen, finally beating inflation (real gains!). Score 1 for ""room-to-run"" crowd!”
The bottom line is this: North Carolina families, workers, and businesses can achieve great things when government empowers them to succeed instead of putting up barriers to growth. 
Keep reading for the full update. Have a blessed week.
Sincerely, ￼ Mark Walker

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend,  This week, we continued Hurricane Michael recovery efforts in the Second District and addressed the damage experienced by our farmers, ranchers, and foresters. Please read about my week below:   Hurricane Michael Recovery ￼   This week, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon visited the Second District to assess damage. Thank you to Secretary Carson and SBA Administrator McMahon for working with us to expedite disaster recovery resources to those who need it most. We surveyed recovery efforts and discussed long-term solutions to housing issues and disaster loans.  ￼   Tyndall Air Force Base Update  We also heard from the Air Force this week about the future of the missions at Tyndall Air Force Base. Several key missions will be returning to Tyndall in the next few months. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David L. Goldfein stated, ""The strength of Tyndall comes from its Airmen and their families. It will take us a while to restore buildings and infrastructure, but returning our Airmen and their combat missions to full strength—at Tyndall or somewhere else in the interim—will happen quickly.” Thank you to President Trump, Vice President Pence, and Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson for your resolute support in rebuilding Tyndall.  Click here to learn more.   Assessing Agricultural Damage ￼   This week, I toured the Apalachicola National Forest with Liberty County Sheriff Eddie Joe White. We discussed damage caused by Hurricane Michael, as well as how we can support the timber industry in the area. Foresters in north Florida were devastated by Hurricane Michael and I am working with federal and local leaders to ensure that we take care of our timber producers.   On Wednesday, I joined Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam in Blountstown to meet with local leaders about steps we can take to immediately help the agriculture industry in the area. From peanuts and cotton, to soy and timber, our agriculture producers were hurt by Hurricane Michael. I am committed to ensuring we take care of our farmers, ranchers, and foresters.  Next week, the Farm Service Agency will be holding four Disaster Assistance Information Meetings in the Second District to share information on agricultural resources and hear from producers. These meetings are open to the public and representatives from the Farm Bureau, USDA, and the Natural Resources Conservation Service will be in attendance. I encourage all farmers and foresters who were impacted by Hurricane Michael to attend.  November 6  Washington County  Time: 9:00-11:00 AM CT Location: First Baptist Church Sanctuary, 1300 South Blvd., Chipley, FL 32428  Jackson County  Time: 2:00-4:00 PM CT Location: Jackson County Agricultural Center Auditorium, 2741 Penn Ave, Marianna, FL 32448  November 7  Calhoun County  Time: 9:00-11:00 AM CT Location: Rivertown Community Church Sanctuary, 19359 SR 71 North, Blountstown, Florida 32424 
Gadsden County  Time: 2:00-4:00 PM ET Location: FAMU Research and Extension Center, 4259 Bainbridge Highway, Quincy, Florida 32352 

Hurricane Michael Resources Recovering from the devastation left by Hurricane Michael will take time and resources from all levels of government. I have set up a page on my website dedicated to Hurricane Michael recovery resources that includes both federal and local aid available to Florida. Click here to learn more.   ￼  Operation Blue Roof provides free temporary covering of damaged property until permanent repairs can be made. The deadline to apply for Operation Blue Roof is Sunday, November 11, 2018. Rights of Entry can be submitted at several locations in the Second District. To learn more call 888-ROOF-BLU (888-766-3258) or visit www.usace.army.mil/blueroof.   The U.S. Department of Agriculture is beginning to provide  Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to those in 12 counties affected by Hurricane Michael. Households that qualify can receive one month of benefits to meet their food needs.  Click here to learn more.    If you are having an issue with a federal agency please do not hesitate to reach out to my office. Due to damage from Hurricane Michael, the physical location of my Panama City office is temporarily closed. The phones are still being answered and staff can be reached at my Tallahassee and DC offices.   Thank you for your continued energy and enthusiasm, as reflected in your letters and Facebook posts. If you haven’t already, LIKE my Facebook page. You can also follow me on Twitter @DrNealDunnFL2. 
Thank you for the opportunity to serve you in Congress!

Dear Friends,

In central Arkansas this week, I enjoyed visiting with our Air Force families at the first air show since 2012, joining our Jewish community in prayer and in service for restoration, healing, and unity, and more. Thank you for taking time to keep up with my work as I represent you.

Thunder Over the Rock at Little Rock Air Force Base 
￼
What an honor to be with our military families and local residents for the Thunder Over the Rock Air Show at Little Rock Air Force Base (LRAFB). With much anticipation, we witnessed the Air Force Thunderbirds’ incredible performance and saw the C-130s in action at the airlift Center of Excellence at LRAFB. I enjoyed touring the booth and visiting with service personnel, pilots, and central Arkansans - seeing static displays of older model planes and learning more about our Air Force operations.

Praying for Restoration, Healing, and Unity 
￼
Martha and I were devastated by the mania of an anti-Semitic killer at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. During Monday's moving and beautiful service at Congregation B'nai Israel in Little Rock, Rabbi Barry Block shared George Washington's wise words to the Jews in America: “To Bigotry No Sanction; to Persecution No Assistance."" We continue to pray for healing, restoration, and unity.

Boosting Arkansas's Economy 
￼
Right to Left: Congressman French Hill, Kevin Tweddle (Group EVP, ICBA), Rebeca Romero-Rainey (President and CEO, ICBA), Mike Preston (Executive Director, Arkansas Economic Development Commission), Mark Stodola (Mayor of Little Rock), and Wayne Miller (Executive Director, the Venture Center)

Arkansas is a great place to live and work, and we're continuing our efforts to boost our state's economy, strengthen our community banks, and attract even more tech talent here at home. I was pleased to announce on Wednesday the launch of the Independent Community Bankers of America and the Venture Center's ThinkTech Accelerator, which I'm confident will help bring in our nation’s best tech entrepreneurs. Read more here. 

""Not in Vein""
￼
Across Arkansas, tearful families have told me their stories about how the opioid crisis has personally affected them, and this film - ""Not in Vein"" - shows the effect the epidemic has at the community level. I highly recommend watching this powerful video that offers helpful insight into how we can better combat the tragedies transpiring in our homes and neighborhoods.

Protecting and Improving Our National Parks  
￼
We have seven beautiful national parks here in the Natural State, and there is bipartisan and wide-ranging support for wildlife conservation and efforts to meet the demands of maintenance back logs that currently exist in our national parks. I was pleased to receive a recent letter in support from Preserve Arkansas on the need for Congressional action because I’m deeply committed to protecting and improving our national parks. Read more here. 

Thank you for taking time to keep up with the work I'm doing on your behalf. If I can be any assistance to you or your family, please reach out to my office at (501) 324-5941 or Hill.House.Gov.

STANDING UNITED AGAINST HATE
Last weekend, vicious acts of hatred took the lives of 11 individuals at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh and 2 individuals in Kentucky. Anti-Semitism, racism, and bigotry in all of its forms have absolutely no place in our society.  
￼ 
Rep. Carbajal attends UCSB's ""United With Pittsburgh Against Hate"" vigil

Educating the public about the history of anti-Semitism and the consequences of intolerance is more important than ever before. On Friday, I jointly co-sponsored the Never Again Education Act with my Republican colleague Rep. Don Bacon. This legislation gives our teachers the resources and training they need to teach our children the important lessons of the Holocaust. 

FUNDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
 Strengthening the partnership between law enforcement and mental health professionals ensures individuals struggling with mental illness and addiction have access to the care they need, while also addressing their wrongdoings.  I’m happy to announce San Luis Obispo County will receive $1.79 million in federal funding this year to build on mental health programs within the criminal justice system.  Read more here. 


PROTECTING OUR PUBLIC LANDS
In August, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) launched a year-long study to analyze the impacts of fracking across BLM administered public land, including on the Central Coast. The agency gave a mere 30-day window for concerned citizens to leave a comment, which I believe was insufficient time.  You can submit a comment through my office until Nov 8th, which I will submit to the Bureau of Land Management.  There are only FIVE DAYS left to submit a comment through my office. Make your voice heard HERE. 
￼ 
As always, I want to hear from you about issues that are important to you and your family. Call my office, find me on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, or feel free to email me. It’s an honor to represent California's 24th Congressional District.   Sincerely,

Dear Lindsey, 
Election day is almost here! On Tuesday, November 6th, we head to the polls. 
Our civic responsibility to vote is one of the most sacred privileges we have as citizens of the United States.  
In case you have not yet already located your polling place, you can do so by clicking here. For more election information, including who is on the ballot, ballot measures, and how to vote, click here.  
The integrity of our elections is something I hold extremely dear. That is why I joined 23 of my colleagues in the House of Representatives in sending a letter to Attorney General Sessions asking him to protect our elections from illegal voting.  
There is no greater expression of citizenship in our great nation than casting your vote, so I hope to see you out at the polls! 
Out and About in Southwest Alabama 
￼ 
It was great to see everyone out at the Bayou La Batre town hall meeting on Monday morning (top photo)! I received a lot of feedback and concerns regarding infrastructure, veterans care, and many people expressed concerns over immigration. I am glad that I had the chance to update everyone on my continued push for my bill, the 50 Votes for the Wall Act! Border security is national security, and we must build the wall. 
Also this week, I had the chance to visit the very impressive and very massive 2.5 million-square-foot Wal-Mart distribution center in south Mobile County(middle right). They employ over 650 people and continue to expand, showing more signs of our area’s strong economic growth. We are truly better off now in Southwest Alabama and, with this sort of continued investment, getting stronger for the future.
Next, I had the chance to speak to the North Baldwin Chamber of Commerce in Bay Minette to update the group on our conservative, pro-growth policies that are helping to boost our economy and bring more money and jobs back to Main Street. Special thanks to the Stagecoach Café for the delicious breakfast!
On Thursday, I visited with Dr. Lonnie Johnson and the fine folks of the Airbus engineering team at their facility here in Mobile to learn more about the great work they are doing (middle left). Dr. Johnson is a native of Mobile, having attended Williamson High School, but you may know him better as the inventor of the Super Soaker. He has also done work with NASA and the U.S. Air Force and holds over 100 patents. I was glad to show Dr. Johnson the great things happening at Airbus.
I had the chance to meet with a great group of people from the Mobile Association of Realtors Governmental Affairs Committee to update them on the work I’m doing in Washington (bottom left). Mobile realtors have been helping people find homes and businesses for over 100 years in our area, and it was great to visit from them.
Also on Thursday, I joined with the Downtown Mobile Alliance to check out the latest on efforts to revitalize the downtown area (bottom right). I saw the old Wheeler building, which is in the process of becoming a mixed use building with some residential and some commercial spaces. I also saw the new Precision Engineering building, which is in the old Dodge building. Both projects were made possible thanks to the historic tax credit!
Illegal Immigration is Illegal 
There are no two ways about it. Illegal immigration is illegal. 
There are hundreds of thousands of people from all around the world who gain citizenship every year. According the Pew Research Center, around 19.8 million naturalized citizens currently live in the United States.  
There are ways to become a legal citizen in our country, and I admire all those who go through that process. No one gets upset about illegal immigration more than those who followed the law and entered our country legally.
Amassing thousands and marching on the southern border, or just one person crossing our border illegally, is not the right way to gain citizenship. 
It is unfair for the millions of citizens in our country who put in the time and effort to apply for visas, did not overstay them, and went through the appropriate legal channels to allow people into the country who do not follow the law.
I recently returned from a trip to Honduras at the beginning of October to learn more about where these people come from. It is true that there is much corruption, crime, and hardship in Central America. But, it cannot be stressed enough: illegal immigration is illegal. 
We must build the wall through my 50 Votes for the Wall Act, reform our broken immigration system, and increase our border security. Border security is national security, and we cannot allow our security or sovereignty to be put in jeopardy. 
There is an immigration crisis, and it must be addressed. I hope that my colleagues in the House will join me as I fight for a safer America and uphold the laws of our country.

It was an honor to be on hand for the Coastal Alabama Business Chamber breakfast to celebrate 25 years of the Gulf Shores and Orange Beach Tourism Bureau. We have hit 8 straight years of record visitors and retail sales at our Baldwin County beaches! This is a testament to the wonderful team we have down in Orange Beach, Gulf Shores, and the Tourism Bureau. From the oil spill to hurricanes, it is also remarkable how resilient these communities are.
After the breakfast celebration, I had the honor to join the ribbon cutting at the new Lodge at Gulf State Park. As many of us know, the original Lodge was built in 1974 as a premier tourism destination but was sadly destroyed in 2004 by Hurricane Ivan.  
A lot of people put in a lot of work over the years to make the new Lodge and Conference Center at Gulf State Park a reality. Friday was a testament to all that hard work. Finally, after 14 years, the Lodge is once again open.
It is a beautiful and environmentally friendly complex that will help bring even more people to explore Alabama and all we have to offer. It is also important that the facility contain space for conferences.  This will allow businesses and organizations to bring their conferences to Alabama instead of that business being lost to Florida. 
Thank you to everyone for their hard work, and I look forward to see how much our tourism industry will grow into the future.

I got into the Halloween fun by dressing as a hunter and handing out candy to some of the patients at USA Children's & Women's Hospital in Mobile. An easy way to give a happy distraction to some of these patients and their families! It was so great to see all those smiling faces! 
What’s Ahead

From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:
Good Afternoon,
This week in Congress, I had the honor to attend and speak at the Lycoming County Hometown Heroes Ceremony.
￼
Recognizing the Sacrifices of Our Veterans
The Lycoming Hometown Heroes Ceremony is held annually to honor veterans in Lycoming County. Family, friends, and businesses sponsor members of their community to be recognized during the event. One of my greatest joys during my time in Congress has been the opportunity to advocate on behalf of the men and women who selflessly served this great nation. It is events like this that remind me how lucky I am to represent PA-10. Thank you for having me!
Developing a Strong 21st Century Workforce
I was excited to hear that I earned the National Association of Manufacturers Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence for my work to support Pennsylvania’s manufacturing industry in the 115th Congress. The NAM Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence is presented to legislators who consistently support policies that create jobs, advance U.S. interests in the global market, and raise the standard of living for manufacturing workers. Manufacturing in Pennsylvania has an annual economic output of $87 billion -the 8th largest output in the United States- and employs 560,000 workers across the state. I will continue to support legislation that highlights the importance of U.S. made products, a skilled workforce, and being on the cutting edge of innovative technology.
Economy Continues on Upward Trend
The recently released October jobs report numbers show no signs of a slowdown in our booming economy. The nationwide unemployment rate held steady at 3.7 %, the economy added 250,000 jobs, and wage gains passed 3% for the first time in nearly a decade. For the first time in many years, the U.S. has more businesses looking to hire workers than there are workers available to fill positions. Month after month, we have seen large employment gains and an improved standard of living for all Americans.
The national economic boom is also finding its way to Pennsylvania. The Real Gross State Product in Pennsylvania, our state-level indicator of GDP, increased 2.9% to $675.2 billion. Key industries in the commonwealth such as manufacturing, mining, logging, and construction, are leading employment growth, which increased by 7.3%. From our backcountry to our cities, communities are reinvigorated, businesses are hiring more workers, and market confidence is stronger than ever before.
Preparing for a Career in Law Enforcement 
I had the opportunity to attend the graduation ceremonies for the Mansfield University Municipal Police Academy.
￼
This rigorous program is a 754-hour course that includes training in laws and procedures, criminal investigation, crisis management, physical training, first aid and CPR, defensive tactics, and firearms. Upon graduation, cadets are eligible to be certified as municipal police officers in Pennsylvania. I am proud to see a new generation of public servants ready to protect and serve our communities. Our law enforcement officers serve those in need, protect the public from crime, and preserve the fabric of American communities. As a former district attorney and federal prosecutor, I have seen firsthand the tough job that law enforcement officers do, and I strongly believe our officers are worthy of our utmost respect. Congratulations on this achievement!

Topeka Chamber Luncheon:
I had the privilege of speaking at the Topeka Chamber’s Congressional Luncheon, where I was able to share about the issues that I have been fighting for on behalf of Kansans I represent in Congress – tax cuts, rural health care, IRS modernization, trade, and more. It was a good time and I want to thank those who made it possible.

Paola High School Visit:
I had the opportunity to spend time with the staff and administrators at Paola High School this week. The dedication they put into the students and their work is inspiring! I want to extend a special congratulations to Christine Deatsch, who was selected as the 2018 School Nutrition Association SW Region Employee of the Year. Paola has had four consecutive State Employees of the Year, three of which have also been regional winners. Thank you for showing me around and keep up the good work! One last thing, the pumpkin bread was incredible. Thanks, ladies!

ICYMI: H.R. 6 Signed Into Law:
Last week, President Trump signed H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, into law. This bipartisan package of legislation is aimed at combatting the opioid and drug addiction crisis that is gripping our country. My bill H.R. 3331, the Improving Access to Behavioral Health Information Technology Act, was included in the bill. H.R. 3331 takes the critical step of bringing mental health and addiction treatment into the 21st century while reducing health spending and expanding access for these treatments to underserved communities, like those in rural Kansas.

November 04, 2018 
Dear Friend,
 
Illegal marijuana cultivation has become a huge problem on our federal lands – to the point where it’s a clear danger to the public and harmful to the environment. Law enforcement doesn't have the resources to keep pace with organized, large-scale grow operations, often run by international cartel organizations.
 
According to the U.S. Forest Service, roughly 90% of all illegal marijuana grow sites are located on National Forest System land in California. Local, state, and federal officials recently completed a year-long illegal marijuana eradication effort known as Operation Forest Watch. The effort resulted in the seizure of 82 firearms, 638,370 plants, and over 103,603 pounds of trash, pesticides, and chemicals.
 
It’s a major problem that many in the North State are all too familiar with. That’s why I recently introduced H.R. 7018, the Protecting Lands Against Narcotics Trafficking (PLANT) Act.
 
The PLANT Act provides resources to help local, state, and federal law enforcement eradicate illegal marijuana grows on public lands, increases fines and penalties for illegally producing marijuana on public lands, and establishes a fund to restore land that has been damaged by pesticides, chemicals, and other illegal cultivation activities – paid for through fines imposed on illegal growers.
 
This is a bipartisan issue that I’ve been working on since I’ve been in Congress. Our public land is being abused and held hostage by armed drug traffickers. We need to be able to enjoy our federal public lands without the fear of stumbling across one of these very dangerous grow sites. The environmental damage done by illegal pesticides, illegal water diversions, and killing of wildlife at these sites is also immense. My bill equips law enforcement with the tools they need to eradicate this threat and begin the cleanup.
 
Recently, I attended the Butte Valley Chamber Town Hall in Dorris, CA to talk about my bill and other measures to protect public safety in the North State.
 
￼
 
Oroville Dam
 
Last week, I participated in an Oroville Dam Safety Comprehensive Needs Assessment (CNA) Ad Hoc Group Meeting at the DWR Oroville Field Division. The Ad Hoc Group meets to review and provide input on the efforts by DWR and the Independent Review Board (IRB) to develop a CNA for public safety related to Oroville Dam and its structures. All of the meetings are available for viewing on DWR’s website at ca.water.gov.The video for last week’s meeting will be posted on 11/7/18 and the meeting summary will be posted on 11/16/18.
 
￼
 
Twenty months after the Oroville Dam spillway disaster that occurred in early 2017, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has finished the reconstruction of the spillway. On Thursday, I attended a barbeque with DWR Director Karla Nemeth, Deputy Director Joel Ledesma, and many DWR employees to thank them for their work on this part of the reconstruction efforts.
 
￼
 
Supporting our Veterans
 
A Veterans Stand Down is an event intended to showcase all of the resources and services available to local veterans on the local, state, and federal level. I was happy to attend the latest stand downs in Shasta County and Nevada County to support our veterans and provide information on ways my office can be of assistance.
 
￼
 
￼
 
The Newest Business in Paradise
 
I had a great time attending the ribbon cutting ceremony for Paradise, CA’s newest business - Gabrielle’s Eatery. With our steadily improving economy, I have no doubt they will be successful for years to come.
 
￼
 
NORTEC Grow Manufacturing Expo
 
Last week, I had the chance to address regional manufactures who attended the NORTEC Grow Manufacturing expo exhibiting the products they produce in the North State. The Expo was held at Chico State and hosted approximately 2,500 students from around the district who are interested in careers in manufacturing. I spoke with many manufacturers, including Raymond Rumiano of Rumiano Cheese in Glenn County, who explained the aging process and its influence on the final product. He’s the 4th generation of his family carrying on the tradition of producing delicious cheeses in Northern California. The outlook of American manufacturing is very bright, as the industry has added nearly half a million jobs over the last 2 years.
 
￼
 
The Economy
 
In case you’ve missed it, the American economy is beginning to thrive once again. Unemployment is at the lowest since 1969, the Department of Labor reports that 250,000 jobs were added in October, and wages have grown 3.1% over the last 12 months.
 
In light of those great economic indicators, I thought it was the perfect time to visit Professor Sean Morgan’s Project Management class at Chico State’s School of Business to speak about the importance of education and its impact on the job market and the economy. Thank you to Professor Morgan for having me!

Siskiyou County Cattleman and Cattlewoman of the Year
 
Congratulations to Tom Nelson, Siskiyou County Cattleman of the year, and Heidy Carver, who received Siskiyou County Cattlewoman of the year at this year’s annual dinner.
 
￼
 
￼
 
I also attended the Lassen County Farm Bureau & Cattlemen/Cattlewomen Annual Dinner to present a certificate to George Alfonso, the county's federal trapper, who is retiring after decades of service to the North State.
 
￼
 
Last but not least, I was in attendance for the Plumas-Sierra County Farm Bureau & Plumas- Sierra Cattleman's Association Fall Dinner along with Farm Bureau President Dave Roberti, Farm Bureau Secretary Helen Roberti, Cattleman’s Association President Rick Roberti, and Cattleman’s Association Secretary Carolyn Roberti.

Out and about in the 10th
On Saturday, October 20, the Eastside Community Center opened its doors. Shalisa Hayes and Team Billy Ray brought the community together to make this project happen, and I can't wait to see all the joy, friendship, and celebrations that will come out of this new space.
￼ 
￼ 
 I joined community leaders from Pierce County at Pacific Lutheran University to discuss the most pressing issues our schools and communities are facing, notably homelessness and how that impacts education. 
￼ 
 I joined leaders of the Nisqually Indian Tribe and Thurston County at the Nisqually reservation to celebrate their first ballot box, which will provide another way for tribal members to cast their ballot in future elections.
￼  
I checked in with the students at GATES High School in Tacoma to see how school is going and participated in a Q&A about how to be active in our representative democracy.
￼ 
￼ 
I also spoke to the Lakewood Historical Society about how we can preserve our community's history and get future generations engaged in telling the stories of our past.
￼ 
I return to D.C. in November for more legislative business, and I'll make sure to take what I heard from the people of the 10th Congressional District back with me as we decide on important matters before this session of Congress ends. 
As always, thank you for your engagement and input, I couldn't do it without you.

Friends,
 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) motto reads: ""To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan."" 
 
As Fort Bragg's Congressman, I take that sentiment to heart and work every day to keep that promise.  
 
As part of that responsibility, I had the opportunity to welcome the Second Lady of the United States, Karen Pence, to Fort Bragg and our district last week. Mrs. Pence has made supporting military spouses and families a pillar of her work as Second Lady. And that’s exactly why I wanted to bring her to Fort Bragg – the epicenter of the universe. I enjoyed introducing her to our community, and we spent valuable time meeting with service members and their families and hearing what our government can do to better support them.
 
￼
I was proud to welcome Mrs. Pence to Fort Bragg. 
 
From there, we traveled to Moore County so that I could show Mrs. Pence an incredible small business that is owned by military spouses and serves to provide military spouses meaningful and dependable employment. After touring R. Riveter a few years ago, I wrote the ROSIE Act to incentivize small businesses to hire more military spouses.
 
By the same token, I’ve worked with President Donald Trump to make caring for our troops, our veterans, and military families a top priority. And we’ve made great progress.
 
This year marks the first on-time annual funding bill for the Department of Defense in 22 years. With this bill, we took steps to ensure military spouses and families have the support they need. It includes $34.4 billion for the Defense Health Program, which funds cancer research, traumatic brain injury and psychological health research, and sexual assault prevention and response, among other worthy initiatives.
 
We also gave our troops a well-deserved pay raise – the largest one in nine years, and included my amendment to increase funding to train our Special Forces at Fort Bragg. We will only continue to be the strongest military in the world if we remain committed to making our troops a priority, and that’s exactly what we’ve done the last two years with Congress and the White House working together.
 
￼
Mrs. Pence and I visited R. Riveter, a small business in our district doing BIG things. 
 
This visit with Mrs. Pence came at a special time for us as Veterans Day is fast approaching. With President Trump as our Commander in Chief, we’ve made great strides to improve veteran health care.
 
This Congress, the House has passed more than 70 bills to improve care and support for our veterans, and we’ve had over two-dozen of these bipartisan bills signed into law. I worked to make sure we provided the highest funding level in history for the VA while also strengthening oversight and holding bureaucrats responsible. And we’ve passed critical measures to address the tragedy of veteran suicide and improve mental health services.
 
Further, I helped get the largest expansion of GI Bill benefits in a decade signed into law. And I continue to fight to get my bill, the Care Veterans Deserve Act (H.R. 1152), signed into law. I believe veterans with a 50% service-connected disability rating or higher should have the choice to seek private care in their own communities and have the VA pay for it.
 
All of this is progress, but there is still so much more work to do to fulfill our promise to our nation’s heroes. I give you my commitment that I’ll do just that each and every day I have the privilege of being your voice in Congress.
 
 
Until next week,
￼
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)

Back Home in the Tenth District



I spent Friday morning with Lincoln County Schools Superintendent Dr. Lory Morrow, Principal Shanti Clancy, and the students and teachers of St. James Elementary School.

￼

In the afternoon I presented a FEMA Assistance to Firefighters Grant check to the Town of Stanley Fire Department in Gaston County. This grant was awarded through the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant program which is peer reviewed and competitively awarded.

Good News For Our Economy



Last week, we again heard good news about the booming U.S. economy. In the third quarter the U.S. GDP saw higher than expected growth at 3.5% thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The October jobs report was released this week and 250,000 jobs were added in October along with a record number of pay raises. It's no surprise that consumer confidence is at an eighteen year high. Americans all across the country are better off now than before and you can click here or on the image below to find out some more reasons why.

Gaston Gazette 

Please join Giulia and me in praying for the Dallas Police Department and the loved ones of Corporal Travis Wells who was killed in this last week's tragic accident. I am always thankful for our law enforcement officials and everything they do to keep our neighborhoods safe.

Standing in Solidarity 
 
 
I had the honor of attending the vigil at Temple Emanu-el in memory of the 11 people who tragically lost their lives in Pittsburgh. My heart breaks for their families and the entire Jewish community during this time. I will always stand with you against anti-Semitism and any other form of hatred or violence. There is no place for these evils in our society and we will fight them together.

Economic Good News Continues
 
Republicans in Congress are working every day to restore economic competitiveness, rebuild our middle class, and create opportunity for the next generation. Our policies of less government, lower taxes, and less regulation are doing just that! If you need proof just look at the October Jobs Report which was released on Friday. The robust labor market beat expectations again, adding 250,000 new jobs with wage growth topping 3% for the first time since the recession! This is on top of record low unemployment and record high business and consumer confidence. I am so proud of how far we've come and am committed to further growing our economy through pro-growth policies!

Myrtle Beach Red Cross Tour
 
 
I had the opportunity to tour the Myrtle Beach Red Cross to meet with volunteers and thank them for their efforts during Hurricane Florence. When thousands of people weren't sure if they were going to have food to eat or a place to sleep during the storm, The Red Cross was there to help. I am so grateful for their selfless work when we needed them most!

Manufacturing Legislative Excellence Award
 
 
I was honored to receive the National Association of Manufacturer's Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence for supporting policies that have strengthened manufacturing and created opportunities for South Carolina's workers. In 2016, President Obama and Democrats said that manufacturing jobs were never coming back, but after implementing common sense regulatory policies and pro-growth tax reform, we are in the midst of a manufacturing resurgence. I will continue to work with the Administration on policies that support manufacturing jobs and create new opportunities across all sectors of our economy.

FEMA Updates 
 
 
As our community continues to recover from Hurricane Florence, I will keep you updated with information from FEMA that may be helpful to you and your family during this process. 
Bucksport Mobile Disaster Recovery Center: A Mobile Disaster Recovery Center (MDRC) is now open in Bucksport. The MDRC is located at the James R. Frazier Community Center at 1370 Bucksport Road and will be open November 2nd to November 6th (excluding Sunday, November 4th) from 9 am to 6 pm. 
Deadline Approaching: There is less than one month left for you to apply for FEMA assistance. Homeowners, renters and business owners in Chesterfield, Darlington, Dillon, Florence, Georgetown, Horry, Marion and Marlboro counties have until November 20, 2018 to apply for disaster assistance for damage and losses from Hurricane Florence.
 

 
Vote Tuesday! 
 
 
As you might know, the midterm elections are this Tuesday, November 6th. Every American has the right to vote, and this is a right we should not take for granted. Regardless of who you vote for, I hope you get out and vote on Tuesday!
 

Have a great week,
￼

A Recap of the Past Few Weeks
It has certainly been a busy few weeks as I made my way across TX-36, visiting my fellow Texans across all the counties of the district! I enjoyed every meeting, dinner, and conversation as we all continue to work together to make this country as safe and economically secure as it can be. I want to provide you all with a little recap of last month's district work period because we covered some ground! It is truly an honor to represent each man, woman, and child that resides in the 36th Congressional District of Texas.
Johnson Space Center Visit with Ivanka
It was special to have the opportunity to speak with our astronauts aboard the International Space Station when I visited Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston with Ivanka Trump. There is great work being done at JSC, and many exciting things are in store for America's space program in the coming months.

 Prototypes of the Border Wall

I learned so much during my trip to California to view the prototypes for the President's border wall. Our Immigration and Custom Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents are working hard to secure our borders and keep American citizens safe.

There is a lot of concerning news coming from Washington these days, Lindsey. 

But despite all the noise and nonsense, I know we can still work together to solve problems and move our country forward.

Here’s how I’ve continued to focus on Making Government Work for Sacramento County: 

• Introducing Prescription to Protect Our Care to fix what isn’t working in health care: I supported the first bipartisan plan to fix the Affordable Care Act and make it better. My Prescription to Protect Our Care plan would protect people with pre-existing conditions, lower costs, and expand access to health care.

• Helping local families, veterans, and seniors: My office has helped 11,072 people in Sacramento County. That’s helping folks with backlogged veterans’ benefits, Social Security and Medicare issues, stalled tax refunds, and so much else. We’ve also helped local taxpayers recover $5,499,922 they were owed. That’s money right back in the pockets of local families – fueling our economy.

• Delivering results to help everyone get ahead: We’ve also helped veterans with housing, supported critical infrastructure projects, helped keep our neighborhoods safe, and much more. My staff and I have worked to deliver results and make our community better. 

Congress should be a place for service. If we work hard, we can put the needs of real people ahead of special interests and partisan politics.

If you have any thoughts or concerns you’d like to share, please click here to contact me.

Be well,

President Trump Signs Tenney’s Bill, Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act into Law
In case you missed it, President Donald Trump signed H.R. 6, SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act into law. Included in this comprehensive legislation is my bill, H.R. 5723-Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act of 2018. This legislation will provide the state ofNew York $50,521,352 to combat the opioid crisis. My bill passed the House as a stand-alone bill in June.   As a member of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force, I have made it my mission in Congress to find a comprehensive and compassionate solution to reverse the tide of the growing opioid epidemic. Addiction is plaguing our communities and ripping families apart. Last year alone, we lost 114 people to the opioid scourge. Shockingly, ourdistrict experienced nearly 10 percent of the total opioid deaths statewide. Over the past two years, we have worked to secure over $6 billion to combat the opioid epidemic. The bill I introduced?the Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act?will identify and roll back barriers that have inhibited the use of non-opioid alternatives to treat pain. I will continue to work closely with the Trump Administration to ensure ending the opioid scourge is a top priority.
Assistance With Grants and Letters of Support 
Whether you’re a fire department in need of new equipment or a community organization looking to grow, our office can assist you in navigating the federal grant process.

Serving Our Community...
Dear Friend:


As we close out October and begin November, I appreciate you taking the time to read this brief update. It is an honor representing you.

Keeping our community and children safe has always been one of my top priorities. Back in March, I wrote to you about the passage of H.R. 4909, the ‘STOP School Violence Act of 2018.’ This bill provided an additional $75 million a year, over the next decade, geared towards school security. More recently, I also wrote to you about my bipartisan introduction of H.R. 6713, the ‘Safe-2-Tell Act of 2018,’ which looks to take Colorado’s ‘Safe-2-Tell Program’ nationally.

￼

Just this past Wednesday, 9News reported on this initiative. Not only am I glad to see this legislation garnering local media attention, but I am even more excited at the possibility of expanding Colorado’s model across the country to keep students, teachers, and staff safe. As I return to Washington later this month, I will continue working in a bipartisan manner to pass this legislation and get it to the President’s desk for his signature.

This week, I also sent a letter to the Acting Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding their proposal to roll back the current emission standards for mercury. Mercury is a trace element contained in the coal burned by power plants and the EPA put in place standards in 2012 to dramatically limit those mercury emissions. The EPA set this standard because exposure to too much mercury can have severe health consequences. Between 2012 and 2016, the utilities that burn coal spent billions of dollars complying with this standard and now all the coal fired power plants in the U.S. have met the new standard. At present, the electric power companies and the environmental community agree that the standards should not be relaxed and I agree too. There are many poorly thought out or excessive regulations the Administration can and should consider eliminating, but this is not one of them. I hope the EPA will reconsider its position on this matter.

Closer to home, as I mentioned in last week’s message, this past week we interviewed the young men and woman who live in this congressional district who hope to attend one of our service academies and then become the next generation of leaders for our military. This is always one of the highlights of the year for me as it is an opportunity to see and hear from some talented young people. This year we interviewed 65 applicants (40% of them women) with the majority seeking to attend the Air Force Academy. The competition is quite intense, since I can only nominate 10 individuals to each of the three main academies (Air Force, Navy, and Army). I want to thank the 34 individuals (mainly veterans and academy graduates) who devoted their afternoon to serving on the interview panels. My staff is now totaling up the scores from these applicants and, at the end of November, I will review their applications and the input from the interview panels. Then I must make the tough decisions on which ones I will nominate.

Finally, I invite you to stay in contact with me via my website, facebook or twitter account. See you around the district!


Sincerely,

Friends,
I hope you all had a great week. I certainly enjoyed traveling around the district meeting with you all.
We Stand With Pittsburgh 
Monday night, I was honored to stand in solidarity with the Jewish community and others in Northeast Ohio at a vigil honoring the victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. Anti-Semitism, bigotry, and violence have no place in our country. 
￼
Great Lakes Restoration Project
Resources from the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) are used to implement environmental protection and restoration projects throughout the entire Great Lakes region. On Monday, I spent the afternoon with folks from the Western Reserve Land Conservancy at Gray Horse Farm in Munson Township to see one of these preservation projects firsthand. 
The Great Lakes remain a priority for me. They hold about 20% of the world's fresh surface water supply, generate more than 1.5 million jobs and $60 billion in wages annually. I will continue to champion full funding to preserve the Great Lakes in Congress. 
￼
￼
Protecting Our Seniors
On Thursday, I held seminars in Aurora and Munroe Falls educating our seniors on mail fraud and telemarketing scams. More than $37 billion is stolen from the elderly in America each year. These scammers target the most vulnerable among us. These seminars help educate our seniors on steps to take to protect themselves. 
Thank you to Mayor Ann Womer Benjamin, Mayor James Armstrong, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service for making these events successful!
If you feel you've been a target of scammers, call 1-800-275-8777. For more information, visit the United States Postal Inspection Service's Inspectors Website.

￼
Service to Others
This week, I visited both the Hudson Rotary Club and the Twinsburg Rotary Club to give an update about my work in Congress. I was happy to answer questions on important topics and see some new people in our community. It is always inspiring to hear about all of the acts of service both rotary clubs do in Northeast Ohio. I hope to see you all again soon. 
￼
￼
Innovation at NeuroTechnologies 
It was great to spend time with the Mayor of Independence, Anthony Togliatti, and folks at Great Lakes NeuroTechnologies in Independence. I enjoy partnering with small businesses in Northeast Ohio and I am pleased to share that NeuroTechnologies recently received two National Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation Research grants to develop innovative biomedical technologies. 
￼
￼
Habitat for Humanity 
I was happy to lend a helping hand to Habitat for Humanity of Summit County at their current build site in Twinsburg Township with Trustee Tom Schmidt. Habitat for Humanity has a longstanding tradition of serving families in need in Northeast Ohio. Keep up the great work!
￼
￼
YMCA and Willoughby Eastlake Schools 
I'm pleased to share that construction for the ""Union Village"" development project in Willoughby is underway. Willoughby Eastlake Schools partnered with the YMCA to build a new school building, YMCA, and senior center. Thanks for inviting me to check out the site. I look forward to seeing the finished product!
￼
￼
The Shelly Company 
It was great to visit The Shelly Company in Shalersville this week with my dear friend, State Representative Sarah LaTourette. We talked about the need to fix our roads and bridges, and about the company's growing impact in Northeast Ohio. 
￼
Thank you all for taking the time to read my newsletter. I hope you're enjoying your Sunday, and Go Browns!
Dave

November 4, 2018
Dear Friend,  
It has been a busy week.  I’ve had the privilege of speaking with many of you and attending countless events throughout our community.  As I mentioned in the newsletter I emailed last Sunday, 25 of the provisions I’ve authored since 2015 have already been signed into law.  This past week, I spent a great deal of time working behind the scenes with administration and agency officials to ensure the most recently passed policy and budgetary provisions are implemented in the manner intended. I want to be sure that the positive impact to constituents and our community is maximized.  
Continue reading for a brief recap of the highlights from my week of work on your behalf!  
Facilitating Economic Success 
As indicated in this article, the Department of Labor issued a report last week that contained excellent news about the state of our economy. Yet again, expectations across a broad spectrum of metrics have been exceeded. The economy added 250,000 jobs in October. The unemployment rate stayed at 3.7 percent in September, the lowest it has been since 1969. I was in first grade the last time it was this low. Wages rose by 3.1 percent over the past 12 months, and no major industries lost jobs last month.  There were also large jobs gains in a variety of sectors:
	•	30,000 new construction jobs
	•	32,000 new manufacturing jobs
	•	44,000 new education and health services jobs
Average hourly earnings rose by 3.1 percent over the past 12 months. This is the first time that the 12-month growth in nominal average hourly earnings exceeded 3 percent in nearly a decade – since April 2009.  Even taking inflation into account (real wage growth), wages are still growing. Based on the most recent Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index from September, inflation in the past year was 2.0 percent.  We must continue to ensure that we support the policies that are enabling these positive results!
Supporting Affordable Housing for Vulnerable Populations 
It was great to join other community leaders for the ground breaking of a local housing project for developmentally disabled adults last week. This important public-private partnership combines a mix of federal and state funding with private investment to meet a tremendous need in our community. Affordable housing is such an important priority, especially for vulnerable populations, such as those with developmental disabilities. These adults with special needs deserve an opportunity to experience independence in a safe and supportive environment. That is exactly what they will receive at the Commons at Spear Village, with the help of the dedicated staff of Youth and Family Alternatives. This facility will have a positive impact on the lives of countless individuals, families and our community as a whole, and I look forward to celebrating its opening.
￼ 
Honoring our Heroes 
It was a privilege to welcome home our heroes from last week's Honor Flight. This special program allows Veterans the opportunity to visit Washington, D.C. and tour the monuments that have been built to honor their service and the service of the brave men and women they served alongside.
￼ 
I also had a very productive and positive meeting with Paul Russo, the new Director of the Bay Pines VA Healthcare System, last week.  We discussed several concerns and needs that have been brought to my attention by constituents.  Some examples include: expanding the current outpatient clinic in Palm Harbor, the needs of female Veterans within the system warranting more attention, and opportunity existing to improve the speed and convenience with which Veterans are able to access mental health and substance abuse treatment.  I found Mr. Russo to be responsive, well-informed and Veteran-focused. He also provided me with specific suggestions about how Congress can help provide him with greater flexibility in meeting the needs of local Veterans, which I have already begun to tackle.  I am encouraged by the progress made during this meeting, and feel optimistic that we will have a positive working relationship that will benefit my constituents living within the area that is served by the Bay Pines VA Healthcare System.    
Learning from You 
Last week, I continued my Coffee with Your Congressman series, holding two forums in the district. One was held at the Seven Springs Golf and Country Club in New Port Richey.  We discussed our nation's growing deficit, preserving Social Security and the importance of border security.  
￼ 
I also held one at Heritage Pines, in Hudson.  We discussed the need to teach civics to our students, Veterans' benefits, Medicare and law enforcement issues.  If you or your community is interested in inviting me to speak to your neighbors, please contact my scheduler, Dan Paasch, at 727-232-2921.
￼ 
Celebrating Families and Adoption  
Last week, I also had the chance to participate in the 6th Judicial Circuit National Adoption Day Ceremony in West Pasco.  This was a beautiful celebration of all of the parents who have opened up their homes and hearts to give a child in need of a stable and loving environment a forever family.  Not only was it a moving and uplifting experience, but a great reminder that in the midst of troubling things that often grab headlines, there is so much good that exists and lives that are being forever changed right here in our community.

The Tree of Life Synagogue Tragedy
Synagogues and other places of worship are safe havens where communities come together to celebrate, pray, and reflect. The murder of 11 people inside the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh last weekend was a cowardly act of violence fueled by hate and anti-Semitism.
It has been heartening to see the outpouring of support for the members of Tree of Life Synagogue and the city of Pittsburgh, as vigils were hosted across the country. I had the honor of joining hundreds of people of various faiths and backgrounds to pray, mourn, and to stand up against anti-Semitism and hate at vigils in Pittsburgh and Allentown.
My prayers continue to be with the victims, their families and friends, and the members of the Tree of Life Synagogue. I greatly appreciate the actions of the first responders who tended to the wounded and apprehended the shooter.
Together, we will rise above this act of hate.
￼
￼
Honoring Pennsylvania's Vietnam Veterans
Our Commonwealth's Vietnam veterans bravely served this country and for too long, many have been unsung heroes. To recognize these veterans, my office is partnering with state lawmakers from Pike and Wayne Counties to host a ceremony honoring their service with a 50th anniversary commemorative pin.
This ceremony will take place on Friday, November 9 at 2PM at the Hamlin Fire Company Banquet Hall, located at 582 PA-590 in Hamlin.
Veterans who served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces at any time between Nov. 1, 1955, and May 15, 1975, regardless of station location, will be eligible to receive a lapel pin at this ceremony.
Vietnam veterans who wish to attend should RSVP by contacting my office in Wilkes-Barre at (570) 820-4088. I encourage all Vietnam War veterans in Wayne County and the surrounding area to participate in this recognition event.

Dear Friends, 
Happy first Sunday in November! Before the Packers take on New England tonight, I wanted to take a moment and give you an update on some important news happening both in Wisconsin and around the country.  Let's Take On The Opioid Epidemic Together 
Opioid abuse has devastated communities in Wisconsin and around the nation. In fact, opioid abuse kills more Americans every year than car accidents.  We've got to do everything we can to combat this widespread epidemic. And even though it's an uphill battle, we are making some important strides to help our communities fight back. For example, the House of Representatives has recently passed more than $10 billion worth of measures to fight this crisis. Funding specifically goes to states and tribal governments for treatment and prevention measures.   And I couldn't be more proud of the way Wisconsin has embraced Prescription Drug Take Back Days. On the Take Back Day this past May, Wisconsin got rid of 63,000 pounds of unused prescription drugs. That accounted for more drugs disposed of than every state in the nation except Texas and California (which of course are much larger than Wisconsin).
And this morning, I'm excited to share information about a new resource for our communities: a free and confidential new service from Wisconsin Department of Health Services. By dialing ""211,"" you can now receive information about local resources in Wisconsin for those struggling with drug addiction.
Click HERE to ""like"" and share to spread the word about this helpful resource.
￼ 
  
Our Economy Continues To Grow 
Just a few years ago, we saw ""Going Out Of Business"" signs in storefronts in Wisconsin and around the country. Low growth, no new opportunities, and if you were in a job that you didn't like, you were probably stuck in it because there were not other jobs available.  Now, after our pro-growth policies have been enacted, the American Dream is more accessible. By lowering your taxes and getting rid of ridiculous regulations, businesses large and small have replaced those ""Going Out Of Business"" signs with ""Now Hiring"" signs.  And just this past week, we received news that the economy added a whopping 250,000 new jobs in October. And on top of that, wages and salaries have jumped by the ""highest level in a decade.""  Click HERE or the image below to share the good news about our growing economy. There's a lot of noise when you turn on a TV or radio these days- people need to hear about this! 
￼  
Great Opportunity For College Students Or Recent Grads    Attention college students or recent grads: my Washington DC office is now accepting applications for Spring internships. It's a great way to serve your community and get involved in the political process.   For more information on the internship, click HERE or the photo below. Also be sure to share these opportunities with any interested students! 
￼ 
 Stay Connected On Social Media         Snapchat is a fun way to stay connected with what’s going on in Wisconsin and Washington (and of course, find me on Facebook and Twitter- @RepSeanDuffy). Find my snapchat profile either by searching @RepSeanDuffy or use the Snapcode below!  
￼ 
  
 
 
Until next week!   God bless, 
￼

JOBS!

The Department of Labor announced big jobs news this week. Due to pro-growth policies, the economy added 250,000 jobs last month. Additionally, wages are up and the unemployment rate stayed at the lowest rate it has been in nearly half a century. 

￼

I fight every day in Congress for pro-growth, pro-job policies like tax reform to support hardworking Americans and our job creators and I will continue to do so. As I travel the First District, I hear from many businesses that they are creating so many jobs they can't hire workers fast enough. I'm thrilled to see these policies working here in GA-01. 

ADDRESSING MATERNAL MORTALITY

The rate of maternal mortality in Georgia is absolutely unacceptable. Recently I invited health care professionals in the First District to participate in a roundtable to discuss solutions. I'm going to bring this important information back to Washington as we work to address this problem in the Energy and Commerce Committee. 

￼

I spoke about this issue on Mid-Morning Live this week on WTOC. Click here to view our discussion. 

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CLXXXVI

Monday, October 29, 2018:  Yesterday, I was honored to be the guest speaker at the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) quarterly meeting held on St. Simons Island.  MOAA is a group that was chartered in 1964 and consists of active and retired officers from the Golden Isles area.  After bringing them up to date on issues in Washington, I enjoyed a question and answer session with this great group. 
￼
Rep. Carter speaking at the MOAA quarterly meeting
 Afterwards, I headed to the St. Simons Island Methodist Church where I participated in the Eagle Scout Ceremony for Glynn County resident Walker Butin by presenting him with an American flag flown over the Capitol.  This morning I participate in a National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) presentation in Pooler before heading to the Savannah Downtown Rotary Club weekly meeting where the guest speaker is Hunter Army Airfield commander Lt. Col. Ken Dwyer.  Lt. Col. Dwyer, a Green Beret who has received numerous awards during his outstanding career, shares his inspirational personal story with the group that shows his courage and perseverance are above reproach.  Afterwards, I head to Fort Stewart Army Base where I visit with the 1-118 Field Artillery of the Georgia Army National Guard as they prepare for deployment to Afghanistan in the upcoming weeks.  After a short briefing of the overall training plan from leadership, I head to the field where they are conducting Gunnery Skills testing before touring the Rapid Fielding warehouse as Soldiers are issued the latest equipment prior to deployment. 
￼
Rep. Carter at Fort Stewart
 Next, I tour the medical and administrative readiness update unit where all medical and administrative issues are corrected or updated prior to the soldier’s deployment.  These great men and women are some of our nations very finest and their dedication and commitment are inspiring.    
 
Tuesday, October 30, 2018:  I’m in downtown Savannah bright and early this morning as I have a radio interview with Wayne Waters on WRUU, a noncommercial community radio station.  After about 45 minutes discussing political issues, I head back to Pooler and later head to Pembroke in Bryan County to meet with officers of the North Bryan Chamber of Commerce including Mayor Judy Cook. 
￼
Rep. Carter attending the North Bryan Chamber of Commerce meeting
Next, I head to First Presbyterian Christian Academy in Hinesville in Liberty County where I visit with Ms. Dollar’s second grade class that has recently been studying how our federal government works. I enjoyed answering the many questions that this bright group of students had for me regarding my work in Washington.  Afterwards, I head to our district office in Savannah where I meet with a constituent who runs a rehabilitation center in Pooler to discuss the Opioid epidemic and the recent legislation that we passed to address the situation.  My next meeting is with a constituent concerning Social Security Disability benefits followed by a meeting with a constituent who I have worked with in the past regarding the Opioid crisis and has suggestions on how we can have more outreach programs in the community.  My final meeting is with a student from Richmond Hill High School who is applying to a military academy and will be participating in our academy day in November.  Each year I host an academy day where applicants from across the district are interviewed by a board of volunteers that advise me in nominating students to the military academies.  After a conference call with officials at the State Department to discuss a specific immigration issue that we have been working on in our office, I head to Congregation Agudath Achim in Savannah for an interfaith vigil for the victims of the Pittsburg synagogue shooting last weekend.  I finish my day by heading to Richmond Hill in Bryan County for a meeting with constituents.
 
Wednesday, October 31, 2018:  Today begins with a tour of the Preferred Materials Plant in Savannah where I meet with company officials and learn more about the work they are doing in upgrading our infrastructure in the District.  Preferred Materials supplies asphalt, concrete, concrete products and paving services throughout the Southeast and as I tour their facilities I am impressed with the quality and magnitude of their work.  One of their current challenges, like so many businesses these days, is access to workers which we addressed in Congress earlier this year by passing the Carl D. Perkins Reauthorization Act, the largest federal bill for funding for career and technical education. 
￼
Rep. Carter touring the Preferred Materials Plant in Savannah
 Afterwards, I head to the Coastal Georgia Center in Savannah where I have the opportunity to address the Clinical Social Work Association of Savannah and bring them up to date on federal issues.  Next, I head to McIntosh County Academy in Darien where I meet with U.S. History students and share with them my story of how I became involved in public service, what a typical day serving in Congress is like and then participate in a question and answer session.  Without question, this is one of my favorite activities and I am very impressed with the questions this group of young people have. 
￼
Rep. Carter speaking to McIntosh County Academy students
Next, I head to St. Marys in Camden County and during the drive I have a phone interview with Kent Justice with WJXT in Jacksonville to discuss the political landscape in the District.  Once in St. Marys I meet with members of Transport Workers Union, Local 526 at the Kings Bay Base and have a great discussion with them on national and local issues. 
 
Thursday, November 1, 2018:  I begin today with two radio interviews.  My first interview is with the world famous Butch and Bob show in Jesup as I discuss state and national politics with my good friend Bob Morgan.  Next, I am the guest on the Verb Altitude Hour in Savannah with Carrie Smith as we discuss issues important to the upcoming election.  Afterwards, I record a Twitter question and answer series with staff before heading to downtown Savannah for a special press conference with the YMCA/Healthy Savannah foundation where they announce they have been awarded a $3.4 million grant from the CDC to reduce health disparities in African American and Latino communities in the area. 
￼
Rep. Carter at the grant announcement for YMCA and Healthy Savannah 
 Next, I head to Clanton’s River Ranch in Wayne County for one of my favorite events of the year- Day for Wayne.  This annual event sponsored by the Wayne County Chamber of Commerce draws elected officials and citizens from near and far as the County showcases the beauty of the area and how much it has to offer.  The beautiful weather combined with the great fellowship and many outdoor activities make this year’s event one of the best ever.
 
Friday, November 2, 2018:  It’s always good to start my day with a radio interview with my good friends Bill Edwards and Laura Anderson with WTKS in Savannah and there’s plenty to talk about this morning with Vice President Mike Pence’s visit to Savannah last night and the final days before the election.  Afterwards, I meet with representatives from State Farm Insurance to discuss issues such as flood insurance before heading to the WTOC studios in Savannah where I am a guest on Mid-Morning Live and have the opportunity to discuss my work on maternal mortality in our State. 
￼
Rep. Carter on Mid-Morning Live
 Next, I end a very busy week by meeting with constituents in Effingham, Bryan and Chatham Counties.

October in Photos
Fall is in full swing, and many of our farmers are seeing the product of their hard work. And throughout the nation, Americans are seeing the results of pro-growth policies – more jobs, higher wages, stronger trade, and a renewed sense of optimism.
Here are five photos that show some of my favorite moments from the month of October: 
1. National Farmers Day – During the month of October, we celebrated National Farmers Day. A farming culture is ingrained in our country’s heritage, and because of the farmers and ranchers who work the fields day in and day out, farming will continue to be our nation’s number one industry. If you see or know a farmer, thank them for their hard work in producing our nation's safe and secure food supply. 
￼  
2. West Texas Warriors – We as a nation are eternally indebted to those who have laid down their life so we can live in freedom and peace. It has been my profound honor recognizing the fallen heroes of our region, and it is my hope that through the West Texas Warrior initiative, we can create a culture of honor and respect among our youth for those who serve in uniform.
￼ 
3. Frontlines – The opioid crisis is one that cuts across all communities in all corners of our country. As our nation continues to battle this epidemic, it has been critical hearing from some of our sheriffs who are on the frontlines in the fight against opioids. In October, President Trump signed into law legislation I was proud to support that will strengthen the federal response to this crisis and better assist those struggling with addiction. 
￼ 
4. Strong Ag Economy – The agriculture industry is the lifeblood of our economy, and our region plays a tremendous role in feeding and clothing the United States and other nations around the world. I am proud to represent and fight for our producers as negotiations continue on the 2018 Farm Bill. Those with The Texas Lyceum and I had a great discussion on ways to support the industry. 
￼ 
5. Rural Development – Throughout the nation, local communities are investing in new projects because of tax and regulatory relief, and it is exciting to see that growth play out right here with the Big Spring Rail Project grand opening. Big things happening are in Big Spring!

Due to a staff error, yesterday’s newsletter regrettably contained a typo. It read, ‘We will be intimidated by the anti-Semitic attacks on members of our community.’ That sentence should, of course, have read “We will not be intimidated by the anti-Semitic attacks on members of our community.”  Sincere apologies for the error; it is corrected below. 

In This Edition 
I was horrified and devastated by the shooting at the Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue in Pittsburgh. This bigotry and hatred exhibited by the shooter has no place in our society. 
It was a pleasure to visit the students at Tincher Preparatory School in Long Beach last week. 
This week, I joined my colleagues in sending a letter to President Trump requesting that his administration act to uphold the Affordable Care Act’s strong protections.  
The 2018 midterm election is on Tuesday the 6th. In this edition, you’ll find information on where and how to vote early. 
In this edition of Alan’s Inbox, see my response to constituents who have contacted me to express their support for the Opioids and STOP Pain Initiative Act.  
In Congress U this week, I talk about why the United states holds its national elections on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November.  
Lastly, don’t forget to take this week’s poll in the right-hand column.

A Horrific Shooting at a Pittsburgh Synagogue 
I was horrified and devastated by last weekend’s shooting at the Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue in Pittsburgh. This bigotry and hatred exhibited by the shooter has no place in our society. I want to commend the law enforcement personnel and first responders who put their lives on the line to prevent an even greater loss of life. My heart goes out to the family and friends of those who were killed and injured in this tragedy. I am proud to be a Jewish Member of Congress. We will not be intimidated by the anti-Semitic attacks on members of our community. As we mourn our brothers and sisters in Pittsburgh, join me in pledging to support compassion, truth, and hope as we vigorously push back  against hatred, lies, and divisiveness.
Visiting Tincher Preparatory School in Long Beach 
It was a pleasure to visit the students at Tincher Preparatory School last week. Tincher is a K-8 school in Long Beach that has been recognized as a California Distinguished School and a Title 1 High Achieving School. On the day of my visit, the school was celebrating its redesignation as a “School to Watch” by the National Forum to Accelerate Middle-Grades Reform for its academic excellence.  I spoke to the students about the importance of working hard in school, and the many wonderful career opportunities that hard work can lead to. Thanks to the Long Beach College Promise, many of these students will be able to attend Long Beach City College and CSULB once they graduate from high school.

Defending the Affordable Care Act 
This week, I joined my colleagues in sending a letter to President Trump requesting that his administration act to uphold the Affordable Care Act’s strong protections for patients with pre-existing conditions. The President continually claims to support people with pre-existing conditions, while his own Administration backs a lawsuit that would end these protections and devastate millions of Americans. Click here to read the full letter.

Each week hundreds of constituents contact my office to share their views on a variety of topics. I have recently received many messages from constituents expressing their support for the Opioids and STOP Pain Initiative Act. Below is a portion of my response to those messages: 
“The Opioids and STOP Pain Initiative Act would establish a research program through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to increase our understanding of pain, develop and improve alternative treatments for pain, and establish strategies for addressing the opioid crisis. 
I am supportive of this bill.  As a community psychologist, I recognize the importance of research that allows people to lead healthier lives.  As a nation, we have a long and proud record of accomplishment in scientific research that has brought cures and treatments to billions across the globe.  
You may also be interested to know that in the previous Congress, I cosponsored and voted in favor of the 21st Century Cures Act, which was signed into law.  This legislation boosted funding for the NIH, as well as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which approves new treatments and cures.  In addition, this bill made a number of changes to the drug approval process to ensure that medical cures reach the people who need them more quickly, while also maintaining patient safety. 
I will continue to support, as I have every year I have been in Congress, robust funding for the NIH and our health research programs.”  
If you have written in to me, please continue to do so. If you have not, I encourage you to share your views and concerns with me, as it is the best way for me to find out which issues you care most about.   You can find out how to contact me on my website by clicking here.

Congressional Elections: Why Tuesday, and Why November?   We are now just days away from the November 6, 2018 mid-term election, where, as is the case every two years, all 435 seats in the House will be decided by the voters. I thought it might be interesting to look back on the very first national House of Representatives election and why it, like all federal elections, are held on the first Tuesday in November.   Prior to 1845, each state held federal elections on dates of their own choosing. In 1845, Congress passed a law setting the Tuesday after the first Monday in November as the date for the next presidential election. This was further adopted as the date for electing House Members in 1875. When Senators began being directly elected by voters, the legislation was amended to include them. 
In the mid-1800s, America was still a largely agricultural society with very slow and inadequate rural transportation. Winter months were difficult to travel during. Most voters were busy in the spring planting crops and busy in the summer tending the crops, and it wasn’t until November that the fall harvest was usually complete.   Why Tuesday? Rural voters often required at least a day to travel to their county seats to vote. Since church service put Sunday out of the question and Wednesdays were usually market days in rural areas, Tuesday was selected. 
And why the Tuesday after the first Monday? The answer is somewhat mundane—it’s a matter of counting calendar days. When the 1845 law setting the presidential election date was being debated, the date was first set as ""the first Tuesday in November."" Someone noticed that in some years the period between the first Tuesday in November and the first Wednesday in December (when the presidential electors are required to meet in their state capitals to vote) would be more than 34 days. This would have violated the existing Electoral College law. So, using an election calendar already used by the state of New York, the bill was reworded to make election day the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This meant that there could only be a maximum of 29 days between election day and the first Wednesday in December, satisfying the electoral college law.   
￼ 
Which voting method do you plan to use to cast your ballot in the November 6th midterm election?   
60% I will vote early by mail  35% I will vote in person on Election Day  3%   I will vote early in person  1%   Don’t Know/Unsure  0%   I don’t plan to vote in this election 

Thank you,

Helping save homes in Lewis County from river erosion
￼
Celebrating the completion of the new bank protecting the cabins in Packwood from the Cowlitz River was a memorable day. I was pleased to play a role in the project by securing the necessary funding through FEMA, and attend the dedication ceremony last weekend.
￼
When there was a major threat of river erosion to the Timberland Community cabins, the neighbors banded together to see this project through to completion. It was an honor to assist and meet the residents whose homes were saved.
Rebuilding warming shelter for winter sports enthusiasts
￼
After the warming shelter on Marble Mountain burned down seven years ago, the Mount St. Helens Trac Riders Snowmobile Club worked tirelessly with the U.S. Forest Service to get this structure re-built. Last Saturday, I joined the club celebrating the completion of the new shelter. 
￼
I was happy to work with the U.S. Forest Service to get the new warming shelter project back on track after it been stalled earlier this year. I’m thrilled this awesome shelter will now be ready for the 2018 winter recreation season!

Talking about the economy, future of health care at Southwest Washington human resources conference
￼

It was an honor to join Southwest Washington Society for Human Resource Management for their conference in Vancouver last week and talk about our economy, and the future of immigration and health care, among other topics. And thank you for helping folks in Southwest Washington get, and keep, great jobs! 


Southwest Washington fishermen sound off on sea lion predation

I've been asking folks in Southwest Washington to tell me what fishing means to them and the importance of preserving our fish and tackling the overpopulation of sea lions in the Columbia River. 

My bipartisan bill to lethally remove the most problematic sea lions passed the U.S. House this summer; now we're working hard to get it through the Senate so we can save our native salmon and steelhead runs. 

Here are a few of the thousands of responses I've received on what fishing means to folks here:

Christine from Vancouver:
“I have personally witnessed [the increased sea lion predation] over the past 30 years fishing extensively on the Columbia River. They are more and more brazen. I have had them grab my net next to my boat for a fish before it could be hoisted into my boat.”

Daniel from Vancouver:
“I fish in the Columbia River frequently. I am tired of seeing ocean mammals in a freshwater river, eating the bellies out of salmon, steelhead and sturgeon. 20 years ago you never saw sea lions in the river. Now you see them all the time.”

George from Cathlamet:
“I started commercial fishing at the age of 12 and I’m now 75. It makes me sad to see the decline in fish runs.”

Dean from Ridgefield:
“Worked my whole life to able to fish in my retirement. Now I need help to have a chance to fish. Thank you!”

Bob from Brush Prairie:
“I'd like to think that there might still be salmon and steelhead to fish for when my great-grandchildren try fishing for bigger fish than the trout we now target."" 

Gary from Washougal:
Wants to be able ""to take my grandchildren fishing and catching.” 

Donald from Vancouver: 
""Been fishing on Columbia. Only reeled in half a salmon -- a sea lion was fighting for, and ate, the other half.""

Meeting with Southwest Washington residents
￼
One of the best parts of my job is being able to help folks in Southwest Washington navigate federal bureaucracy. I was pleased to help Mr. Dierenfeld obtain his presidential service award for his time in the White House, and it was my honor to catch up with him at my Vancouver office last week.

￼
Thank you, Save the Children Network, for taking the time to personally highlight the importance of high-quality early learning.

Lindsey – I wanted to let you know about Medicare open enrollment!

If you’re currently on Medicare and you’re happy with your Medicare coverage, don’t worry – you don’t have to do anything. Open enrollment gives you the chance to make changes or to sign up for coverage in 2019. You may be able to improve your coverage or find a more affordable plan.

Please click here to visit the Medicare Plan Finder to review and compare Medicare plans.

￼

Medicare open enrollment lasts until December 7th, 2018. Here are some other resources that may be able to help you during this time: 

• Medicare and You 2019 Handbook (PDF): This is the federal government’s official handbook for seniors on Medicare. This guide may be able to help you answer many basic questions. You can also order a free hard copy here.

• HICAP Services of Northern California: The Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program, or HICAP, helps local seniors navigate a number of Medicare issues. It is part of the California Department of Aging, a state agency that is partially supported by the federal government. This is a free, public service available to help area seniors with unbiased information.

• Report Medicare fraud: Be careful – criminals have been known to target seniors during this time! Medicare will never ask you to give your personal information to anyone that comes to your home uninvited. If you think you may be a victim of fraud or identity theft, call 1-800-MEDICARE (4227) or click here to learn more.

As a doctor, I’ve cared for many seniors who depend on Medicare. Our parents and grandparents have paid into Medicare and Social Security their entire lives, and we should honor the promise we’ve made to them. The last thing we should do is cut Social Security or Medicare to pay for an enormous tax giveaway to billionaires, as some politicians in Washington have suggested.

Congress should be where we serve you, and put people’s needs ahead of special interests. Please always feel free to contact my office to ask a question or to share your views.

Be well,
￼
Ami Bera, M.D.
Member of Congress

P.S. Your thoughtful suggestions always help my office do a better job of serving you. 

What did you think about this email update? 
￼ I liked it. Thank you! 
 ￼Sorry, I thought it could have been better.
 
Other: Not sure / I have a suggestion.

Listening to you is my most important job. Thank you for taking a moment to share your thoughts.

Congressman Smith's E-news: November 3, 2018  
￼  Many thanks to the students, faculty, and staff of Kimball High School for their hospitality and engaging conversation.  
Stopping Fraudulent Phone Calls 
We’ve all been there. Our families sit down for a nice, relaxing dinner and just as we begin to eat, the phone rings. But who could it be? It’s fairly late in the evening and mostly anyone who would call at such an hour is already gathered together.   Not wanting to miss an important call from a friend in need, we take the bait and answer the phone. Immediately, we find ourselves in the middle of a sales pitch for the latest and greatest home security system or a mortgage refinancing product which promises to have us debt free in a matter of months.   It’s obviously a recording, but what to do now? Do we wait for it to end, at which point we can select an option indicating we wish to be removed from their calling list, which rarely works, or simply hang up only to be called back shortly thereafter? In my case, I sometimes receive as many as five unwanted calls in a day, despite having registered my number with the Do Not Call Registry (1-888-382-1222.)  These calls are illegal. In some cases, they’ve gone as far as to imitate the Social Security Administration in an attempt to steal retirement benefits which prompted its inspector general to issue a public warning to would-be victims. According to the report, criminals are using “spoofing” technology to make the Social Security Administration’s 1-800 number display on caller IDs when they call. If you or your loved ones happen to receive one of these fraudulent calls, please note the following.  The Social Security Administration will never threaten your benefits. Callers have reportedly offered to increase benefits or push through approvals if their victims would only provide personal information such as Social Security Numbers and bank account information. If you receive a suspicious call, you may report it to the Social Security Administration’s Office of the Inspector General at 1-800-269-0271.  If you’re concerned a genuine problem exists after receiving a call requesting your personal information, hang up and call the government agency, bank, or credit card company in question directly at their public number. This puts you in control by ensuring you’re on the phone with the right people.   In 2010, I supported a bill which was signed into law to make call spoofing illegal and empower U.S. law enforcement and consumer protection authorities to put an end to them. To further strengthen these laws, I voted last year with the vast majority of my House colleagues to ensure this prohibition extends to spoofed calls coming from international locations.  Unfortunately, stopping these criminals is challenging. The technology they employ is constantly evolving and requires new approaches by law enforcement officials. As we continue to grapple with this problem, I remain committed to considering new and innovative measures aimed at bringing an end to fraudulent and unwanted calls.  
Senior Service Fairs 
My offices will host Senior Service Fairs in Scottsbluff on Wednesday, November 14 and in Grand Island on Thursday, November 15 to coincide with Medicare Open Enrollment.

Friend-
October marked the beginning of Fiscal Year 2019 where, for the first time in a decade, our military started the year with on-time, reliable funding. Restoring years of decaying military readiness so our service members can complete their mission and come home safe has been a top priority of mine. From funding the military, to fighting back against the opioid crisis, to restoring funds for the Chesapeake Bay Program, to bringing our economy back to life, I’m proud of how I have worked to advance critical First District priorities.
Throughout the district work period this month, I traveled across every county in the district helping constituents with casework issues, visiting businesses, and holding constituent forums to discuss the pressing policy areas facing our nation.
See where I have stopped across the First District this month below:

￼

I spoke at the 100th Anniversary of Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren.

Everytime I attend an honor flight send off, I’m reminded of how much our nation’s veterans have sacrificed for us. 
￼

I hosted two Career & Technical Education symposiums, one in Hanover and the other in Stafford, to bring schools and businesses together to help our students cultivate the skills needed in today’s workforce. 

￼
I stopped by Greencore's operations here in Virignia to hear how regulatory relief has impacted their business.

Dear Friend,
We are blessed to live in a country with a unique form of government, one that checks itself and spreads power among many different people and branches of government. While our founding fathers had many clever ideas to balance the power in government, the most revolutionary idea our founding fathers had was a government “of, by, and for the people,” placing the ultimate power in the hands of citizens, not tyrants or kings. At the heart of this power is our ability to freely elect our leaders in the ballot box and decide the future of the country. On Election Day you may have many candidates to choose from, but this Tuesday you have one easy choice to make: whether or not your voice will be heard...KEEP READING HERE 


WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH

￼
I was honored to help Jefferson County celebrate it's 200th anniversary at the new Jefferson County History Museum in Festus. Two hundred years of established history is an impressive accomplishment - something that entire countries fail to reach! I presented the Bicentennial Committee with a copy of my remarks in the U.S. House of Representatives recognizing this momentous occasion forever in the Congressional Record. 

￼

Speaking of Jefferson County's Bicentennial, check out this incredible corn maze by Pierce Century Farm in Hillsboro! If you think it looks big now, just wait until you see this video.

￼
The youth portion of deer season started last week - check out this 12-point buck Sela from Crawford County brought down! I hope there's still some bucks left for the rest of us! 
￼
I had a great time speaking with Gideon School District students and answering their questions about how our government works. Thanks for having me, Bulldogs!
￼
I swung by the Ozarks Regional Library in Ironton and donated boxes of books from the Library of Congress. Be on the lookout for new selections at their branches in Ironton, Fredericktown, Viburnum, and Annapolis!
￼
What issues do you want Congress to tackle the most? I want to hear what is the most important to you.

A Dark Consensus About Screens and Kids Begins to Emerge in Silicon Valley
“I am convinced the devil lives in our phones.”
By Nellie Bowles, The New York Times

SAN FRANCISCO  The people who are closest to a thing are often the most wary of it. Technologists know how phones really work, and many have decided they don’t want their own children anywhere near them.

A wariness that has been slowly brewing is turning into a regionwide consensus: The benefits of screens as a learning tool are overblown, and the risks for addiction and stunting development seem high. The debate in Silicon Valley now is about how much exposure to phones is O.K.

“Doing no screen time is almost easier than doing a little,” said Kristin Stecher, a former social computing researcher married to a Facebook engineer. “If my kids do get it at all, they just want it more.”

Ms. Stecher, 37, and her husband, Rushabh Doshi, researched screen time and came to a simple conclusion: they wanted almost none of it in their house. Their daughters, ages 5 and 3, have no screen time “budget,” no regular hours they are allowed to be on screens. The only time a screen can be used is during the travel portion of a long car ride (the four-hour drive to Tahoe counts) or during a plane trip.

Weather 2050

America is warming fast.
See how your city’s weather will be different in just one generation.
By Umair Irfan, Eliza Barclay and Kavya Sukumar, Vox
Our world is getting warmer. This we know.

Just look at Los Angeles, which experienced all-time record heat in July, topping out at 118 degrees Fahrenheit. Dozens of other heat records across the United States were smashed this summer alone.

But how much will temperatures in US cities change by 2050? By then, scientists say average global warming since preindustrial levels could be about twice what it is in 2018  and much more obvious and disruptive. It’s a world you’ll (probably) be living in. And it’s the one we’re definitely handing off to the next generation.

To answer this question, we looked at the average summer high and winter low temperatures in 1,000 cities in the continental US, comparing recorded and modeled temperatures from 1986 to 2015 to projections for 2036 to 2065. This offers us the best possible estimate on how much winters and summers will shift from 2000 to 2050. (More on our methodology here.)

In 1958, a synagogue was bombed. An editor's response won a Pulitzer  and his words ring eerily true today
By Roy Peter Clark, Poynter
On Oct. 14, 1958, racial terrorists bombed Atlanta’s largest Jewish synagogue. The next day, Ralph McGill, editor of The Atlanta Constitution, fired off an editorial that won him a Pulitzer Prize and holds up a mirror for our own times.

The mass murders at the synagogue in Pittsburgh have forced us once again to find the words to express our deep sorrow and outrage. “There are no words” is a refrain, repeated by survivors, family members and citizens devastated by an act of hatred and intolerance.

There is another refrain in another song on the same playlist: “Words matter.” That phrase is used frequently in reference to President Donald Trump and what are often called his “incendiary” tweets and speeches, his demonizing of political enemies and his scapegoating of certain ethnic groups, especially immigrants. The argument goes that while the president did not pull the trigger, his language and political tactics have created a culture in which such acts could take place.

 Fighting the Scourge of Opioid Addiction



Last week, a bill I introduced to help combat the ongoing opioid crisis in this country, the Substance Abuse Prevention Act, was signed into law by President Trump.
This bill is a necessary step in fighting the epidemic of opioid abuse that continues to cut short tens of thousands of lives across the nation.
Texas isn't immune to this problem. Deaths from drug overdoses in Texas more than doubled last year, from 1,087 to 2,979. More than 500 of these lives were lost to opioid abuse.
￼
click to here to view photos from the roundtable
To get a better idea of how Texas communities will benefit from this law, I hosted a roundtable in Houston on Monday with local non-profits, law enforcement, and judges who work directly with those struggling with opioid and substance use disorders – helping Houston residents get clean and stay clean.
It is my hope that this bill will begin to stem the flow of opioids and illicit drugs into our communities, and I'm proud to see what Texans are already doing to fight back against this terrible problem.

THE SCALISE CAPITOL REPORT
This week, I enjoyed meeting with constituents and traveling around southeast Louisiana to hear first-hand the issues on the minds of hard-working families and small businesses. I always appreciate this time to meet face-to-face and talk about issues important to our state and our country.    Speaking to our Future Leaders Junior Achievement of Greater New Orleans designated the Walter E. Blessey Jr. Free Enterprise Center of Learning on Tuesday, and it was a treat to speak with some of the local students who participate in Junior Achievement activities. Junior Achievement has long been a positive resource in our community to prepare students for the future, and I was honored to speak at this event. After spending time with some of these future leaders, it is clear to me that Louisiana’s future looks bright!  
￼
I spoke with local students on how Junior Achievement is helping them have a brighter future. 
Meeting with Young Business Professionals Earlier this week I also met with members of GNO, Inc.'s ""Next Gen Council"" on issues important to the New Orleans region, including tax reform, trade policy, flood insurance, and coastal restoration.   We discussed challenges facing young professionals in Louisiana and new opportunities we are now seeing thanks to the work we’ve done to get this economy booming again. I have long been passionate about creating better career opportunities for young people so the next generation of leaders can stay here at home when they graduate, and we can attract more young people to south Louisiana.   I will continue working to pass legislation, like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that will open more doors to success for hard-working families and small businesses in our state so we can improve the lives of all Louisianans. I will also keep fighting for legislation that helps us restore our coast and strengthen flood protection so we can have a stronger and more prosperous region.

￼
I joined a panel conversation with young professionals in the New Orleans region to discuss issues important to their future.
 
It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more information please visit my website, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook pages.   God Bless,

OPIOID CONFERENCE ROUND-UP I hosted an opioid conference to celebrate the signing of the federal opioid legislation, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6).  The conference concluded a series of roundtables that have taken place since 2016 and briefed the community on the new resources made available to them through the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act.
When we started hosting opioid roundtables in 2016, Oklahoma’s communities, particularly right here in Claremore, stepped up to the plate. At our first roundtable in Claremore, community leaders and representatives brought problems and ideas to the table.  Two years later, I am proud to say that together, we have found solutions at the federal level that will give our communities the resources they need to combat the crisis next door.
Click HERE to watch the opioid conference in its entirety.  
￼
What they’re saying FOX 23: “For two years, Congressman Markwayne Mullin has hosted roundtable meetings about the [opioid] epidemic.  From the roundtable to the Oval Office, Mullin helped form the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed by the president last week.”  
￼
 NEWS ON 6: “For two years we didn’t waste your time. For two years, we have a whole list of accomplishments that we were able to accomplish because you were persistent in being in these meetings and staying involved,” said Mullin.  
￼
RECOGNIZED FOR MANUFACTURING LEGISLATIVE EXCELLENCE It is an honor to be named a Champion of Manufacturing by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). Oklahoma’s manufacturing companies employ over 130,000 individuals who help produce over $17 billion in output annually from manufacturing.  Alongside our efforts in Congress, employment in Oklahoma’s manufacturing industry has increased 3.3% percent since President Trump took office.  I am committed to continuing my work in Congress and with President Trump to allow manufacturers to create more jobs and stimulate local economies in Oklahoma.
This award is based on votes taken in the 115th Congress on issues that are critical to manufacturing in the United States. Key votes included in the Voting Record are selected by small, medium and large manufacturing executives who serve on the NAM’s Key Vote Advisory Committee. Additional information on the NAM Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence can be found HERE. 
THIS WEEK IN OKLAHOMA I enjoyed visiting the Rogers County Sheriff’s office and touring their new building. Rogers County is in good hands with Sheriff Scott Walton in charge. Thank you to our law enforcement officers for all they do to protect our communities.  
￼
The opioid epidemic is impacting our fathers, our mothers, and our kids. I was proud to take part in the ribbon cutting at Groups: recover together. Claremore has stepped up to the plate to take care of their own and the members of this community ought to be commended for that.  
￼
It was great to have the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, in Oklahoma this week! We had a productive discussion at a roundtable luncheon with the Oklahoma delegation about issues impacting Oklahoma’s farmers and ranchers.  
￼
Nice to visit with David Stewart of MidAmerica who gave me an update on how MidAmerica is growing in Pryor. Southern Business & Development Magazine selected MidAmerica as one of the Top 10 Super Sites Across the South.  
￼

I had the chance to visit with the crew on the shop floor at HE&M Saw in Pryor. They have over 200 employees in more than 250,000 square feet of space where they manufacture over 70 different models of production band saws for the metalworking industry. 
￼
It was great to tour the new Shawnee Tribe Cultural Center in Miami! Thank you to Shawnee Tribal Chief Sparkman, 2nd Chief Barnes, and Miami Tribal Chief Lankford for showing me around. 

￼

Thank you to the Oklahoma State Health Department and Integris Health for taking the time to meet with me to discuss the importance of men's health in Oklahoma. 

￼
BACK IN D.C. I’m sorry to have missed Wade and Linda Exendine while they were in D.C!

THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING!
Dear Lindsey,
Don't take my word for it. Here's what the Associated Press had to say:
￼
	•	""added a stellar 250,000 jobs last month""
	•	""raised average pay by the most in nearly a decade""
	•	""increased the proportion of Americans with jobs to its highest level since January 2009""
	•	""Consumers are the most confident they have been in 18 years""
This is all great news, and it just goes to show what happens when we start getting the government out of the way: lowering taxes, cutting red tape and incentivizing small business growth. That's why we just voted last month to permanently lock in the individual tax cuts like doubling the standard deduction and child tax credit.
There is a lot more work to do - like getting out of control federal spending back under control - but the bills we've passed have put us on a great track!

Dear Lindsey, 
This is a friendly reminder that all applications for Military Academy Nominations are due before the deadline on Friday, November 30, 2018. 
As your congressman, it is my honor to be able to nominate 10 outstanding high school seniors from the 15th District of Texas for placement at our nation’s service academies. The nomination process is extremely selective and based on many factors including proven leadership, community service, grade point average, and test scores. Please note that the honor of attending a service academy comes with the obligation and commitment to serve in the military for a minimum of five years upon graduation. 
The four service academies that accept Congressional nominations are: the US Air Force Academy, the US Naval Academy, the US Military Academy at West Point, and the US Merchant Marine Academy. The U.S. Coast Guard Academy does not accept Congressional nominations. However, I invite you to contact the Academy’s Admission Hotline at 800-883-8724 if you are interested. 
If you would like to be considered for this great distinction, please download the Service Academy Nomination Application Packet, or use this link and fill out the information requested. Remember, you must apply directly to the service academy as well as to my office for a Congressional nomination. Please be advised that a congressional nomination is only part of the overall application process for a service academy. Prospective students must still communicate with appropriate service academy liaisons – a congressional nomination accompanies this procedure.
If you have any questions about applying to the four service academies, please do not hesitate to call Patrick Roberts in our Edinburg office at (956) 682-0141.   


Sincerely,

￼

Congressional Report

Dear Friends, 
This week, I attended various meetings and events with different individuals and organizations, including the Mission Reach Press Conference in San Antonio, Operation Stonegarden Grant Announcements for McMullen and Webb counties and federal funding announcements for Texas A&M International University, the Laredo International Airport, and the Mitchell Lake Ecosystem Restoration.
In the district, my staff attended several meetings and events, including the Big Lots Ribbon Cutting Ceremony in Converse, Texas. 
Lastly, I have included a video from smokefree.gov that talks about steps you can take to quit smoking in honor of November being National Lung Cancer Awareness Month.  As always, please contact one of my offices if you need assistance with any federal agency.  


Rep. Cuellar Announces Operation Stonegarden Funding for Webb County
 
￼

On Thursday, October 25, I announced the awarding of $3.6 million in federal funds to Webb County from the Department of Homeland Security through an Operation Stonegarden Grant. These funds will be used to secure the border, reimburse Webb County local law enforcement for their resources, and enhance cooperation among different law enforcement agencies in the area. Pictured from left are Assistant Chief JJ Rendon, Webb County Comissioner Precint 3 John Galo, Assistant Police Chief Manuel Maciel, Webb County Sheriff Martin Cuellar, Assistant Chief Wayo Ruiz and Congressman Henry Cuellar. 


Rep. Cuellar Announces Funding for TAMIU 
￼

On Friday, October 26, I announced the awarding of $2.7 million in federal funding to Texas A&M International University (TAMIU). The funds will be delegated to several programs including ones which promote opportunities for Hispanic students, advance education for nurses specializing in sexual trauma, increase the pool of Hispanic science teachers, and more. The funds will ensure TAMIU can better address the medical and educational needs of Webb County. 


Rep. Cuellar Announces Funding for Mitchell Lake Ecosystem Restoration 
￼

On Friday, October 26, I announced $1.5 million in federal funding to begin the process of studying and restoring Mitchell Lake’s ecosystem and the surrounding habitats. Working to secure this funding on the Appropriations Committee for the last few years, I recognized not only the importance of protecting the environment around the lake for wildlife, but also the potential economic benefit of increased tourism and the possible health improvements for the community. Pictured from left are SAWS President and CEO Robert Puente, Congressman Henry Cuellar, Congressman Will Hurd, and San Antonio Councilwoman, District 3 Rebecca Viagran.


Rep. Cuellar Speaks at Mission Reach Press Conference
￼

On Monday, October 29, I spoke about the Mission Reach Project, a project meant to prevent future flooding along the San Antonio River. Led by the United States Army Corp of Engineers, this project will mitigate flooding along the river banks, enhance river quality, and increase the sustainability of the natural habitat surrounding this wonderful resource. In Fiscal Year 2019, I secured $25 million for this project which will reimburse the costs Bexar County has carried in the development of this project. 


Rep. Cuellar Announces McMullen County Operation Stonegarden Grant
￼

On Monday, October 29, I announced $150,000 through Operation Stonegarden for McMullen County. These funds will cover agency operation costs and will reimburse overtime pay and equipment expenses. Pictured from left are Congressman Henry Cuellar, McMullen County Sheriff Emmett Shelton and McMullen County Judge James Teal.


Announcing Funding for the Laredo International Airport 
￼

On Tuesday, October 30, the City of Laredo and I announced more than $7.5 million to the Laredo International Airport to make necessary infrastructure improvements that will bring in trade while increasing safety and efficiency of the airport. Pictured from left are Congressman Henry Cuellar, Laredo Mayor Pete Saenz, City Manager Horacio de Leon Jr., Deputy City Manager Cynthia Collazo, Assistant Airport Director of Transportation Mario Maldonando and Airport Director Alejandro Labrada.


Big Lots Ribbon Cutting Ceremony 
￼

On Friday, October 26, my Outreach Coordinator for Atascosa, Bexar, McMullen and Wilson counties Gilbert Lafuente attended the Big Lots Ribbon cutting ceremony in Converse, Texas. Pictured from left to right are Sgt. Police Chief Hubert Locklear, Fidel Villegas, Congressman Henry Cuellar and Fire Chief Luis Valdez. 


Staff Spotlight: District Press Secretary Leslie Martinez
￼

Meet our District Press Secretary Leslie D. Martinez. Leslie oversees all press operations in the District including developing effective communications strategies, preparing and translating press materials, and building relationships with district media organizations. In her spare time, Leslie enjoys reading, writing and learning foreign languages.  


Intern Spotlight: Mia DeLlano
￼

Meet our intern Mia De Llano. She is a recent graduate from Texas A&M University College Station where she received a degree in English with a Minor in Communications. She is currently interning in our Laredo office. To learn more about Mia and our other interns, please click here.


SmokeFree.gov: Every Try Counts 
￼

This video from smokefree.gov talks about small steps you can take to quit smoking. Tobacco use remains the single largest preventable cause of death and disease in the United States, with a large number of deaths attributed to secondhand smoke (cdc.gov).  


 
 

Sincerely,
￼
Henry Cuellar

Weekly Review




October 29

War on Waste: Did you see the ad in The Wall Street Journal today?
On two full pages in the middle of the first section, the government transparency group Open The Books is asking the president to declare a “War on Waste.”
Seems like a good idea to me!
We tried to do that back when I was governor in all of the budget hearings that we held as a way of highlighting the waste that we saw in Columbia, and doing that same thing at the Executive Branch level in Washington makes a lot of sense.
But it can’t be a one-time item in a meeting.
It will require beating the drum daily to make headway here.... Click here to read more.

Current Trade Policy: Today, I found myself at the Gaillard Auditorium listening to Wilbur Ross speak about trade policy at the SC Trade Conference.
As has consistently been the case, I like part of what they’re trying to get at but very much disagree with the means by which they are doing so.
It’s heavy-handed, and I think will prove counterproductive. This is especially the case in a state as reliant on trade and foreign investment as South Carolina. It needs to once again be remembered that our state economy is the third-most dependent on trade out of all the 50 states and the most reliant state in the continental United States on foreign direct investment. Foreign direct investment in layman’s terms means the Bosch, Volvo, or BMW plant. These investments on a per-person basis by foreign companies are number one in the US.
I believe I can speak with some level of authority on this, given the ways in which I was before our country was cool on the issue of China and trade. If you remember it now, I was among the handful of Republican ‘nos’ that voted against China’s ascension to the WTO. This was during my first term in Congress in 2000 and, as a Republican, a fairly lonely stand to take. But I think it was the right one, given what China was even telegraphing back then with regard to their adherence to open trade practices and intellectual property rights. Click here to read more.

$1,280 Coffee Mugs? Did you see the story from USA Today shared over the past week about the Air Force buying mugs at $1,280 a piece?
In fairness, these are not your everyday mugs but mugs to keep liquids warm aboard air refueling tankers. But it is so over the top that Senator Grassley sent a note to the Air Force outlining what he believed to be outrageously wasteful on this front, given the total price-tag of $326,785 for these mugs since 2016 alone.
His point, and one that I would agree with, is about relative choices in the way that we spend federal dollars. The mugs may be superior to your standard coffee cup…and maybe even slightly superior to a YETI cup…but for $326,785, you could pay the annual wages of almost TEN new pilots in the air force who start out earning $35,668 a year. Would that expenditure have more bang for the buck in protecting our country? I’d say yes - and Secretary of the Air Force, Heather Wilson, agrees, saying the practice “is simply irresponsible.” Click here to read more.

SC-01 Candidates on Tri-County Waterfront Park: I don’t know if you caught this week's edition of The Daniel Island News, but in the event you didn’t, I've included a question posed by the paper to the candidates running for the district I now represent. I think it’s an important one and accordingly, I would ask you look at their responses immediately below… and my thinking on their responses a bit further below.

The question posed to both candidates: ""Earlier this year, Congressman Mark Sanford proposed a 400-plus acre park for Daniel Island's Southern tip, bordering the Wando River. Are you in favor of this ""Central Park"" of Charleston, and if so, how do you believe it should be funded?""

Katie Arrington's response: ""No. I am opposed to creating a regional park on Daniel Island because Daniel Island's neighborhoods are already congested by traffic, and I am not confident that the proposed water taxi route would be adequate to meet the demand of park visitors from the region. The park is a good idea in concept, but not if it would disrupt the Daniel Island community. Any further development on the southern tip of Daniel Island should require a direct vote of the community.""

Joe Cunningham's response: ""Yes, Charleston has developed rapidly in recent years and I believe creating a green space for the community to enjoy our beautiful wildlife and spend time outdoors is a worthwhile investment. Congressman Sanford has said that he plans on establishing a nonprofit to handle funding for the project and I think that is the best strategy in terms of paying for the park.""

Here’s my thinking on what they said… I think my mother was right. She always used to stress the notion of balance in all things. I suspect your mother, or grandmother, may have said the same. Click here to read more.

November 2

Reasserting the Role of Congress:  Under the category of further catching up from the flurry of activity that occurred before Congress closed down for the midterm elections, let me highlight a letter I signed onto led by Representative Barbara Lee to the president regarding US troops in Syria. It’s a bipartisan letter that once again reemphasizes what the Constitution is so clear on… that only the Congress can declare war. 

Republican and Democratic presidents alike have run with the power to do so since Congress began running from its authority since about the time of the Vietnam War. 

This letter is simply an appeal for the President to seek Congressional approval before committing any additional troops to combat in Syria. What’s happened there is atrocious and we’re all rightfully aghast at the tactics and atrocities committed by the Assad regime. 

However, despite public outrage over how the Syrian civil war has been conducted, the US military should not get involved in hostilities there without the simple authorization of Congress. In reality, US troops have already been involved in fighting in Syria for several years without specific authorization from Congress, but that does not mean that this practice should continue.

ECONOMY ADDS 250,000 JOBS IN OCTOBER
￼
This is great news! Last month, the economy added 250,000 jobs for hardworking Americans – that’s more than 2.1 million jobs created since the historic tax cuts took effect.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered taxes for middle class families and small businesses, giving Hoosiers a better chance to achieve the American Dream.
With the nation’s unemployment rate down to just 3.7 percent, it’s clear our economy is stronger than it’s been in a long time. And wages are rising faster than they have in almost a decade.
￼
Now it's time to continue building on our economic momentum so more workers can find good jobs and families can thrive.
That’s why I’m focused on helping Main Street businesses and hardworking Hoosiers succeed. I’ve fought to get burdensome regulations and Washington bureaucrats out of the way of growing businesses. I’ve worked to bring balance to our trade policies so we can go after bad actors like China while protecting manufacturers and farmers here at home. And I’m working to strengthen our Hoosier workforce so workers have the skills and opportunities they need in the 21st century economy.
￼
I also recently voted to make the middle class and small business tax cuts permanent and give families new tools to save for the future. That means bigger paychecks, more jobs, and a stronger economy.
Because of tax cuts, regulatory reforms, and other commonsense solutions, America’s economy is booming. We need to keep that momentum going.
I’m committed to working together to build a brighter, more prosperous future for hardworking Hoosiers.
As always, it is a privilege to represent 2nd District Hoosiers in Congress.

Advocating for you
     ￼
Davis meets with constituents in Washington, DC. 
My number one priority in Congress is providing outstanding constituent service to the people of the 13th district and it is something I work at every single day.   If you can't get an answer from a federal agency in a timely fashion, or if you feel you have been treated unfairly, my office can help resolve a problem or get you the information you need. While we cannot guarantee you a favorable outcome, we do our best to help you receive a fair and timely response to your issue.  So far this Congress, has helped 1,091 constituents navigate the federal bureaucracy through casework. And we are currently assisting 249 more constituents who are having issues with federal agencies.   From the Social Security Administration to the VA, we work every day to make Washington for Illinois' 13th district.   
Hearing your concerns
Hearing from my constituents helps me better serve my district.   I have held 34 open office hours in every single county in my district. These open office hours, which are free and open to the public, allow me to sit down with individuals or small groups to work out issues. Sometimes it's to hear about a policy they may not agree on or other times they are asking for help when dealing with a federal agency.  
 
     ￼
Davis listens to constituents' policy concerns at Open Office Hours. 
If you are unable to attend these events, my staff in the 6 district offices or in Washington D.C. are always willing to listen to your concerns and provide assistance.   On average, my office responds to 3,000 letters and emails on issues that are important to constituents. Each week, whether I am in DC or traveling the district, I have about 65 meetings with constituents, covering a variety of issues.   I’ll continue to be one of the most accessible members of Congress by continuing to hold these events and others, take the tough questions from media, and be responsive to every constituent. It’s a responsibility I take very seriously.
Working for you in Washington
 
     ￼
I have been working hard for the constituents of the 13th district in Washington and we are delivering results. The House has passed 1,011 bills this Congress and over 200 have been signed into law.   Almost all of the of the bills I have introduced are a result of hearing about an issue from a constituent.   Law enforcement officers in Normal came to me with concerns about individuals who were ""pharmacy shopping"" for opioids in the community, which is contributing to the opioid epidemic. With their input, I introduced a bill, the Opioid Prescription Verification Act, to help prevent bad actors from obtaining opioids.  When part of my district experienced severe flooding in 2015 and did not receive federal disaster assistance, I worked with FEMA officials to change the funding formula. Last month, President Trump signed my bill to make this change so now rural communities will be treated fairly when disaster strikes.   Serving the constituents of the 13th district is an honor and I will continue to work every day to make Washington work for them.

11/3/18 9:13,WOW!,"News from Congressman Brian Mast
￼ 
THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING!
Lindsey - 
Don't take my word for it. Here's what the Associated Press had to say: 
￼ 
	•	""added a stellar 250,000 jobs last month""
	•	""raised average pay by the most in nearly a decade""
	•	""increased the proportion of Americans with jobs to its highest level since January 2009""
	•	""Consumers are the most confident they have been in 18 years""
This is all great news, and it just goes to show what happens when we start getting the government out of the way: lowering taxes, cutting red tape and incentivizing small business growth. That's why we just voted last month to permanently lock in the individual tax cuts like doubling the standard deduction and child tax credit. 
There is a lot more work to do - like getting out of control federal spending back under control - but the bills we've passed have put us on a great track!

Stronger than hate



Dear Friend: 
Welcome to your weekly update. As always, you can learn more about these and other legislative issue at my website: upton.house.gov. 
Stronger than hate
Last weekend, the people of Pittsburgh suffered a terrible tragedy at the Tree of Life Synagogue were eleven innocent lives that were engaged in a time of prayer and reflection where taken in the name of hate and anti-Semitism. To target a religious community in any way disregards our values as Americans and I wholeheartedly condemn any act of violence. 
I pray for the victims, their loved ones, and their community as they work to rebuild after suffering such a loss. I remain committed to ensuring all Americans have the freedom to practice their religion peacefully and without fear.  
Strengthening Southwest Michigan’s economy
One of my top priorities is promoting job creation and economic growth here at home in Southwest Michigan. 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 250,000 jobs were created in October and U.S. workers are seeing their highest wage growth since 2008 – further proof of the strong state of our economy.
I have worked to grow our economy by rolling back burdensome regulations on small businesses, keeping our Great Lakes harbors open and operational, and enacting pro-growth tax reform.
Around the district
It’s been another busy and fun week here at home meeting with constituents. I welcomed back our veterans from another Talons Out Honor Flight in Kalamazoo, got a first-hand look at Schuler Farm’s modern dairy operation, and enjoyed some travel talk at a tourism roundtable with local and state stakeholders. 
I also stopped by the Saugatuck Center for the Arts, toured the brand new Exchange Building in downtown Kalamazoo, and spoke with students at Providence Christian School.
You can always stay up-to-date with what I’m up to back home by following my Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter pages.
Have a great weekend and God bless,

 District Visit
              ￼
With Congress out of session until after the election, most of my time has been spent visiting with folks across the district. This week consisted of a very productive visit to Dumas, where I held an opioid roundtable event and attended a ribbon cutting for the grand re-opening of my Dumas office. I held a similar roundtable event in Jonesboro back in August and I hope to keep this important conversation going by hosting more of these meetings across the 1st District. 

FAQ (What folks have been calling/texting my office about this week)
Q: I keep hearing that there is a caravan of 3,000 migrants headed for the US border, what is being done to stop them?  A: I have long been a supporter of funding a wall along our southern border. True immigration reform can not begin until we have secured our borders, if we don't we will continue to face these problems down the line. Last week, Rep. McCarthy introduced a border funding bill that I plan on supporting when it comes to the Floor for a vote. I actually wrote a newsletter last week on this very topic, you can click here if you'd like to read more about my views on this issue.

More Positive Economic News for West Virginia 
American workers have benefited from the biggest leap in pay since 2009 as job gains are at an all-time high, and the unemployment rate is held at a 48-year low. We can expect this strong economic growth to carry over into 2019. Although there is still more to be done, this is great news for West Virginia.   Click here to read more  

McKinley Discusses Workforce Needs With Sheet Metal Apprentices
This week we had the privilege of speaking to apprentices from the Sheet Metal Workers Local 33 in Vienna. They are a great program that trains young people for in-demand skills. West Virginia deserves a well-trained workforce to help build our future, and apprenticeships are critical to our success. We need to continue to promote apprenticeships and the trades as a smart career path.

ICYMI: McKinley Commends Bipartisan Opioid Bill
Last week President Trump signed a bill into effect that will provide relief in the battle against opioids in West Virginia. H.R. 6 builds on previous efforts to fight the opioid epidemic that have gone through the House over the past two years. This bill will provide triple funding for West Virginia to fight opioids. Our biggest goal is to make sure the number of overdose deaths start to decline, and we believe this bill will be a big help in accomplishing that throughout our state.   Click here to read more

Open Enrollment Begins 
Dear Friends:   
Health insurance can protect you from astronomical costs when a serious accident or illness occurs.  Did you know that the average cost for a three-day hospital stay is $30,000?  Or that a broken leg can cost up to $7,500?  Health insurance helps protect you from those types of unexpected health care costs.  Health insurance can also help cover different medical supplies and medications. 
November 1st marked the start of the 2019 health insurance open enrollment period. 
From now until December 15, 2018, you can purchase a plan or renew your coverage through HealthCare.gov for the upcoming year. The open enrollment period is shorter than it has been previously, so be sure to sign up by the deadline.   
If you sign up by December 15th, you can get coverage that starts on January 1, 2019.
More than 500,000 North Carolinians took advantage of this opportunity last year, and many of them received financial help to make their premiums affordable.  During last year’s enrollment period, 9-in-10 North Carolinians who applied qualified for financial help – for most people, that meant they could find insurance premiums between $50 and $100 per month.  Paying monthly premiums could save your family tens of thousands of dollars in unexpected health care costs.  
For details about available plans, please visit https://www.healthcare.gov/get-coverage/ or call 1-800-318-2596. 
Here are a few helpful links to get you started: 
	•	Want to get in touch with a broker or navigator who can help you sign up for insurance? You can search for someone in your area here.  
	•	Want to know if a certain health care provider works with your plan? You can check here – but it’s still a good idea to call your provider and confirm before you sign up for a plan. 
	•	Interested in learning more at an in-person event? You can find upcoming events across North Carolina here. 
	•	Visit my website for Open Enrollment frequently asked questions.
Take the time to learn about your options and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact my office.  
Thank you, ￼  G. K. Butterfield U.S. Representative, NC-01

On my weekly ""Capitol Hill Report,"" I spoke with AJ Taylor of KIOW Radio in Forest City and Erin Sonners of the Lake City Graphic-Advocate about the Farm Bill, China and political civility. 
Q&A: Economy is Full Steam Ahead
Q. Do the positive economic benchmarks echo what you're hearing from Iowans? Q. What's the economic forecast for agriculture? 
Quick Links
The relationship between the United States and China has been called the most important bilateral relationship of the 21st century. I couldn’t agree more. It’s also the most complicated. Trade, economic development and technological innovation are just a few of the issues currently putting pressure on relations between our two nations. America must continue showing a strong, united front against China’s egregious efforts to lie, steal and cheat its way to being the world’s economic leader. Otherwise, the United States is sure to fall behind. Read more in my op-ed about China here.  
I wrote a letter to the Departments of State and Homeland Security seeking briefings on potential national security threats relating to the migrant caravan headed toward the southern border. The letter requests background details about the individuals in the caravan, including the criminal histories or gang affiliation of any of the migrants. Information on these groups will help the Senate Judiciary Committee address the needs of vulnerable asylum-seekers who need humanitarian relief, while preventing the entry of caravan members who are national security threats, such as members of transnational criminal organizations. 
For years, Washington talking heads said Americans should just get used to the ‘new normal’ of stagnant growth under former President Obama. They were wrong, and today’s economy proves it. Americans are back to work and wages are rising. Thanks to the Republican agenda, the American economy is booming again. Workers, employers and small business owners are all more optimistic than ever. This holiday season, Americans will have more money in their pockets, more financial security for their families and more hope for their futures. That’s something everyone should be able to celebrate. Read more about Iowa’s economic progress here. 
For more than four years I pressed to declassify two Congressional Notifications indicating that, during the Obama administration, the CIA obtained congressional communications about pending and developing whistleblower complaints. Those two notifications were finally declassified this week. They revealed that the CIA under the Obama administration was reading Congressional staff’s emails about intelligence community whistleblowers. This raises serious policy concerns as well as potential Constitutional separation-of-powers issues that must be discussed publicly. 
I received a letter from Dr. Francis S. Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, in response to an August inquiry I sent seeking more information about a study on the long-term effects of daily alcohol consumption that was reportedly in large part funded by alcohol companies. I appreciate that Dr. Collins addressed my concerns regarding the study with the seriousness the situation warrants. Transparency and accountability are critical in maintaining public trust in the federal government. The questionable activities related to this study were alarming to me and all taxpayers and should have never happened in the first place.

Dear Friend,

I'm pleased to share some highlights of my recent work in Congress and our communities.  I hope you find them informative.  And if you haven't followed me yet on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, be sure to do so today.  See the online version of this newsletter here.

My heart is breaking for the victims of the horrifying shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue.  Violence and bigotry have no place in our society.  I pray for all those touched by this tragedy, and call again for passage of commonsense laws that help end gun violence.‬

This Tuesday, November 6th, Is the General Election: The right to vote is an essential part of making your voice heard by our nation's leaders.  If you're an eligible California voter, be sure to vote this Tuesday, November 6th!  Polls are open from 7 AM to 8 PM.  You can find your polling place at lavote.net/locator, and check your voter registration status at lavote.net/vrstatus.

Este Martes, 6 de Noviembre, Es la Elección General: El derecho de votar es una parte esencial para que los líderes de nuestra nación escuchen su voz.  ¡Si usted es un votante elegible de California, asegúrese de votar este martes, 6 de noviembre!  Las urnas están abiertas de 7 AM a 8 PM.  Puede encontrar su centro electoral en lavote.net/es/locator y verificar el estado de su registro electoral en lavote.net/es/vrstatus.


Read the New Edition of My Student Resource Guide:

If you are a high school or college student looking for help to pay for college, I encourage you to read the 2018-2019 edition of my Student Resource Guide.  The guide includes information about scholarships, internships, fellowships, and websites to help you meet your college expenses.  Please feel free to circulate it!


Championing Our Local Businesses and Workers:

￼
Touring Associated Group's warehouse in Commerce.

I have been busy with visits to a wide and varied array of 40th District businesses!  I joined World Energy in Paramount for its announcement that it will invest $350 million to expand its renewable fuel production facility there, and took part in the grand opening of the rPlanetEarth plastic-recycling factory in Vernon -- two new opportunities for good-paying jobs in our 40th District.  In Commerce, I toured Associated Group and its warehouse of holiday decorations for businesses and hotels, and I toured Celluphone, which provides cell phones and support services to small business retailers and distributors of phones and services.  I also appreciated the chance to meet with local business leaders at events held by the Bellflower and East LA Chambers of Commerce.

Additionally, I have been learning more about the many ways businesses and workers in and around our district can get the assistance they need to excel.  I toured East LA College's ESTEC LA Incubator, which provides women, minorities, veterans, formerly incarcerated persons, and LGBTQIA individuals who want to start their own businesses with personalized business guidance and curriculum from industry experts.  I spoke with Erik Miller, executive director of South LA's PVJOBS, about his organization's work to support at-risk youth and adults by providing them with training activities that help prepare them for careers in the construction industry.  And I toured a Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters training center, which offers high-quality, state-of-the-art training to about 1,700 apprentices per year.


Supporting Our Residents and Celebrating Our Communities:

￼
Meeting with local residents during the Bellflower Joint Service Club Luncheon.

I enjoyed talks with a range of local residents at events throughout the district, including the Bellflower Joint Service Club Luncheon and the East LA Network's Community Resource Fair.  I always enjoy meeting with constituents and letting you know how my office can help you in dealing with federal agencies.  For more information about my office services, visit https://roybal-allard.house.gov/constituentservices/casework or call my Commerce office at (323) 721-8790.

It was a pleasure to present the Downey Symphony Orchestra and Downey Symphonic Society with a copy of my Congressional Record statement honoring their 60th anniversary during a Symphony concert at Downey Theatre.  I am grateful for all the Symphony and Society do to broaden the artistic horizons for the people of Downey and nearby communities.

I was honored to help celebrate the 100th anniversary of the chartering of the Los Angeles Host Lions Club.  During its anniversary event in Commerce, I presented the Club with a copy of my Congressional Record statement saluting the Club's first century of growth and good works.

Vernon’s Halloween Spooktacular was loads of fun!  I loved all the thrills and treats, and the cool maze set up by the Vernon Police Department.  While I was there, the Vernon Police also took me on a tour of their headquarters.


Supporting Our Students and Schools:

￼
At the Maywood Education Fair with Paramount resident and UC Irvine student Brianda Ruiz.

It was great to speak with students and parents at the Maywood Education Fair as they learned about scholarship opportunities and joined in workshops to prepare students for success in higher education.  Many thanks to all the sponsors who make this great annual event a reality.

I was honored to be recognized by the East Los Angeles College (ELAC) Foundation for my support of the foundation’s Washington, DC Gateway Internship program and students.  Programs like the Gateway Internship program help ELAC students get firsthand experience in government, gain a better understanding of the legislative process, and network with other students from across the country.

I loved taking part in the dedication and blessing of St. Pius X-St. Matthias Academy's beautiful stadium and multi-purpose track and field in Downey.  I hope it will be a site of great triumph and joy for students and families in the coming years.  During the ceremony, I presented a Certificate of Congressional Recognition to the school commemorating this happy occasion.


Fighting for the Just and Humane Treatment of Immigrants and Refugees:

I was proud to re-introduce my Child Trafficking Victims Protection and Welfare Act in the House of Representatives, which will ensure that immigrant children are treated with dignity and humanity while in our government’s care.  The bill establishes a number of essential requirements for the care of children in the custody of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), including a climate-appropriate environment, safe and sanitary living conditions, a bed and sufficient linens, adequate and healthy nutrition, potable water, and access to legal services.

The Trump Administration's continued efforts to stoke anti-immigrant hostility have been deeply troubling to me, including the president's call to end the constitutional right to birthright citizenship.  Let's be clear: NO president can rip out parts of the U.S. Constitution that they don't like.  Donald Trump is desperate to distract us from Republicans' plan to rip away your preexisting condition protections, so he is pushing an agenda of fear, division, and hatred.

It was a privilege for me to help honor organizations that assist our immigrant community, including CARECEN-LA (which was marking its 35th anniversary) and COFEM (which was celebrating its work to help more than 1,000 residents apply for naturalization).  I presented Certificates of Congressional Recognition at events for both organizations.

I have joined with several fellow California congressmembers in writing to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to share our deep concerns about the mistreatment and neglect of detainees at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, as recently reported by the DHS Inspector General.  In August, I witnessed horrible conditions at Adelanto during our visit there to speak with asylum seekers and detainees.  Our government MUST treat all people with respect and dignity while they are in our care!.


Supporting Good Local Housing:

￼
Listening to LAPD Sgt. Heidi Stocklein during a tour of South LA's Pueblo Del Rio housing project.

During my visit to South LA's Pueblo Del Rio housing project, I met with community leaders, officers, and administrators.  I appreciated learning more about Pueblo Del Rio, the services it provides, the renovations taking place, and the amazing youth and community programs offered to local residents.


Promoting Good Health for All Americans:

On my visit to the Children's Hospital Los Angeles’ Newborn and Infant Critical Care Unit, I spoke with doctors about the critically important research being done on congenital small lung, also known as pulmonary hypoplasia, a dangerous neonatal lung condition affecting approximately one in 1,000 newborns.   As Maternity Care Caucus Co-Chair, I will keep fighting for policies that improve child and maternal health.

Did you know Republicans are STILL fighting in court to end protections for 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions?  Remember: Democrats want to KEEP pre-existing condition protections.  The Republicans' lawsuit will rip those protections away.


Protecting Our Country and Communities:

￼
Celebrating the U.S. Coast Guard's 228-year history at a Capitol Hill event with Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Karl Schultz.

I celebrated 228 years of the U.S. Coast Guard at a Capitol Hill event with Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Karl Schultz and others.  As the top Democrat on the House subcommittee that funds the Coast Guard, I will keep working to make sure our Coast Guard has the resources it needs to help protect America.

Recently, wildfires have burned hundreds of thousands of acres in California alone.  Other threats, 
both natural and man-made, can strike when we least expect it.  As a leading voice on Homeland Security in Congress, I have recorded this video encouraging you to visit ready.gov to learn how to prepare for emergencies.

Recientemente, incendios forestales han quemado cientos de miles de acres en California.  Otras amenazas, tanto desastres naturales como causados por el hombre, pueden atacar cuando menos lo esperamos.  Como una voz líder en Seguridad Nacional en el Congreso, he grabado este video que lo alienta a visitar ready.gov/es para aprender cómo prepararse para emergencias.

Members of the Los Angeles Interagency Metropolitan Police Apprehension Crime Task Force (L.A. IMPACT) met with me to discuss the fight against criminal narcotics in our neighborhoods.  L.A. IMPACT is a compilation of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in LA County whose primary focus is to investigate major crimes and to dismantle mid to major level drug trafficking organizations.


Promoting Clean Communities:

￼
Greeting participants in the Keep Downey Beautiful clean-up.

It was great to thank some of the participants in the Keep Downey Beautiful clean-up, including Downey Mayor Sean Ashton and his wife Tammy.  I appreciate all who took time out of their day to help keep our wonderful city beautiful.


Fighting for the Safety and the Voices of Women:

￼
With representatives of Nuevo Amanecer Mujer Integral at the GFWC Women’s Club of Huntington Park’s Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Conference.

As we marked Domestic Violence Awareness Month in October, I was honored to address the GFWC Women’s Club of Huntington Park’s Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Conference.  The amazing women I met there are committed to ending violence against women and empowering women to tell their stories. Thank you to all the volunteers, who provide such important resources and information to our community.

Congratulations to South Central Los Angeles Ministry Project (South Central LAMP) on 25 years of providing empowering and educational programs for women and their families.  I presented the organization with a Certificate of Congressional Recognition at its Anniversary Brunch.


Celebrating Persons with Disabilities:

Joining 2017 Ms. Wheelchair California Tayloure Richardson and Southern California Resource Services for Independent Living (SCRS-IL) Policy Director Hector Ochoa at SCRS-IL's Disability Pride festival in East LA.

I enjoyed taking part in two East LA events that celebrated our family, friends, and neighbors living with disabilities: Southern California Resource Services for Independent Living's (SCRS-IL) third annual Disability Pride festival, and Familia Unida's 15th annual Wheelchair Wash and Wellness Fair.  Thanks to Familia Unida, SCRS-IL, and all who worked so hard alongside them to make this year’s events successful.  Working together, we can do more to help persons with disabilities contribute to their community, fulfill their goals, and enjoy a higher quality of life.


Demanding Common Sense Spending Policies:

I was glad to help negotiate the Labor-HHS-Education/Defense bill that passed the House and became law.  The bill funds critical programs, keeps our national defense strong, and ensures our government will stay open through December – while rejecting draconian spending cuts proposed by the Trump Administration.  Read my statement about the bill.


Advocating for the Humane Treatment of Animals:

I have been a leader in the fight to retire National Institutes of Health (NIH) research chimps to sanctuaries, so I thank NIH Director Francis Collins for his continued commitment to retiring as many lab chimps to sanctuary as possible.  I am glad that an independent panel will have final decision-making authority to ensure that only those chimps truly unfit for transport will be held back in labs.

It was also wonderful to meet with so many fellow animal rights champions at a People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) event in LA.  I am proud to have helped bring an end to the Coast Guard’s use of animals in medical training, and the NIH’s use of baby monkeys in horrific experiments.

• Democrats pledge support
• FEMA adds to disaster declaration

Keeping spirits up after so much loss. Your congressional office is responsible for making sure that every possible federal resource is available to the Commonwealth government to recover from Super Typhoon Yutu. We are working to help individuals find the aid that is available now and register for future assistance. And we are preparing to include the Marianas in supplemental funding that Congress will provide for survivors of natural disasters throughout America, when we reconvene later this month. It is also critical for us all to stop, and listen, and comfort each other after so much injury and destruction. 
 
 

Congress works on supplemental aid

When Congress returns after the elections, a top priority will be funding disaster relief. Your congressional office is already at work on assistance for the Marianas above and beyond what the Federal Emergency Management Agency can provide from its Disaster Relief Fund. The supplemental aid package now being put together will also cover the Carolinas, hard hit by Hurricane Florence in September, and Georgia and Florida, struck by Hurricane Michael in October. For the Marianas, additional money for Medicaid and food assistance are two priorities that fall outside the scope of FEMA’s funding. We also want to make sure that other federal programs extended to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands after hurricanes last year are funded to cover Marianas disaster relief. We are keeping key Appropriations Committee offices in the House and Senate abreast of the damage assessments, recovery efforts, and the need for ongoing assistance. 
 

Democrats pledge support

Shortly after the storm, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi released this statement on disaster recovery needs in the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands:

""Our fellow Americans in the Mariana Islands have endured a storm of staggering force and destructiveness. We are praying for the families and communities who were hit, and for the brave first responders who have rushed to help.

""We are grateful for the tireless leadership of Congressman Sablan, who immediately began working to ensure the federal government keeps its moral obligation to our fellow Americans in the aftermath of this disaster. The powerful and respected voice he brings to Washington, on both sides of the aisle, will be invaluable in ensuring the Mariana Islands receive the help they need to rebuild strong as ever. 

""Every American is owed this solemn promise, whether they live in the territories or the mainland: that in the critical months of recovery to come, their government will do everything it can save lives and make them whole."" 
 

FEMA adds to Disaster Declaration

The Super Typhoon Yutu Major Disaster Declaration issued by the President on Oct. 26 was amended on Wednesday to allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide more help. In addition to already authorized assistance to individuals for household aid and to the government for emergency work and the repair and replacement of damaged facilities, FEMA can now remove debris on Rota, Tinian, and Saipan and restore roads, water control and other utilities, and recreational areas on Tinian and Saipan. 
 
 

Registration: first step to aid. Visiting door to door I explain to families how to register with FEMA. Registration is the first step in getting help to repair your home or replace what you lost in the typhoon. Call 1.800.621.3362, log on to www.disasterassistance.gov, or come to your congressional office in Susupe for help in registering. 
 
 

Hopwood shattered. Among the worst-damaged schools, inside and out, was Hopwood Middle School. The Public School System is already planning to add double sessions on campuses that can be quickly cleaned up and repaired, and once schools are no longer in use as emergency shelters. But finding room for every student to get back to learning is a challenge. Facilities like Hopwood will need rebuilding from scratch. 
 

DeVos pledges school support

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos called me on Wednesday to express concern for the Northern Mariana Islands in the aftermath of Super Typhoon Yutu and to pledge her support for our students, families, teachers, and schools. I gave Secretary DeVos an overview of the destruction – so many public and private schools suffered extensive damage, as did our college. It will be a challenge to get students back to a regular schedule soon. Knowing that Secretary DeVos is aware of our situation and wants to help is reassuring and a reason to be hopeful. She said she and her staff would keep in close contact with PSS and the Northern Marianas College over the coming weeks and months of recovery and rebuilding. And I am working to ensure that Congress provides adequate funding towards disaster relief efforts so that our schools have the resources students and teachers need to restart educational activities and fully restore a safe and healthy learning environment.
 

$2.8M for lost jobs

The U.S. Department of Labor Employment Training Administration is providing an initial $2.8 million grant to the Commonwealth’s Workforce Investment Agency through the National Dislocated Worker Program. The funds will assist U.S. citizens who lost work as a result of typhoons Mangkhut and Yutu. Similar funding was provided to the Commonwealth following Typhoon Soudelor. Commonwealth officials said that details on how and where to apply for jobs funded by the federal grant would be announced once the government offices are up and running. 

 

Keeping you informed

When natural disaster strikes, as happened again last week with Super Typhoon Yutu, the role of the congressional office is to make sure that all federal resources reach the Marianas fast. We also do everything we can to keep people informed about restoration of services, where to get assistance, and any other news that we think will help. Find our regular updates on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and at sablan.house.gov. Or come to your congressional office in Susupe Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon. 
 

Latest Typhoon Yutu Updates

Disaster Recovery Registration 
A Recovery Intake Center opened at the Department of Commerce on Tinian on Thursday, November 1. FEMA staff are assisting disaster survivors to register for disaster assistance there. Similar Disaster Recovery Centers are planned for Saipan, but not yet opened.

Food and Water Distribution
Saipan: Food and water are being distributed from 10 am to 5 pm at: 
	•	Koblerville Fire Station and Minachom Atdao Pavilion from Saturday, Nov. 3 to Friday, Nov. 9
	•	American Memorial Park, Kagman Fire Station and San Roque Fire Station from Sunday, Nov. 4 to Friday, Nov. 9

Tinian: The American Red Cross-NMI Chapter and the Tinian mayor’s staff set up a food and water distribution center at the Tinian Gym. FEMA has provided bottled water, ready-to-eat meals (MREs), and humanitarian daily rations (HDRs). 

Power
Saipan: The Commonwealth Utilities Corporation (CUC) has restored power to the Commonwealth Health Care Center and certain areas along Navy Hill, Upper Navy Hill (Chalan Galaide), Puerto Rico and Garapan with the help of the Guam Power Authority, Colorado Primary Source, the U.S. Department of Energy, FEMA and the Army Corp of Engineers.

Tinian: The entire island remains without power. Officials estimate it will take three months to restore power to half the island, at least one year for full restoration to the island. There are 754 downed poles and 9 damaged transformers throughout the island.

Water
Saipan: CUC reports that the following villages are online and now receiving water: As Teo (Agag area), Lower and Upper Navy Hill, Koblerville homestead area (except for Tottotville and Adobo Street) Middle Road to Puerto Rico, South Lower Base to Hotel Street.

Tinian: Residents are now getting island water from Maui Well Pump Station. Drinking water is also available through a reverse osmosis system installed by the Air Force.

Tinian: The Tinian Fuel Station opened for business on Wednesday, Oct. 31. 

CNMI Government 
Government offices reopened under new operating hours of 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekdays beginning Tuesday, Oct. 30.

Schools
CNMI Public School System reports nearly all Saipan and Tinian campuses sustained significant storm damage. PSS expects to conditionally open Saipan and Tinian schools in two to eight weeks. Double session scheduling may be used. The school year will be adjusted to make up for instructional time lost. Rota schools resumed classes on October 29. The public is advised not to visit schools on Saipan and Tinian for safety reasons.

Postal Operations
All post offices, including contract postal units, on Saipan, Tinian, and Rota are open. Mail is being delivered to P.O. boxes. Retail and parcel pickup windows have resumed operations.
 

IRS extends tax deadlines

The U.S. Internal Tax Service has extended tax deadlines in recognition of the difficulty for individuals and businesses to get back to normal after Super Typhoon Yutu. U.S. tax deadlines falling on or after Oct. 24, 2018 and before Feb. 28, 2019, are granted additional time to file through Feb. 28, 2019. This includes the quarterly U.S. estimated income tax payments due on Jan. 15, 2019, and the quarterly payroll and excise tax returns normally due on Oct. 31, 2018 and Jan. 31, 2019. It also includes U.S. tax-exempt organizations that operate on a calendar-year basis and had an automatic U.S. extension due to run out on Nov. 15, 2018.

Foxx Report
 
These past weeks have been busy with my attending local events around the Fifth District, meeting with constituents in my district offices and hosting roundtables with different stakeholder groups to learn more about the needs of the Fifth District! The wisdom of the world is not in Washington, and I was enlightened by the input I received and also grateful for the opportunity to share positive economic news and results of the conservative policies passed by this Congress.
Last week, I held a roundtable at Forsyth Tech @ Innovation Quarter to discuss the federal grant reporting process and my bill, the Grant Reporting Efficiency and Agreements Transparency (GREAT) Act. Libraries from around the state, universities, non-profits, the Winston-Salem Police Department and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District shared the challenges they face with the current grant reporting system. As a former researcher, librarian and college president, I have been grant-writing for all of my professional life. It’s hard to believe that the same challenges I faced at the beginning of my career are the same ones faced by federal grant recipients today—inconsistent reporting standards and inefficient paperwork. That’s why I introduced the GREAT Act, which will modernize federal grant tracking and reporting with digital data and searchable documents. It passed in the House on September 26, and I am working with my colleagues in the Senate to make it law! Read more about the GREAT Act here.

TOURING R.J. REYNOLDS MANUFACTURING  As I toured R.J. Reynolds manufacturing operations last month, I met employees who received bonuses and saw the company’s new investments in research and development—both made possible thanks to our tax cuts. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a win-win for workers and business leaders, and this company and its employees are proof of its positive impact in the Fifth District. Not only are workers keeping more of their hard-earned money, local businesses are expanding and passing on their tax savings to workers.

SUPPORTING OUR FARMERS 

￼
 
Last Tuesday, North Carolina Farm Bureau President Larry Wooten presented me with the Farm Bureau Award for my strong advocacy for farmers in North Carolina and nationwide this Congress. American Farm Bureau Federation gives the award each Congress to members whose voting records demonstrate their outstanding support for agriculture.

ROUNDTABLE WITH VETERANS & SERVICE DOGS 
Chances are you have seen one of the frequently reported stories of fake and poorly trained emotional support animals and service dogs causing problems on airplanes—from emotional support hamsters to squirrels. In light of this issue, I gathered veterans and representatives from the American Service Dog Access Coalition, Saving Grace K9's, and the Salisbury VA Medical Center to discuss how the abuse of accommodations for service dogs and emotional support animals has hurt veterans and their families. They emphasized that education for the public is just as important as legislation when it comes to solving these problems. Many times people who don't understand the difference between legitimate and illegitimate service animals deny disabled individuals the accommodations that they are entitled to. To learn about what qualifies as a service animal, see this FAQ. And if you have questions about this issue, please feel free to contact my office. I will be glad to share educational resources and hear your input as I consider additional legislative solutions.

FLAT ROCK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

Yesterday, I was delighted to present Flat Rock Elementary School with a plaque to honor the heroic sacrifice of Cora Beasley who died in 1957 saving third grader Larry Adams in a fire that destroyed the school. Flat Rock Elementary and the Mount Airy community have remembered her bravery through the generations, and I am very proud to represent a town that never forgets its heroes. We don’t all have the opportunity to make the ultimate sacrifice, but by keeping alive the memory of incredible role models like Mrs. Beasley, we are reminded daily to dedicate ourselves to helping others in every way we can.

The Hill Report   A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions Week of October 29 - November 2, 2018
This November, we recognize the sacrifices made by the families of our men and women in uniform as we observe Military Family Month. As the son of an Air Force veteran, I have seen the many difficulties faced by the selfless families of our military members. From small things like a missed birthday or holiday, to the constant concern for a loved ones’ safety, the families back home supporting our troops truly are serving our nation. We can never do enough to repay our brave patriots and they deserve our deepest appreciation and respect. This is why I have continuously backed legislation to provide our troops, and their families, the support they need. Most recently, I voted in support of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019, which will provide our war fighters with a 2.6% raise – their largest pay increase in nine years – and supports our military families by including $34.4 billion for the Defense Health Program. Our service members and their families make daily sacrifices that the rest of us cannot begin to comprehend, all to the benefit of our way of life and our cherished freedom. Join me in thanking our military families this month.  
Events in the District 
Mental Health Breakfast  On Tuesday morning, I was honored to speak at a breakfast hosted by my dear friend, Dr. Carla Russo, about the importance of suicide prevention and mental health awareness. I was glad to see other community leaders who have a vested interest in not only stopping the stigma associated with mental health but finding real world solutions. As your representative, I have been actively engaged with several mental health professionals from North Texas, I have been in touch with leadership at the Dallas VA, and I have hosted two round table discussions to help address the needs of those living with mental illness. I look forward to continuing discussions with my colleagues to find solutions to improve mental health care and delivery of services to those in need.
￼  Congressman Sessions with Dr. Carla Russo. 
North Texas Crime Commission Gala  On Tuesday evening, I was pleased to once again join my friends with the North Texas Crime Commission (NTCC) for their annual gala. Established in 1950, NTCC operates the North Texas Crime Stoppers reward program, which pays rewards for anonymous tips and forwards that information to law enforcement agencies. Every day, the selfless men and women who work in law enforcement get up and place themselves in harm’s way to protect our communities. They deserve our respect and support, and I am always proud to stand in solidarity with them. I will continue to support legislative efforts and organizations, like NTCC, that back our selfless heroes in blue.
￼  Congressman Sessions speaking at the North Texas Crime Commission Gala. 
UPS Dallas  On Thursday morning, I was delighted to visit with my friends at the UPS Dallas facility. It was great to talk with the drivers and support workers who ensure the on-time deliveries across North Texas that keep our economy and our country moving forward. During our conversations, I was struck by how our booming economy translates into more work, more jobs, and more opportunity for these hard-working men and women, and I could not be more proud of Republicans' work in Congress to ensure continued success and economic growth right here in North Texas.  
￼  Congressman Sessions visiting the UPS Dallas Facility.  
Benjamin Waggoner Eagle Scout Presentation  As a proud Eagle Scout, I was honored to attend the Eagle Scout Presentation of Benjamin Waggoner at Lake Highland United Methodist Church this week. I am so proud to see individuals, like Benjamin, overcome such tremendous challenges and achieve this prestigious award. For his Eagle Scout project, he raised funds and built a Frisbee golf course at a camp that specializes in helping children with unique medical and physical challenges. Again, I was pleased to meet with this bright young leader and I applaud his commitment to service, loyalty to his country, and dedication to the values of scouting. 
￼  Congressman Sessions with Benjamin Waggoner at his Eagle Scout Presentation.  
Friends of Dallas Police 2018 Awards Banquet  This week I was glad to meet with the men and women who selflessly serve and protect our community day in and day out. Over the summer, I also had the opportunity to visit the Dallas Police Department (DPD) Fusion Center to better understand our local law enforcement's efforts to detect and analyze criminal activity. Our police officers are the cornerstone of our communities and I will continue to protect them just as they protect us.

A Horrific Shooting at a Pittsburgh Synagogue 
I was horrified and devastated by last weekend’s shooting at the Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue in Pittsburgh. This bigotry and hatred exhibited by the shooter has no place in our society. I want to commend the law enforcement personnel and first responders who put their lives on the line to prevent an even greater loss of life. My heart goes out to the family and friends of those who were killed and injured in this tragedy. I am proud to be a Jewish Member of Congress. We will be intimidated by the anti-Semitic attacks on members of our community. As we mourn our brothers and sisters in Pittsburgh, join me in pledging to support compassion, truth, and hope as we vigorously push back  against hatred, lies, and divisiveness.
Visiting Tincher Preparatory School in Long Beach 
It was a pleasure to visit the students at Tincher Preparatory School last week. Tincher is a K-8 school in Long Beach that has been recognized as a California Distinguished School and a Title 1 High Achieving School. On the day of my visit, the school was celebrating its redesignation as a “School to Watch” by the National Forum to Accelerate Middle-Grades Reform for its academic excellence.  I spoke to the students about the importance of working hard in school, and the many wonderful career opportunities that hard work can lead to. Thanks to the Long Beach College Promise, many of these students will be able to attend Long Beach City College and CSULB once they graduate from high school.

Defending the Affordable Care Act 
This week, I joined my colleagues in sending a letter to President Trump requesting that his administration act to uphold the Affordable Care Act’s strong protections for patients with pre-existing conditions. The President continually claims to support people with pre-existing conditions, while his own Administration backs a lawsuit that would end these protections and devastate millions of Americans. Click here to read the full letter.

Each week hundreds of constituents contact my office to share their views on a variety of topics. I have recently received many messages from constituents expressing their support for the Opioids and STOP Pain Initiative Act. Below is a portion of my response to those messages: 
“The Opioids and STOP Pain Initiative Act would establish a research program through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to increase our understanding of pain, develop and improve alternative treatments for pain, and establish strategies for addressing the opioid crisis. 
I am supportive of this bill.  As a community psychologist, I recognize the importance of research that allows people to lead healthier lives.  As a nation, we have a long and proud record of accomplishment in scientific research that has brought cures and treatments to billions across the globe.  
You may also be interested to know that in the previous Congress, I cosponsored and voted in favor of the 21st Century Cures Act, which was signed into law.  This legislation boosted funding for the NIH, as well as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which approves new treatments and cures.  In addition, this bill made a number of changes to the drug approval process to ensure that medical cures reach the people who need them more quickly, while also maintaining patient safety. 
I will continue to support, as I have every year I have been in Congress, robust funding for the NIH and our health research programs.”  
If you have written in to me, please continue to do so. If you have not, I encourage you to share your views and concerns with me, as it is the best way for me to find out which issues you care most about.   You can find out how to contact me on my website by clicking here.

Congressional Elections: Why Tuesday, and Why November?   We are now just days away from the November 6, 2018 mid-term election, where, as is the case every two years, all 435 seats in the House will be decided by the voters. I thought it might be interesting to look back on the very first national House of Representatives election and why it, like all federal elections, are held on the first Tuesday in November.   Prior to 1845, each state held federal elections on dates of their own choosing. In 1845, Congress passed a law setting the Tuesday after the first Monday in November as the date for the next presidential election. This was further adopted as the date for electing House Members in 1875. When Senators began being directly elected by voters, the legislation was amended to include them. 
In the mid-1800s, America was still a largely agricultural society with very slow and inadequate rural transportation. Winter months were difficult to travel during. Most voters were busy in the spring planting crops and busy in the summer tending the crops, and it wasn’t until November that the fall harvest was usually complete.   Why Tuesday? Rural voters often required at least a day to travel to their county seats to vote. Since church service put Sunday out of the question and Wednesdays were usually market days in rural areas, Tuesday was selected. 
And why the Tuesday after the first Monday? The answer is somewhat mundane—it’s a matter of counting calendar days. When the 1845 law setting the presidential election date was being debated, the date was first set as ""the first Tuesday in November."" Someone noticed that in some years the period between the first Tuesday in November and the first Wednesday in December (when the presidential electors are required to meet in their state capitals to vote) would be more than 34 days. This would have violated the existing Electoral College law. So, using an election calendar already used by the state of New York, the bill was reworded to make election day the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This meant that there could only be a maximum of 29 days between election day and the first Wednesday in December, satisfying the electoral college law.   
￼ 
Which voting method do you plan to use to cast your ballot in the November 6th midterm election?   
60% I will vote early by mail  35% I will vote in person on Election Day  3%   I will vote early in person  1%   Don’t Know/Unsure  0%   I don’t plan to vote in this election 

Thank you,

Long’s Short Report – The growing problem of maternal mortality rates, especially in minority communities 
By Rep. Billy Long
The Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee recently held a hearing on reducing the maternal mortality rate in the U.S. We heard from a number of advocates on the issue as well as personal stories of those who have been directly affected by this growing problem. One story in particular made a lasting impression on me. It was from Charles Johnson IV, a father of two, who lost his wife, Kira, after the birth of their second son. What was supposed to be a routine pre-scheduled C-section turned into more than 10 hours of waiting to see if his wife was going to make it. Charles knew immediately something was wrong and started begging for someone to help his wife. He was told that everything was going to be fine and his wife just wasn’t a priority, but at 2:22 a.m. on April 17, 2016, Charles lost his wife, and his two sons lost their mother.
I would like to say stories like this are rare, but sadly that’s not the case. Between 2000 and 2014, the maternal mortality rate increased by 27 percent. Compared to other developed countries, the U.S. has the highest maternal mortality rate, sadly making us one of eight countries where the maternal mortality rate continues to increase. Unfortunately, due to limited data, we can’t fully understand why the maternal mortality rate continues to increase.
During the hearing, we discussed ways to address this problem, including through legislation such as H.R. 1318, the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act. This bill would enhance the partnership between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and states to help set up and expand state maternal mortality review committees (MMRCs), which are made up of local experts in the field who look for ways to prevent future deaths. This bill would also increase collaboration and information sharing among committees and the CDC to get a more accurate picture of the problem nationwide. Currently, 33 states have these types of committees.
Charles’ heart-wrenching testimony of trying to save his wife in the few hours she lived, after her previously scheduled C-section, made a big impact on our Committee. Charles is black as was his wife. While this health care crisis affects everyone, minority maternal mortality rates occur at a much higher rate than in the general population. This is one more layer to the puzzle that we in Congress need to work to solve. My colleagues and I will continue to work to ensure this bill is passed so we can get better data to get better outcomes for maternal health.

Dear Neighbor,
The American people want Republicans and Democrats in Congress to work together to get things done in Washington and help people.
We were recently rated one of the Top 25 of most bipartisan members in Congress.
This year we have been working on a lot of bipartisan bills, but we would like to take a moment to highlight just a few:
We worked with Rep. Engel (D-NY) to introduce the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act:
	•	Increases training for palliative care and hospice professionals.
	•	Launches a national campaign to inform patients and families about the benefits of palliative care.
We worked with Rep. Sanchez (D-CA) to introduce the Credit for Caring Act:
	•	Provides a tax credit for caregiving expenses for family members.
We worked with Rep. Welch (D-VT) to introduce the Rural Hospital Access Act:
	•	Ensures that funding is secured on a permanent basis for Medicare dependent and low-volume hospitals.
We worked with Rep. Higgins (D-NY) and Rep. Neal (D-MA) for the New Market Tax Credits Extension Act:
	•	Amends the Internal Revenue Service to make the new market tax credits permanent.
	•	The National Comedy Center in Jamestown is a result of new market tax credits.
We worked with Rep. Tonko (D-NY) and other members of the New York delegation for the Finger Lakes National Heritage Area Study Act:
	•	Requests the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study to designate certain land as the Finger Lakes National Heritage Area.
We worked with our upstate colleagues, Rep. Higgins (D-NY), the late Rep. Slaughter (D-NY) and other New York members, to pass the reauthorization of the West Valley Demonstration Project:
	•	Reauthorizes the project through 2025 with $75 million, a 30% increase since 2010.
As always, if you are looking for assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to any of our offices. Our doors are always open.
Until next time,
Tom

ICYMI: Womack Pens Op-ed in The Hill 
Earlier this week, I penned an op-ed in the Hill showing how bipartisanship can still work in Congress through the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform. The editorial highlights bipartisanship in Congress in advance of process reform recommendations to be reported out of the Joint Select Committee and the upcoming midterm elections.    Although comprised of a diversity of political thought, the members of the Joint Select Committee have clearly shared a common goal since being given our charge: producing recommendations that meaningfully improve the congressional budget and appropriations process rather than offering prescriptions for specific budgetary outcomes that benefit one party. We have found value in compromise and collaboration and believe that no matter who holds a majority in either Chamber, our budgetary framework should encourage, if not ensure our success.    Ultimately, news of our bipartisan work may not break through the noise of post-election posturing. I regret that. But as you watch returns come in November 6, regardless of which party 'wins,' know that there is and will continue to be bipartisan cooperation and efforts ongoing to ultimately make Congress work better together and work better for the American people.    Click here to read the full piece from The Hill.  
WEEK IN REVIEW
￼
One of the best parts of my job is talking to and hearing from constituents, families, businesses, students, and friends from Arkansas’s Third Congressional District. From traveling around Harrison and Russellville, to Yellville and Peel, it was another great week in Arkansas. Below are some highlights! 
I started my week with the Harrison Kiwanis Club. I appreciated having the opportunity to give a Washington update and discuss challenges facing our nation. It was great to speak to such an engaged group and hear more about the issues that matter to them. Kiwanis members are dedicated to strengthening our local community, and I look forward to visiting again soon. 
￼
My next stop was Harrison High School to talk with hundreds of students about their goals and the importance of investing in themselves. These young adults will face many decisions in the coming years, and it’s essential that they know that hard work will lead them to success. We discussed the importance of education, service, and leadership. Our high school students are the future leaders, business owners, teachers, and public servants of our country. With hard work and dedication, their futures will be without limit. A special thank you to Principal Jay Parker and School Superintendent Stuart Pratt for their time and effort!
I value learning about the work of companies in our region. I traveled to Thorpe Industries to check out their plant maintenance, engineering, and manufacturing work. They create custom fiberglass vessels that hold hazardous materials and other liquids. Each container is custom designed to withstand corrosion, high heat, and other challenges. Businesses like this are the job creators, innovators, and economic drivers that keep our local community strong. 
￼
We want our next generation to become good, productive citizens that give back to our state. Having an open dialogue with students in our district is a priority for me, and I always make it a point to visit classrooms throughout our state. On Wednesday, I spent time with Russellville High School Seniors and members of the Junior ROTC program. Leadership goes beyond the school walls, and I was impressed by the caliber of conversation I had with these students. Meeting young people with a passion for serving our country and community is always inspiring. 
￼
I then walked across the campus to participate in the ribbon cutting ceremony of the new Russellville Multi-Purpose Sports Facility. The complex includes indoor practice space for football programs and other teams, locker rooms, classrooms, a training and weight space, and offices. Providing students and coaches with a first-rate facility will allow student-athletes to train harder, faster, and stronger year-round. 
￼
The manufacturing sector is a critical piece of our economy. Did you know that tire manufacturing alone contributes hundreds of billions of dollars in economic output and supports hundreds of thousands of jobs each year? I visited the Bridgestone Tire plant to learn more about the company and see their production work firsthand. They even let me get some hands-on experience and make a tire inner tube! It was great to meet with employees and see the tire making process. Bridgestone not only keeps truckers and families moving across the country, they also are providing great jobs and boosting economic opportunity.
￼
I ended the day with a small business tour of downtown Russellville. When our small businesses succeed, they create jobs, invest in our communities, and boost opportunity throughout AR-3. Stopping by local shops allows me to learn more about issues business owners face and get firsthand insight into their work to manage and run successful businesses. I always take these insights back to Washington with me to help develop policies that support business growth. Our entrepreneurs embody the values and ideals of Arkansas – hard work, perseverance, and a dedication to ingenuity and innovation. A special thank you to Main Street Russellville and Director Jami Mullen for taking me around!
￼
On Thursday, I took an early morning ferry ride over to Peel. It was great to join residents and discuss some of the things going on in Washington. We talked about a variety of topics, including social security, immigration, economic growth, and the deficit. I also shared some of my priorities in Congress: a strong defense, lower taxes, secure borders, and continued economic growth. It’s important that I hear directly from the people I represent! Thanks to everyone who took time out of their busy schedules to share some coffee and their thoughts. 
￼
I wrapped up the week at Yelcot Communications in Yellville, where we talked about rural broadband access and infrastructure challenges in our community. Policies coming from Congress should incentivize increased access to internet, not create more red tape.
Wishing you a wonderful weekend filled with family and friends! Remember to keep an eye on my website or check out my Twitter and pages to stay up-to-date with the latest news from the Third District and Washington.

Fighting to Secure Houses of Worship in the Wake of the Devastating Synagogue Attack
The attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue is an abhorrent display of anti-Semitism and hate. All places of worship are supposed to be havens to reflect and pray. This sick individual is a terrorist whose goal is to strike fear in a community. His actions and goals will not prevail, and we can't allow for his hate to fester. I pray for the victims, their families and friends, and everyone in the Jewish and local community in Pittsburgh.
In the wake of this devastating attack, I joined my colleagues in the House of Representatives this week to call on the Senate to pass H.R. 1486, the Securing Non-Profit Organizations Against Terrorism Act of 2017. This bill would establish a grant program within the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide funding to at-risk religious institutions to secure and protect houses of worship from violent attack. I was the only Republican co-sponsor of this legislation when it passed the House in January with unanimous consent.

Visit to Bliss Towers in Hudson 
Bliss Towers in Hudson has long been in need of renovations to provide its residents with a safe and healthy living environment. I have been working closely with Hudson Housing Authority’s (HHA) Executive Director Tim Mattice and the U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Regional Administrator Lynne Patton to ensure critical upgrades are made to its facilities. I was pleased we were able to tour Bliss Towers yesterday and witness the many improvements that have been made over the last few months, including new shower, sink, and air fixtures.
During my time in Congress, I have been Bliss Towers’ biggest advocate on the federal level. Shortly after I was made aware of the appalling living conditions at Bliss Towers, I raised the issue immediately with HUD. One month later, it was announced that HUD was providing over $300,000 in funding for the HHA. Safe, reliable and affordable public housing is a fundamental way to empower low-income individuals in our community. I will always continue my work to ensure our fellow citizens in public housing have decent living conditions. Over the next three years, major renovations of Bliss Towers as well as new construction to replace dilapidated structures will be initiated.
Read the letter I sent to HUD Secretary Ben Carson, urging HUD to take immediate action to improve the Bliss Towers facilities here: https://bit.ly/2qrKukc

October Sees Continued Growth in U.S. Economy
The month of October saw 250,000 jobs added to the U.S. economy, while unemployment stayed at 3.7 percent and typical earnings increased over 3 percent – breaking the 3 percent mark for the first time in almost a decade. The growing strength of our national economy is a result of reduced regulations and the many hardworking men and women who form the backbone of industries such as transportation, manufacturing and healthcare.
As our economy continues to grow, we now have more job openings than individuals to fill them. Here in New York, I have consistently heard concerns from local business owners that they do not have access to the reliable and skilled labor force they need for their operations. To change this, I have been a leading voice in Congress to expand access to work training programs to ensure employers here in Upstate and across the country have the high skilled workers they need – especially in the high-tech manufacturing sector.   Read more about October's economic growth here: https://on.wsj.com/2Djohgu

Catskills Ranked Second-Best Region to Visit
The Catskill region was recently ranked number two by the Lonely Planet travel guide in their Best in Travel Top 10 Regions to Visit in 2019. Not a surprise, the Catskill Mountains are not only beautiful, they have an abundance of outdoor opportunities like hiking and camping as well as local farms, breweries, and other small businesses.  
Our district in Upstate New York is filled with magnificent outdoor spaces like the Catskill Mountains that contribute to our regional identity and act as a significant driver of our local economy. The outdoor recreational economy generates nearly $42 billion in consumer spending every year in New York while supporting over 300,000 jobs. 
I am a leading advocate in Congress, fighting to expand conservation efforts that allow for our state to remain one of the foremost destinations for families, outdoor enthusiasts and travelers alike. For example, I have been an outspoken opponent of the IRS’ recent proposal that could hamper land conservation in New York.

Congratulations to Otsego Northern Catskills BOCES for $500k Federal Funding Award
Congratulations to Otsego Northern Catskills Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) for receiving a $500,000 grant award from the USDA Rural Development Distance Learning and Telemedicine program. This federal investment will help increase Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) opportunities as well as bolster education about opioid misuse and prevention in schools throughout Upstate.  
This USDA Rural Development grant program helps organizations find new ways to utilize technology to connect with students in their communities and enhance learning opportunities. The work Otsego Northern Catskills BOCES is doing to expand STEM education programs for their students, while also focusing on opioid prevention, is truly commendable as it addresses critical needs in Upstate – ensuring individuals have the skills and training they need for today’s jobs and combating the opioid epidemic.
Read more about this federal investment here and here.  

Open Now: Medicare Open Enrollment Period
Don’t forget, the Medicare open enrollment period goes from October 15 - December 7. This is when individuals on Medicare can change their health plans or prescription drug coverage to better suit their needs. More information on open enrollment can be found on CMS’ website: https://go.cms.gov/2yOQat5  If you or anyone you know is experiencing difficulties with their Medicare coverage or changing their enrollment, call my Kinderhook District Office at (518) 610-8133 and they may be able to assist you.

Welch Legislation Lowering the Cost of Prescription Drugs Signed into Law 
Peter’s bipartisan legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs was signed into law last month. His bill eliminates contractual “gag rules” imposed on pharmacists that prevent them from informing customers of lower cost options on prescription drugs. “In a time of skyrocketing prescription drug prices, it defies common sense that some pharmacists are prohibited from helping customers save money on their medications,” Peter said. “This new law empowers pharmacists to steer customers to the lowest cost option when filling a prescription.” 
Four Welch Bills Combating the Opioid Epidemic Signed into Law 
Four bipartisan bills co-authored by Peter to combat the opioid epidemic were signed into law last month. The new laws increase funding for the Medicaid Health Homes program, attack the root causes of overprescribing in the Medicaid and Medicare programs, educate seniors on alternatives to opioids, and fund National Institutes of Health (NIH) research into non-addictive drugs for pain management. While supporting a package of opioids bills signed into law, Peter decried the lack of a more comprehensive approach. “What we need, in addition to these good bills, is a full-scale opioids Marshall Plan that provides significant resources to those working on the front lines of this public health epidemic.” 
Helping Disabled Seniors  
At Gardener's Supply in Burlington, Peter unveiled legislation that will eliminate two barriers to older disabled Vermonters who wish to remain in the workforce after turning 65. “It simply doesn’t make sense to penalize disabled seniors who want to remain in the workforce beyond traditional retirement age,” Welch insisted. “This legislation eliminates two arbitrary barriers that discourage disabled seniors from working. And it ensures employers have dedicated workers ready, willing and able to get the job done.”

At Gardener’s Supply in Burlington, Peter unveils his legislation to eliminate barriers to employment for disabled seniors. 
Rebuilding Our Infrastructure  
Joined by Senator Sanders, Peter announced that Congress passed legislation that opens the door for Vermont to receive federal funds to repair three aging flood control dams. The America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 includes an amendment authored by Peter and Senator Sanders that authorizes safety improvements at certain state-owned flood control dams constructed by the federal government before 1940. In Vermont, three dams – the Waterbury, East Barre and Wrightsville dams – are eligible to receive funding under this provision. “In 2011, Waterbury suffered a devastating flood during Tropical Storm Irene,” Peter said. “More catastrophic damage was prevented due to the existence of the aging Waterbury Dam. This important legislation will increase funding to refurbish outdated and hazardous flood control dams in Vermont and across the country.” 
Halt Military Aid and Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia  
Following the disappearance of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Peter joined several House colleagues in introducing legislation to halt military aid and the future sale of arms to Saudi Arabia. “For too long the United States has blindly supported a Saudi Government engaged in a horrific campaign against the people of Yemen,” said Peter. “And now we learn that the Saudis were, at a minimum, complicit in the murder of a journalist who was critical of the Saudi regime. It is long past time to stop military assistance and the sale of arms to this brutal dictatorship.” 
Home in Vermont 
Over the past month, Peter has traveled the state to meet with and listen to Vermonters. Check out some highlights below. 
￼
Peter spoke with employees of Columbia Forest Products in Newport about his successful effort to impose tariffs on dumped and subsidized imports of Chinese hardwood plywood.  
￼ 
Peter addressed Senator Brian Campion’s Activating Democracy class at Bennington College.  ￼ 
Peter learned from the experts at Farmhouse Pottery in Woodstock 
￼ 
Peter joined in a ribbon cutting ceremony celebrating the expansion of Smuggler’s Notch Distillery in Jeffersonville.

11/2/18 17:25,News from Nita: Girls’ STEM Education — $450K to Combat Opioids — 📭 Ongoing Postal Service Failures,"￼
ABOUT NITA           CONSTITUENT SERVICES           NEWSROOM           LEGISLATIVE ISSUES           17th DISTRICT           CONTACT ME 
Dear Friend:
Here are some of the ways in which I'm fighting hard to keep Lower Hudson Valley communities safe, healthy, and secure: 
	•	Promoting Girls' STEM Education 
	•	Announcing $450,000 for Big Brothers Big Sisters of Rockland County
	•	Demanding Postal Service Accountability
	•	Calling on the FDA to Strengthen Food Allergy Labeling
Promoting Girls' STEM Education 
￼ 
Rep. Lowey talks about the importance of STEM with middle-school girls at Regeneron's second annual ""Day for Doing Good.""  
I recently participated in Regeneron's second annual ""Day for Doing Good,"" a global, company-wide day of service where I met at company headquarters in Tarrytown with middle-school girls from underserved school districts after they participated in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) activities, and discussed the importance of increasing access to STEM education for women and girls. 
	•	In 2015, women filled 47 percent of all US jobs, but held only 24 percent of STEM jobs. The deficit of women in STEM is not just a women's issue, it's an economic issue that could be detrimental to our country's ability to compete on a global scale.  
	•	As the Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee, I'm working to address the STEM gap and support young women who dream of being great scientists, mathematicians, and engineers in our district and across the country. I secured historic investments to support STEM in the federal spending bill enacted in September, including computer science education, $130 million in STEM resources for teachers, and $60 million for a new STEM and Computer Science competition.  
	•	I told the young women I met that they are the future of science, technology, engineering, and math-the next technological innovators and scientists. I look forward to seeing their contributions and reading about their successes for years to come.
￼ 
Announcing $450,000 for Big Brothers Big Sisters of Rockland County
I was pleased to announce that Big Brothers Big Sisters (BBBS) of Rockland County has been awarded $450,000 in federal funding to provide mentoring services for youth impacted by opioids. 
	•	This funding will go a long way toward keeping Rockland County youth safe and healthy, strengthening mentoring services for those impacted by opioids and helping protect a new generation from opioid addiction.  
	•	BBBS will use this funding in collaboration with Wellcore, their service-providing partner, and other community allies, to target approximately 5,000 Rockland County youth ages 17 and younger who are not only using or at high risk for using opioids but also those who are seriously impacted by parents or family members with opioid addictions.  
	•	Securing robust funding to respond to the opioid crisis has been one of my top priorities. In 2017, I announced $25,260,676 in federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services to New York State to combat opioid addiction. I will continue to secure these vital federal resources to keep our communities safe.
Demanding Postal Service Accountability  
￼ 
I was deeply troubled that several boxes of mail were found dumped in the woods in Westchester, allegedly by a U.S. Postal Service worker. This latest incident is part of the larger systemic problems plaguing post office branches throughout the Lower Hudson Valley. 
	•	Many Lower Hudson Valley residents continue to experience problems with U.S. Postal Service mail delivery or customer service.  
	•	I'm committed to holding the Postal Service accountable, and to getting residents answers and solutions to this crisis. Some of the actions I've recently taken include: urging the Deputy Postmaster General to provide prompt answers regarding scheduling changes and problems at the Westchester Processing and Distribution Center, as well as details about recent mail thefts; meeting with high-level Postal Service officials regarding systemic USPS failures in the Lower Hudson Valley; and convening local elected officials and residents to demand long-term solutions from USPS.
Calling on the FDA to Strengthen Food Allergy Labeling 
     ￼ 
I was pleased by the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) recent announcement that it is considering new labeling requirements for sesame because of allergy concerns. 
	•	For years, I have pushed the FDA to add sesame-one of the most prevalent allergens in the U.S.-to the list of major food allergens. Just like other major allergens, sesame can trigger life-threatening reactions. Its absence from food ingredient labels places consumers-especially children-with the allergy at serious risk.  
	•	Requiring sesame under federal law to be listed on food allergen labeling would mitigate these risks, making it easier for sesame-allergic consumers to identify and avoid foods that could cause a reaction.  
	•	I urge the FDA to swiftly move forward with these new disclosure requirements to protect public health and put necessary information in the hands of consumers.  
	•	To learn more about my efforts to support the food-allergic community, which include authoring the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act, click here.

Dear Friend,   
To understand the power, beauty, and dignity of what America means, one only has to look at the picture of the ordered white crosses nestled along the cliffside of Omaha Beach in Normandy, France.  It is solemn.  It is noble.  And it reflects the idea that one has no greater love than to lay down his life for his friends.  Nestled within the gentle rolling hills of white crosses are also headstones with Jewish Stars of David on them. 
On Saturday, October 27, at the Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue in the Jewish neighborhood of Squirrel Hill in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Robert Bowers opened fire during a baby-naming ceremony, shouting anti-Semitic slurs as he carried out his diabolical rampage.  Twenty minutes later, eleven people were dead and nine were injured, including four police officers.  It was the deadliest attack on a Jewish community in the history of the United States, and a multi-generational rending of our communal fabric. 
The pilgrims who settled in early 17th century New England were refugees from religious persecution in Europe.  These “Puritans” viewed their emigration from England as a re-enactment of the Jewish exodus: England was Egypt; the British monarch was Pharaoh; the Atlantic Ocean was the Red Sea; America was the Land of Israel.  The Puritans saw themselves like the New Israelites, entering a whole new covenant with God in a brand new Promised Land.  They imagined that Thanksgiving ― first celebrated in 1621, a year after the Mayflower landed ― would parallel Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement: A time of prayer, fasting, and introspection. 
Over 170 years later, in a 340-word Letter to the Hebrew Congregations of Newport, Rhode Island, President George Washington wrote that the Jewish communities of America would find more than mere “tolerance” in the New World.  “It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it were by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights,” Washington wrote.  “For, happily, the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support,” he continued. 
Perhaps this moment of pain for the Jewish community and all of America will cause us to reflect on a new healthier covenant for and with America.  A healthy America does not manufacture bogeymen towards which violence can be justified, nor does it subvert the principles of decency, civility, and order that allow us to be friends.  A new healthy America invites the wide array of Americans into this renewed covenant, which is rooted in respect for human dignity and the unifying principles presented at our nation’s founding. 
The various conflicts that the Jewish people have endured through the ages now have tragically manifested themselves again in this horrific trauma in Pittsburgh.  When I learned of the tragedy, my mind went to a piece of art I have in my own home called “The Tree of Life.” General Washington concluded his letter to the Hebrew Congregations of Newport, by writing, “May the children of the stock of Abraham who dwell in this land continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants; while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree and there shall be none to make him afraid.” The Tree of Life. 
  Sincerely, ￼  Congressman Jeff Fortenberry

11/2/18 17:19,Rep. Grothman Newsletter - Education & Employment Opportunities,"￼ 
  

College Here and Now
This week, I spoke at the ""College Here and Now"" program unveiling at Sheboygan North High School. This program, sponsored and made possible by Lakeshore Technical College and Lakeland University, offers a first-of-its-kind career pathway for high school students. 

This public/private partnership between high schools and local colleges will radically reduce the time to a college degree, save families thousands of dollars and prepare the next-generation workforce. It offers a great way for students to accelerate their education at a low cost and ensure a clear path to employment. Starting in the Fall of 2019, the program offers two options for high school students to promote their advanced education and develop knowledge of important career opportunities.

High school students attending Sheboygan North & South High Schools can earn an associates degree through Lakeshore Tech at the same time they graduate from high school. Students interested in an associates degree from Lakeshore Tech will have classes offered at both Sheboygan North & South high schools and the program will be available at no cost. Upon completion of their associates degree, students can continue at Lakeland University with guaranteed admission to earn a Bachelor's Degree with little to no debt through the University's co-op program with Lakeshore Tech.

Currently, the available area of study is Information Technology, however, both schools plans to add other career pathways such as Healthcare, Education, and Advanced Manufacturing to the program in the near future. This program is an incredible opportunity for high school students looking for a clear path to employment in important sectors that will drastically help narrow Wisconsin's skills gap. I'd like to congratulate both Lakeshore Tech and Lakeland University on promoting such a valuable program. I encourage students to reach out to their high school counselors to learn more about the program. I'm very excited to see it in action next Fall!

October Jobs Report
The U.S. added 250,000 jobs to the economy in October, shattering analyst expectations of 190,000 new jobs. This jobs report accompanies other great economic news such as an unemployment rate that has remained at a 49 year low, and a wages report that saw workers earnings increase by 3.1%. 

Manufacturing and constructions jobs each jumped by over 30,000 jobs and a variety of other economic sectors saw positive gains. With wages up and job opportunities on the rise, its our mission to make sure these positions get filled and the skills gap narrowed. The U.S. economy is on a roll, lets keep it up!  

Manufacturing Legislative Excellence 
This week, I was honored to accept the ""Manufacturing Legislative Excellence"" award from the National Association of Manufacturers. This award is given to Members of Congress who exhibit consistent support for the manufacturing sector through their legislative voting record. 

Supporting policies that enable manufacturers in Wisconsin and across the country has always been one of my top priorities. The 6th district has more manufacturing jobs than any other district in the country and I will always stand by the hard-working men and women who serve the industry. Making sure that manufacturers have the means to promote their business goals, compete in the global economy, and create jobs will continue to be one of my top priorities.   

Weekly Roundup
I had a great visit this week to AxleTech in Oshkosh. They manufacture components for heavy duty commercial and military vehicles. I had a great discussion with their representatives focusing on the skills gap, career technical education, and trade.

11/2/18 17:16,Not okay,"￼ 

Dear Friend, 
It's been a busy, productive week meeting with folks across South and West Texas. Take a look:  
Antisemitism of any kind is not okay. As we continue to mourn the innocent lives lost at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue, I was proud to stand tall with local officials and faith leaders in support of our Jewish brothers and sisters across the nation at this week's Community Memorial Gathering in San Antonio. We must continue to show the world that only light can conquer darkness.  
￼ 
Chairman Mike Simpson from Idaho has allowed San Antonio to secure reimbursement for Mission Reach year after year. I was glad to welcome him down to Texas to show him firsthand San Antonio River Authority's transformative ecological, cultural and economic improvements to our city.  
￼ 
It was awesome to see the great work being done at Catholic Charities - San Antonio and meeting a few of our future leaders this week. These kids sure kept me on my toes on the basketball court!  
￼ 
Are you a birder? I wasn't either, until visiting Mitchell Lake Audubon Center, where you can find nearly 350 bird species on the Southside of San Antonio. I'm proud to have helped secure funding for its continued improvements so that all of San Antonio can enjoy this TX-23 natural treasure for years to come.  
￼ 
My thanks to Treasury Secretary Counselor Dan Kowalski for visiting Texas A&M University - San Antonio to discuss local Opportunity Zones. I am eager to see the positive impact and growth these investments provide across South and West Texas.  
￼ 
For continued updates on my work for you, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube at @HurdontheHill. Have a great weekend!

Hoeven Introduces Resolution Designating November 3rd as National Bison Day 
Senator John Hoeven has introduced a bipartisan resolution to designate November 3rd as National Bison Day. The resolution celebrates America’s national mammal, the North American bison, and its significance in United States’ history.  “We worked hard to designate the bison as our national mammal to commemorate its unique and incredible place in American history and culture. Bison are strong, proud and free, and an important spiritual symbol for many Native Americans. They are a true American icon with an incredible story. The bison was once nearly wiped out, but through our nation’s first great conservation effort, they flourish today throughout the United States and North America. This resolution designates November 3 as National Bison Day and commemorates all that the bison means to our nation.” Click here for more.

RUTHERFORD ROUNDUP
For November 2, 2018

Dear Friends, 
Our hearts continue to go out to all the families and friends of those lost in the horrible attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. We pray for the souls we lost, and we are incredibly grateful for the law enforcement and first responders who courageously intervened to save lives.
Violence and terror have absolutely no place in our country, and can be neither tolerated nor justified. We come together to condemn vicious attacks of any kind, especially those based on bigotry, like anti-Semitism and racism. Attacks motivated by politically-inspired hate, such as the attempts to harm prominent Democrats last week or the attempts to murder congressional Republicans last year, shock the conscience and are entirely unacceptable.
These actions of deeply disturbed individuals do not reflect the views of any elected official, political party, or the values we stand for as Americans, and it is our responsibility to refute any suggestion to the contrary. Nearly every single American rejects hate and discrimination and would never seek to harm their fellow man. These tragedies remind us that we are united by our love for country and all our fellow citizens. Let us renew our efforts to promote a civil discourse that allows for vigorous debate of ideas without straying from our respect for others.     

￼ 

Real Progress in the Fight Against Human Trafficking
￼ 
Human trafficking is one of the world’s fastest growing crimes, so I am pleased to report that a law we passed earlier this year, the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), is making a real difference in our efforts to stop this despicable trade. FOSTA gave prosecutors new tools to target criminal actors seeking to sell girls into slavery and prostitution through the internet, and those tools are helping us get results.  
The Department of Justice shut down backpage.com, a site notorious for promoting the sex trade, and its owners were arrested. Craigslist and Reddit removed pages on which significant trafficking took place in the past. According to the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri, 90% of sex trafficking websites and online ads have been shut down since FOSTA’s passage. While this is encouraging, criminals seeking to exploit the vulnerable for profit will continue to look for ways to do so. We must do all we can to keep people safe from these vile traffickers.  
Here at home, federal agencies are ensuring full enforcement of our laws, so that those who seek to exploit our people and break our laws face justice. Last year:  
	•	The Department of Justice secured convictions against nearly 500 defendants in human trafficking and the FBI dismantled 42 criminal enterprises engaged in child sex trafficking.
	•	The Department of Homeland Security initiated more than 800 human trafficking cases, resulting in 1,500 arrests, 530 convictions, and more than 500 victims identified.
 ￼
Less Red Tape = More Jobs
￼ 
Last week brought another round of good news as we learned that the economy grew by an estimated 3.5% in the last three months. Just last month, the economy added 250,000 new jobs. After years of slow growth, our economy has expanded at a 3% rate in the last 12 months, providing more and better-paying jobs for our workers.  
It is no accident that our nation is enjoying historic economic success. A pro-growth agenda, built on a foundation of tax cuts and regulatory reform, is creating jobs and increasing wages across the nation. Just in the last year, the Trump Administration’s regulatory reform efforts have reduced cost burdens on our economy by $23 billion, freeing our small businesses to focus on growing rather than complying with red tape mandates. By eliminating 176 outdated, unnecessary or duplicative regulations, our small businesses are able to provide greater opportunities for families in Northeast Florida and across the country.

November 2, 2018 
Dear friend, 
In a letter sent this week to the State Water Resources Control Board in Sacramento, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler expressed concern over several aspects of the proposed Bay-Delta plan and questioned the effectiveness of unimpaired flows on improving native fish species when studies show that several additional factors contribute to their dwindling populations. This comes on the heels of President Trump signing a presidential memorandum to bring more storage to the Valley and address hydroelectric relicensing at Don Pedro, requiring agencies to consider local plans like the Tuolumne River Management Plan developed by Modesto and Turlock Irrigation Districts. This process has been stalled by Sacramento bureaucrats who are using the National Marine Fisheries Service to shut down hydropower generation and drastically increase flows on the Tuolumne River by ignoring local plans and sound science. 
Today as a follow-up to the presidential memorandum, I hosted a call with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to discuss the details of the memorandum, next steps in the process, and allow irrigation districts and farm bureaus an opportunity to ask questions. I’m pulling every available resource to stop the state’s dangerous water grab, and this includes bringing administration officials to the Valley to see first-hand what’s going on and engaging the White House to push executive action to stop Sacramento from stealing our water. Both the Department of Interior and EPA have now directly weighed in against Sacramento’s plan.

Jobs numbers show continued improvement  Also this week, the state released new jobs numbers, and once again, our district is showing improvement. Unemployment in California’s 10th congressional district has dropped again. Stanislaus and San Joaquin Counties now have 5.3 and 5.0 percent unemployment respectively, down from 18 and 18.1 percent when I first took office in 2011, and median household income among the two counties has increased from an average $47,464.50 to $63,223 per year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. You can’t deny the numbers! Our Central Valley economy is on the rise thanks to pro-growth policies. I’m seeing it in my local business. There are more Valley job opportunities, and local incomes are growing. 
Nationwide, the number of Americans filing applications for new unemployment benefits has dropped to its lowest level since December 1969, and GDP growth – one of the most direct indicators of economic strength – outpaced optimistic projections, hitting 4.1 percent growth for the second quarter of this year. Our economy is on track to grow this year by more than 3 percent GDP for the first time in 13 years. I’m proud to say that our hard work is paying off, and I look forward to even more growth in the weeks, months and years again. 
Opioid epidemic bill signed into law Last week, President Donald Trump signed into law H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which I supported and includes over 90 U.S. House provisions to address the opioid crisis. It’s time we eliminate the stigma surrounding opioid addiction. This bill will provide treatment, keep our community safe and prevent future addictions across the Valley. 
Opioid abuse and deaths in the Central Valley have risen sharply in recent years. The number of deaths per year in San Joaquin County is significantly higher than the rest of the state, and Stanislaus County has more opioid prescriptions on file than there are people living in the county. H.R. 6 is the first comprehensive federal law to address the opioid crisis, and it empowers our healthcare and treatment systems, physicians, law enforcement, and community to fight this crisis head on. 
H.R. 6 helps fight the opioid crisis by: 
	1.	improving access to recovery centers;
	2.	encouraging non-addictive alternatives to treat pain and improving methods to identify at-risk patients;
	3.	providing law enforcement tools to remove drugs from our community; and
	4.	cracking down on foreign shipments of illicit drugs, such as fentanyl.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), over 116 people die every day from an opioid overdose. The policies set forth in H.R. 6 will protect American communities and families from the dangers of opioid addiction.   
TVT: My interview with Gold Star parents Julia and Scott Conover In honor of Military Families Month, this week’s Thank-a-Vet Thursday (#TVT) video features Julia and Scott Conover, parents of Lance Corporal Brandon Christopher Dewey, who was killed in action in Iraq in January 2006. 
Brandon Dewey enlisted in the Marine Corps at age 17, young enough that his mother had to sign him over to the military’s care. Brandon deployed twice to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, earning his first Purple Heart while protecting his base from a suicide bomber during his first tour in the battle of Fallujah; his second Purple Heart was awarded posthumously. 
For his service, Brandon was awarded two Purple Hearts, Combat Action Ribbon, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, National Defense Service Medal, and Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal. 
Brandon’s little sister, Elyse, followed in his footsteps, joining the U.S. Navy upon graduating from high school and volunteering for deployment to Afghanistan. 
This #TVT video is an excerpt from a longer interview for the Library of Congress’ Veterans History Project where Julie and Scott recount the moment when they were notified Brandon had been killed while serving his country. Visit my Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages to watch, or click here. 
My deepest and most heartfelt thanks go to Julia and Scott for sharing your family’s story.

Press Release of the Week: Rep. Loudermilk’s Bill to Increase Consumer Privacy and Modernize Financial Reporting Gains Support
 
 
Rep. Loudermilk's bill, the Financial Reporting Threshold Modernization Act, raises the currency transaction report (CTR) threshold from $10,000 to $30,000, which, in some instances, will reduce regulatory paperwork on small community banks and credit unions by almost 80 percent. 

Here's what some business associations are saying about the bill:

National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions: ""Credit unions are committed to combating criminal activity throughout our financial system. Representative Loudermilk’s bill will help ensure credit unions are able to focus more closely on catching illegal activity rather than being bogged down by stacks of paperwork and compliance exams. We thank Representative Loudermilk for his efforts to modernize the current BSA/AML regime.""

11/2/18 17:03,Say goodbye to shrinking seats - the SEAT Act is law! ,"￼
￼ ￼ ￼ 
November 2, 2018
Dear Friend,  As a military and general aviation pilot, flying is something I am passionate about and have always enjoyed. However, when I’m traveling as a passenger, I’ve noticed things have become quite cramped between the rows of seats on commercial airplanes and the width of the seats themselves seem smaller, too. In fact, two years ago my colleague and I looked into it and found out that the average distance between rows of seats has dropped from 35 inches to about 31 inches today, and the average width of an airline seat has shrunk from 18 inches to about 16.5 inches. These reductions have made air travel a hassle for passengers, but worse, they have made things far more dangerous and pose serious safety concerns in the event of an emergency. 
For these reasons, I was proud to introduce the SEAT Act, bipartisan legislation that ensures appropriate standards for legroom per seat and overall seat sizes, which will make air travel more enjoyable and safer for passengers. I was immensely proud to see the SEAT Act included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization that was signed into law on October 5, 2018.
With over 23,000 flights conducted every day in the United States, we must ensure standards are in place to provide safe and comfortable air travel for all passengers. It truly is an honor to represent you in the U.S. House of Representatives. Please do not hesitate to contact me if my office can be of assistance to you or your family.
Sincerely, 
￼

NEWS FROM THE FIRST DISTRICT
Dear Friends, 
Yesterday, I joined Senator Hassan and health care leaders at the Manchester Community Health Center to kick off the open enrollment period for marketplace health plans established by the Affordable Care Act. I encourage you to visit healthcare.gov to see if you can find a plan that’s right for you. Most people can find plans from $75 – $100. You might even find one that’s better than what you have now.  
I was pleased to see that the president signed the bipartisan water infrastructure bill into law last week. This legislation includes provisions I secured to dredge Hampton and Portsmouth Harbors. 
Remembering the victims of the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh 
Tomorrow morning will be the one-week anniversary of the Tree of Life shooting in Pittsburgh. I am devastated by this horrific violence and deeply worried about the rise of anti-Semitism and other acts of hatred in this country. I am grateful for the first responders who put themselves in harm’s way and for the good people who have come together to show their love and support for the Jewish community. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families, the Jewish community, and the people of Pittsburgh as they continue to mourn. We must stand together against hatred and those that incite it. 
Calling out corruption 
President Trump has given his administration a license to rip off American taxpayers. Special interests have been given unprecedented power, while Cabinet Secretaries abuse the trust taxpayers put in our government. Now, Interior Secretary Zinke is the subject of at least six ongoing ethics investigations, and one has been referred to the Department of Justice for a criminal review. Read more here. 
Hampton and Portsmouth Harbor dredging projects   
I am pleased that my provisions to dredge Portsmouth and Hampton Harbors have been signed into law. Hampton Harbor is our state’s largest commercial fishing port and is an important part of our Seacoast economy. It needs to be dredged as soon as possible, as severe shoaling has made it nearly impossible for vessels to enter or leave the harbor when the tides are low. I am also pleased that my provision to improve navigation in the Piscataqua River Basin is also now law. This project will expand the width of the turning basin, which will improve safety and help our local economy.
Kicking off ACA open enrollment 
When I ran a social services agency before Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act, I used to have to tell clients that we couldn’t help them with some of their conditions because they didn’t have health insurance. It was heartbreaking, and many Americans were suffering because they didn’t have insurance. While not perfect, the Affordable Care Act has changed so many people’s lives for the better. Health insurance has meant that more Americans can lead happier and healthier lives without the fear of bankruptcy or choosing between necessary expenses like food or rent and medical care if they get sick. In New Hampshire, most applicants will be able to sign up for a plan that costs $75 – $100. I encourage you to visit healthcare.gov even if you have insurance to see what’s available, because you may find a better plan than your current one. If you need assistance or have questions about plan options, you should visit localhelp.healthcare.gov.

Speaking to students in the UNH Women and Politics class 
I enjoyed speaking with UNH students in the Women and Politics class on Wednesday. I told them that women make up only 19% of the US House and only 300 have ever served, and that’s why we need more women to run for office. I encouraged the men and women to make their voices heard, and said a great way to do that is by voting for the candidates of their choice on Tuesday. 
￼ 
Visiting Great Bay National Wildlife Refuge 
I visited Great Bay National Wildlife Refuge to see the work they are doing to protect Great Bay from Pease-era contaminants and to learn about their efforts to save the New England Cottontail rabbits. When non-endangered rabbit species enter the controlled environment that the refuge is using to raise the endangered rabbits, the refuge has to release them. Here’s a little guy who seemed happy to hop away.

Meeting with leaders from New Hampshire’s Air National Guard and Army National Guard 
It was great to visit with leaders from the New Hampshire Air National Guard and Army National Guard in my DC office last week. I thanked them for all they do to protect our state and country.￼ 
Speaking at Breathe New Hampshire's Night of Thanks 
I spoke at Breathe New Hampshire's Night of Thanks about the importance of lung health. On the Armed Services Committee, I worked to protect servicemembers from toxic open air burn pits overseas. I also founded the Congressional Asthma and Allergy Caucus to raise awareness and to promote research and funding. Breathe New Hampshire promotes public health by focusing on issues related to lung health such as tobacco use, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), asthma, air quality, and lung cancer. Breathe New Hampshire provides educational programs, advocates for public health, and supports scientific research to prevent, eliminate, and treat lung disease.

Closing thoughts 
This week, I was happy to present Eliana Fleischer with the 2018 Congressional Award Bronze Medal that she earned. Among other achievements, Eliana started a nonprofit to collect orthopedic braces and redistribute them in developing countries. Well done!

Finally, TUESDAY IS ELECTION DAY. Click here for more information on where to vote in New Hampshire and how to register if you’re not registered already. Be counted! And make sure you get your family and friends out as well. As the great Granny D said, democracy is not something we have; it’s something we do!   Best Wishes, ￼  Carol Shea-Porter Member of Congress ￼￼

Open enrollment begins for health coverage under ACA 
WMUR // Ray Brewer 
MANCHESTER, N.H. — Now is the time to enroll for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, and health care advocates said enrolling can be a lifesaving decision. Open enrollment began Thursday and lasts for six weeks. At a news conference, health care advocates and elected officials said health insurance is affordable, and local health centers can help wade through any confusion in finding the right plan. U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, D-N.H., said her brother's life was saved because he had insurance. She said that after he got health insurance, he felt a pain in his back.

Union Leader // Kimberly Haas  
NEWINGTON - Work being done to help protect animals and birds living at Great Bay National Wildlife Refuge has been lauded by officials and preservationists. The 1,100-acre piece of land in Newington was once part of Pease Air Force Base. Since 1992, it has supported diverse habitats of plants and animals native to the Seacoast, including New Hampshire's greatest concentration of wintering bald eagles and several state-listed rare and endangered species.
Judge Bars New Hampshire Proof of Residency Requirement for New Voters 
Reuters 
A New Hampshire judge on Monday put on hold a law requiring some voters to present proof of residency when they register, saying it would lengthen lines at polling places and make it difficult for students, disabled voters and others to cast ballots. The temporary injunction against the Republican-backed law comes two weeks before U.S. Congressional elections that will determine whether opposition Democrats or U.S. President Donald Trump’s Republicans retain full control of the federal government’s legislative branch.
Delegation seeks study on PFAS and pediatric cancer 
Fosters // Jeff McMenemy 
PORTSMOUTH — The state’s congressional delegation is asking a national health agency to study the possible connection between a child’s exposure to PFAS chemicals and pediatric cancer. The delegation asked the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to “ensure that studies investigating the negative association between PFAS exposure and immune function include a focus on the chemicals’ connection with pediatric cancer.”
Protecting the press: Foley Run helps journalists stay safe

 A Stronger Houston & Economy 
 


Dear Neighbor,

This week, I was honored to visit Laura Ward to present her with a flag that was flown over the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. Laura has been an advocate for the children of Houston for over 30 years. She serves as the President and CEO of Houston Children's Charity (HCC), which serves underprivileged, abused and disabled children in our community.

￼
(L-R) Laura Ward, Congressman John Culberson, and Dave Ward  Since the creation of HCC in 1996, Laura has been responsible for providing money and operational support for over 300 agencies that have impacted over 3,500,000 children. The many programs offered through HCC touch nearly every aspect of our children’s lives, and the impact on our community is immeasurable. Laura’s dedication to serving and investing in our neighbors makes me proud to be a Houstonian. 
￼
The U.S. economy is now booming, with faster growth, higher wages, and more jobs for American workers. After eight years of a stagnant economy, we are now seeing a strong reversal, which is a direct result of the pro-growth policies and tax cuts that Congress passed last year.  Just look at some of the recent economic news:
	•	The U.S. economy grew at a strong annual rate of 3.5 percent in the third quarter of this year.
	•	Wages and salaries grew by 3.1 percent in the third quarter, “the biggest increase in a decade.”
	•	The unemployment rate is at 3.7 percent, its lowest rate in nearly 50 years.
	•	Consumer Confidence is at an 18-year high. 
Additionally, manufacturing continues its historic growth streak. According to the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), an indicator of the economic health of the manufacturing sectors, manufacturing has had 25 consecutive months of strong growth. Thanks to tax reform, the future for our manufacturers has changed for the better, across the nation and right here in the Seventh District of Texas. In fact, I was recently awarded the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence for my support of policies that promote economic growth, remove bureaucratic red tape, and help manufacturers expand. 
To let me know your thoughts on these or any other issues, you can email me here.
It is an honor and privilege to represent you and Texas in the United States House.
 Sincerely,   ￼  John Culberson

This week I went to Zagreb, Croatia on my last official overseas visit as a US Senator. I was invited by President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic who awarded me the “Order of Prince Branimir” ribbon for my “contributions to the independence of the Republic of Croatia and relations between the Croatian and American people,” one of the highest honors the nation of Croatia can bestow. As a young Senator, I had the opportunity to work with President Reagan to establish an independent Croatia after the Berlin Wall fell. The people of Croatia have always had a special place in my heart.

My friend Krešimir Cosic was a BYU basketball star and coach of the Yugoslav national basketball team in Zagreb, Yugoslavia. 
At an event hosted by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I was able to highlight Cosic’s work on behalf of Croatia and the Baltic region as we commemorated what would have been his 70th birthday.

This week, I also held productive meetings with Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic, President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, and Speaker of the Parliament Gordan Jandrokovic. Since working with President Reagan on the signing of the Dayton Accords, I have sought to strengthen the US-Croatia bilateral relationship and advance common political, military, commercial, and cultural priorities. I believe that building and maintaining strong relationships around the world is a critical part of keeping America safe and prosperous.

Dear Friend,
We have a responsibility as a community to make sure that seniors retire with dignity and with a respectable standard of living. That begins with preserving critical programs that were established to protect the health and well-being of our nation’s seniors – Social Security and Medicare.
For many retirees, Social Security is their only or primary source of retirement income. For others, it supplements additional sources of income, but regardless, it is a vital program that seniors paid into for decades and have every right to expect will be there to help them.
Similarly, Medicare plays a key role in providing health and financial security to millions of Americans who are over 65. It is easy to forget that almost half of all senior citizens were uninsured before Medicare was created. Today, it provides affordable, reliable, and comprehensive coverage to more than 5.5 million people in California alone.
Instead of working to strengthen these programs, Republicans in Congress have announced they plan to cut these programs to pay for the deficit-exploding tax cuts they passed this year for big corporations and wealthy families. In fact, just last month, Senator Mitch McConnell confirmed as much when he said:
“The three big entitlement programs that are very popular, Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid.… There’s been a bipartisan reluctance to tackle entitlement changes because of the popularity of those programs. Hopefully, at some point here, we’ll get serious about this.”
Here's the truth.
Republicans promised their tax cuts would “pay for themselves” – they knew that wasn’t true, but they said it anyway. They have now made it abundantly clear that they would like to make cuts to programs such as Medicare and Social Security to make up for the massive $1.5 trillion hole in our budget caused by the tax bill. This would be shocking were it not a further continuation of an unsustainable policy of cutting taxes for the wealthy, while targeting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for massive cuts.
I believe we have to protect Social Security and Medicare and strengthen them, not use them to pay for irresponsible tax giveaways.
I will do everything I can to oppose efforts to undermine Social Security and Medicare and the benefits that so many Americans depend on— and deserve. I remain committed to protecting these vital safety net programs for this generation, and for generations to come.
You can always share your thoughts through Facebook or Twitter. As always, I welcome hearing from you on these and any other issues, and hope that you will stay in touch.
All my best,
￼
Congressman Adam Schiff

Beatty Backs Decision Protecting Purged Ohioans’ Right to Vote
This week, the 6th U.S. Circuit of Appeals granted an emergency injunction suspending an October 10, 2018, decision by federal judge George Smith that authorized the State of Ohio to remove hundreds of thousands of voters from the rolls due to inactivity. As a result, previously purged Ohio voters will now have the opportunity to vote. Reacting to the Court’s ruling, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) issued the following statement:
“Although this week’s decision by the 6th Circuit of Appeals will not stop Ohio’s ongoing, aggressive purge, it does open the door for voters involuntarily removed from the rolls to cast their ballots and to have their voices heard. This election is one of the most important in generations, and I believe the federal government and states should be working to make it easier to vote, not harder. The right to vote is not a ‘use-it or lose-it’ proposition. Rather, voting is a permanent guarantee essential to the foundation of our democracy and fundamental to all the other rights we share as Americans.”
Congresswoman Beatty pledges to “fight to protect the vote” during a rally outside the Supreme Court. 
(January 10, 2018)

￼
Background  A 1994 Ohio state law authorizes the Ohio Secretary of State to implement a “supplementary process” to identify and purge voters who died, moved to other states, or otherwise lost voting eligibility. That “supplementary process” involves the Ohio Secretary of State producing a list of voters who go two years without voting activities (e.g. voting and/or updating their personal contact information) and sending those voters a notice. If that notice is not returned or the voter does not vote in the subsequent four years, then the voter is automatically struck from the rolls.  Independent analysis has found this policy to be especially harmful to at-risk Ohioans, people of color, veterans, and students—as these populations are less likely to have a longstanding, permanent address. One such example is decorated veteran and Mayor of Oak Harbor, Ohio, Joe Helle, who discovered he too was purged from the voter rolls when he attempted to vote recently.

Line 3 replacement project begins!

Dear Lindsey,
As both a member of the Education and Workforce and Transportation and Infrastructure committees, the maintenance of our great state’s infrastructure and the quality jobs infrastructure development supports are top priorities. 
After years of supporting the effort, I was incredibly pleased to see the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission recently issue a formal approval order for the Enbridge Line 3 replacement plan. I’ve long been a proponent of replacing the existing line with a newer, cleaner, and safer version, and it’s great to see this effort moving forward. Line 3 currently supports thousands of jobs in the Second District and maintains a steady supply of oil to Pine Bend refinery in Rosemount, which provides much of the fuel at MSP airport..
Built in the 1960’s, the current line has been in need of updates for years, and with a replacement plan solidified, we can address a long-overdue infrastructure project while also providing thousands of job opportunities for Minnesotans during construction and securing existing workers’ roles down the line.
My steady support for the Enbridge Line 3 replacement is only one example of my pro-labor and pro-infrastructure development agenda. I’m proud to work on behalf of members of the Second District to ensure quality infrastructure investment throughout the state while also fighting for job security and growth. This year we passed authorization for drinking water, waterway, aviation, and airport infrastructure. I am now focused on roads, rails, and pipes as our next biggest priorities.
As I work on this and other issues, I always like to hear directly from you.  Please share any thoughts you may have through my website, and sign up for my e-mail newsletter for the latest updates from Washington, D.C. and around the district. You can also stay on top of my work by following my Facebook and Twitter pages. Please feel free to call my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-2271 or my local Burnsville office at 651-846-2120 with any comments or for assistance with a federal agency.

Sincerely,

November 2, 2018

￼  
Remember to vote! Tuesday, Nov. 6, is Election Day! In Middle Tennessee, polls open at 7:00 AM and close at 7:00 PM. If you are in line by 7:00 PM, you will be allowed to vote! Find your polling location here! 
Tennessee leads nation in early voting totals compared to 2014 midterms A New York Times report out today states that Tennessee is leading the nation in early voting turnout numbers, outpacing the state’s 2014 midterm numbers by 95%. More Americans are taking advantage of absentee and early voting this year, with 28 million ballots already cast nationwide and four days of the campaign still to go. In 18 states and Washington, D.C., advance vote counts have already surpassed those of the last midterm election. 
+ Early voting ended yesterday, and turnout has more than doubled over the early vote turnout for the 2014 midterms. 1,378,840 votes have been cast so far, compared to 629,485 in 2014. It is now estimated the the overall turnout could be higher than 2.1 million by Election Day, which would be a mid-term record for the state. 
￼  
Affordable Care Act Marketplace is open from now until Dec. 15. Plans are cheaper across the state than last year, and most Tennesseans will have more plans to choose from. Click here to start shopping today!
+ Jim said, “It’s never been easier for Middle Tennesseans to sign up for health insurance! All the new and expanded options show the Affordable Care Act is working. Tennesseans have six weeks to choose the best plan for them.” 
 
New study finds number of uninsured Tennesseans is increasing According to a new study by the University of Tennessee, the uninsured rate in Tennessee has increased each of the last two years, and has risen approximately 10 percent in the past year alone. That means an additional 40,000 Tennesseans currently lack health insurance, bringing the total number of uninsured Tennesseans to around 451,000. The state legislature has still refused to expand Medicaid, which would cover almost a quarter million residents, dramatically cut our state’s uninsured rate, and stop rural hospitals from closing. 
￼  
Trump’s campaign immigration rhetoric criticized by Republicans President Trump continues to ramp up his anti-immigration rhetoric as the midterm election draws near. Most controversially, Trump announced that he would change birthright citizenship by executive order. Legal experts rejected that this constitutionally protected right can be changed by executive order, and Speaker Paul Ryan said that the president “obviously cannot do that.” Regarding Trump’s immigration rhetoric and recent proposals, Senator Bob Corker said, “We all know what’s happening. It’s all about revving up the base, using fear to stimulate people to come out at the polls.”
 
More than 7,000 Active Duty Troops to the Border The Pentagon has stated that more than 7,000 active-duty troops, mostly Army, will be sent to the Southwest border. Initial reports indicated less than half that number, but a Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were already 2,600 military personnel at staging bases across Texas, Arizona and will eventually move into California. The large majority of the tasked forces are engineering and logistical support units like the 887th Engineer Support Company out of the 101st Airborne from Fort Campbell. Additional personnel include military police, medical and public affairs experts. All active duty personnel are deploying in support of the Department of Homeland Security and will have strict Rules of Engagement that govern their actions. 
+ Jim joined more than 100 House Democrats in sending a letter opposing Trump’s decision to send additional troops to the border to Defense Secretary Mattis. The letter said, “This effort is nothing short of a militarization of the southern border to score political points and stoke misleading fears among Americans regarding immigrants. In addition, this decision negatively impacts the readiness of our military personnel who could be training to increase their effectiveness in line with their assigned missions and expertise.” 
￼  
U.S. calls for cease-fire in Yemen After three and a half years of conflict in Yemen, the U.S. and Britain are pressuring the parties to come to the table for peace talks within 30 days. The war in Yemen is the world’s worst man-made humanitarian disaster, and Saudi Arabia’s involvement is criticized as leading to some of the most devastating effects. The call for a cease-fire comes as the U.S.-Saudi Arabian relationship has deteriorated due to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
+ Jim has voted for a House bill denouncing the conflict in Yemen and calling on all parties to prevent casualties and allow humanitarian relief. Jim also signed a letter to our defense leaders requesting a briefing to answer questions on the situation in Yemen. This year’s defense bill also included several provisions related to Yemen, including prohibitions on in-flight fueling of Saudi-led coalition aircraft, and a report from the Defense Secretary on the U.S. strategy in Yemen.

Celebrating the Grygla Trail opening in Beltrami Island State Forest
 
Dear Friends,
 
While Congress was in recess, I was busy traveling the state visiting with folks on a number of issues important to Western Minnesota. On Tuesday, I celebrated the official opening of a new ATV trail connection near Grygla. Sportsmen in the area have long told me about the need to reconnect the state forest roads that were washed out by flooding in 2002, and I was able to negotiate with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Minnesota DNR to make that happen. We also received some great news up North with the timely approval of Digi-Key’s application for a Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) subzone status. I worked with the company to get the Administration to expedite Digi-Key’s application which will help the company and consumers alike. I have also been fighting on behalf of over 900 Minnesota farmers and landowners to reverse the Department of Agriculture’s decision to put a hold on making CRP payments where revisions or corrections to contracts are pending. After talking to Secretary Perdue and following up with farmers, I have been assured that USDA headquarters will send out word shortly that the local offices will be allowed to move forward and run these contracts through the computer system. I appreciate the working relationship that I have with Secretary Perdue and the Department, and I am happy that we were able to resolve this situation for landowners and producers in Minnesota as well as surrounding states.
 
Sincerely,
￼ Congressman Collin C. Peterson
Minnesota 7th District
 
Grygla Trail Ribbon Cutting Ceremony
￼
 
This week, I joined Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Commissioner Tom Landwehr, members of the Grygla-Fourtown Sportsmans Club, and the Roseau & Lake of the Woods Sportsmans Club to celebrate the official opening of the Dam 4 Trail Connection in Beltrami Island State Forest. This section of trail had been closed due to flooding in 2002. After negotiating a land exchange deal between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Minnesota DNR, we were able to get this section of trail opened for ATV and Recreational Off-highway Vehicle usage. I enjoyed celebrating the trail section opening with the clubs and riding the trail on both Polaris and Arctic Cat machines. It was great to see this long-term project completed, and I am pleased we could find a resolution for the area sportsmen and women that use our natural resources in this part of Minnesota.
 
Tariff Relief Approved for Digi-Key Corporation
In late August, Digi-Key Corporation applied for Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) subzone status at their Thief River Falls facility in response to escalating tariffs on electrical components. I wrote a letter to the Department of Commerce asking the agency to approve their application in an expedited manner. Facilities that receive FTZ status approval can achieve significant savings through reduced tariff payments and customs efficiencies. Final decisions on FTZ status applications usually take up to 90 days, but Digi-Key received their approval in about two months. Advocating on behalf of our rural Minnesota businesses is one of my most important responsibilities. Securing this timely and positive outcome for a bedrock manufacturing facility in northern Minnesota will benefit employees and customers alike.
 
Rick Trontvet, Vice President of Administration for Digi-Key Corporation, said, “Congressman Collin Peterson’s letter and voice of encouragement was no doubt a critical factor in our receiving such a prompt, affirmative response from the Department of Commerce. Approval of our FTZ was an important step and gave Digi-Key another tool for mitigating the impact of the recent China tariffs on our customer base.”
 
If you and your business have questions on seeking tariff relief, feel free to contact Zach Martin with my office at Zach.Martin@mail.house.gov for further information.
 
Action for Farmers with Delayed CRP Payments
On Thursday, I called on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) to allow FSA offices to make payments on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) contracts where modifications are pending. The agency made payments under similar circumstances in 2013 and should do so again this year. I spoke with USDA Secretary Perdue last week and he promised me this issue would be fixed. There are over 930 such cases across Minnesota, and folks depend on CRP payments to pay property taxes and other bills. I appreciate the working relationship that I have with Secretary Perdue and the Department, and I’m happy that we were able to resolve this situation for landowners and producers in Minnesota as well as surrounding states.
 
Northwest Manufacturers Celebration
￼
 
I attended the Northwest Region Minnesota Manufacturers Association meeting in Roseau this week. The organization awarded scholarships to winners of their annual essay contest and invited them to read their essays which described the impacts of manufacturing in their communities. With 28,739 jobs at 815 establishments, manufacturing is the second largest employing industry in the 26-county northwest Minnesota planning region. Manufacturing accounts for 13 percent of total employment in the Northwest, nearly 2 percent more concentrated than in the state as a whole. Minnesota’s manufacturing workers brought home the second-highest total wages of the state’s business sectors last year.
 
Redwood Area Rotary Club
￼
 
On Monday, I met with Redwood Area Rotary Club to share an update on the Farm Bill and answer questions from the group. Many of their questions were about the relationships between lawmakers in Washington. I told them that it’s not always an easy task to find common ground, but that I am willing to work with anyone I can to advance the issues that folks in the 7th District care about. It was a good meeting and I enjoyed my time spent with the Redwood Area Rotarians.
 
Dakota Immersion School
￼
 
This week, I visited the Cansayapi Wakanyeza Owayawa Oti, Lower Sioux Dakota Immersion Early Head Start and Head Start. Director Vanessa Goodthunder gave me a tour of the school and shared some of the school’s early successes. The facility just opened in August and is already full. Children are being prepared to be the next generation of Dakota language speakers by immersing students in their culture while assisting them with school readiness.
 
Peterson, Klobuchar, Smith Call on FEMA to Ensure Accurate Flood Mapping for Halstad and Hendrum
This week, I led a letter to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), along with Senators Klobuchar and Smith, urging the agency to delay issuing new preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps for Norman County until they have been updated to include the flood control projects currently underway. FEMA has the responsibility to ensure their flood mapping is accurate and considers the important work our communities are doing to protect against flood damage. By failing to incorporate upcoming flood protection projects, FEMA will place unnecessary flood insurance costs on households in the region. Including flood control projects on the new maps is a commonsense solution.
 
Halstad and Hendrum Mayors Lori DeLong and Curt Johannsen shared comments on the effort.
 
“Congressman Collin Peterson, Senator Amy Klobuchar, and Senator Tina Smith are true advocates for rural MN,” Mayor DeLong said. “Their support in asking FEMA to delay its Red River Valley Flood Plain mapping process will certainly have a positive impact for the City of Halstad. A FEMA decision to delay the mapping process will ensure our citizens are not subject to flood insurance requirements. The City of Halstad is currently in an active levee reconstruction project which is slated to be completed in the later of 2019 which will ensure FEMA recertification of the city levee system. With the delay of the mapping process and upon the completion of the levee reconstruction project, the City of Halstad can avoid any detrimental cost to its citizens. The City of Halstad truly appreciates the work and dedication of its United States Congress Representatives!”
 
“The citizens of the community of Hendrum greatly appreciate and are thankful for the efforts of Senator Amy Klobuchar, Senator Tina Smith, and Congressman Collin Peterson in assisting us with working with FEMA,” Mayor Johannsen said. “Senator Klobuchar, Senator Smith, and Congressman Peterson have always been there when the City of Hendrum, as well as others in the State of Minnesota, needed them. It is assuring to know that our federal delegation listens and stands up for all its constituents in Minnesota. Thank-you Senator Klobuchar, Senator Smith, and Congressman Peterson!”

Opioid Town Hall
￼
 
My staff attended an Opioid Town Hall meeting in New London hosted by the Kandiyohi County Drug Free Communities Coalition and the Dan Baker Foundation this week. These educational meetings help overcome the stigmas associated with addiction through panel discussions with experts. Combined efforts at the federal, state and local level are critical to combat this epidemic. I am hopeful that our efforts will not only make a difference for individuals and families but will make our communities better equipped to respond to addiction. On Tuesday, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) released a Rural Resource Guide to Help Communities Address Substance Use Disorders and Opioid Misuse.
 
Tour of Economic Development Projects in Marshall
￼
 
On Friday, my staff aide Jacki Anderson joined the Marshall Economic Development Authority (EDA) for a bus tour of past, present and future economic development projects including the newly designated federal Opportunity Zone. The tour featured investments from federal, state, local and private entities working to bring new opportunities to town including commercial development, new housing, recreational spaces and updated infrastructure.
 
USA Today’s America’s 50 Best Cities to Live 2018
Cities from across the country have been listed in this year’s America’s 50 Best Cities to Live by USA Today. There are many wonderful places to live in Western Minnesota, and this year two cities from the Seventh District, Thief River Falls and Hutchinson, were recognized by USA Today. These towns are home to many hard-working people and are seeing expansion through manufacturing and technical education. 
 
Thief River Falls is home to both Digi-Key and Textron corporations, one distributes electronic components and the other manufactures outdoor recreational vehicles. Digi-Key itself employs over 4,000 people and Arctic Cat employs 900. I recently advocated for Digi-Key’s status as a Foreign Trade Zone subzone to the Department of Commerce and I participated in the ground breaking of their expansion efforts last year. Textron was also kind enough to provide a few side-by-sides for the Dam 4 North Star Trail connection ribbon cutting ceremony earlier this week. Each of these industries are essential to Minnesota’s economy and for the community of Thief River Falls. I have also always appreciated Thief River’s commitment to the arts, from their renowned high school choir to their active community theater. They also are home to the Ralph Engelstad Arena, a world-class facility where you can watch hockey at all levels of play.
 
Hutchinson is a vibrant community with a growing economy. I have advocated for the construction of the Harmony River Living Center, which will provide care for senior citizens. As a former 4-H kid, I make sure to attend the McLeod County Fair to and visit with local 4-H students every year. I have also toured the Hutchinson High School’s Tiger Path Initiative. One of only a few in Minnesota, the high school has partnered with local industries to provide students with the technical skills needed for today’s workplace needs.
 
I wish to congratulate Thief River Falls and Hutchinson for creating great places to live. I am proud to represent these communities in Washington.

2018-2019 Federal Duck Stamp
￼
Bob Hautman’s winning Duck Stamp // the first Duck Stamp
 
Artist Bob Hautman from Delano painted this year’s winning entry, depicting a pair of alighting mallards. Bob has now won the federal contest 3 times with his latest success. Bob’s two brothers, Jim and Joe, are also artists and avid duck hunters. The 3 brothers have collectively won the contest 9 times. Ducks Unlimited partnered with the brothers this year to highlight their art and send them hunting in North Dakota.
 
The Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp was first printed in 1934, and purchasing one is a requirement to hunt migratory game birds. The program has raised over $1 billion dollars since its inception, and the funds help acquire and protect over 6 million acres for the National Wildlife Refuge System. Folks in Washington gathered this week to celebrate the Duck Stamp Program with a gathering hosted by Ducks Unlimited and the USA Rice Federation. The Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Program is an important tool for protecting wildlife habitat and creating sustainable and healthy bird populations across the country, so hunters can continue this American pastime.

Father Lucien Galtier and his log church
 
On November 1, 1841, Father Lucien Galtier dedicated his log church to ""St. Paul, the apostle of nations."" This name was deemed superior to ""Pig's Eye,"" the community's previous title. St. Paul would be incorporated as a town on the same date in 1849. The log structure later served as the first school of the Sisters of St. Joseph, and in 1856 its logs were dismantled, numbered, and hauled up the hill to the St. Joseph's Academy construction site. Unfortunately, the plan to rebuild the chapel as a historic site had not been communicated to the workmen, who used the logs to warm themselves and their coffee.
 
What’s the Story?

Based in Karlstad, Mattracks produces rubber track conversion systems for 4x4 vehicles including ATV’s, trucks and agricultural vehicles. The conversion allows vehicles to utilize tracks for movement, enabling them to cross difficult terrain that could cause problems for wheeled vehicles. Mattracks has sold products in over 100 countries since becoming publicly available in 1994. They have also been featured in films including Terminator 3, Fast & Furious 8, and the James Bond film Spectre. I display photos of their innovative products in my Washington, D.C. office.

Dear  ,  I wanted to take time this week to reflect on the events of last weekend, and provide you with some updates from my travels around eastern Connecticut. 
￼  Congressman Courtney attends a Prayer Service and Memorial at Temple Emanu-El 
A Week of Reflection, Healing, and Action
On Monday night, I joined the southeastern Connecticut community at Temple Emanu-El in Waterford to mourn the victims of the heinous attack at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh and to start healing as a community. I am thankful to Rabbi Marc Ekstrand, his congregation, and the Jewish Federation of Eastern Connecticut for hosting such a meaningful service of harmony and unity.  
All over the district, I've heard from constituents who are aghast at the violence that was on display this past weekend in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, this incident is just one of many that have been targeted at the Jewish community in an increasingly anti-Semitic environment in our country. According to the Anti-Defamation League, since the 2016 election, anti-Semitism and harassment have become far more commonplace. Just last year, white supremacists felt emboldened to march with torches in Charlottesville, Virginia chanting anti-Semitic hate speech and incidents of anti-Semitic graffiti and slurs have increased significantly at schools, cemeteries, and houses of worship. In 2017, the Anti-Defamation League saw a 57% increase in anti-Semitic incidents in the United States since the previous year. In Connecticut, anti-Semitic incidents in 2017 were double the number reported in 2016. This is unacceptable. 
It is more important than ever that those in positions of power speak out - and make clear to the Jewish community and all Americans that these acts are not - and will not - be tolerated in our country. Members of Congress and those who hold our nation’s highest offices must condemn conspiracy theories and hate speech that lead to this type of violence. It is also essential that we work across the aisle to prevent additional tragedies due to the proliferation of gun violence in our country. Enough is enough.

Earlier this week, I had the chance to stop by a job fair in Mystic hosted by the Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce. The event included a long list of community partners and employers, including Foxwoods, Electric Boat, Groton Public Schools, and several small manufacturers. 
After visiting the job fair, I joined the Chamber’s panel discussion on workforce development and housing needs in eastern Connecticut. This panel was a great opportunity to discuss the major uptick in job training, employment, and housing needs in our region. Major increases in hiring at Electric Boat and suppliers in eastern Connecticut will in turn lead to more urban development and a boost in the housing market. 
One such defense manufacturer in the region in Alpha Q, Inc. - a local aerospace manufacturer in Colchester and a recent participant in September’s U.S.-Australia Defense Summit that took place in Mystic. Alpha Q manufactures large parts for companies like Sikorsky, Rolls Royce, and UTC Aerospace Systems. During my visit, I met with employees, toured the facility, and learned about their advanced aerospace manufacturing technology. Like many companies around the region, Alpha Q is in the process of hiring new employees and massively expanding its floor space. 
Throughout the last month, I got the chance to tour so many manufacturers, workforce training programs, and community college programs for manufacturing - and eastern Connecticut has built an incredible model for other parts of the country to look to. I’m excited to highlight the successes of workforce development investments in eastern Connecticut when Congress gavels back into session this fall.

Thank You Willie!

This week, San Franciscans and baseball fans all across America mourn the passage of a true legend of the game.  Willie McCovey was a titan on and off the field. From his humble beginnings in the segregated South to his induction to Major League Baseball’s Hall of Fame, Willie McCovey lived the American Dream.  He earned international renown for his talent and leadership.  For decades after he retired, Willie’s community service earned the devotion of generations of San Franciscans.  That the San Francisco Giants’ annual most inspirational player award is named for Willie McCovey is a lasting testament to his joy, generosity of spirit, and optimism.
￼ 
We will carry Willie in our hearts, and honor his memory every time the Giants drive a home run into McCovey Cove.  May it be a comfort to Willie’s wife Estela and the entire McCovey family that our whole city, and so many more across the country, join in mourning this extraordinary man.
Enough is Enough  
This past weekend, all Americans were horrified and heartbroken by the brutal mass shooting in Pittsburgh. To have such an unspeakable anti-Semitic hate crime visited on a place of sanctuary and prayer magnifies the pain of that awful day. 
￼ 
Congresswoman Pelosi joined Stephen Colbert this week to talk about the President’s divisive rhetoric and Democrats’ For The People agenda. 
As ever, we are deeply grateful for the selfless heroism of the first responders who rushed into harm’s way to save lives. We pray for them, for those wounded, and for the loved ones of those who were killed on that dark morning. But thoughts and prayers are not enough – Congress must finally act on commonsense, bipartisan gun violence prevention legislation. As Members of Congress, we take a solemn oath to support and defend the Constitution and protect the American people. On Sunday, we marked 9 years since President Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act under a Democratic Congress. In contrast, this GOP Congress has consistently turned a blind eye to domestic terrorism. The vast majority of the American people believe in commonsense reforms to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill. 
Democrats are committed to saving lives and working to restore confidence in the safety of our communities with deliberate and concrete steps to prevent gun violence. We share in the grief of the Tree of Life congregation and of the entire Pittsburgh community.  May it be a comfort that so many across the country mourn with them at this tragic time.

Around the District 

 
I wanted to take this week’s EC from DC to say thanks for the opportunity to meet with many of you this month while Congress is in recess. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting with business and charitable organizations, students and educators, and just meeting with constituents in the Fifth District.
It was truly an honor to speak to young men at Metropolitan Community College for the “Am I My Brother’s Keeper” Conference. The purpose was to empower high school minority men from across the district to build each other up and be a part of the organization.

I have no doubt that these young men will make their mark on the world. 
 
￼
I spent some time this week, speaking with experts about Missouri’s risk and recovery efforts should a disaster occur in our state. We discussed many topics related to climate change and natural disasters at the annual Community Recovery and Resilience Leadership Forum in Kansas City. We’ve all witnessed mother nature’s wrath of recent. We should be even more concerned about preparation and prevention.  
I had the chance to visit with business leaders in the northland at the Clay County Economic Development Council discussing opportunities for affordable housing and business development. It was also great to meet with Governor Parson at this event.
Thanks for the opportunity to catch up with friends and colleagues at the annual Northland Neighborhoods, Inc. Annual Awards Banquet.
 ￼    ￼
I also spent time with the Chambers of Commerce from several municipalities in my district. Thank you, Independence, Lee’s Summit, Raytown, Blue Springs, Grain Valley and Oak Grove Chambers.   What an honor to attend Kansas City Metro’s Annual Law Enforcement Appreciation Luncheon. I am immensely grateful to the brave men and women who work so hard to keep our community safe.

Warmly,

Dear Friend, 
This week, I wrote to President Trump and to the state attorneys general who are suing the federal government to allow insurance companies to deny coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions and called upon them to drop their litigation and for the President to defend the Affordable Care Act. I also took note of Thursday’s start of an abbreviated open enrollment period for 2019 HealthCare.gov plans, called for emergency hearings on hate crimes after the recent murders in a Pittsburgh synagogue, talked about the Music Modernization Act and other federal policy concerns with the Memphis chapter of the Recording Academy, expressed concern about a series of recent false statements from the President, invited veterans to my annual Veterans Day event, planned to hold a November “Congress On Your Corner,” offered constituents U.S. Capitol Historical Society calendars and suggested a health tip about Halloween candy and safe storage of medication. Keep reading to learn more about my week and follow me on Twitter and Facebook to see more updates as they happen.

Protecting Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions 
On Tuesday, I joined Congressional colleagues in sending letters to President Trump, 18 state attorneys general -- including Tennessee Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III -- and two governors who are suing the federal government in Texas v. United States. The letters call on them to drop pending litigation that seeks to allow insurance companies to deny health insurance coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions.  
The letters note that both the President and the Senate Majority Leader now claim they are fully supportive of coverage for pre-existing conditions despite years of effort by them to kill or weaken the 2010 Affordable Care Act that guarantees those protections.  President Trump’s Department of Justice has refused to intervene to uphold those protections. Trump-aligned state attorneys general, including Tennessee’s, are still advancing litigation that, if successful, would end those protections. If they’re serious about their newfound position, they should call for this litigation to be dropped. 
  
Flagging Open Enrollment Now Available at HealthCare.gov 
￼ 
Thursday was the first day of open enrollment for 2019 HealthCare.gov insurance plans. This year, open enrollment runs only through December 15. I will be making use of every possible means to make my constituents aware that the time available to sign up has been limited again this year compared to the enrollment periods during the Obama Administration -- six weeks shorter than it was in 2016. For more information on signing up for health care, see Healthcare.gov. 
Calling for Emergency Hearings on Hate Crimes and Domestic Terrorism 

On Monday, as the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, I joined House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jerrold Nadler and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee in sending a letter to Chairman Bob Goodlatte calling for emergency hearings on hate crimes and domestic terrorism in the wake of recent killings by individuals with white supremacist views. Our letter comes after 11 people were murdered at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, explosive devices were sent to more than a dozen public figures critical of President Trump, and two African Americans were killed at a supermarket in Jeffersontown, Kentucky after the shooter attempted to enter a predominately black church. The American people deserve hearings so that right-wing extremists and those with neo-Nazi and white supremacist views are exposed for the dangerous threat they pose to our liberties.   

Talking Music with Memphis Chapter of the Recording Academy 
 .￼

On Wednesday, I was honored to receive the Memphis Recording Academy’s “Champion of Music” citation at a gathering at David Porter’s Made in Memphis Entertainment Studio. The Memphis recording professionals thanked me for my work on the Judiciary Committee that helped lead to passage of the Music Modernization Act in September. The new law updates provisions of federal copyright law to account for the transformation of the music industry by the internet, music streaming and smart phones. It also expands federal copyright protection to pre-1972 sound recordings to ensure that legacy artists, including many in Memphis, are appropriately compensated for the use of their work. The Music Modernization Act contains elements of the Compensating Legacy Artists for their Songs, Service and Important Contributions to Society (CLASSICS) Act, which I cosponsored, that will resolve uncertainties over copyright protections for certain pre-1972 sound recordings and clarify digital royalties for pre-1972 sound recordings. The Recording Academy members also wanted to talk about the Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement (CASE) Act (H.R. 3945) that I have cosponsored and asked me to stay committed to funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and music education programs, which I have long supported. 

Expressing Concern about the President’s False Statements 
￼ 

While a group of migrants who are seeking asylum and fleeing unspeakable conditions in their Central American countries was more than 1,000 miles from the U.S. border, President Trump declared it an “invasion” and dramatically but needlessly called out active duty soldiers to stop it. A few days later, he said the middle class would get a 10 percent tax cut before the Midterm elections despite the fact Congress isn’t in session until after those elections. Then the President declared he had the authority to end birthright citizenship, enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment, by executive order. None of these statements are true. As I told CNN's Wolf Blizer this afternoon, the President ""shouldn't engage in fantasy, falsehoods and fabrications."" This kind of serial dishonesty needs to be called out.  

Remembering Attorney Marvin Ballin 

On Wednesday, I attended the Baron Hirsch Synagogue services for Marvin Ballin, a great lawyer who was loved around the courthouse for his storytelling and for the advice he offered. Marvin stood up for people who needed a voice when they otherwise wouldn’t have one. In eulogies by his son and law partner Leslie Ballin, his law partner Randy Fishman and his grandson and law partner Blake Ballin,  his hard work for his clients, his family and his community were celebrated. Marvin Ballin was a special person, a special lawyer and a special Memphian. His was a life well lived, and he will be missed.
Inviting Vets to My Annual Veterans Day Event 

￼ 
Words cannot adequately express the gratitude our nation owes its military veterans for their dedication to our country and the sacrifices they have made. My annual Veterans Day gathering is a time to thank them and their families and enjoy some barbecue while we discuss veterans issues. My 10th Annual Veterans Day Meeting and Barbecue Luncheon will be held on Monday, November 12, from noon to 2 p.m. at the Kroc Center of Memphis – Hardin Hall, 800 East Parkway South. Vets please RSVP by Thursday, November 8 at (901) 544-4131.  
Holding My Next “Congress On Your Corner” 

My Memphis staff and I will hold an evening “Congress On Your Corner” for those who can’t make our daytime events, on Monday, November 26, at the Benjamin Hooks Central Library, 3030 Poplar, from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m.  As your representative in Congress, part of my job is making sure your concerns and issues with federal agencies and federal benefits are dealt with fairly and expeditiously. We can help with Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits and military service issues, Small Business Administration (SBA) loans and services, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) home loans, federal grant applications, visas and passports, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issues and more.  
Offering U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars 

￼ 
My office will soon have a limited number of 2019 U.S. Capitol Historical Society calendars available. If you would like to receive a calendar, please complete this formon my website. Due to the rules of the House, I can mail calendars only to residents of Tennessee’s 9th Congressional District. Please feel free to share this email with other residents of the 9th District who may be interested in receiving one but who do not receive my e-Newsletter. 
Signing Up for “Congress On Your Corner” and this e-Newsletter

￼ 
I enjoy meeting regularly with constituents in the district and helping get answers for them to questions about dealing with federal agencies. If you are interested in attending one of my “Congress on Your Corner” events, you can sign up here to receive notification as soon as the next event is scheduled. 
For those who haven’t participated in a telephone town hall, it’s easy to sign up for them by using this form.   
If you would like to receive this weekly e-Newsletter, or share it with others, you can do that with this form. 
Weekly Health Tip 

￼ 
Each week, I share a health tip in the hope of promoting a healthy lifestyle for residents of the 9th Congressional District. As always, it is best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine or lifestyle. 
After Halloween, you might find that you have a lot of loose candy and gum drops around the house. Some pills and capsules of medicine can look like candy, especially to young children, so my tip this week comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Keep your prescription and over-the-counter medications up and out of the reach of children and make sure safety caps are locked. See details here. 
Quote of the Week   
￼ 

Rabbi Jacob Rothschild and Atlanta Mayor William Hartsfield in the rubble of the bombed-out synagogue, October 1958. 
Just before dawn on October 12, 1958, a dynamite blast ripped a hole in the wall of The Temple synagogue on Peachtree Street in Atlanta. Those responsible called themselves the Confederate Underground. The bombing was in retaliation for Senior Rabbi Jacob Rothschild’s outspoken support for racial equality. The next day, Ralph McGill, the legendary editor and publisher of The Atlanta Constitution, published a front page editorial. 
“This is a harvest. It is the crop of things sown. It is the harvest of defiance of courts and the encouragement of citizens to defy law on the part of many Southern politicians…It is not possible to preach lawlessness and restrict it…Let it be understood that when leadership in high places in any degree fails to support constituted authority, it opens the gates to all those who wish to take law into their hands…You do not preach and encourage hatred for the Negro and hope to restrict it to that field. It is an old, old story. It is one repeated over and over again in history. When the wolves of hate are loosed on one people, then no one is safe…For a long time now it has been needful for all Americans to stand up and be counted on the side of law and the due process of law – even when to do so goes against personal beliefs and emotions. It is late. But there is yet time.” 

As always, I remain 
Most Sincerely,

Jobs & Economy Report 
￼
Courtesy, Senate Republican Policy Committee
Top Story - Our economy is red hot
The headlines keep pouring in showing that our economy is booming! Here are just a few:
U.S. add 250,000 jobs in October, wages rise at fastest pace in more than nine years  Unemployment rate falls to 3.7 percent, lowest since 1969
US economy keeps growing strong at 3.5% in the third quarter
Consumer confidence is at its highest level since 2000
U.S. Is World’s Most Competitive Economy for First Time in a Decade
Surging economy bolstered by lower taxes, fewer regulations
I supported the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and canceling several regulations from the Obama Administration because I thought doing so would jumpstart our underperforming economy—and that is exactly what is happening!
The average Montanan is keeping more than $1,000 of your hard-earned money under the tax relief, helping you to pay bills and invest in your family’s future. And small businesses across Montana and our country are hiring new workers, increasing wages, and making investments that will allow them to grow.
Simply put, these pro-growth policies have increased the take home pay of most Montana families and generated renewed economic prosperity across our country.
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act – Did you Know?
Through its Opportunity Zone Program, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is helping 25 low-income communities in Montana create jobs and boost wages. In exchange for a lower capital gains rate that decreases based on the length of the investment, investors can put those unused dollars to work in Opportunity Zones. This new program will help these Montana communities flourish!  
Survey:
Do you believe keeping taxes low and reducing harmful regulations is important to sustaining our economic prosperity?

Senator Maggie Hassan  
See below for highlights of my week fighting for the priorities of Granite Staters.
Visit my website for more updates at Hassan.Senate.Gov. 

This Week: Kicking Off the Open Enrollment Period for Marketplace Health Insurance Coverage

Granite Staters, it's time to get covered. From now until December 15, you can go to healthcare.gov and explore the best options for health insurance coverage for you and your family. You can also visit my website at hassan.senate.gov/get-covered to find out more information on how to take advantage of open enrollment. 
￼ 
This week, I joined with stakeholders from around New Hampshire to remind everyone to take advantage of the open enrollment period to shop around and get covered ahead of the deadline. Even if you already have a plan through healthcare.gov, it’s still important to take a look at what’s available because plans and costs may have changed. You can watch a video from our press conference here. 
This week, Senator Shaheen and I wrote an op-ed on our efforts to lower the cost of health care for Granite Staters, including addressing surprise medical bills. 
It's an outrage that consumers face massive surprise medical bills for care they thought was covered by their insurance. One Granite Stater wrote to me about how she had gone into the ER for kidney stones, paid according to her in-network insurance requirements, but then months later received a surprise medical bill because the radiologist she saw was out of network – even though the hospital was in-network. 
You can read our op-ed here. 
If you have had an experience with surprise medical bills, you can share it by filling out this form or emailing your story to healthstories@hassan.senate.gov. Sharing your story will help inform policy to prevent future surprise medical bills. Please note if you provide your personal story, it may be shared publicly. 
I also had the opportunity to meet with businesses and students across New Hampshire this week. 
￼ 
I visited Titeflex Aerospace to hear from employees about the work they do to develop innovative products here in New Hampshire that help bolster our national security and keep our country safe. 
I also stopped by Woodbury School in Salem for the annual Veterans Day Ceremony. This event helps instill in our young people the importance of honoring our brave veterans and their families for all that they have sacrificed for our country and our freedom. 
￼ 
I also visited Plymouth State University this morning for the ribbon-cutting for the new offices for the TRIO Student Support Services. The TRIO program plays an important role in helping our young people succeed in college and ultimately graduate, particularly those students who are low-income, first generation college students, or who experience disabilities. 
￼ 
It was also great to see so many students who are taking a step forward in preparing for their futures and getting the tools they need to pursue a postsecondary education while I was at the GEAR UP College Road Show hosted at Plymouth State. With their talent and energy, these young people are poised to lead our state in the 21st century innovation economy, and I look forward to seeing all that they accomplish. 
￼ 
Our office hot dog Piper also hopes everyone had a happy and safe Halloween this year!

UPDATE FROM HAL: Autumn 2018
Dear Friends, 
This autumn has been filled with great news for Southern and Eastern Kentucky, including more jobs, a stronger workforce, better care for our veterans and improved access to treatment and recovery options for people struggling with addiction. 
Discussing Appalachia's Workforce with Ivanka Trump 
It was an honor to join Governor Matt Bevin to welcome Ivanka Trump to Eastern Kentucky last week. She graciously spent time meeting with local businesses, employees and students in Prestonsburg, Paintsville and Morehead to discuss successful certification programs and educational workforce advancements in our rural region.
￼
Addressing Healthcare Workforce Needs 
Last month, I convened a think-tank in Morehead, Kentucky to pinpoint the healthcare workforce needs in our region and find a solution. Two dozen top administrators from our hospitals, colleges and universities located in Southern and Eastern Kentucky joined me for a roundtable discussion about preparing and aligning students for nursing jobs and other healthcare positions that we lack in Kentucky's Appalachian region. Leaders from several federal agencies joined us for the discussion to discuss competitive grant funding options, including Tim Thomas, Federal Co-Chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC); Pamela Farmer, Kentucky Economic Development Representative for the Economic Development Administration; and Clay McKnight, Kentucky Area Specialist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Rural Development. Click here for more information. 
￼
Preparing for Military and Automotive Contracts in Eastern Kentucky 
Two dozen local employers met with federal contractors from the military and automotive industry in Corbin in October to learn how to be more competitive when applying for federal contracts. It was part of the 2018 Supplier Education Economic Development (SEED) Symposium hosted by the Southeast Kentucky Economic Development Corporation (SKED). To learn more, visit southeastkentucky.com.
￼
Preparing Our Industrial Parks for More Jobs
I had the honor of announcing nearly $10 million in federal funding this month for infrastructure and economic development projects at industrial sites across Southern and Eastern Kentucky. I joined state and local leaders to break ground on a new natural gas line in Perry County, a new water tower in Laurel County, and announced the next step in site preparation for Braidy Industries in Carter County. In Harlan County, we celebrated the grand opening of a new airport terminal, as well as tourism improvements at Portal 31 and on Black Mountain at Kentucky's highest point.

Improving Care for our Veterans
In September, President Trump signed into law the federal spending package passed by Congress providing historic funding for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with $98.1 billion for fiscal year 2019. The bill funds the new VA electronic health record, boosts funding for critical medical services, and directs the VA to further reduce the backlog of disability claims to ensure adequate compensation and care for the almost 450,000 veterans still awaiting final decisions on their claims.
Veterans in the Lake Cumberland area will also now benefit from a new state-of-the-art expanded VA Clinic in Somerset with access to new services right here at home. I was honored to be the keynote speaker for the grand opening celebration where I met David Elder, a 95-year-old World War II Army veteran. I consider this clinic just a down payment on the debt we owe to Mr. Elder and all those who served our nation.

Making Strides in the Battle Against Drug Abuse
I was pleased to read a recent report in the Herald Leader marking a reduction in overdose deaths in Eastern Kentucky. In fact, several counties have seen overdose death rates cut in half. That news gives hope to families and those suffering with addiction. It is also a testament to the tremendous work driven by Operation UNITE and the non-profit organization's community coalitions across the region who have championed life-saving efforts in the epicenter of the nation's drug abuse epidemic. However, we must remain vigilant in our efforts as nearly 200 people die every day from drug overdose deaths in America.
To further aid efforts to combat the nation's drug abuse crisis, President Trump recently signed landmark legislation passed by Congress called the Support for Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6). The new law will advance treatment and recovery initiatives, improve prevention, combat deadly synthetic drugs like fentanyl from coming across our borders, while also addressing gaps in insurance coverage for pregnant mothers with substance use disorders.
It will help programs like Karen's Place Maternity Center operated by Addiction Recovery Care in Louisa, SKY Hope Women's Recovery Center in Somerset, and Grace Health's Women's Care facility in Corbin where women are getting the medical care and support they need, close to home. As I visited those three facilities last month, I was inspired by all the women persevering through their recovery journey, as well as the number of health care professionals and support staff who have made it a mission to help women and their families find hope and the medical care they need. Together, we are making a difference and we must continue the fight.

Strengthening our North Country Economy 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 250,000 jobs were created in October – further proof of the strong state of our economy. In Congress, one of my top priorities has been growing our economy and helping North Country businesses create well-paying jobs. I am pleased that these strong national economic trends continue to reach the North Country. Since coming to Congress, unemployment in all twelve counties I represent has fallen.
I have prioritized growing our economy by working to roll back burdensome regulations; passing new laws to strengthen our career and technical education programs; increasing access to rural broadband; and continuing to advocate for increased trade and tourism for our region. In Congress, I will continue to make growing our economy my top priority. 
Veteran of the Year 
￼ 
It was an honor to present a Congressional Proclamation to recognize Lieutenant Col. (ret.) Nicholas M. Laiacona for being named Veteran of the Year at the New York State Military Museum in Saratoga. Mr. Laiacona served our country in the Army for 24 years, which included service in Vietnam. We’re grateful for his distinguished service and his continued advocacy for our veterans. Click here to read more about the Veteran of the Year event in the Saratogian. 
Sharing the Stories of North Country Veterans 
￼ 
The North Country is steeped in rich military tradition and is home to some of the bravest patriots this country has ever known. On Veterans Day, Americans across the country pause to honor those who have served, but their sacrifice is so much bigger than just one day. Throughout November, I’ll be sharing stories and photos from North Country veterans on my website and social media to honor those who served. For more information on how you can submit your story or the stories of loved ones, click here. 
Recognizing Family Caregivers 
￼ 
In our district and in communities across our nation, family caregivers devote their lives to giving their loved ones the best possible healthcare. During National Family Caregivers Month, we pay tribute to those who stand by the elderly, the disabled, and individuals who are terminally ill. This Congress, I helped the House pass the RAISE Family Caregivers Act – now law – to direct our Federal government to develop a strategy for supporting the vital work of family caregivers. Click here to read more.

Dear Lindsey, 
Standing Up Against Hate 
My heart breaks for the lives lost and the families and loved ones of those killed in the unthinkable act of violence that occurred at the Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue last Saturday. This barbaric attack against the Jewish community is an affront to our core values as Americans. My thoughts remain with those wounded and the brave law enforcement officers who responded to this tragedy. This is a time for all of us to come together as Americans to stand up against the forces of hate and bigotry. We cannot allow violence and hate to become normalized and must focus on what unites us all; love for peace, respect, and inclusion.
Getting the Healthcare You Need 
Despite numerous attempts by Congressional Republicans to repeal and weaken the Affordable Care Act, it remains the law of the land. If you need health insurance or wish to change your current plan, please take advantage of the 2019 Open Enrollment period, which lasts from now until December 15th. To view different coverage options and pick the plan that works best for you and your family, visit www.healthcare.gov.

Joining Forces to Combat the Opioid Crisis 
On Friday, I joined with Senators Shaheen and Hassan, along with Congresswoman Shea-Porter and members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation, to applaud the award of $2.95 million to the Massachusetts Attorney General’s office in support of partnerships between Massachusetts and New Hampshire law enforcement to investigate and interdict narcotics, including heroin and fentanyl. Drug trafficking knows no borders, which is why partnerships across state lines are so important to keeping drugs off our streets. This award is a vote of confidence in our law enforcement, who do such a tremendous job protecting our communities and need all the help they can get as they fight on the frontlines of the opioid crisis. I’ll continue to work with my colleagues and do everything I can to secure resources and provide tools to those who are fighting to end this epidemic.
Serving You 
As your Representative, my most important job is supporting Granite Staters when they need help with federal agencies. I was contacted by Deb Black of Grafton, who had an issue regarding a payment to the Social Security Administration (SSA). My staff worked with the SSA and helped resolve Debbie’s situation. If my office may be of assistance with a problem you are experiencing, please reach out to my staff at 603-226-1002 so we can learn how we may help.
It is more important than ever to be involved in our democratic process and make your voice heard. If you have any questions, concerns or ideas, please do not hesitate to reach out to any of my offices. Thank you for everything you do to make New Hampshire such a special place to call home. Enjoy your weekend!

Friends,  
  
This week I was honored to join KSU and Sen. Moran in welcoming our USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue to the wheat state. It is always great to have the leading voice on Ag in the White House meeting with Kansans. 
While I wholeheartedly understand the tough times our producers have been up against, I know that Sec. Perdue, myself, and other Ag leaders are fighting hard in Washington to secure new markets, and see this Farm Bill to the finish line.   In other news, today the Department of Labor released the October jobs numbers. The economy added 250,000 jobs in October, up from 118,000 in September, and the unemployment rate came in at 3.7 percent, the lowest since 1969! The unemployment rate in Kansas has fallen by 0.8 percent to their lowest level since 1999.   There's no denying that this Congress and Administration has unleashed this economy with our pro-growth policies. I am working around the clock to make sure our Farm economy also reaps these same economic benefits. 
  
￼
Lastly, I hope you all had a safe Halloween, trick or treating with your loved ones. My grandson surely enjoyed the candy and treats in their superhero costumes!

KSU welcomes USDA Sec. Perdue
￼
It was a pleasure to welcome U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue back to Manhattan on Thursday as the featured speaker for the esteemed Kansas State University Landon Lecture Series.   Secretary Perdue shared the lessons and principals he learned growing up on a farm in Georgia, which included: stewardship and responsibility; trust and faith; and optimism. Today he uses those same guiding principals to serve our nation's farmers and ranchers. In his lecture, he reiterated his commitment to making the USDA more user-friendly and effective to better serve its rural customers.  The USDA's work has a significant impact on my district, for both farmers and the numerous rural communities across the Big First.  I couldn't be more proud of the work he has done and continues to do at the USDA. 
Rolling back the red tape on our nursing
homes.
During my time as a physician in Great Bend, Kansas I saw the struggles many skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) were facing due to illogical and burdensome regulations. One particular regulation has kept SNFs from training new Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) – an already depleted workforce. This rule mandated if facility accumulates fines over $10,000, whether or not those fines had anything to do with their CNA training program, CNAs could not be trained there.  While it is absolutely important to monitor the quality of care for our loved ones in these nursing facilities, providing these practices with an adequate workforce is just as crucial for their safety and comfort. I am honored to have signed onto HR 6986, the Nursing Home Workforce Quality Act, that will update these regulations and ensure a strong CNA workforce in our assisted living facilities.

SERVING YOU  |  MEDIA CENTER  |  LEGISLATIVE WORK  |  OUR DISTRICT
 
November 2, 2018
 
 
 Dear Friend,   11 innocent people lost their lives last Saturday after a senseless and horrible shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Their deaths are only the most recent in a long line of Americans whose lives were ended with the pull of a trigger. The assailant, armed with multiple firearms, fired for several minutes in a place of worship and made this attack the deadliest against the Jewish community in the history of our country.   My heart is broken for the people who were killed and targeted simply because of their faith and were terrorized during a celebratory ceremony. I send my thoughts and prayers to all those affected by this unspeakable violence. The hatred that drove their murderer to attack them in their house of worship is too common in our country. All of us have a responsibility to denounce anti-Semitism, racism, and bigotry.   I’m not sure what it’s going to take before all leaders of our country work together to end this epidemic of gun violence. The only way to end this crisis is with commonsense laws. There are dozens of bills pending in Congress today that would reduce gun violence in our communities. I've authored and co-sponsored several pieces of legislation to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, children, and individuals with serious mental illness. None of these bills have been brought to the floor for a vote, however, because the Republicans who control Congress refuse to advance any legislation opposed by the powerful gun lobby.  I’m not going to give up. I will continue fighting to advance these important bills. All of us who serve in Congress owe it to the American people to put an end to the gun violence epidemic.  HEALTH COVERAGE   Health insurance is incredibly important and helps protect you from unexpected costs, like a trip to the hospital or an unforeseen accident. That’s why I want to make sure that all of my constituents are aware that November 1st marked the start of Health Source RI’s open enrollment period for 2019 coverage.   From now until December 31st, you can purchase a plan or renew your coverage through HealthSourceRI.com. Once you sign up, you will get coverage that starts on January 1st, 2019.   ALTHEA CENTER GROUNDBREAKING 
On Monday I was excited to join Children’s Friend for their groundbreaking ceremony for the Althea Center, which will be a high-quality early education and family support center.   Making investments in early childhood education has incredible benefits for young people and puts them on a path to succeed. There is a large disparity between children from the highest and lowest socio-economic group before entering kindergarten, with the wealthiest children averaging higher cognitive test scores. This inequality is unjust, but programs like Head Start help ensure disadvantaged children have access to high-quality child care programs and have the same resources as their peers.   In Congress, I have been a strong advocate for Head Start programming and I was an original co-sponsor of the Child Care for Working Families Act which would support:  • Universal access to quality pre-school programs for young children  • Increase Head Start funding to expand to full year, full day programming, improve pay and benefits for early education teachers, and individuals working in early education  • Improve child care for children with disabilities   • Prohibit suspending or expelling children younger than age 5 from early learning programs  This legislation also ensures that all families under 150 percent of state median income would not pay more than 7 percent of their income for child care.   It is our responsibility to make sure that all children, regardless of income, have access to high-quality child care and early education programs so that they all have the ability to succeed.   LEAD SAFE    I was pleased that earlier this week the Environmental Protection Agency announced a $25,000 award to The Childhood Lead Action Project through their “Lead Safe Neighborhoods Program”.  This funding will help the organization train contractors on keeping children safe from lead during renovations. The project will focus on engaging directly with those at high risk for lead poisoning and will improve and protect human health by reducing environmental risks.   It is important that the federal government makes investments like this to improve the health and lives of people in our state and country every day.  AFFORDABLE HOUSING  This week I was delighted to participate in the ribbon cutting ceremony for two different affordable housing projects in our state. Affordable housing is a critical issue in Rhode Island and around our country. So many families are working harder than ever but unable to get ahead with stagnant wages and rising costs of living.   In Congress, I’m proud to support programs and advocate for legislation aimed at expanding production and access to affordable housing. The federal government needs to be making smart, strategic investments that support and empower all communities. Programs like HOME, CDBG, Low Income Housing Tax Credits, Historic Tax Credits and more can all be utilized to provide community development and affordable housing.  I will continue to fight to expand these types of programs that help individuals and families access safe and affordable housing.  ELECTION SECURITY   Last week I was happy to join Congressman Langevin, Secretary Gorbea, and Assistant Secretary Jeanette Manfra from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for a meeting to discuss election security.  We heard from Secretary Gorbea about the work she is doing in our state to ensure the security of Rhode Island’s elections system and how Help Amerca Vote Act (HAVA) funding is being used to strengthen our election infrastructure.   And we were able to hear from Assistant Secretary Manfra about the work that is being done on the federal level to strengthen the security and resilience of our elections.   The 2016 election made it clear that we need to make improvements and set aside additional resources to protect the integrity of our elections. Russia and other foreign adversaries have the intention of influencing the outcomes of our elections and pose an ongoing threat. I’ve been proud to take action and advocate for legislation that would improve our elections security.  Elections are the basis of our Democracy and it’s important that voters feel confident in the security of our election systems. I look forward to continuing to work to make sure we dedicate the necessary resources to safeguard our elections and help voters feel confident in their participation in our democratic process.   As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns, please call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov.   You can also click here to follow my work on Twitter.   Warm Regards, ￼  David Cicilline Member of Congress

For Students 

CTE Programs Boost Economy 
￼ 
I visited CRH Americas Materials' Central Pre-Mix Concrete site in Yakima to tour and learn more about the projects they are currently working on. We discussed the need for trade labor and the importance of Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs in high schools. These programs are vital for students and for companies like CRH that create family wage jobs to boost our local economy. High schools in Central Washington are increasingly promoting CTE, and I was proud to support legislation that enables schools to collaborate with industries and provide real-world training for students.  
TechSpark Spurs Rural Development 
￼ 
I met with Quincy High School students, teachers, and volunteers to learn about their experiences with Microsoft's TechSpark program. North Central Washington is one of six regions in the United States chosen to participate in the TechSpark partnership, which aims to foster economic opportunity and job creation by advancing coding, computer science, rural broadband infrastructure, and career development skills through partnerships with local entities. The students shared a few of their projects, and we discussed the need for pathways for students who are interested in computer science, especially in rural areas like Quincy. 
Honoring Our Cold War Patriots 
￼ 
At the 10th annual Cold War Patriots National Day of Remembrance event in Richland, I honored the men and women patriots who have worked in nuclear complexes like Hanford to enhance our nation's security. Washington's 4th Congressional District is home to thousands of workers who served on behalf of our country during World War II, the Cold War, and beyond - at times in hazardous conditions. Right here in our backyard, the Manhattan Project National Historical Park and the B Reactor are historic treasures for future generations to learn about Hanford workers' contribution to winning World War II and the Cold War. This is our communities shared history, and it should serve as a point of pride for all of us call Central Washington home. Learn more about the event on NBC Right Now. 
Water Developments in Quincy 
￼ 
The low-cost, reliable, clean energy resources in Central Washington make Quincy and the surrounding areas a desirable place for tech companies to locate their data centers and server farms. Investments from companies like Yahoo and Dell have encouraged economic prosperity in the region, and Microsoft recently chose Quincy as the location to construct its largest facility in the world. However, these centers pose unique challenges for the city, as they require large amounts of water to cool their serves in the summer. City management and local irrigation districts are exploring options to reuse waste water and develop new water projects to ensure water availability for everyone in the region, and I am grateful for the opportunity to tour and witness their progress.   
National Diabetes Awareness Month 
￼ 
November is National Diabetes Awareness Month, and I had the privilege of meeting with Maddie and Ella, two of my young constituents with Type 1 Diabetes, and their parents. They taught me about how their continuous glucose monitors have allowed them to have more freedom, and their parents shared that the technology gives them a peace of mind. We spoke about our shared interest in protecting patients with pre-existing conditions, like diabetes, as we work to improve health insurance costs and access in Central Washington. I have cosponsored several bills and resolutions to ensure these protections - most recently H.R. 6898, the Maintaining Protections for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions Act of 2018. I am grateful for Maddie and Ella sharing their personal experiences and raising awareness for diabetes.  
Angels in Adoption 
￼
November is also National Adoption Month. I recognized James and Angie Sessions of Pasco with the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute's ""Angels in Adoption"" award. James and Angie were inspired to become foster parents after learning about the foster care system at a local church camp for children in state custody. They became foster parents to four siblings and were determined to keep the family together. In August of 2017, the Sessions family grew from 2 to 6 when Ajay, Nathan, Kyler, and Layla found their forever home. The ""Angels in Adoption"" award recognizes families for their outstanding advocacy of adoption and foster care issues, and James and Angie are absolutely deserving of this honor. I hope their story will be an inspiration for other families in Central Washington considering becoming foster or adoptive parents.  
Highlighting Economic Development in Prosser 
￼ 
I spoke at the The Port of Benton's open house celebrating the new 9,000-square-foot development at its Vintner's Village in Prosser, consisting of three separate 2,500-square-foot bays. The Prosser Economic Development Association’s new home and business incubator is an exciting project for our local economy that will attract small businesses and boost tourism here on the sunny side of Washington. If you build it, they will come!

11/2/18 13:03,Blaine’s Bulletin: National Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month,"￼ 
November 2, 2018

BLAINE'S BULLETIN

With each passing year, researchers and doctors across the nation are continuously finding innovative new treatments and cures for diseases affecting millions of Americans. However, the sixth leading cause of death in the United States is a cruel disease that currently cannot be prevented, cured or even slowed. Alzheimer’s disease is the only top ten cause of death with this tragic distinction.

As fatality rates for those with heart disease are thankfully decreasing, deaths from Alzheimer’s disease have increased 123% between 2000 and 2015. An estimated 5.7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease, and without additional interventions those suffering from the disease and their caregivers will have little hope for the future.

I’m proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 4256, the Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act, legislation to finally implement effective Alzheimer’s interventions across the nation. In 2018, Alzheimer’s will cost Americans more than $277 billion due to preventable hospitalizations, the toll on caregivers, and the long-term care costs borne by Medicare and Medicaid. By 2050, the number of people living with Alzheimer’s is projected to triple and costs are expected to exceed $1 trillion.

H.R. 4256 identifies Alzheimer’s as a public health issue due to the large burden, major impact, and opportunity for intervention. Specifically, the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to create a nationwide Alzheimer’s public health infrastructure. This includes the establishment of Alzheimer’s Centers of Excellence to increase education, provide technical assistance to public health departments, and expand public private partnerships. Additionally, it provides funding to help public health departments implement Alzheimer’s interventions and develop strategic plans.

In 1983, President Ronald Reagan first declared November as National Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month. This month, I hope you take this opportunity to honor the brave Missourians fighting Alzheimer’s, the more than 316,000 caregivers in our state, and remember those who have tragically lost their lives, including President Reagan. With the support of my Congressional colleagues and Americans across the nation we can increase the quality of life for millions, while seeking a cure for this horrible disease. Together we can #EndALZ.

November 2, 2018 
  
Mrs. Lindsey P.   
235 W 102nd Street #11m 
Scottsblue, NE 69361
  
Dear Mrs.  : 
  
Knowing of your interest in issues affecting national security, I am writing to update you on recent developments. 
As you may know, the border between the United States and Mexico stretches for 1,951 miles, running through diverse terrain ranging from densely populated cities to farmland to remote mountains and deserts. While improvements in audio/visual remote monitoring technologies and the use of drones have allowed the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) to extend their monitoring of the area, the vast space and lack of resources leave large areas exposed. In fact, only about 650 miles of this is protected by permanent border fencing, with more than 1,300 miles of border left unprotected.
This vulnerability is open for exploitation by any wishing to enter the country undetected, including drug smugglers and potential terrorists. In Fiscal Year 2018 alone, CBP apprehended 396,579 individuals attempting to cross the southwest border between established points of entry, and according to a 2016 Department of Homeland Security report only about 50% of those who attempt to cross between the 48 official points of entry are apprehended. 
In addition to the national security risk, these open stretches of border encourage gangs and human traffickers to exploit and extort potential migrants, charging thousands of dollars to “guide” them dangerously unprepared across remote stretches of the border. In 2017, at least 412 illegal immigrants died while trying to cross the border, often from hypothermia, dehydration, or drowning. Securing our southern border would make it significantly harder for human traffickers and drug smugglers to cross into the United States, potentially saving thousands of lives, while also increasing our ability to deter and detect threats to our national security. 
Because of urgency of this situation, I recently cosponsored two bills which would dedicate funding to complete a wall along our southern border. The 50 Votes for the Wall Act (H.R. 7073) would use the budget reconciliation process, an expedited process created by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-344), to appropriate up to $25 billion in border infrastructure funding with only a simple majority to pass the Senate. Alternatively, the Build the Wall, Enforce the Law Act (H.R. 7059) would instead appropriate $23.4 billion in border wall funding, combined with reforms to the immigration enforcement process, making it harder for sanctuary jurisdictions to refuse to comply with federal law enforcement, increasing federal penalties for illegal reentry, and facilitating the deportation of criminal alien gang members.
Currently, H.R. 7073 has been referred to the Committee on Homeland Security, and H.R. 7059 has been referred to the Committees on the Judiciary, Homeland Security, Ways and Means, Armed Services, and Budget. Rest assured, as a member of the Committee on Ways and Means, as well as of the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus, I will continue to work with my colleagues and President Trump to develop long-term infrastructure and legislative solutions which protect the integrity of our legal system and our national security.

￼  ￼  ￼  ￼  ￼  ￼  
Dear Neighbor,

Over the past month we’ve visited residents, businesses and communities across Western New York.  Take a look at some of the work we have accomplished and progress our community has made. We hope you'll enjoy reviewing these exciting developments, and we will continue working hard to ensure that there are many more to come!  

Improving Access to Western New York's Waterfront:

￼
We announced the completion of the West River Shoreline Trail on Grand Island, funded in part with $1.6 million in federal funding

￼
The new, 8-mile West River Shoreline Trail, links to parks on Grand Island and features Niagara River overlooks

￼
Also completed was the new Shoreline Trail at the Bethlehem Steel site in the City of Lackawanna
￼
The $1.8 million Shoreline Trail connects to trails along the Buffalo Outer Harbor, includes features of Lackawanna's industrial history, and was funded through a combination of New York State, federal Community Development Block Grants, and Erie County funding.
￼
In South Buffalo we joined the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, taking the lead on the Seneca Bluffs Ecosystem Restoration project which will restore natural habitat along 2,500 linear feet of shoreline at the Buffalo River. A separate $3.7 million Army Corps project will restore 1,300 feet of seawall along LaSalle Park. 
Celebrating WNY’s History:   


￼
￼
We were proud to support the Buffalo Colored Musicians Club's application for designation to the New York State and National Registers of Historic Places and honored to join the community unveiling of the plaque recognizing this well-deserved status. 
￼
With the Hispanic Heritage Council of Western New York, we celebrated the renaming of the Niagara Branch Library in honor of Isaías González-Soto, who gave to his country as a member of the United States Army during WWII and continued to serve the Buffalo community throughout his lifetime.

Supporting Local Business: 

￼
We had the opportunity to visit 3M in Tonawanda to learn more about the business and meet with some of their 350 employees.

 
￼
We joined Westminster Economic Development Initiative, Inc. in announcing a $375,000 federal grant to expand their community based business model provided to entrepreneurs through the West Side Bazaar. A separate federal grant to Erie County will expand the senior dining program to include local restaurants, including the Bazaar. 

Building Healthy Communities: 

￼
Compeer Buffalo received over $2 million in federal grants to expand their mentor program and provide mental health first aid training to an additional 2,000 people
￼
Erie County was granted $3.4 million in federal funding to combat the opioid epidemic
Recognizing Domestic Violence Awareness Month: 
￼
With Erie County District Attorney John Flynn, Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz and other community partners, we announced $900,000 in federal funding to expand Erie County's Domestic Violence High-Risk Team's work protecting survivors.
￼
And we joined Family and Children's Service of Niagara, Mayor Paul Dyster, and members of the Niagara Falls community in taking a stand against Domestic Violence with a walk down Third Street. 







Stay updated with our work every day through email, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Flickr.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact us if my office can be of any assistance.

Did you know that more than eight million tons of garbage is dumped into the ocean each year?   Or that a floating island of trash in the Pacific now stretches 600,000 square miles — more than twice the size of Texas (nearly three times the size of France), and it’s growing every day. (photo below)
 ￼ 
We need to confront this environmental disaster before it is too late.   Bipartisan legislation I co-sponsored to address this problem was just signed into law by the President. Ocean Conservancy calls the bill a “significant piece of legislation.”  The Save our Seas Act reauthorizes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Marine Debris Program through 2022 and encourages the administration to reach out and engage the leaders of countries — located primarily in Asia — that are responsible for much of the sea pollution.  More than 100 million marine animals die every year due to plastic debris in the ocean. Sea turtles are especially at risk, including the endangered Loggerhead and Green Sea Turtles, both of which are native to Southwest Florida. Plastic debris takes thousands of years to decay.  Protecting the environment is especially important here in Florida, which has the longest coastline in the continental U.S. and is home to some of our country’s greatest treasures and natural resources.  Our oceans should not be turned into a global landfill. Please let me know if you agree that clean oceans and clean beaches should be a high priority.  Vern

Dear Friend, 
The tragedy that took 11 lives and injured six others at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last weekend was utterly heart-wrenching. It was important to stand in solidarity with the San Antonio community at Temple Beth-El this week. By coming together, we help stamp out the scourge of anti-Semitism and all other forms of hatred in this nation.

Early Voting in Bexar County 
Don’t forget that early voting in Texas runs through today. A historic turnout is expected, and y’all should visit votetexas.gov to learn more.
Troops Headed to Texas 
As part of a continuous effort by this Administration to demonize immigrants, the President has now announced that he will deploy additional military to the Southern border in response to migrants fleeing Central America. This is a tactic used to instill fear in the American people. You can read my full statement here, and watch coverage on KSAT12 News.  
Plans to Eliminate Birthright Citizenship 
The President’s plans to eliminate birthright citizenship is extremely troubling. 14th Amendment makes clear that those born or naturalized in the United States are citizens, and the President’s proposal to change that amendment would bypass the will of Congress and the American people solely for political gain. Any move by this Administration to unilaterally eliminate birthright citizenship would be illegal, unacceptable and immediately challenged. You can read my full statement here.  
You can read coverage about this in the Dallas Morning News and San Antonio Express-News. 
Foreign Affairs 
It was great to speak to our nation's future foreign policy and national security leaders at the University of Texas-Austin this week hosted by the Strauss Center, Clements Center, and the LBJ School’s PHD Colloquium. Our responsibility with foreign policy in Congress is to provide oversight, uphold American values, maintain alliances and create opportunities for diplomacy.

Home     Serving You     Contact     District     Legislation     Newsroom     About Bob 
Friends,

I know that in today's media environment it can sometimes be difficult to keep up on what is happening in Congress and around the country. This Congress, I've worked with my colleagues to pass some of biggest legislative achievements in years. It's led to a booming economy, promises kept to our veterans, and more money in the pockets of American families. I've personally had legislation I authored to help provide clean drinking water and combat the opioid epidemic signed into law by the President. Here's a snapshot of what's been accomplished.
 
What got done?
Historic Tax Cuts; Growing Economy– The historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was 31 years in the making, and it's led to the best economy we've seen in years. The law provided tax relief to middle-class families by doubling the child tax credit and increasing the standard deduction. It also provided a first-of-its-kind 20% deduction for small businesses, the engines of our economy. We now have the lowest unemployment rate in 49 years and the highest wage growth in a decade.
Combating the Opioid Epidemic – President Trump signed into law the most significant legislative effort to combat a single drug crisis in U.S. history when he signed H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. The bill included my legislation, the INFO Act, which will provide local communities important information regarding resources and funding to combat this crisis.
Protecting Lake Erie – Another important bill signed into law was the America's Waterways Infrastructure Act, legislation to upgrade our nation’s waterways, aid the flow of goods, and deliver resources for needed water infrastructure projects. The bill also includes provisions to protect Lake Erie from invasive Asian carp and legislation I authored to improve drinking water systems and ensure safer drinking water.
Improving Career and Technical Education - With a job market that continues to change, it’s critical that Ohioans have options when it comes to training for jobs in the modern economy. The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act updates federal law to ensure that those in the K-12 and workforce development systems have access to training in the most in-demand fields. Ensuring people have the skills to compete will help them find jobs and help businesses that are having difficulty filling positions. I've visited career centers around Ohio's 5th District where they are doing amazing work to train students for the jobs of tomorrow, and this law will help them with this goal.
Keeping Promises to Our Veterans – Congress has passed a number of pieces of legislation to improve the VA, including making it easier for veterans to appeal claims. We also passed the VA MISSION Act which will improve access to health care for veterans and allow them to see a doctor closer to home. I had introduced legislation and worked with my colleagues to fix a problem for some Northwest Ohio veterans suffering from cancer that had to travel to the Toledo VA and then Ann Arbor to receive treatment. This problem was fixed in the VA MISSION Act.
Repealing the Individual Mandate – One of the worst provisions included in Obamacare was the individual mandate, which requires a citizen purchase a product they may not want or can’t afford to avoid a hefty fine imposed by the Federal government. Even worse, the mandate mainly falls mainly on lower- and middle-income families – 79% of people forced to pay the penalty make less $50,000. We repealed this burdensome mandate once and for all as part of tax reform.
Providing Relief to Main Street – Dodd-Frank has had a debilitating effect on community banks on Main Street. Congress passed the Financial Choice Act to provide needed regulatory relief for community financial institutions. It also included important provisions that protect student loan borrowers and allows consumers to freeze and unfreeze their credit reports for free.
Eliminating Burdensome Regulations – Congress passed 16 Congressional Review Acts this Congress which remove overregulation put into place at the end of the Obama Administration. The CRA’s are estimated to contain $86 billion in savings for taxpayers and $18.8 billion in regulatory savings. President Trump also implemented a policy where two regulations had to be repealed for every one put in place.
Rebuilding the U.S. Military; Giving the Troops a Raise – The drawdown of our military under the Obama administration has been reversed. The National Defense Authorization Act provides the largest pay raise for our troops in nearly a decade, improves military readiness, and increases funding for the purchase of essential military aircraft, vehicles, and weaponry. 
School Safety - The STOP School Violence Act provides needed resources to train students, teachers, school officials, and local law enforcement on how to identify and intervene when early signs of violence arise, creates a coordinated reporting system, and facilitates coordination between schools and local law enforcement. 
 
Action Still on the Horizon
All of the above was accomplished despite historic obstruction by the minority party in the U.S. Senate. Here are some initiatives I helped support that have passed the House, and I’m hopeful the Senate passes before the end of this Congress.
Supporting our Farmers - The Farm Bill supports the Ohio farmers by keeping in place important crop insurance programs that allow farmers to purchase policies that protect them against financial ruin brought by disease, drought, or other catastrophic events. It also contains important conservation provisions and my amendment to help with the use of precision agriculture in rural areas.
Expanding Health Care Choices, Lowering Costs -The House has passed a number of provisions to allow more health care choices and decrease costs for patients. Two bills would expand access to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and provide patients with more health care options. Another piece of legislation would allow small businesses to band together to negotiate for better health care at lower cost for their employees. The House has also voted to delay the Health Insurance Tax, which increases premiums for American families, and the Medical Device Tax, which stifles life-saving and life-improving medical technology. 
Enforcing our Immigration Laws – Kate's Law would enhance penalties for deported felons who return to the U.S. The bill is named after Katie Steinle, who was killed by a criminal felon that had been deported multiple times. It passed the House of Representatives last year along with a bill that would stop federal funding to dangerous sanctuary cities.
Reforming the IRS -The Taxpayer First Act and the others bills passed by the House makes needed changes to the IRS to ensure they are held accountable. The legislation provides taxpayers with more tools to resolve disputes with the agency, including having access to an impartial review of the facts. The bills also modernizes the agency by making IRS data available in a searchable, electronic format.
 
What Else I’m Working On 
Improving Innovation and Lowering Costs for Over-the-Counter Drugs - When innovation is stymied, it’s ultimately the consumers that lose. The system to approve over-the-counter products, called the monograph system, hasn't been updated for 45 years. The House passed my bipartisan legislation that reforms this system and will ensure products are more effective, affordable, and safer for consumers.
Helping Veterans - The Veterans Right to Expediency Act ensures that veterans are informed in a timely manner of the outcome of their Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability claim. I recently met with members of his Veterans Advisory Group who expressed concern that delayed delivery of notifications was causing veterans to miss the window to submit an appeal. According to members of the Veterans Advisory Group, the VA stated it was issues with the United State Postal Service that resulted in the delivery issues. The Veterans Right to Expediency Act would require that all VA denial of claims for benefits notices be delivered by certified mail. 
Self-Driving Car Legislation – Self-driving cars are job creators that will help make our roads safer and improve mobility for Americans. My legislation to help innovators working on this technology passed the House of Representatives unanimously, and I’m optimistic it will be signed into law soon.
Preventing Terrorism on U.S. Soil – Vehicular terrorism has been on the rise in Europe and we’ve now seen it occur in America. Legislation I authored to give the Department of Homeland Security the tools it needs to prevent these acts and protect U.S. citizens has passed the House.


I'll continue to work hard to move forward policies that help Ohioans in the 5th Congressional District. Please don't hesitate to reach out to my office if I or my staff can be of service to you.

Sincerely,
￼
Congressman Bob Latta

Dave 

 Greetings,
Before Congress comes back to DC in November, I wanted to send you an update about the work I have been doing on your behalf in the 115th Congress.
115th Congress by the Numbers (to date):
	•	1,005 pieces of casework resolved
	•	400+ events with constituents
	•	297 Capitol tours given
	•	1996 White House tours processed
	•	169 flag requests processed
	•	108,000 constituent inquiries answered
	•	27 bills introduced by Rep. Brat
	•	229 bills co-sponsored by Rep. Brat
	•	1,125 total votes by Rep. Brat
	•	1,323 total bills passed by the U.S. House
	•	273 total bills signed into law

Legislative Update:
This fall, the Republican Congress made major strides protecting taxpayer money, addressing the opioid crisis and protecting the foundations of our republic from foreign influence.
The Republican-controlled House and Senate just passed a bi-partisan bill, H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act – a comprehensive piece of legislation designed to address the opioid crisis and it included one of my bills (more info below). Just last week, the bill was signed into law by the president.
- H.R. 6 directs federal agencies to create and expand community programs to increase access to treatment, authorizes grants to support recovery centers, and prioritizes stopping the flow of synthetic opioids into the country. 
- Included in this comprehensive law is one of my bills H.R. 5889, the Recognizing Early Childhood Trauma Related to Substance Abuse Act of 2018. This bill helps children in families battling addiction.
In September, we passed a legislative package that included one of my bills and is designed to promote additional economic growth and protect individual American tax cuts. Here are a few more details about each of the bills in this package:
- House passed H.R. 6756, the American Innovation Act, that would make it easier for entrepreneurs to start a new business. The bill provides deductions to start-up and organizational costs in the business’s first year.
- House passed H.R. 6757, the Family Savings Act, which included an idea Rep. Dave Brat introduced last year via H.R. 937 called Universal Savings Accounts (USAs). USAs are a popular idea designed to offer Americans an improved version of Roth IRAs, similar to offerings found in Britain and Canada.
- House passed H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act. After witnessing the giant leap in economic growth due to Republican tax reform, the House voted to make these tax changes permanent.
The House voted to adopt H.Res. 1071, a resolution that condemns voting by noncitizens and illegal immigrants. The U.S. House resolution goes on to state that allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues and dilutes the voting power of U.S. citizens. 
- The resolution was issued in response to actions by San Francisco that allow non-citizens, including illegal immigrants, to vote in school board elections if the person has a child under age 19. This practice is antithetical to the integrity of American elections. Each of the Constitutional amendments extending the right to vote (15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th) begins with: ‘The right of citizens of the United States [to vote],’ clearly indicating that this right is for citizens. 
- Our Constitution is clear. We must not let this trend spread -- it threatens the foundations of our republic. 
 Lowering the Cost of Healthcare and Taking Care of Seniors:
Not long ago, the House passed H.R. 1628 that would have lowered premiums and lowered the cost of care via market mechanisms. Democrats are spreading a lot of misinformation about this bill and the GOP's record on healthcare. Contrary to what's been said, Republicans voted to protect individuals with pre-existing conditions and always sought to protect Medicare and Social Security. For more information, please refer to former doctor Sen. Bill Cassidy's op-ed at CNN. 
 Our Southern Border:
Due to years of lax enforcement and bipartisan failures to solve our immigration problem, we have a humanitarian crisis at our southern border. In the news, a caravan of thousands of migrants approaches from Mexico. Border officials estimate three-quarters of the migrants are adult men and DHS has confirmed that some have criminal histories and gang affiliations. Certainly, it reiterates the importance of shoring up our border security and reforming our immigration laws.
As we work toward broader reforms, I worked with Senator Cruz earlier this year to introduce a bill (the Protect Kids and Parents Act to Keep Illegal Immigrant Families Together, H.R. 6195) that would keep families together at the border and speed up the asylum process to ensure they were not detained for extended periods of time. Specifically, our bill would double the number of federal immigration judges at the border, expedite processing and review of asylum cases, authorize new shelters for families and mandate that illegal immigrant families be kept together absent aggravated criminal conduct or threat of harm to the children. 
 Taking Care of Our Troops; Rebuilding our Military:
The Obama administration neglected our military and service members for two full terms and made dangerous cuts to our national security forces, but this Republican Congress and administration has got us back on track. In late summer, I was happy to vote to give our troops and their families the largest pay raise they’ve received in a decade in this year’s National Defense bill known as the NDAA. In that piece of legislation, Congress authorized a record-level reboot and rebuild of our armed forces, upgrading equipment and modernizing our fighting force to be ready for threats from our fiercest adversaries like China, Russia and Iran.

￼ 
WHY I'M FIGHTING TO END PAINFUL TESTING ON DOGS
Lindsey - 
As an Army veteran and a dog owner, the VA's practice of conducting painful and deadly experiments on dogs is especially alarming to me. 
Having sustained catastrophic injuries on the battlefield, which included the loss of both my legs, I am acutely aware of the vital role dogs play in helping troops recover from war's physical and psychological tolls. 
￼ 
Additionally, given the VA's limited resources, it is unjustifiable for it to spend taxpayers' money hurting dogs in questionable experiments when veterans are unable to get the treatment and care they need. We must do better for veterans, dogs and American taxpayers. 
That's why I helped introduce a bipartisan amendment to the VA’s spending bill that would prohibit taxpayer funds from being spent on dog experiments that cause the animals significant pain and distress. 
The House of Representatives unanimously passed our amendment to cut funding for these cruel and wasteful experiments, but new reporting by USA Today has exposed that fatal dog experiments have moved ahead anyways. 
The VA has not executed what we wanted as intent, which is to bring this to an end in its entirety, so we will keep up the pressure until these invasive, painful and deadly experiments on dogs stop completely!

11/2/18 4:39,#ThrowbackThursday: Protecting the Rocky Mountain Front,"￼
 
￼ 
Few things are more important in
Montana than our outdoor heritage.

That's why I’m sending a #ThrowbackThursday to the time I passed two bipartisan bills protecting thousands of acres of public lands.  The Rocky Mountain Front Heritage Act added and protected over 250,000 acres of public lands, and created new wilderness in Montana for the first time in over 30 years. The North Fork Watershed Protection Act permanently protected the North Fork of the Flathead River by banning future mining and drilling on 430,000 acres near Glacier National Park.  Protecting these special places took a lot of work from folks on both sides of the aisle, and I listened to landowners, recreationists, ranchers, businesses and individuals to make sure we passed a solution that strengthened out outdoor heritage in Montana.  It was a big win for hunters, anglers, hikers, and anyone who enjoys spending time outdoors, and for Montana’s $7 billion outdoor economy.  Defending our public lands is one of my highest priorities in Congress, and I’m ready to work together to protect our outdoor heritage for generations to come.

Open enrollment for 2019

  
Many Washingtonians get their health insurance through Apple Health, Medicare, or an employer (like the state government or TRICARE). For those who don’t, the Washington health plan exchange helps them get covered with meaningful insurance. The exchange was set up in 2014 after the Affordable Care Act was implemented. At the end of every year, the Washington health plan exchange holds an open enrollment period, during which Washingtonians have the opportunity to review their current plan and decide if they want to make a change. The Washington health plan exchange open enrollment period begins today, November 1, and runs until December 15. 
Last year, I decided to switch health plans. I receive health care coverage from the DC Health Exchange, as part of the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that Members of Congress and their staff get health insurance coverage through the exchanges. In the fall of 2017, my wife and I reviewed plans in the exchange and decided to change to a plan that was a better fit for us.
The Washington Healthplanfinder (www.wahealthplanfinder.org) is the tool you can use to find a health insurance plan that's right for you and your family. I have set up a webpage of resources (dennyheck.house.gov/resources/2019-open-enrollment-resources) for you to use if you are deciding to enroll for the first time or switch plans. 
We know this is an important decision, and we want you to be armed with the best information to make your choice. For example, if you prefer to talk to someone in person who can help you sign up, we have information on how to identify and connect with a free Healthplanfinder navigator in your area. 
Despite efforts to end or weaken it, the Affordable Care Act is still in place and makes it possible for hundreds of thousands of Washingtonians to access affordable coverage. If people continue to sign up for comprehensive health care coverage, we can work to bring down costs for everyone.
Sincerely, 
￼
Denny Heck
Your Member of Congress

11/1/18 18:30,Notes from the Ninth: Indiana in October,"￼ 

Hoosiers,

I hope everyone had a fun and safe Halloween yesterday. Baby Joseph dressed up as Captain America for Trick or Treating last night in Jeffersonville - check out his costume here on my Instagram!

From roundtable conversations on senior care to tours of local manufacturing companies, October has been a busy month here in Indiana, and I appreciate each and every school, hospital, business, family, and individual Hoosier for taking the time to sit down with me, have a conversation, and share thoughts, ideas, and concerns as I'm fighting for you in Congress. Below are just a few highlights from October that I wanted to share with you. Be sure to check it out and provide your feedback here. I look forward to hearing from you.

Be of good cheer,
￼


Manufacturing Day

Made in Indiana. Across Indiana, manufacturers keep our economy rolling, making everything from the car you drive to your family's dinner table.

National Manufacturing Day was on October 5. On National Manufacturing Day, and every single day, I'm honored to fight for these hardworking men and women, and create an economy that allows our local manufacturing industry to thrive for generations to come. 

￼

￼
Manufacturing Week. The number one issue I hear from manufacturers, by far, is how do we get more talent into manufacturing? How do we encourage more people to be interested and excited about entering these fields and make a real difference in their lives? 

It's an employer problem, but it is also a real opportunity for Hoosier kids to find a career that will help them build a successful future. Thank you to One Southern Indiana for having me -- I was excited to support your 4th Annual Manufacturing Week and to continue supporting Hoosier manufacturing!

 Fighting the Opioid Crisis
 
Last week, President Trump signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6) into law. I pushed for the strong, comprehensive approach that H.R. 6 takes on our nation's continued fight against the opioid epidemic. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act is a compilation of more than 50 bills to forge ahead in our historic fight to provide tools to Hoosier families and communities hit by the scourge of opioid addiction. Read more about it here on my website. 

 Hearing from Hoosiers
 
￼
Care Townhall. At a System of Care townhall, I spoke to members of the Clark and Floyd County communities who are committed to increasing access to the best possible care for all. Specifically, I took questions on what Congress can do to increase access to mental health services and increase overall awareness of mental healthcare. Our suffering neighbors are better off thanks to local efforts, and I appreciated being a part of this healthcare discussion. 
 
￼
Harrison Healthcare Center. Kathy showed me around Harrison Healthcare Center, a nursing facility in Corydon that provides both short-term recovery services and long-term care for seniors. Thank you for taking the time to share all you are doing to increase access to care for Hoosier seniors.

￼
Franklin Police Department. Congratulations Kirby Cochran on your new role as Chief of the Franklin Police Department. Great to sit down with Chief Cochran and Deputy Chief Tennell to hear their plans for expanding Franklin PD - thank you for all you do to keep us safe!

￼
￼
Westwood Elementary. At Westwood Elementary in Greenwood, I shadowed Principal Dave Ennis around the school where I met some of the 480 students, teachers, administrators and had the chance to see firsthand a collaborative assignment some students were working on in a STEM class.

￼
WindRose. Great conversation with healthcare providers at WindRose Health. We talked Medicare, health insurance, and the importance of preventative care. We also discussed how to protect seniors from email and phone scams, which cost far too many seniors their hard-earned savings when they fall victim to these scams.

￼
Academy Day. Thank you to all students and parents who joined me at Seymour High School for this year's Academy Day. If you missed it, you can find more information about the U.S. Service Academy Nomination process on our website.

￼
Redeem the Dream. Redeem the Dream, Inc.: a youth outreach organization in New Albany that offers mentoring, sports, activities, and resources to Southern Indiana kids. Their mission: help Kentuckiana's youth redeem their dreams by realizing their own potential. Thanks Dan and Zach for sharing your inspiring stories - and for inspiring those around you.

￼
Frank Miller Lumber. In 1903, John Miller purchased a small lumber mill in Union City, Indiana. Today, Frank Miller Lumber has three facilities across Indiana, including here in Salem, and employs almost 200 Hoosiers. Thanks Bob, Chris, and Steve for the tour, and for sharing your thoughts on tariffs, the labor shortage, and the importance of passing the 2018 Farm Bill. 

￼
Goodwill Excel Center. In Clarksville, I toured the Goodwill Excel Center, a program that started in 2010 to help adults in our community earn a high school diploma, industry-recognized certificates, or college credit. With a 95% graduation rate, this successful career development program that started right here in Indiana has expanded to multiple other states across the country. Thank you Lakia, Allison, Betsy, and Michelle for showing me around!

￼
Clark Regional Airport. It was an exciting day in Clark County as we celebrated the expansion of Clark Regional Airport. This expansion is going to make a profound difference in traffic that can come in and out of this airport, benefitting not only our community here but across the region, and I'm excited about the opportunities that this will bring as more and more businesses find a home right here in southern Indiana. You can read more here in the News and Tribune. 

￼
Falls of the Ohio. Last week, heroes from the Town of Clarksville used a complex rope system to save the life of a man who had fallen into dangerous terrain at the Falls of the Ohio. I had the honor of thanking our Clarksville Fire Department for their bravery and commitment to the safety of all members of our community. We are lucky to have you. 

￼
￼
Finding a Cure. Approximately 1.25 million American children and adults have type 1 diabetes. I sat down to hear the stories and struggles from Hoosier kids who deal with Type 1 diabetes every single day, and volunteers for JDRF, a non-profit organization fighting for those diagnosed with this disease. Thank you for sharing your stories on the effects of diabetes on your daily lives and your thoughts on how Congress can continue to promote further research and help fight rising medical costs.

 Congressman Adam Smith’s November Update 
Throughout the month of October, I heard directly from constituents across the 9th District about the issues impacting them and their families. These conversations help me better serve you in Washington, D.C. and move forward policies that will keep our community strong, safe and healthy. 
Protecting Healthcare 
Like every American, health care is personal for me. My family lost our health insurance after my father passed away and my mom later died in part because she couldn’t afford the medication she needed. My family’s story is unfortunately not unique. Everyone should be able to afford health insurance. I support H.R. 676, the Expanded & Improved Medicare for All Act. 
￼ 
The continued efforts of Republicans in Congress and the Administration to undermine the Affordable Care Act threatens access to affordable health care and jeopardizes coverage for millions of American families, including those with pre-existing conditions. I will continue to fight any effort that would limit access to health care coverage. 
Support for Community Health Centers 
Community Health Centers (CHCs) provide quality and affordable care to ensure that everyone – regardless of income – has access to vital health care services. I'm proud to support our local providers and their commitment to our community. 
This week I met with local CHCs to discuss their work providing culturally and linguistically appropriate health services and learn about the innovation that CHCs are spearheading to break down barriers and provide access to all. Their services and commitment to our community is invaluable and I will continue to work in Congress to make sure CHCs receive the funding they need to continue to support the people of the 9th District. 
Thank you HealthPoint, International Community Health Services, Sea Mar, Seattle Indian Health Board, Country Doctor, Washington Association of Community & Migrant Health Centers, and Save Health Care in Washington for your work! 
￼

Hearing from our First Responders 
I have deep respect for the work firefighters do to keep us safe. Thank you to Seattle Fire Department Station 10 for hosting an honest discussion on the challenges our first responders face and how we can better support their work. 
￼

Securing Noise Mitigation Funding For Highline Schools
The students in our community deserve to learn in a safe and healthy environment free from distracting noise and environmental burdens. I am proud to have secured over $14 million in federal funding to help Highline School District equip school buildings with noise mitigation. 
A 2002 agreement between the Port of Seattle, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Highline Public Schools committed federal funding for noise mitigation for fifteen schools. Since the agreement was signed, the noise contours around the airport changed, leaving remaining schools in areas where the FAA could not legally provide mitigation funds despite the prior agreement. 
As Ranking Member of the House Armed Service Committee and a Highline alumnus, I included an amendment to the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act to secure the Highline funding, which was signed into law at the end of August. This week, I joined together with Highline Public Schools and Port of Seattle officials to celebrate the mitigation funding that our schools will receive. 
Continued coordination with Highline and the Port of Seattle on mitigating aviation impacts will ensure that the students attending our local schools will have the classrooms and facilities they need so that they can focus on their studies as they learn and develop. 
￼ 
Adam joined Highline School Board Vice-President Bernie Dorsey, Highline Superintendent Susan Enfield, Elizabeth Leavitt, Port of Seattle Senior Director of Environment and Sustainability at the site of the new Des Moines Elementary. 
Celebrating Women in Business 
Thank you to the Seattle Southside Chamber of Commerce for inviting me to participate in your Celebration of Women in Business Panel Discussion! I was honored to join the panel for a powerful conversation on how far we have come and what more we need to do to ensure equality for women in the workforce. 
I am fighting to pass the Equality Act, the Paycheck Fairness Act, and the Pregnant Worker Fairness Act, all of which will help ensure that we achieve gender equity to improve the lives of women and their families. 
￼

Pathways for Employment 
I had the honor of speaking at the ANEW and North American Building Trade Union hosted event celebrating the importance of women in trade and apprenticeships. I will continue promoting programs, training and opportunities for women to gain economic success in non-traditional careers. 
￼ 
Adam speaks at the Apprenticeship & Non-Traditional Employment for Women (ANEW) event   
Keeping Families Together 
We must continue to raise awareness about the Trump Administration’s abhorrent family separation policy. My staff joined the youth-led Families for Families rally and march to stand with our community and send the message that families belong together - not detained. 
￼ 
Expanding Equality of Opportunity – The House Intern Pay Act
In September, the House and Senate voted to allocate $20,000 in funding for each Member’s office to pay interns. I am pleased that we are taking a meaningful first step toward providing paid internship opportunities in the United States House of Representatives. While long over-due, I applaud House Appropriators for recognizing the hardships that unpaid internships pose for many who seek to contribute and learn on Capitol Hill. 
We must now build on and go further than the Minibus appropriations conference report’s allocation to each House office. This measure only allocates funds for the coming fiscal year, and the funding amount it provides will force offices to choose between paying interns on a less than full-time basis, paying them below the minimum wage in the District of Columbia, or offering a paid internship for only part of the year. Congress has a responsibility to provide equality of opportunity for all to intern on Capitol Hill – and that means funding a full-time, year-round internship position in each Member’s Capitol Hill or district congressional office at a livable wage. 
The House Intern Pay Act, which I introduced in September, would authorize funding for a consistent, full-time internship program in each Member’s office at a rate of $15 per hour. I look forward to working with a growing group of my colleagues to bring the House Intern Pay Act to the floor for a vote to ensure that we provide a permanent and dedicated funding stream to pay interns so that all students have the ability to intern on Capitol Hill. 
My office has long-recognized the opportunity that a paid internship can provide. We continue to offer one full-time paid internship in both our Renton and Washington, D.C. offices each session. The deadline for the Winter Internship session is November 15th! Learn more by visiting my website: adamsmith.house.gov/internships 
￼ 
Conserving our Environment 
It’s been 32 days since the Land and Water Conservation Fund expired. I support permanent reauthorization of this invaluable program and urge Congress to pass legislation to do so as soon as possible. I'm fighting to protect our natural resources and save the Land and Water Conservation Fund.
￼ 
Opposing the Exportation of Coal and Gas from West Coast Military Bases 
I am extremely concerned with reports that the Trump administration may be considering the use of military bases to ship coal and gas. This is a clear attempt to circumvent environmental oversight and protections. The Trump Administration is once again using national security as an excuse to drive their short-sighted agenda. The reality that this administration refuses to act on, however, is that climate change is one of the gravest national security threats facing this country. In 2017, I led my colleagues passing into law legislation that acknowledges climate change is a national security threat.
Exporting coal and gas through Department of Defense military bases or lands will do nothing to help address the impacts of climate change or benefit the energy resiliency of Department of Defense installations. In fact, turning our military bases into export terminals could be an encroachment risk and potentially harm military training, operations, and readiness. We need Congress and this administration to treat climate change for what it is – a threat to our national security and to the wellbeing of this country. As Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee, I will work with my colleagues to hold this administration accountable for these actions and the risks they pose for our environment and national security.

In the News: Keeping the Department of Defense Accountable 
On issue after issue, the Department of Defense under the Trump Administration has made conspicuous decisions to roll back transparency and public accountability precisely when we need it most. I’m fighting to keep the DoD accountable. 
The message from the top has been to withhold information from Congress, the public, and the press, even as President Trump has simultaneously taken inappropriate steps to politicize the military.

11/1/18 17:23,Important announcement: ,"￼ 
Lindsey – As a doctor, I know many families are having a hard time with health care costs. An unexpected medical bill shouldn’t make you worry about going bankrupt.

That’s why I recently introduced two new bills to make health care more affordable for Sacramento County. My legislation will modernize health savings accounts for middle class families and help retirees who face higher costs.

Please click here to learn more about them and see what I’m doing to fix what isn’t working in health care.

￼

The Health Savings Modernization Act updates rules for health savings accounts so they can work better for middle class families. It also makes more affordable plans available for everyone. 

For instance, although young adults can stay on their parents’ insurance until age 26, parents cannot use their health savings account to pay for their children’s expenses. My bill would change that, so health savings accounts can be used to pay the costs of young adults who are still on their parents’ plan. These and other fixes will help people facing high premiums without sacrificing consumer protections.

Likewise, the Bridge to Medicare Act will provide relief for retirees facing expensive insurance premiums who aren’t yet eligible for Medicare. 

While retirees may not have an earned income, they still may not qualify for premium assistance. This can leave some people in their late 50s and early 60s on the hook for the full cost of health insurance. My bill would let those hardest hit pre-Medicare folks deduct the cost of their family’s health insurance.

These are commonsense steps we can take right now to help everyone get ahead. We should be working together to protect people with pre-existing conditions, lower costs, and expand access to health care – not trying to gut the Affordable Care Act and kick millions off their care.

Please click here to learn more in my Prescription to Protect our Care to see how I’m working to fix the Affordable Care Act and make it better.

As always, it’s an honor and privilege to serve you in Congress. Please always feel free to call or write to ask a question or share your views.

Be well,

Weekly Update: National Adoption Month By Congressman Rob Wittman November 1, 2018  November is National Adoption Month. As a child of adoption, it’s important to me to share my story. I want folks to know that adoption is an option, and when they’re faced with difficult choices, I want them to have the information and resources they need to give a child a shot at love and a shot at life.  I was born on February 3, 1959, but home didn’t start there. It started when my mom and dad adopted me. And in a way, that’s comforting. My family chose me—they could have chosen anyone, but they chose me. And the woman who brought me into the world gave me more than life; she gave me possibility. She gave me a shot at a boyhood full of fishing boats and baseball cards and the opportunity to have a wife and children and now grandchildren of my own. She gave me the chance to serve the community that made me the man I am and to make a difference in the lives of others.  Adoption isn’t a partisan issue. We can all agree that the most vulnerable members of our community deserve a place to call home and a place to find and reach their full potential. You know, one of the extraordinary things about the country we live in is that families come in all shapes and sizes. The “perfect” family is the family filled with love and understanding, and I’ve seen so many of those in the First District. Adoptive families face unique challenges, and on the other side of those challenges, they’re rewarded with unique blessings and with the satisfaction of having said “yes” when others were saying “no.""  Here in Washington, I want to do everything that I can to support adoption and to support life. It's why I’ve fought, once again, to defund Planned Parenthood and any organization that disregards the sanctity of innocent life. It’s why I have introduced the Adoption Information Act, which ensures that expectant parents have access to information about adoption. It’s why I fought to have the Adoption Tax Credit remain in our tax code.  But what is most important to me is to act as a resource for families considering adoption, and to make sure that people know the value that an adoptive family can bring into a child’s life. That’s what my family did for me, and that’s what I want for others.  Thanks to all of the adoptive parents and biological parents who have chosen, as my mom did, to let love grow.

11/1/18 16:44,Stronger Than Hate,"Open in its own browser window   Open a plain text version
News from Representative Lou Barletta 
￼
 


 
 November 1, 2018  
Stronger Than Hate 
Last weekend, the people of Pittsburgh suffered a terrible tragedy when 11 innocent men and women from The Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill were murdered in the name of hate.  To target a religious community in any way disregards each and every value we hold dear as Americans, and to do so with such a cowardly and heinous attack is pure evil. 
￼
Let me be clear: there is no place for anti-Semitism or any similar hatred in our society. Any threat to a religious community is outrageous and inexcusable, and the full force of the law should be brought against the perpetrators.
As the Pittsburgh community, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and nation as a whole continue to mourn this tragedy, we thank the brave law enforcement officers who risked their lives to bring the man responsible for this monstrous crime into custody, as well as the first responders and medical staff who worked tirelessly to save all those who were injured.
Since joining the House Committee on Homeland Security, I have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure all members of our community have the resources necessary to practice their religion peacefully and without fear of persecution.
Earlier this Congress, I chaired a bipartisan hearing on the importance of the Nonprofit Security Grant (NSG) Program, which provides organizations that are at high risk of a terrorist attack with funding for security enhancements such as security guards and monitoring systems.  This funding can help houses of worship, such as synagogues and churches, save lives when dealing with threats to public safety.  Just last year, NSG grants were instrumental in helping Jewish Community Centers (JCCs) respond to a wave of bomb threats.  As a former mayor, I know how critical this funding is in helping communities in times of crisis, and I will continue to advocate for this important program.
However, simply responding to these attacks is not enough, which is why I have repeatedly worked to eliminate anti-Semitism altogether.  For example, I’m proud to co-sponsor Representative Carolyn Maloney’s (D-NY) Never Again Education Act (H.R. 5460), legislation that will give teachers across the United States the resources and training they need to teach our children the important lessons of the Holocaust and the consequences of intolerance and hate.  Threats like those made to JCCs across Pennsylvania last year, as well as the vicious attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue, should never occur in the first place.  By educating our children about the darkest chapters in our world’s history, we can help ensure the hatred that fuels these terrible acts is eradicated once and for all.
Unfortunately, anti-Semitism is also alive in our global economy, disguised as the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.  BDS is an international campaign that encourages the boycotting of companies and organizations that do business with the Jewish State of Israel.  This thinly-veiled act of anti-Semitism cannot be tolerated, and I am proud to have fought against it throughout my eight years in Congress. 
The Freedom of Religion is a fundamental right provided to American citizens in the Constitution.  Any threat to this right is an attack on one of the core pillars of our democracy and must be confronted. 
I forcefully condemn the anti-Semitic attack at The Tree of Life Synagogue and remain committed to providing our local communities with the resources they need to keep our families safe and ensuring all Americans have the freedom to practice their religion peacefully without fear.  
All my best,  ￼  Lou Barletta  Member of Congress

For updates from our office follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. 
Dear Friend,  I wanted to send you an update on bipartisan legislation I filed this week to improve mental health care and address the tragic problem of suicide, which is now the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. 
I believe that you can’t solve any problem without data and that approach is at the heart of this bill, the Suicide Prevention Analytics Act. 
Right now, emergency room practitioners record suicidal and self-harm behaviors using standard medical data processes, in line with federal privacy requirements and safeguards. However, it can take years for these reports to be compiled. My legislation addresses this problem by creating a pilot program to fund near real time data sharing, in accordance with existing privacy protections. 
This new pilot program would increase coordination between local care providers, prevention experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and create a path for faster data sharing. This potentially could help save lives, if caregivers and medical professionals see a link between self-harm ideation and other risk factors that show up in the data. 
I am proud that this legislation has bipartisan support: Republican Congressman Chris Stewart (UT-2) is the lead cosponsor of the bill. The surest way to solve problems in Congress is to find common ground and work across the aisle and that’s what we’ve done with this legislation. The bill is also supported by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. 
For too long we have neglected mental health care in this country and nearly every family has been impacted. The Suicide Prevention Analytics Act is a step in the right direction, but we still have a lot of work to do. 
Sincerely, 
John

Dear  ,   Thank you for signing up to receive my email newsletter. These newsletters will cover a variety of topics, including events happening in northeast Indiana, legislation being considered in Congress, and my perspective on current issues. My hope is to keep you updated and informed on how issues in Washington may impact our region. I welcome your feedback.  
Thanks for reading, ￼  Jim Banks Member of Congress Indiana's Third District 
	•	
Here to Serve You
I often tell people that northeast Indiana is a great place to live, work and raise a family. Hoosiers in our region work hard and are committed to serving their neighbors and communities. One of my goals as your congressman is to provide outstanding constituent services to 3rd District residents. I am proud of what my staff and I have been able to accomplish over the past two years.
￼ 
The constituent services team in my Fort Wayne office coordinates dozens of inquiries to federal agencies every month. Since I took office on Jan. 3, 2017, my office has opened 1,444 cases and closed 1,124. Some cases stay open several months due to backlogs and delays at federal agencies, but the average case closes within a month. We have helped many individuals receive assistance when they felt they had nowhere else to turn. 
To make things more convenient, my staff takes our office on the road twice a week to meet with Hoosiers in their local communities. My staff hosts mobile office hours at locations throughout northeast Indiana then shares the feedback they receive with me. We believe in the motto: “Follow up and follow through.” 
￼ 
I also make it a priority to visit regularly with mayors, council members, Rotary clubs and other civic groups across northeast Indiana. These organizations are the bedrock of our region and, in many ways, the bedrock of our nation. I'm proud that during my first term in Congress, my office has also helped mitigate or resolve issues affecting several of our communities in the 3rd District. 
￼ 
In April, Decatur Mayor Ken Meyer approached me about flood mitigation efforts there. Decatur had been denied critical Federal Emergency Management Agency grant funding to help with flood mitigation. In May, I toured these mitigation zones with the mayor and saw his leadership on the issue firsthand. After several conversations to learn more, I sent FEMA a letter in support of the mayor's original request and asked the agency to reconsider its initial decision to deny funding. I'm proud to report back that not only did FEMA reconsider, but the grant ultimately was awarded. 
￼ 
Shepherd's House in Fort Wayne works diligently every day to serve Hoosier veterans who struggle with homelessness and addiction. They provide individuals with a program and support system to ensure a lasting recovery. In July 2017, this incredible organization alerted my office that it was on the verge of losing federal funds provided through the grant and per diem program at the Department of Veterans Affairs. As a member of the House Veterans' Affairs committee, I knew it was my duty to help our local veterans however I could and fight to restore funding. 
I reached out to then-VA Secretary David Shulkin and asked that another year of funding be extended. Ultimately, the grant was awarded, and Shepherd's House was able to continue its critical work transforming the lives of veterans. I will continue to advocate for Shepherd's House and other organizations that support our Hoosier veterans. 
￼ 
My office also assisted the city of Portland and residents of Noble County's West Lakes community with flooding issues by helping with coordination between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and local leaders. My team and I have spent time with leaders in Ligonier, helping to address railroad overpass safety issues. And we have helped The Farm, a new charitable organization serving foster children in LaGrange County, with obtaining non-profit status. 
Whether it is local governments, civic organizations or Hoosier families who need federal assistance, my staff and I are ready to serve you. I am proud that this year my office was named one of six finalists, out of 535 congressional offices, for the nonpartisan Congressional Management Foundation's award for Constituent Services. 
I believe in the old adage that “all politics is local.” If my office can assist you or your family with a federal issue, please contact us online at banks.house.gov or give us a call at 260-702-4750.

Health Insurance Open Enrollment: What You Need to Know  
Dear Friends,  
Starting November 1st, you can sign up for affordable health insurance for 2019. 
Why get covered? Because health insurance can protect you from unexpected costs when an accident or illness occurs. Signing up for comprehensive coverage will give you and your family peace of mind, as well as financial security if you or a loved one gets hurt or sick.  
Here’s what you need to know to get covered using the health care marketplace:  
	•	Open enrollment for New Yorkers begins on November 1st and ends on January 31st. You can sign up for coverage or learn more by visiting nystateofhealth.ny.gov or calling 1 (855) 355-5777.
 
	•	Coverage is more affordable than you may think, and you may qualify for financial assistance. Last year, 8-in-10 marketplace shoppers could find premiums for less than $75 per month. 
 
	•	You can find out whether your doctor works with your plan. You can check here – but it’s still a good idea to call your health care provider and confirm these details before you sign up for a plan.
 
	•	If you have questions, help is available. If you’d like to get in touch with a broker or navigator who can help you sign up for insurance, you can search for someone in your area here.  Or, if you’d like to attend an in-person event to learn more, you can find upcoming events in New York City and Westchester County here.   
Accidents and illness can happen at any time – that’s why affordable, comprehensive health insurance is the smart choice.  
I hope you’ll visit nystateofhealth.ny.govstarting November 1st and find a plan that works for you. 
Sincerely, ￼ Eliot L. Engel MEMBER OF CONGRESS

11/1/18 12:31,Big Win for Cherry Farmers,"  
￼

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  Oct 31, 2018
CONTACT: James Hogge 231-640-9158


Congressman Bergman Helps Deliver Big Win For Area Cherry Farmers

Traverse City - On September 12, 2018 Congressman Jack Bergman sent President Donald Trump a letter on behalf of First District cherry farmers, urging the Administration to ""withdraw duty-free benefits under the Generalized System of Preference (GSP) for tart cherry juice from the Republic of Turkey."" 

Yesterday, President Trump began the initial process to end Turkey's duty-free access to the U.S. market. Congressman Jack Bergman issued the following release:

Rep. Bergman stated, “I applaud the Trump Administration for positively answering our request to withdraw the Republic of Turkey's duty-free benefits, siding with Michigan cherry farmers. The tart cherry market is rapidly expanding, largely in part to work that farmers in northern Michigan have been doing. However, unfair trading practices allowed Turkey to dump its  government-subsidized product into the United States, nearly crushing our domestic tart cherry industry. Removing Turkey's duty-free status is great news for the agriculture community in the First District, but there's still more work to do to ensure a level playing field in all of our nation's trade practices.""

Ben LaCross of Leelanau Fruit Company stated, ""Michigan tart cherry growers applaud President Trump‘s move to revoke duty-free trade status for Turkish tart cherry juice. This is the best news cherry farmers have received in years. As a young cherry farmer, it is important for my farm’s long-term success that US farmers are able to sell our crop in the United States.
""Congressman Bergman has been a key ally in helping cherry farmers communicate our issues to the Trump administration. Our work is not done, though. Turkey’s farmers are still highly subsidized, and they will still be able to sell in the US market at below the cost of production. This is unfair to US farmers, and we will continue to fight for fair trade.""

11/1/18 12:23,Update from Rep. Collins: Getting FBI Answers & Record High Wages,"
￼ 



November 1, 2018 

Dear Friend,
Over the last two years, America has been making an incredible comeback, and we've seen the benefits at play in Northeast Georgia. I'm thankful to hear from local communities about the issues that matter to them. If you've got questions about what's happening in our economy or the latest news about the Department of Justice and FBI, this letter is full of updates and resources that I hope you find helpful. 
Getting Answers from the DOJ & FBI 
The House Judiciary Committee has oversight over the Department of Justice (DOJ) and FBI, and I take my duties as part of that committee seriously. Over the last year, I've questioned Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, FBI Director Wray, and Peter Strzok himself about the role Strzok played in the Clinton and Russia investigations. 
I've also personally pursued answers from the FBI about whether Strzok's access to extremely sensitive information was ended when the FBI's own protocol required it to be cut off. As it turns out, Strzok's polygraph exam was expired for 101 days while he led the Clinton investigation, but his top-level security clearance was not revoked at that time—even though it should have been. Again, after Strzok was removed from the Russia investigation, he maintained access to highly sensitive information for at least eight months, even though FBI rules prohibited that access. You can read more about the successful work the Judiciary Committee has been doing on this front here. 
￼
￼
This June, I had the opportunity to question Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and FBI Director Wray about Peter Strzok's investigative role. This line of questioning eventually led to the revelation that Strzok maintained access to sensitive information that he should not have had, access that was finally cut off.  
  
3.5% Rise in GDP as Tax and Regulatory Reform Pay Off
￼
The latest numbers for economic growth are in, and 2018 has seen real GDP increase over the third quarters of 2016 and 2017. The Wall Street Journal reports that this 3.5% growth ""stands as fresh evidence that growth has picked up from subpar levels closer to 2% that had prevailed for much of the long-running U.S. expansion since 2009."" At the same time, wages have jumped more over the last year—3.1%—than they have in a decade. 
What's helping fuel this growth? Last December, I voted for and President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and businesses have spent this year creating new jobs and making new bonus payments to their employees. One retired couple in Habersham County, for example, told me that they work part time jobs for ""fun"" and each received $500 bonuses because of tax reform. 
I championed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act so that Northeast Georgians can keep more of what they earn, and the economy is expanding at 3.5% because Americans are reinvesting that money in goods and services right here at home. I also continue to support commonsense regulatory reform efforts that Congress and the Trump Administration have made to give American job creators a fairer chance to succeed in the free market. 

￼
Last Friday, fifth-graders at Mt. Vernon Elementary greeted me with great questions about America's legislative branch. I hope the copies of the U.S. Constitution I shared with these students inspire them to continue growing into engaged, informed citizens.

Representing the priorities of Georgia's 9th District remains a humbling responsibility. If you'd like to keep up with the latest news about the policy improvements I support and why they matter to Northeast Georgia, I invite you to sign up for my regular newsletters. You can also follow me on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.

11/1/18 11:45,Getting Results for Hoosiers: 50 Provisions Signed Into Law,"
 
Click here to open this message in your browser    
￼ 

Dear Hoosier, 
As the hired help for Indiana, I have brought a bipartisan, pragmatic approach to the Senate, where I work to solve problems and address issues important to Indiana and our country. 
Last week, I was pleased President Trump signed five more of my provisions into law. Since I started in the Senate in 2013, 50 of my provisions have become law, including 28 since President Trump took office. 
From efforts to combat the opioid abuse epidemic and providing mental health resources for our servicemembers and law enforcement officers, to giving patients the right to try and access potentially life-saving treatments, I have worked together with Hoosiers to make life a little better for the people of our state. Importantly, the legislation demonstrates the good we can accomplish when we work together. 
￼ 
Some of my legislation that has been signed into law: 
Giving patients the ‘Right to Try’ 
	•	In May, President Trump signed into law my bipartisan ‘Right to Try’ legislation which gives patients the right to try and access potentially life-saving treatments. I worked with Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) on this effort as well as the McLinn family of Indianapolis, whose son Jordan has Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
Combating the opioid epidemic 
	•	Recently, President Trump signed into law the bipartisan SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which included four of my provisions. One of these provisions creates incentives for substance use disorder providers to work in areas that have high overdose rates, or a shortage of treatment providers. And, working with Senator Todd Young, two of our provisions that are now law will help to expand the use of non-opioid alternatives, and encourage the development of non-addictive treatments.
Improving Access to Mental Health Resources 
	•	Suicide claimed more than 1,000 lives in Indiana last year. One of my priorities in the Senate has been to improve mental health and wellness services for servicemembers and law enforcement officers. The first bill I introduced in the Senate – the Jacob Sexton Military Suicide Prevention Act, which was signed into law in 2014, requires all servicemembers to receive an annual mental health assessment.
	•	In 2015, I introduced the bipartisan “Care Package"", which aimed to improve mental health outcomes for servicemembers and ensure they have access to quality mental health care whether they seek private sector care through specially-trained community mental health providers or through the Department of Defense. Its provisions became law as part of the 2015 and 2016 annual national defense bills.
	•	Our law enforcement officers put their lives on the line to protect and serve communities in Indiana and across the country every day, and sometimes they experience challenging or even horrific situations. My bipartisan Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act, which I introduced with Senator Todd Young, will help law enforcement agencies to establish or enhance mental health services for their officers. It was signed into law earlier this year.
	•	It is essential we make it easier for anyone in crisis to connect with the mental health resources they might need. I was proud to join Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) to introduce the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act, which aims to reform and improve the national suicide prevention lifeline system and Veterans Crisis Line, including to see if a 3-digit number would be easier for people to access. It was signed into law in August.
We know we can achieve more when we work together. I am proud to represent all Hoosiers in the Senate and will continue to work on bipartisan, commonsense policies for our state. If there is anything I can do, please do not hesitate to contact my office at 317-226-5555 or email me here. 
 
Sincerely, 
￼ 
Senator Joe Donnelly

The big secret about the Affordable Care Act: It’s working just fine  The Washington Post  On Thursday, the Affordable Care Act health-insurance exchanges open for the sixth year. A well-kept secret about them is hiding in plain sight: Despite the Trump administration’s best sabotage efforts, the exchanges are succeeding. Indeed, by almost every metric, the exchanges are now stable and even thriving. Just days before an election in which health care is a top issue, this important point has been almost totally ignored.  Corker on migrant caravan: Republicans 'using fear to stimulate' midterm voter turnout  Tennessean  Retiring U.S. Sen. Bob Corker delivered a soft rebuke to his party on Wednesday, describing as a scare tactic some Republicans' use of the migrant caravan in their final midterm election campaigning. ""Let's face it,"" said Corker to reporters in Nashville. ""We all know what's happening. It's all about revving up the base, using fear to stimulate people to come out at the polls.""   Early vote totals in at least 17 states already surpass 2014 turnout at this point  The Washington Post  Americans have already voted in record numbers in many states in this year’s midterm elections, confirming the heightened interest in the fight for control of Congress and state houses playing out in dozens of bitterly contested races.  Tennessee set its highest mark for ACT test scores. Here's why that matters to students, the state.  Tennessean  Tennessee students had the highest ACT composite score ever, edging last year's number by a tenth of a point. The 2018 ACT composite score of 20.2 sets a new standard for the state as it has inched toward its goal of bringing student averages to a 21 on the standardized exam by 2020.  We need your help to diagnose the health of Nashville  Tennessean  But, when we look deeper, what do we find? The honest answer is, it’s difficult to make an accurate diagnosis of Nashville’s health. The information needed simply isn’t available. That’s why the Metro Public Health Department and NashvilleHealth have launched the Nashville Community Health + Well-being Survey, a foundational, county-wide survey of the health of Davidson County residents.  U.S. and Britain Seek Yemen Cease-Fire as Relations With Saudis Cool  The New York Times  The calls for a halt to the conflict — by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday night, his British counterpart, Jeremy Hunt, on Wednesday, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis starting last weekend — came as criticism of Saudi Arabia has surged over its bombing campaign in Yemen and the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a dissident Saudi writer.   Blackburn, Bredesen say halting birthright citizenship by executive order unconstitutional  Tennessean  With less than a week until the Nov. 6 general election, Republican U.S. Senate nominee Marsha Blackburn and Democrat Phil Bredesen have found common ground on at least one issue: that President Donald Trump's plan to sign an executive order to end birthright citizenship would be unconstitutional.    Can Nashville’s Service Industry Problems Be Solved?  Nashville Scene  Lipscomb and Fisk — both launching hospitality management education programs — plan to find out.  Sentenced to 17 years for low-level drug charge, Nashville man gets freedom thanks to deal with prosecutors   Tennessean  The young man got a 17-year sentence for a non-violent drug offense committed in 2008. It was his first criminal charge, but his penalty matched sentences typically doled out to people convicted of rape or second-degree murder. A state law that is now seen as discriminatory allowed prosecutors to tack on extra time because Bryant sold party drugs within 1,000 feet of a school.  Trump smacks Ryan for questioning his birthright citizenship plan  POLITICO  President Donald Trump on Wednesday shot back at House Speaker Paul Ryan for criticizing his proposal to upend birthright citizenship, saying Ryan should be paying attention to the midterm elections instead.      Sincerely, ￼  Jim Cooper

11/1/18 11:06,Congressman Hank Johnson on the Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooting,"







































￼
￼ ￼ ￼￼ ￼￼ ￼￼￼ 

Dear Friends, 
 
In light of last weekend’s devastating shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue, I stand in solidarity with my Jewish brothers and sisters. Today, my heart is with the families and friends sitting shiva for their loved ones who were taken from them too soon. The Tree of Life Synagogue was targeted because of its members’ love for their fellow man — it was on HIAS’s list of Jewish “Welcome Campaign” communities who pledged to accept refugees to the United States. This selfless generosity and willingness to reach out to other humans in need earned the congregation love and respect over the years, and it is tragic that it should be attacked for the good it has done for the country and the world. 
 
It’s time for people of all faiths to stand together. Yes, in grief, but also with the collective understanding that the principles that power faith can transcend those that would tear America apart. To rise beyond evil, we must realize that only together can we overcome fear. When we are united, we can teach those who would be seduced by racism, by anti-Semitism, or by xenophobia, that hatred has no place in the United States. 
 
We cannot let senseless tragedies powered by hate become commonplace — the rise of white nationalism around the country must be stopped before it’s too late. It’s time for Congress to investigate the rise of hate crimes and find solutions to the brewing crisis before us. We cannot be bystanders to our own destruction, and we cannot insult the memory of our brothers and sisters by refusing to take action in the wake of their deaths.   
 
We must conquer hate with love.

Weekly Newsletter  
Dear Friend, 
If you drive from one end of our district to the other, north-to-south or east-to-west, you'll notice one thing we have a lot of: farms. Agriculture spans the length of our district, employing farmers, ranchers, and many more people whose line of work supports the agricultural industry.  
I'm proud of our state's agricultural heritage, and I recognize how important farmers and ranchers are not only to our economy and our way of life, but also to our value system. We learn a lot from the men and women who grow our food everyday--hard work, family focus, perseverance, faith, and much more. 
That's why our efforts in Congress to support the agricultural industry are so important. Here's a recap of some of those legislative items:  
Farm Bill 
I supported the House version of the Farm Bill. The legislation helps farmers and ranchers and also includes reforms to the food stamp program, implementing common-sense work requirements to prevent fraud. Currently, the House and Senate are still negotiating a compromise package. 
￼
We need to continue working in Congress to create an environment where Colorado's farmers and ranchers can thrive.
Improving Water Storage 
As our population grows, we must ensure that everyone, especially farmers and ranchers, have access to water. But too often, water storage projects face multi-year delays due to duplicative and overlapping permitting requirements. For example, the Northern Integrated Supply Project (NISP) has faced a decade of delays as it moves slowly through the permitting process. The House passed the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act to address these problems, placing the Bureau of Reclamation with the Department of the Interior in charge of streamlining the process. I also co-sponsored the Permitting Litigation Efficiency Act of 2018, which sets a two-year deadline on permitting applications. 
WATER Act 
I've written a lot about the WATER Act, and I'm excited it passed the House this year. The legislation, which I introduced, amends the tax code, making water more affordable for farmers and ranchers who rely on mutual irrigation and ditch companies.
Fighting the Estate Tax 
I co-sponsored H.R. 631, the Death Tax Repeal Act, for two reasons. First, Colorado families should be able to pass along their life's work to their children and grandchildren. Second, income should not be taxed twice--once at the point of earning it and again at death. 
Congress needs to keep working on ways to support farmers and ranchers. And we need your help! Please share your policy ideas with me. Call my office at 202-225-4676 or send me an email through my website.  
Keep an eye on my website for more upcoming events. And as always, for more frequent updates on legislation and events, please follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. I look forward to hearing from you; please do not hesitate to contact my Greeley, Castle Rock, or Washington office should you need any assistance. If you'd like to send me a message, you can do so on my website. 
Sincerely, 
￼

￼ 
FIGHTING FOR FINN
￼ 
Lindsey - 
Finn, a healthy 9-year-old standard poodle, escaped from his backyard near the North Fork of the St. Lucie River for just 20 minutes. Less than 48 hours later, he had passed away from acute toxicity due to ingestion of blue-green algae. 
Sammy, a 7-year-old golden retriever, escaped through her fence and made a beeline into the St. Lucie River. Almost right away, she went into cardiac arrest. Her life was saved after 10 days at the hospital, including six plasma transfusions. 
Costa, a 4-year-old golden retriever, got into the river near her house and ingested algae. Less than an hour later, she began vomiting and then collapsed. She had acute liver failure and heart arrhythmias. Vets saved her life. 
Pandora, a 2-year-old miniature pomeranian, ate a dead catfish. Within hours, she collapsed into her water bowl. She spent nearly a week with the vet while they tried to figure out what was wrong. Algae nearly killed her. 
Sadly, these dogs are just the tip of the iceberg. Animals are dying, people are getting sick and our environment is being decimated. Worst of all, its 100% preventable. 
We know there are special interests who will stop at nothing - even dead dogs - to maintain the status quo. But, I'm confident that together, we can overcome the opposition and instill health and human safety as the top priority for the management of Lake Okeechobee. 
It's the same willpower that got us authorization for the EAA Southern Storage Reservoir. It's that willpower that got us a re-write of the Lake O discharge schedule. It's the willpower that has secured hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for our clean water cause. 
Our fight is far from over, but we can put an end to the discharges. 
Watch the newest Tortured Coast episode to hear more about the legacy of these dogs and how they're helping turn the tide in our fight for clean water:

11/1/18 8:19,Heathcare Open Enrollment Begins Today,"￼ 
 


Dear Lindsey,
Today is the first day of open enrollment for the Health Insurance Marketplace. Whether you’re uninsured and looking to find coverage, or would like to explore the available options, you can use the Marketplace to find coverage that works for you. The open enrollment period is shorter than in previous years, and the final deadline for enrollment is December 15th. So, don’t miss your chance to get covered!
￼
During the open enrollment period, you can visit www.HealthCare.gov to create an account, find coverage that works with your budget, and meets your needs. You can also see what financial help you may qualify for. If you have Marketplace coverage currently, you have the opportunity to review your application to ensure it’s up to date and report any life changes. 
Quality coverage is more affordable than you may think. Last year, 8 in 10 people qualified for financial help. The Marketplace and expansion of the Medicaid program helped cut the U.S. uninsured rate down to a historic 8.8 percent. We can build on this progress by getting even more people covered, helping to lower health coverage costs for all Americans.
Find a policy that brings you and your family peace of mind, and will provide no-cost preventative care. Before the Marketplace, high medical bills were the leading cause of personal bankruptcies. Now, you can be prepared for routine, preventative, and unexpected medical costs.
If you have any questions about signing up, or want to talk to a trained Marketplace navigator, free help is just a call or click away. To apply and enroll quickly online, visit www.HealthCare.gov, or call the Marketplace call center 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at 1-800-318-2596. A representative will be able to assist you in the enrollment process as well as to answer any questions you may have. There are also trained representatives you can speak with in person if you have questions. Visit www.Localhelp.HealthCare.gov to find a representative near you.
