Sixth District Report
￼ 
Dear Friend, 
After more than four years of collaboration with families of those who lived and worked at Camp Nelson, along with community stakeholders and others, I was proud to welcome Department of the Interior (DOI) Secretary Ryan Zinke to Jessamine County on October 27, 2018, to announce that President Trump has designated the Camp Nelson Civil War Heritage Park as Kentucky's first National Monument. 
This designation, the first President Trump has signed, will provide the community with resources to preserve and share the story of Camp Nelson for generations to come. 
I am proud to advocate for Camp Nelson, a site which has the ability to unite the American people. I appreciate the community stakeholders and Camp Nelson descendants for their dedication to securing this designation and I would like to thank President Trump and Secretary Zinke for their recognition of this historical site.

Fighting Kentucky's Opioid Crisis 
￼ 
On October 24, 2018, President Trump signed into law the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, another significant legislative package to address our nation's opioid crisis by strengthening our communities' prevention, treatment, and recovery initiatives.  
In 2016, more than 1,400 Kentuckians died of an opioid overdose and we owe it to these families to provide the resources needed to combat this heartbreaking crisis that is devastating communities throughout the Commonwealth. After months of bipartisan work, this critical legislation will provide Kentucky with the tools to prevent the flow of illegal drugs into our communities and better equip our law enforcement and local officials with the support needed to stop drug trafficking and substance abuse throughout Kentucky's communities. 
I was proud this legislative package included my bill, the CAREER Act, which was inspired by the work of many successful transitional housing models in the Sixth District, such as Chrysalis House, Recovery Kentucky, St. James Place, and Shepherd's House. Specifically, my legislation will encourage businesses and treatment centers to form partnerships to secure job training, employment, and housing options for individuals in recovery. To read more about this historic legislation, click here. 
Discussions on the Importance of Border Security   
￼ 
On October 17, House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul (TX-10) joined me and other law enforcement officials for a roundtable to discuss the importance of border security in the fight against drug trafficking and substance abuse in Kentucky's communities. 
The Commonwealth is particularly devastated by the flow of illegal, illicit drugs into our communities. Throughout this crisis, I have heard from law enforcement officials about the need for stronger border security to better control this epidemic and save Kentucky lives. It was a pleasure to have my friend and colleague Chairman McCaul in the Sixth District and it was a great opporunity to hear from those on the front lines of this crisis. 
Helping Secure Grants Across Central and Eastern Kentucky 
This month, I had the honor of joining many organizations throughout the Sixth District to announce the awarding of multiple federal grants. One of my priorities in Congress is to ensure federal dollars are returned back to the community. 
￼ 
Our communities' first responders put their lives on the line every day to keep Kentuckians safe. For this reason, it was great to join the City of Irvine Fire Department to announce a $27,500 grant which was used to purchase a new fire engine. Thank you go all of our first responders for serving our communities!  
￼ 
On October 24, I was proud to visit the City of Campton to announce the awarding of a $635,367 Appalachian Regional Commission grant to begin the Campton Tank Replacement Project to provide residents, businesses, and one public school with access to clean water. 
￼ 
I was also proud to help secure a $500,000 Appalachian Regional Commission grant for the City of Stanton to update the it's sewer service line, which will better equip the city's infrastructure for even further economic development in the future. 
￼ 
On October 11, I congratulated Chrysalis House and Executive Director Lisa Minton, pictured above, for receiving a $29,740 grant, which will be used to expand their residential substance abuse treatment centers by establishing a new facility for pregnant and postpartum women and their children overcoming addiction. 
￼ 
Finally, I joined Voices of Hope in Lexington to announce the awarding of a $129,120 State Targeted Response grant, which will be used to support its new community center and peer-to-peer recovery coaching for those overcoming substance abuse throughout Central Kentucky. 
Additional Photos and Videos Around Kentucky's Sixth District
￼ 
It was great to discuss the results we are delivering to Kentucky families and small businesses with the Rotary Club of Lexington on October 25. As a result of our pro-growth policies, unemployment is the lowest since 1969 and consumer confidence is at an 18-year high.
￼ 
I had the honor of attending the AgTech Scientific Industrial Hemp groundbreaking in Bourbon County on October 18. I am proud to support the Industrial Hemp Pilot Program as it has created vast economic opportunity for the Commonwealth, and I look forward to the future developments and research advances this new facility will contribute to a variety of hemp products. 
￼ 
I joined UK Federal Credit Union to discuss the new era of economic prosperity and the importance of community credit unions in giving Kentuckians' access to credit to finance their American Dream.    
￼ 
During opening weekend of Keeneland, I joined TVG to discuss Kentucky's signature thoroughbred industry and the benefits of our new tax code for this key industry. I also discussed my advocacy for equine-assisted therapy, which pairs our veterans with horses, including retired thoroughbred race horses, as a way for our returning heroes to recover from the invisible scars of combat.

ABORTION RATES ON THE RISE IN OHIO
The Ohio Department of Health (ODH) recently released a report entitled “Induced Abortions in Ohio.”The annual report contained statistics on the 20,893 induced pregnancy terminations that occurred in Ohio in 2017.  This new figure indicates a one percent increase in induced abortions from 2016 to 2017. Furthermore, of the 14 counties I represent, in full or part, in Northwest and West Central Ohio there were nearly 1,200 abortions obtained last year.  
In addition, there were 454 abortion involving pregnancies of 19 or more completed weeks of gestation.  It’s saddening to know that many of these 454 abortions could have been stopped if H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, became law.  In October 2017, I joined 236 of my colleagues in the House of Representatives to pass H.R. 6, which would prohibit abortions on unborn babies 20 weeks or older. Medical evidence suggests that at 20 weeks an unborn child can feel pain by this stage of development.  Unfortunately, the Senate has yet to act on this legislation. 
While an increase in abortion is discouraging, there is hope in knowing that since 2001 there has been a steady decline in pregnancy terminations with an annual decline averaging approximately 830 per year.  I will continue to fight alongside advocates and pro-life Members of Congress to support a culture of life and encourage the end of elective abortion.    ODH REDUCES FINE ON TOLEDO ABORTION PROVIDER
On October 10th, the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) released a Hearing Examiner’s Report and Recommendation that proposes reducing the fine levied against the Capital Care Network of Toledo from $40,000 to $3,000.  You may recall that Capital Care Network was fined after ODH determined the provider put a patient’s health and safety in danger.  The report indicated that it was unclear to the physician if the patient suffered from a perforated bowel due to a botched abortion performed at Capital Care Network.  The physician determined that the patient should receive further testing at a hospital and then had a staff member drive the patient to a hospital in their personal car.  However, after further investigation ODH could not prove many of the violations outlined in their original report, which led to a recommendation to the ODH Director to reduce the penalty to $3,000.   2019 MARCH FOR LIFE
Please mark your calendars to attend the 2019 March for Life rally on Friday, January 18, 2019 in Washington, D.C. I will be hosting an open house for constituents who are visiting the area to support the pro-life movement.  Please be on the lookout for more details in next month’s newsletter.

10/31/18 17:30,Legislative Update: Congressman Panetta,"￼￼ 

  Dear Neighbor,   
As your United States Representative, I am providing you with an update about some of the work that I have done on behalf of the central coast of California over the last couple of months. From authoring and introducing legislation that benefits our local economy, to voting to fund clean energy priorities and raise our troops’ wages, to encouraging community members to participate in the public comment period on the Administration’s public charge proposal, to earning a 100% rating from the Human Rights Campaign for my record to support LGBTQ Equality, it is an honor to serve the people of the Central Coast and represent our values in Washington, D.C.  

In our nation, there are certain groups and people that thrive on divisiveness. In order to overcome such disunity and hate, we not only must stand up and speak out against any violence, rhetoric, and racism, but we also must step up to make our voices and choices heard. Throughout the history of our nation, our leaders provided guidance during difficult times. Unfortunately, there also are those that fail to confront moments of crisis with moral leadership and clarity. That is why it is important to demand that all elected officials, no matter what office they hold, promote civil discourse and the ability to be bipartisan in order to set the tone and mood for our communities and country. By ensuring that our political leaders are civil, we are upholding our civic duties and responsibilities of living in this democracy that is of, by, and for the people.
  Authored Legislation To Support Veterans   I am proud to have authored and introduced two bipartisan bills to support our student veterans on college campuses. The Veterans Resource Center Act would authorize grants for Veterans Resource Centers to advise, assist, and support military-connected students and encourage priority registration for veterans. I co-introduced the GI Bill Transfer Extension Act, legislation that will increase flexibility for service members seeking to transfer their GI Bill education benefits. I will continue to work to support veterans and their families in their pursuit of higher education.  ￼  Announcing the introduction of my legislation on the Veterans Resource Center Act at California State University Monterey Bay.   Authored Legislation To Support Our Agriculture  I authored and introduced the Farmworker Housing Improvement Act to increase Central Coast farmworkers’ access to affordable housing. My legislation will address current challenges by strengthening the Farm Labor Housing Loan and Grant Program, improving access to information for local non-profits, and increasing quality housing options for our farmworker community.  I authored and introduced the Specialty Crop Mechanization Prize Challenge Act to spur innovation of agriculture technology to support our local agriculture industry and improve farmworkers’ harvesting methods. The legislation encourages the private sector to engage with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to develop mechanization technology that can alleviate stress on farmworkers or automates activities where workers are not available. It does so by directing the Secretary of Agriculture to establish prize competitions that incentivize the development of this technology.  ￼  Joined Rep. Rodney Davis (R-IL), fellow co-chair and co-founder of the Agriculture Research Caucus, to speak to the United Fresh Produce Association about bipartisanship, the Farm Bill, immigration reform, and the benefits of research in agriculture.   Authored Legislation To Protect The Special Counsel  I authored and introduced the Special Counsel Security Clearance Protection Act to prevent the unwarranted revocation of the security clearances of Special Counsel Robert Mueller or his any of his team during the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Currently, the Office of the President claims the authority to revoke an individual’s security clearance for any reason at any time. The legislation requires independent judicial approval of any decision to revoke the security clearance of a special counsel. Moreover, any revocation must be for cause and consistent with U.S. national security interests.   Secured Funding For Pajaro River Levee Repairs  I fought for and secured federal funding in order for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to repair damage to the Pajaro River levee caused by the winter storms in 2017. I was pleased to tour the recently completed restorations. I will continue to work with local stakeholders to break through federal bureaucracy to ensure improved flood protection for the residents of Pajaro and Watsonville.  ￼  Viewing the recent repairs to the Pajaro Levee in Watsonville.   Secured A Grant For Housing On The Central Coast  I fought for and secured a federal grant totaling $205,950 from the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development for the Housing Authority of the County of Monterey. The grant provides Mainstream housing vouchers for affordable housing and an array of supportive services for non-elderly persons with disabilities.    Secured A Grant For Substance Abuse Treatment On The Central Coast  I fought for and secured a federal grant totaling $504,691 from the Department of Health and Human Services Center of Substance Abuse Treatment for Janus of Santa Cruz. These funds will be used for an integrated residential substance use disorder treatment program for pregnant and postpartum women and their families in Santa Cruz County.   Secured Grants For Agriculture On The Central Coast 
 I fought for and secured a USDA grant totaling $40,000 for the El Pajaro Community Development Corporation and a USDA grant totaling $38,000 for the Agriculture and Land-Based Training Association. The grants will be used to increase economic security in the region and provide skill building and business education opportunities for aspiring entrepreneurs. In order for the central coast of California to remain the Salad Bowl of the World, investments must be made to ensure that the next generation of farmers, ranchers, and small business owners have the resources that they need to succeed. These grants will help our agricultural industry and rural economies continue to thrive by providing opportunities for entrepreneurs on the Central Coast.   Fighting For Immigration Reform On The Central Coast  I was proud to welcome U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein to the Central Coast, where we toured Monterey Mushrooms, Inc. in Royal Oaks. We spoke with farmers from the Central Coast and California’s Central Valley and farmworkers, including the leadership of the United Farm Workers, about the challenges they face due to the lack of immigration reform. The Senator and I talked about the importance of passing immigration reform, including the Blue Card Bill, which she introduced in the Senate and I was an original co-sponsor in the House. That bill would provide farmworkers with a work authorization and an earned legal status if they show consistent employment in U.S. agriculture. During the discussion, the Senator directly asked for my continued leadership on the bill. I look forward to continuing to work with the Senator and others in Congress to pass legislation on immigration reform that benefits those who contribute so much to our community and country.  ￼  Touring Monterey Mushrooms with Senator Feinstein, farmers, and farmworkers.   Working To Protect And Improve Our Healthcare  I met with local healthcare leaders on the Central Coast to discuss ways to protect and improve the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including the preservation of coverage for pre-existing conditions. I shared the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus principles to save the individual market with the group. I will continue to meet with our local experts to gather evidence for ways to improve access to healthcare and lower healthcare costs.  ￼  Discussing the challenges facing our healthcare markets and developing solutions that improve options in Monterey County. 
 The 2019 Open Enrollment Period for the Affordable Care Act runs from Thursday, November 1, 2018, to Saturday, December 15, 2018. Learn more here.    Mobile Office Hours For October And November  
Mobile office hours are an opportunity for members of the community to meet with Congressional staff, and are offered in addition to meetings in the Salinas and Santa Cruz Congressional offices.

Dear Lindsey, 
Over the weekend, we witnessed a vile attack on our community unlike any we have ever seen: An armed gunman driven by hatred and anger entered the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh and opened fire on the gathered congregation, killing 11 individuals and injuring six more. These victims were wives, husbands, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, and grandparents. One fallen victim was a constituent of the Twelfth District. Anti-Semitism is a scourge on humanity and assaults every American value we cherish.
￼   There is no place for violence in our country. This evil must end. To the entire Jewish community of Pittsburgh, and all our Jewish friends, we stand with you in solidarity against this hatred. 
No one should have to fear for their lives when practicing their beliefs. No one should have to endure what the congregation of the Tree of Life Synagogue did. The perpetuated violence on the Jewish community of Pittsburgh was not just reprehensible, it was pure evil.
The people of Pittsburgh, Western Pennsylvania, and all America are strong and resilient, and we will not be beat down by this hatred. Elsie and I continue to pray for all those affected by this tragedy, and that our criminal justice system will also act swiftly to bring justice against this criminal. Together, the community of Squirrel hill and all Western Pennsylvania will stand resolved and united in rebuilding a culture of dignity and respect. 
If there is anything my staff and I can do for you, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office at 412-837-1361 or go to my website at rothus.house.gov.  
 Sincerely,  ￼                                                Keith

10/31/18 15:21,restoring civility & rebuilding trust,"
 
￼

Good afternoon, 

Last night, I was with the congregation of Temple Beth Shalom in Spokane. Together, we prayed for strength for the Jewish community in Pittsburgh and for their friends and families. We also prayed for a return to civility and for peace. That requires everyone doing their part to see the best in others, not the worst. It requires not giving into fear, and requires protecting and preserving the values we so deeply cherish as a nation. 

This is not a nation of antisemitism. This is not a nation of violence and hatred. America is where you are free to speak, free to worship, and free to dream - and we must stand up to anyone or anything that tries to prevent that. 

That's why, in a time where there is so much anger and hostility - when the political discourse and rhetoric threaten to tear our communities apart - I have made it a priority to bring people together and work to bridge the gaps that divide us. My goal is to help lead the healing that needs to happen in our country and in our community. 

Over the past year, I've been hosting Unity Dinners with people throughout Eastern Washington. The dinner table has a way of breaking down barriers between people. Everyone has a story to share. Many people have experienced deep pain, heartache and loss whether financial, health or family. But by being kind and caring for one another, we can offer each other hope and encouragement to continue on.

I have also co-hosted the Peaceful Community Roundtable here in Spokane to bring a diverse group of leaders together and discuss priorities for Spokane to build a stronger, safer community. We don't just talk about problems, we talk about solutions.

It's important to remember that there is more that unites us than divides us. Our shared values of liberty, justice, and equality of opportunity are stronger than anything. We can't and shouldn't go at it alone. 
Thanks, ￼ Cathy McMorris Rodgers Member of Congress

Dear Lindsey, 
Our nation is in mourning. 
We mourn the eleven lives stolen from us in the anti-Semitic attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. We mourn the two African Americans killed in a racially-motivated shooting in Kentucky.
And all of us were horrified by the mail bombs targeting prominent Democratic officials and the media. 
Sadly, these are not isolated incidents. Just one year ago, white supremacists marched on Charlottesville, leaving a young woman dead and dozens injured.
Hate is on the rise. And rather than combat it, the White House has further sown the seeds of division. 
Time after time, President Trump has exploited xenophobia and racism for political gain. 
We must demand better from our elected officials. 
This is a time for our nation to reject hate, and for our leaders to bring us together. 
The election is next week. You can make your voice heard. 
Please know that I am here for you. I will keep fighting in Congress to ensure all people -- regardless of their skin color, their religion, or their zip code -- are treated with dignity and respect.
As always, my office is happy to assist you and your family. If you need help with a federal issue, please call my Oakland office at (510) 763-0370. You can also connect with me via email, facebook, twitter, and Instagram. 
In Solidarity,

Major Federal Grants Announced for Rural Medical Delivery

Munising - The United States Department of Agriculture is awarding over $400,000 in grants to increase access to health care services. Two of these grants have been awarded within Michigan's First District. Congressman Jack Bergman stated, ""The rural nature of the First District provides many challenges when it comes to quality healthcare delivery. I'm grateful for the work and resources that our federal partners at USDA continue to invest in rural Michigan. This announcement is great news for the First District.""
 In April 2017, President Donald J. Trump established the Interagency Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity to identify legislative, regulatory and policy changes that could promote agriculture and prosperity in rural communities. The goal is to align the federal government with state, local and tribal governments to take advantage of opportunities that exist in rural America. Increasing investments in rural infrastructure is a key recommendation of the task force.  The recipients of these grants are listed below:  Munising Memorial Hospital - $303,337 
This Rural Development investment will be used to purchase telemedicine equipment for six sites in Marquette and Angler counties. New 3D tomosynthesis mammography equipment will replace the outdated 2D mammography equipment technology. The new technology improves cancer detection by 40 percent and will speed up the diagnosis and treatment. The new telemedicine capabilities will impact a population of 2,927 and decrease travel time for patients and provide the most comprehensive breast imaging services, which are not usually available in rural communities. 
Pine Rest Christian Mental Health Service - $102,987
This Rural Development investment will be used to help purchase telemedicine equipment for Pine Rest Christian Mental Health Services which will provide a telehealth network to rural areas of northern Michigan. Rural sites will be connected with larger Pine Rest facilities in Grand Rapids and Traverse City, which provide psychiatry services. The project will also provide access to substance misuse providers based in Marquette and Sault St. Marie. Thirteen sites will have access to state of the art treatment services provided by nine hub sites that have capability of providing a broad range of medical services and treatment options to its service area of 242,191 residents

Dear Friend, 

Taking care of our veterans should always be one of our highest priorities. So when I met with Brian Tally and heard his story about his problem with the VA system, I knew I had to take steps to close this loophole.  

Brian Tally went to the VA for debilitating back pain in January 2016. At the VA he was seen by an independent contractor who sent him away with a bag of pills for the pain. A short time later Brian's condition worsened and he began to fear for his life. He paid for an MRI, and learned he had a staph infection in his spine - an ailment normally discovered through a simple blood test. Brian returned to the VA and was able to get an emergency operation through the VA Choice Act, but the infection had already caused permanent damage - leaving Brian crippled for the rest of his life. 

Brian filed a claim at the VA but since the independent contractor was at fault the VA couldn't do anything for him. His only option was to sue the contractor for medical malpractice. By the time it was all sorted the statute of limitations had already run out, and Brian was prohibited from filing suit and receiving compensation. If the malpractice had been done by a VA employee, he would have had an additional year to bring his case to court. 

                       ￼   ￼

So, I worked with Brian and wrote legislation to bring independent VA contractors under the same medical malpractice procedures for other federal employees at the VA. It will increase accountability for employees and contractors who provide care for our veterans. It also ensures that veterans who have been misdiagnosed, neglected, or experienced malpractice will not be left without recourse. 
￼

Brian's story is heartbreaking and should have never happened. But we can make sure his story is not wasted and that all our veterans in the future are protected from this shameful loophole in our system.

Thank you,

Dear Lindsey, 
This is a pivotal time in our country on many issues; it is important for people to participate and make their voices heard. Thank you to everyone who attended one of my 6 fall town hall meetings in Seaside, Tualatin, Newberg, Banks, Scappoose, and Portland!

 I also met with younger constituents—students—at their schools, on Manufacturing Day, and at other events. I enjoyed hearing directly from you and look forward to continuing to work on your behalf in Congress.  ￼ 

Improving the health of our oceans
￼
The ocean is resilient and we can help it heal, but we cannot continue to ignore the garbage polluting our oceans and shores. I worked with my House Oceans Caucus Co-Chair, Congressman Don Young, on the bipartisan Save Our Seas Act, which passed both the House and Senate with strong bipartisan support. This bill was signed into law in early October, and will assist local communities and states in removing garbage and debris from our oceans and coastline. Marine debris is preventable, and this law will help protect the health of our oceans. 
I was also thrilled to help enact a provision to restore more than 50 acres of salmon habitat on Clatsop County’s Walluski River. This provision was signed into law as part of the new bipartisan Water Resources Development Act. Salmon are an important part of our heritage in the Pacific Northwest, but old, unnecessary levees on our rivers and waterways have turned some salmon habitat into farm or pasture land. Because of this provision, the Columbia River Estuary Study Taskforce will be able to lead habitat restoration projects and smart infrastructure upgrades to protect the environment and make sure that salmon will continue to be there for generations to come. 
 ￼ 

Strengthening protections for airline passengers
When people travel by air, they often experience lost luggage, delays, or other complications that are entirely out of their control. Thanks to a provision I led that was signed into law, the Federal Aviation Administration will create a new Aviation Consumer Advocate position to make sure that all airline passengers have someone on their side to help tackle problems they face while flying. The Advocate will help consumers navigate the system, resolve difficulties, and alleviate some of the stress that comes with unexpected complications. 
 ￼

Standing up for student loan borrowers
￼
Education is always one of my top priorities, and this includes protecting the rights of student loan borrowers. This month, Senator Elizabeth Warren and I led our colleagues in the House and Senate to send the following message to Sec. Betsy DeVos: stop putting profits ahead of students. We demanded that Sec. DeVos provide the full set of documents that the Department of Education used as the basis for the Department’s decision to reinstate an accreditor that has a troubling history of failing to protect students from predatory for-profit colleges. I will continue to hold Sec. DeVos accountable.

10/31/18 12:28,An update from Congressman Chris Collins,"￼ 
Dear Friend,
Here is a quick update on what I have been working on during a busy few weeks in Washington D.C. and Western New York.

￼ 

President Donald Trumped signed H.R 6 SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act into law
On October 24th, President Donald Trump signed into law H.R 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. This bipartisan legislation is crucial for the fight against the opioid epidemic that is devastating the lives of Americans across the country. Included in this package are several bipartisan legislative initiatives I have or co-authored with my colleagues.

President Donald Trump's Revision of NAFTA
President Trump reached a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada called the U.S-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This agreement will make important changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that will put the U.S. on a more equal playing field with other nations. Importantly, this will end Canada's unfair Class 7 pricing that harms Western New York's diary industry.

The NRA score of A+
￼ 
The National Rifle Association has given me an A+ rating for protecting the Second Amendment rights and freedoms. I am honored to receive this rating once again because I believe in the  law-abiding gun owners constitutional rights. 
National Federation of Independent Business Award
￼ 
I’m honored to have received the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Guardian of Small Business Award.

I’ve always been a strong supporter of small business and free enterprise and thank the NFIB for their advocacy efforts. 

￼ 

Meeting with WNIL Inc. 
￼ 
Todd and Michael, from WNYIL Inc., stopped by my office to discuss how we can improve services for people with disabilities in our community.
Toured Newtex Industries  
￼ 
I toured Newtex Industries that is located in Victor, New York. Newtex is a global leader in extreme heat resisting materials. Their products are used by our nations military, firefighters, and companies all over the world. I would like to thank Jerry Joliet and the rest of the Newtex team for showing me around the facility. 
Visited the Veterans One Stop Center 
￼ 
I visited the Veterans One Stop Center which is a non-profit place for veterans and their families to have access to social and health services. They bring in organizations and resources to improve the lives of veterans as they integrate into the working field. This allows veterans to have confidence and support while transitioning. They serve over 100,000 veterans in Western New York and it was a great honor to be invited to take a tour of the facility.
Canandaigua Boy Scouts Clays Shoot 
￼ 
￼ 
￼ 
I spent time with the local boy scouts for the Canadaigua Boy Scout Clays Shoot. As an Eagle Scout myself, it is great  to spend time with future leaders of this organization.
Agricultural Round Table 
￼ 
I met with farmers and members of Western New York's agriculture community. This was an opportunity for me to sit down and discuss what Congress still needs to do to improve the lives of our nations farmers. During this meeting, we discussed the future of diary and the upcoming Farm Bill. Additionally, we discussed the impacts of the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) and how it will assist the agricultural industry in the near future. There are still some inattentive issues regarding the impact of  tariffs on our farmers, which I will be working on when Congress is back in session. 
Toured the Dialysis Center Construction at the Livingston County Nursing Home
￼ 
￼ 
￼ 
I had the opportunity to visit the Livingston County Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation. Currently, they are building a dialysis center which will improve the lives of their patients and provide them with comfort. After the tour, I spoke with residents of the community and they presented me with a commemorative plate as a token of their gratitude for visiting. I am pleased to see the improvements the Livingston County Center is making for the community and I want to thank the everyone who I met with.

Capitol Hill Visitors
￼ 
The Northern Border Customs Brokers Association, The NY/NJ Foreign Freight Forwarders, and the Brokers Association stopped by my office to discuss a variety issues that impact Western New York.

LEGISLATION
 
Dear Friend: 
Every day, thousands of Oregonians make the trip to their local pharmacy to fill prescriptions for medications that are vital to their well-being. Unfortunately, patients and their families often pay far too much for prescription drugs that may very well be the difference between life and death. 
That’s why as Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I’ve championed policies that would make these drugs more affordable while also holding companies accountable for their actions. 
Earlier this month, President Trump signed into law two bills that would give patients and pharmacists the ability to find the lowest price when deciding what medications to buy. I first heard about the gag clause issue from Michele, an independent pharmacist from Grants Pass. 
She told me that as a pharmacist she was precluded -- under certain insurance contracts -- from telling a patient that their cash price would be cheaper than going through their insurance. Michele told me that she once even received a cease and desist letter for trying to help a child with a terminal disease access his medication. That is simply unacceptable. 
These new laws pave the way for pharmacists to responsibly advise their patients on the cost of various medications, free from restrictions imposed by take-it-or-leave-it contracts with insurers. Community pharmacists must have the ability to work with their patients to provide them the best access to the medications they need, and these bills will help them do just that. 
It is also vital that we increase competition and spur innovation in order to bring costs down for consumers and provide the next generation of treatment and cures. That’s why my committee led the charge to pass the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act (FDARA), legislation I authored which establishes a pathway to speed the approval of competitive generic drugs and increase competition in the marketplace. We have already seen generic drugs come to market through these new pathways, and prices beginning to drop for consumers on a variety of medications. 
We also must acknowledge the role of prescription drugs in our nation’s opioid epidemic. Each day, nearly 200 Americans die of overdoses and millions more battle addiction often sparked by prescription opioids. 
That is why last year, I opened a bipartisan investigation into the distribution of prescription opioids by wholesale drug distributors and the enforcement practices by the Drug Enforcement Administration during the opioid epidemic. Our investigation uncovered instances where massive quantities of pills were shipped to small, rural towns, and we are now working to develop legislation to ensure this can never happen again. 
Additionally, I opened a second bipartisan investigation into the companies that manufacture opioids. Several of my Republican and Democratic colleagues joined me in sending letters to Insys Therapeutics, Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, and Purdue Pharma regarding their companies’ internal procedures during the height of the prescription opioid crisis. 
While it is vital patients suffering from severe or chronic pain are able to receive the medication they need, every one of us, large companies included, must do everything in our power to prevent over-prescribing of these powerful drugs. We are still in the middle of this investigation, and I will do everything I can to hold these companies accountable for their role in this epidemic. 
Despite the progress that has been made, there’s no doubt that families across Oregon are paying too much for prescription drugs. President Trump has made a commitment to bring these costs down and recently announced several new initiatives to help level the playing field for consumers. 
I commend the President’s steadfast commitment and will continue working with him and my colleagues in Congress to ensure the vital medications so many Oregonians rely on are safer and more affordable than ever and that the United States remains the leader in medical innovation.
It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. Congress.

Trump’s visit to Pittsburgh after synagogue massacre creates tensions in grieving city   The Washington Post  President Trump visited a grief-stricken Pittsburgh on Tuesday in a trip meant to unify after tragedy, but his arrival provoked protests from residents and consternation from local officials in the aftermath of the synagogue shooting that left 11 people dead.
First Up if Democrats Win: Campaign and Ethics Changes, Infrastructure and Drug Prices   New York Times  Democrats would use their first month in the House majority to advance sweeping changes to future campaign and ethics laws, requiring the disclosure of shadowy political donors, outlawing the gerrymandering of congressional districts and restoring key enforcement provisions to the Voting Rights Act, top Democratic leaders said on Tuesday.
Obamacare enrollment opens facing pressure from new Trump attacks   POLITICO The Obamacare sign-up season starting Thursday is the second one overseen by the Trump administration — and the first since the GOP Congress scrapped the controversial individual mandate once thought to be the law’s linchpin.
Two generations of humans have killed off more than half the world’s wildlife populations, report finds   The Washington Post  Human activity has annihilated wildlife on a scale unseen beyond mass extinction, and it has helped put humans on a potentially irreversible path toward a hot, chaotic planet stripped clean of the natural resources that enrich it, a new report has concluded. 
Trump’s proposal to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional   The Washington Post  Sometimes the Constitution’s text is plain as day and bars what politicians seek to do. That’s the case with President Trump’s proposal to end “birthright citizenship” through an executive order. Such a move would be unconstitutional and would certainly be challenged. And the challengers would undoubtedly win.
How the rise of conspiracy theory politics emboldens anti-Semitism   Vox  An environment where conspiracy theories flourish and find new ground is the perfect environment for anti-Semitism itself to flourish and find new acolytes. Anti-Semitism is a distinct form of hate, one deeply rooted in conspiracies about the role Jewish people play in shaping public life. But moreover, anti-Semitism itself is a conspiracy theory.
Low-Income Students Still Struggle To Pay for College, Four Years After Tennessee Promise's Start   WPLN  Tennessee has been praised for making community college more accessible by giving graduating high schoolers free tuition. But schools in the state have found the free college initiatives are not helping many of the lowest-income students, and some are trying to find ways to fill in the gaps.
Ten years later, what has bitcoin achieved?   QZ  Ten years ago today (Oct. 31), Satoshi Nakamoto posted a white paper on a cryptography mailing list, outlining the plan for “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” In the decade since this seminal work, bitcoin has spawned a sprawling cryptocurrency industry, attracted billions of dollars from speculators, and raised fundamental questions about financial privacy and freedom. It also inspired blockchain hype, the results of which we are yet to see.
Edmund Zagorski's life on death row: 'He is the embodiment of spiritual grace'   Tennessean  Edmund Zagorski is guilty of killing two men in 1983 — he doesn't dispute that. But many who have encountered him during his decades at Riverbend Maximum Security Institute said he has forged a new identity as a peacemaker behind bars. 
America is warming fast. See how your city’s weather will be different in just one generation.   Vox  Our world is getting warmer. This we know. But how much will temperatures in US cities change by 2050? By then, scientists say average global warming since preindustrial levels could be about twice what it is in 2018 — and much more obvious and disruptive.                                     Sincerely, ￼  Jim Cooper

Listening to community leaders at an official Senate Hearing in Gardiner 
￼ WATCH highlights from the Gardiner field hearing
What's New:
As Chairman of the National Parks subcommittee, I recently held an official Senate hearing in Gardiner, Montana, to discuss the challenges communities surrounding National Parks face with the increase in visitation to our National Parks. The public hearing was held at the Gardiner Public School, which partially sits inside Yellowstone National Park, where we heard from the Superintendent of Yellowstone Park and community leaders from Gardiner, Cooke City, West Yellowstone, and the Flathead Valley. These communities have seen first-hand the economic benefits from more tourists visiting our National Parks, but they have also faced growing challenges maintaining infrastructure due to more people traveling through their communities.  Why it matters:  Montana’s National Parks bring tremendous economic opportunities. For example, according the National Park Service, visitors spent approximately $275 million in Glacier National Park and $500 million in Yellowstone and the surrounding areas just last year. This comes as we have seen record numbers of visitors to all of our National Parks. This increase comes at a cost, including more people driving on small town roads and using utilities in small towns. However, the towns remain small, sometimes with less than 100 residents. These residents are the ones that have to foot the tax bill to fix or upgrade infrastructure like roads, water and waste water systems, schools, and emergency responders. In many cases, they simply do not have the resources. There is a real need to find practical solutions to balance the needs of our gateway communities.  
￼
Hearing testimony from community leaders and the Yellowstone National Park Superindendent
What's Next:  The official hearing I held in Gardiner is just the beginning of the conversation. As Chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee I will continue to work to find real solutions to real problems. Our National Parks are treasures and the communities that serve them are the first impressions visitors have. We need to make sure they have the tools they need to serve their residents and the millions of visitors that travel to and through them each year.

Bipartisan Bills Authored by Senator Collins to Prohibit Pharmacy “Gag Clauses” are Signed into Law
The bipartisan legislation bans an egregious practice that can conceal lower prices from consumers, causing them to needlessly overpay 
Last fall, Senator Collins was troubled to learn from a group of Maine pharmacists about a practice that can conceal the least costly way to purchase a prescription drug. Known as “gag clauses,” these terms included in some contracts between insurance companies or their pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacies actually prohibit pharmacists from telling consumers if their prescription would cost less if they paid for it out of pocket rather than using their insurance. A recent study of 9.5 million insurance claims found that nearly one out of four prescriptions filled through insurance ended up costing more for customers than if they had paid out of pocket.  
￼
Senator Collins, who has made increasing the affordability and accessibility of prescription drugs one of her top priorities, worked with Senators Claire McCaskill (D-MO) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) to author bipartisan legislation to ban the use of pharmacy gag clauses. Earlier this month, their bills, the Know the Lowest Price Act and the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, were signed into law.   “Insurance is intended to save consumers money. Gag clauses in contracts that prohibit pharmacists from telling patients about the best prescription drug prices do the opposite,” said Senator Collins. “Who would think that using your debit card to buy your prescription drugs would be less expensive than using your insurance card? It’s counterintuitive. Americans have the right to know which payment method provides the most savings when purchasing their prescription drugs. I am delighted that my legislation to help increase transparency and reduce the cost of prescription drugs received overwhelming bipartisan support and is now law.”   Click HERE to learn more about Senator Collins’ legislation.

Senator Collins Joins Norridgewock Community in Honoring Corporal Eugene Cole
￼ 
Senator Collins joined the community of Norridgewock at a bridge dedication ceremony to honor Somerset County Sheriff’s Deputy Corporal Eugene Cole, who was killed in the line of duty in April. Senator Collins, along with members of Corporal Cole’s family, law enforcement, and local and state leaders, delivered remarks paying tribute to the fallen police officer. The Cole family also led a procession across the bridge and unveiled signs memorializing Corporal Cole.   “It was an honor to join Corporal Cole’s family, friends, colleagues, and community to dedicate a bridge in his name in Norridgewock,” said Senator Collins. “Corporal Cole served the citizens of Somerset County for 13 years with commitment, compassion, and valor. The dedication of a bridge in his name is a fitting tribute. For generations to come, all who pass over it will be reminded of his dedication to others. May God bless Corporal Cole and all who step forward to protect and to serve.”

Ribbon Cutting for Northern Maine Community College Simulation Center
￼ 
“Collins helps mark celebration of simulation and tech centers at NMCC”  The County  
￼
￼
“U.S. Sen. Susan Collins gave brief remarks Friday during a ribbon cutting ceremony for the new allied health simulation center at Northern Maine Community College and also visited the precision machining technology lab.   “‘Today’s ribbon cutting ceremony is more than a landmark moment for health care education in our state,’ Collins said in her remarks. ‘It’s about the values of optimism, hard work, and community found at Northern Maine Community College.’   “The simulation center, located on the second story of the Christie Complex on NMCC’s Presque Isle campus, provides ‘the highest quality clinical experience for students and current health care professionals,’ she said.   …  
￼
“Collins toured the new facility and also visited a class at the college’s precision machining technology lab.   “‘The faculty and staff at Northern Maine Community College are dedicated to creating opportunities for students in Aroostook County and throughout Maine, and I congratulate them on this outstanding accomplishment,’ Collins said.   “The senator helped secure funding for the machining technology program that allowed NMCC to become Maine’s first and only HAAS Technical Education Center, according to a press release issued by Collins’ office. The college’s collaborative relationship with HAAS Automation, Inc., affords students access to state-of-the-art machine tools to support training in both entry-level and advanced machining processes...”   Click HERE to read the full story on The County’s website.

Senator Collins Delivers Keynote Address at the Aroostook Agency on Aging Annual Meeting in Caribou
￼
Senator Collins, the Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, delivered the keynote address at the Aroostook Agency on Aging’s Annual Meeting at the Caribou Inn and Convention Center. Approximately 130 people attended the event, including Board Members, community members, organization staff, volunteers, community partners, donors, and municipal leaders.  
￼
“Recent Census data confirm Maine is the oldest state in the nation, and Aroostook County has a higher median age than the rest of our state. We are working together to build a shared vision for aging that is centered on health, wellness, and community,” said Senator Collins. “The Aroostook Agency on Aging is dedicated to empowering our seniors to stay in the homes and communities they love, for as long as possible, in safety and security. There is truly no place like home, and your commitment, energy, and compassion make it possible.”   Senator Collins has made it a priority to improve health and wellbeing to enable aging in place; stop fraud and financial exploitation targeting seniors; lower the soaring cost of prescription drugs; improve financial security for retirement; and increase funding for biomedical research for diseases and illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer’s.   A non-profit serving Aroostook County since 1972, the Aroostook Agency on Aging’s mission is to improve the quality of life, maximize the independence, and promote the well-being of older individuals in northern Maine.

Sweeping Opioids Package Becomes Law, Includes Key Provisions Authored by Senator Collins
In response to the opioid epidemic that is claiming the lives of tens of thousands of Americans and hundreds of Mainers each year, the bipartisan SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act was signed into law this week after being passed by overwhelming margins in Congress. Senator Collins, a member of the Senate Health Committee, authored two of the provisions that were included in the final legislation and cosponsored several others.   Congress has appropriated $8.5 billion this year towards fighting the opioid crisis. The SUPPORT Act will help states and communities expand access to addiction treatment, encourage evidence-based prevention strategies, and improve detection and seizure of illegal drugs like fentanyl.   “It is imperative that we work together to combat the opioid crisis, which killed 418 people in Maine last year and led to nearly 1,000 babies being born addicted to opioids and other drugs in our state alone,” said Senator Collins. “I am pleased that my bipartisan proposals to allow the safe disposal of unwanted drugs in hospice and bolster peer support networks were included in this comprehensive legislation. By supporting prevention, treatment, and recovery, this all-of-the-above approach will provide vital assistance to individuals and families who are struggling with addiction.”   Click HERE to learn more about the SUPPORT Act and Senator Collins’ provisions.

Senator Collins Secures Largest-Ever Increase for Alzheimer’s Research
Following a concerted push by Senator Collins, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee and a founder and co-chair of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer’s disease, Congress passed and the President signed into law a $425 million increase for Alzheimer’s research—the largest increase in history—which brings the country’s total investment to $2.34 billion for fiscal year 2019. This amount surpasses the $2 billion per year experts have said is needed to prevent and treat Alzheimer’s by the year 2025.  
￼
“We have made tremendous progress in recent years to boost funding for biomedical research, and this legislation builds on that momentum by providing the largest-ever increase for Alzheimer’s, exceeding our $2 billion goal,” said Senator Collins. “I have long championed increased investments for Alzheimer’s, which hold great promise for putting an end to this disease that has a devastating effect on millions of Americans and their families. I am encouraged by the sustained, bipartisan commitment for this research.”   Due to Alzheimer’s exorbitant human and financial costs, fighting the disease is one of Senator Collins’ top priorities. More than five million people across America—and about 28,000 in Maine—are living with Alzheimer’s. In addition, Alzheimer's and other dementias cost our nation an estimated $277 billion a year, including $186 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid. If we remain on our current trajectory, nearly 14 million seniors are projected to be living with Alzheimer’s in 2050, and the cost will surpass $1.1 trillion annually.

Protecting Our Constitution
The President cannot change the Constitution at his whim. President Trump's latest announcement about violating the 14th Amendment and changing ""birth right"" citizenship, is nothing more than campaign rhetoric to stoke fear instead of inspiring hope. When the President starts redefining what a citizen is, we are all in danger. I will continue to defend our Constitution and the rights of every citizen, regardless of their background.

On track for the best economy since 2005!

Dear Lindsey,
Individuals and families in the Second District and across the country have been seeing the benefits of our pro-growth agenda, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and various regulatory reforms. Hard-working taxpayers are finally able to keep substantial savings for vacations, education, or even an extra trip to the grocery store, thanks to increasing paychecks and economic growth.
In the most recent example of our country’s increasing prosperity, our economy grew at the fastest back-to-back pace in 4 years! Growing at an annualized rate of 3.5%, our GDP grew at a faster rate than expected, reflecting a healthy job market and high consumer confidence. Our economy is on track to have the best year of growth since 2005.
As our economy continues to expand, employees are thriving across the board as well. According to the Wall Street Journal, in the second quarter of this year low-income workers saw earnings 5% higher than the same period last year, in addition to expanded benefits and bonuses.
Job opportunities are also on the rise, as the national unemployment level hit 3.7% in September—the lowest it’s been in almost 50 years! Here in Minnesota our unemployment rate is now at 2.8%. Minnesotans are finding jobs and filling much-needed positions as businesses continue to expand and grow thanks to a competitive and nurturing economic environment spurred by nationwide reinvestment in local companies.
Reinvestment in local businesses not only shows that people have more money to spend, but it shows that our country’s consumers have enough confidence in their current fiscal situation to invest more of their money in goods and services.
Implementing good policy that delivers fiscal relief to Americans is the catalyst, but economic optimism and reinvestment is what keeps our economy strong. I’m proud to work on behalf of members of the Second District to help you keep more of your hard-earned money.
As I work on this and other issues, I always like to hear directly from you.  Please share any thoughts you may have through my website, and sign up for my e-mail newsletter for the latest updates from Washington, D.C. and around the district. You can also stay on top of my work by following my Facebook and Twitter pages.

10/30/18 17:47,quick update: ,"￼ 
Lindsey – We’ve thankfully come a long way since the 2008 economic crisis. But I know we still have so much more to do.

Today, many folks just aren’t earning enough to make ends meet. Health care keeps getting more expensive and paychecks aren’t keeping up. New technology and an interconnected world means our economy is increasingly changing, and we have to do a better job of keeping up. 

We need to help everyone get ahead in our economy. That’s why I’ve worked to make a positive impact in people’s lives by supporting crucial infrastructure projects, new jobs, and local businesses. 

I’m pleased to say we’ve delivered results to give area families and our economy a boost. Here’s a quick update on how we’re Making Government Work for Sacramento County: 


Rebuilding Our Infrastructure: 

￼
I saw the latest progress on infrastructure upgrades being made to the Folsom Dam earlier this year, which I’ve long voted to support.

To create jobs and build an economy that works for the middle class, we need to invest in our infrastructure. I’ve worked to help rebuild infrastructure that will modernize our economy, help local businesses, and make our communities safer.

• Upgrading the Folsom Dam: I’ve consistently voted to support major upgrades at the Folsom Dam. Formally known as the Joint Federal Project, these upgrades include building a brand new auxiliary spillway and other significant improvements. Many upgrades are underway or have been recently completed.

This project has brought hundreds of new jobs to our region and infused tens of millions of dollars into our local economy. Ultimately, it will let the Folsom Dam store more water and give it the ability to release water more safely and strategically. This could help with future droughts and provide better flood protection. 

• Strengthening our levees: I voted to fortify the Natomas levees to keep our communities safe and create new jobs. The bipartisan Water Reform, Resources, and Development Act, which is now law, authorized federal support for the Natomas Levee Improvement Project. Thanks in part to these efforts, the Army Corps of Engineers has now completed miles of levee repairs to protect Sacramento County.

• Improving the Mather Airport: I helped secure millions of dollars to upgrade Mather Airport, which is a vital part of Sacramento County’s aviation and cargo infrastructure. Among many improvements, these grants will help resurface pavement on the runway and upgrade drainage systems to improve safety and efficiency.


Creating jobs

￼
I recently had the pleasure of touring the Siemens facility in Florin, which supports hundreds of local manufacturing jobs.

• Supporting manufacturing jobs: I was proud to be a part of bringing hundreds of high-skilled jobs to Sacramento by helping with a contract between the Rail Division of Siemens and the U.S. Department of Transportation. Thanks in part to this contract, Siemens’ Florin facility has continued to build new, high-performance diesel-electric locomotives for public transit systems around the country.

• Hiring more firefighters and first responders: I helped secure more than $5 million in federal homeland security funding to hire and train first responders, secure regional transit, and help high-risk community organizations build their preparedness. Thanks to these funds, the Cosumnes Fire Department is finally able to hire eight new firefighters.


Supporting local businesses

￼
Visiting Green Acres Nursery & Supply in Elk Grove, a family owned business. They created 85 new jobs in part because of the help they received from the Small Business Administration.

Instead of being an obstacle, government should be a strategic partner with businesses to help them grow and hire. I’ve seen how hard our local businesses work and am committed to doing all that I can to support them and help bring new jobs to our region.

• New Small Business Development Center: I fought to bring a new small business development center to Elk Grove. This center provides technical assistance for local small business owners including help to create business plans, access to low cost loans from the Small Business Administration, and more. My office has held several workshops for small business owners to connect them with resources and help.

￼
At the grand opening of the Small Business Development Center in Elk Grove.

• Connecting local businesses with federal contracting: The federal government procures thousands of contracts with private businesses on a range of services – from food, to printer ink, to jet engines. This can be an incredible growth opportunity. My office helped bring new federal resources to our community to assist local businesses in competing for government contracts.


My job is to serve you – regardless of the politics – and to put people’s needs ahead of special interests. I’m proud of how my staff and I have made a positive impact for local families – you can learn more about it in my office’s new special report.

It’s an honor to serve you in Congress. Please feel free to contact me at any time to ask a question or share your views.

Be well,

Manchin's Mountain Message
Hinton Railroad Festival  
I’m so glad the Collis P. Huntington Railroad Historical Society had another great and successful Hinton Railroad Days Festival. Every year, the New River Train adds an estimated $5 million to West Virginia’s economy. When Amtrak announced they would be ending the services, I brought both parties together to ensure that we would not lose the New River Train.  Since then, I have kept in touch with both parties and included language in this year’s Transportation Appropriations bill to make sure that Collis P. Huntington can stay open this year and beyond.  Hundreds of thousands of West Virginians and people from out of state enjoy this festival every year, and I will continue to work to make sure that it goes on for years to come.  Be sure to mark your calendars for next year's festival!
The annual festival is hosted by the Collis P. Huntington Railroad Historical Society, a 59-year old non-profit organization that operates private railroad cars through Amtrak. 
This April, Amtrak announced it would no longer accept private and charter trains, which the Collis P. Huntington Railroad Historical Society uses for the Hinton Railroad Days Festival. After bringing together Amtrak and the Collis P. Huntington Society to explain the adverse impact this new policy would have on West Virginia communities, Senator Manchin helped broker a deal to continue providing service for the Hinton Railroad Days Festival. 
 
On the Road
Last week I had the pleasure of speaking at the Executive Seminar for West Liberty University about leadership and ways to make a difference in our communities. I appreciate everyone in attendance for your excellent questions!

He is a treasure within the state park system and if you're ever visiting the park, make sure to pay him a visit.

Congressman Bruce Westerman’s eNewsletter Tuesday, October 30, 2018
￼
￼
WASHINGTON – Congressman Bruce Westerman (AR-04), along with 16 bipartisan co-sponsors, introduced a House resolution Tuesday (October 30) which would designate October as “National Dyslexia Awareness Month.”
“Dyslexia is a learning disability which affects one out of every five individuals,” Westerman said. “It is important for schools, state and local educational agencies, and Congress to recognize the significant implications that accompany dyslexia. It is my hope that this bipartisan House resolution raises awareness of America’s most common learning disability and highlights the need for continued research into effective interventions.”
The following Members of Congress are original co-sponsors of this bill: Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-23), Julia Brownley (CA-26), Larry Buschon (IN-08), Ted Deutch (FL-22), French Hill (AR-02), Derek Kilmer (WA-06), Sheila Jackson Lee (TX-18), Zoe Lofgren (CA-19), Jim McGovern (MA-02), Jerry McNerney (CA-09), Seth Moulton (MA-06), Rick Nolan (MN-06), Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC-At Large), Steven Palazzo (MS-04), Mark Takano (CA-41), and Kevin Yoder (KS-03).
Westerman was recently named a co-chair of the Congressional Dyslexia Caucus. Brownley is the Caucus’ other co-chair. In the 114th Congress, Westerman co-sponsored H.R. 3033, the READ Act, which authorizes multi-directorate, merit-reviewed, and competitively awarded dyslexia research projects using funds appropriated for the National Science Foundation Research and Related Activities account and the Education and Human Resources Directorate. The legislation was signed into law February 18, 2016.

Arkansas Democrat-Gazette: Wilderness-area bill has tribute to former Arkansas congressman Cleveland County Herald: Veterans Appreciation Dinner Is Saturday at Rison Helena World: Delta Regional Authority Invests $2 Million to Strengthen Arkansas’s Economy, Infrastructure KTBS-TV 3: Congressmen tour The Caddo-Bossier Port and Lock and Dam Timber Processing: Weyerhaeuser Opens New $190 Million Arkansas Sawmill Times Record: Farm Bill still in negotiations between House and Senate
￼
￼
I spent last Tuesday (October 23) with Shreveport-area Congressman Mike Johnson. We first visited the Port of Caddo/Bossier and saw its success. In all, the port and the 17 businesses housed there employ 1,500 people. It is a success we should replicate further up the Red River by making it navigable to Texarkana.
The second stop of the day was the Joe D. Waggoner Jr. Lock and Dam. It is so important to make sure the locks and dams along all of our rivers are operational so goods can flow up and down our waterways.
Thank you to Congressman Johnson, the Red River Association, the Red River Waterway Commission, and Col. Michael Derosier of the Corps of Engineers (Vicksburg District Commander) for making today so informative.

Last week was National Forest Products Week. Wood products provide us with shelter, household materials, and packaging that we use daily. The forest product industry employs nearly 25,000 people in Arkansas in 95 different manufacturing facilities. Last week, I was able to visit Weyerhaeuser’s newly expanded lumber mill in Dierks. I am glad to celebrate all those who work in this important sector of our state and national economy!

Congressman Cook Applauds Capture of Mail Bombing Suspect, Condemns Political Violence
Last week, at least 12 pipe-bombs were sent to the homes of prominent political and media figures. Law enforcement apprehended a man in connection to this act of terrorism early Friday morning.

Congressman Cook released the following statement after the arrest: 

“This is a very precarious time in our nation’s history. In the past several years, we’ve seen an alarming increase in politically-motivated acts of violence. Whether physical intimidation of elected officials, a shooter opening fire on members of Congress on a baseball field, or, in this case, an attempted mail bombing campaign, these acts are despicable and must be condemned in the strongest terms. 

“I’m grateful none of the mail bomb devices detonated and that no one was injured. I commend the swift work of local, state, and national law enforcement in apprehending the suspect quickly. 

“Let me be crystal clear: all politicians must condemn all acts of political violence. Only America’s enemies benefit from our acts of self-destruction. Furthermore, all politicians must turn away from speech and imagery meant to incite violence, hatred, and unnecessary division. We have a duty to heal the wounds of our society. 

“Our American allegiance, not our politics, must come first. We must return to the values and ideas of community and cooperation that made us the greatest nation on earth.” 

Consumer Alerts From the Federal Trade Commission
Hang up on spoofed SSA calls
by Lisa Weintraub Schifferle | Attorney, FTC, Division of Consumer & Business Education

If you get a call that looks like it’s from the Social Security Administration (SSA), think twice. Scammers are spoofing SSA’s 1-800 customer service number to try to get your personal information. Spoofing means that scammers can call from anywhere, but they make your caller ID show a different number – often one that looks legit. Here are few things you should know about these so-called SSA calls.

These scam calls are happening across the nation, according to SSA: Your phone rings. Your caller ID shows that it’s the SSA calling from 1-800-772-1213. The caller says he works for the Social Security Administration and needs your personal information – like your Social Security number – to increase your benefits payments. (Or he threatens to cut off your benefits if you don’t give the information.) But it’s not really the Social Security Administration calling. Yes, it is the SSA’s real phone number, but the scammers on the phone are spoofing the number to make the call look real. 

What can you do if you get one of these calls? Hang up. Remember:

• SSA will not threaten you. Real SSA employees will never threaten you to get personal information. They also won’t promise to increase your benefits in exchange for information. If they do, it’s a scam.

• If you have any doubt, hang up and call SSA directly. Call 1-800-772-1213 – that really is the phone number for the Social Security Administration. If you dial that number, you know who you’re getting. But remember that you can’t trust caller ID. If a call comes in from that number, you can’t be sure it’s really SSA calling.

• If you get a spoofed call, report it. If someone calls, claiming to be from SSA and asking for information like your Social Security number, report it to SSA’s Office of Inspector General at 1-800-269-0271 or https://oig.ssa.gov/report. You can also report these calls to the FTC at ftc.gov/complaint.

For more tips, check out the FTC’s How to Stop Unwanted Calls and Government Imposter Scams. If you think someone has misused your personal information, go to IdentityTheft.gov to report identity theft and find out what steps to take.

Sky's The Limit Visiting Astronomer

Sky's The Limit Visiting Astronomer 
Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn

Event date: Saturday, November 3
Event time: 5:45 pm – 7:45 pm approx.
Event location: Sky’s the Limit Observatory and Nature Center, 9697 Utah Trail, 29 Palms, CA 92277

Event description: Sky’s The Limit Observatory and Nature Center invites stargazers to tour the desert night sky with Visiting Astronomer Brian Ginn on Saturday, November 3. This free public event will start around 5:45 pm and last approximately 2 hours. The Observatory is at 9697 Utah Trail in Twentynine Palms, just outside the main (north) entrance to Joshua Tree National Park.

Mars is in a great position for observing: high in the sky all evening. Jupiter will be low in the West and sets at 6:48. Saturn sets at 9:11 and will be a beautiful object to observe. The Great Square of Pegasus will be overhead. A good test of your eyesight will be if you can see any stars within the square. The constellation Cassiopeia can be found above the Great Square. It is shaped like a “W.”

M31, the great galaxy, found in the nearby constellation Andromeda, is always impressive in a telescope. It is 2.5 million light-years away. To the East you will find the Double Cluster: a two-star cluster that is magnificent in a telescope.

Prominent constellations are Pegasus (the Horse), Taurus (the Bull), Cygnus (the Swan), Aquarius (the Water Bearer), and Cassiopeia (the Seated Queen).

Volunteers will set up a variety of kinds and sizes of telescopes on the winding sidewalks, and guests are welcome to use them or may bring their own binoculars and scopes as well.

The presentation is very casual, so come at any time and leave when you wish. Bring a red flashlight to preserve night vision. Dress for unpredictable desert weather and bring snacks, water bottles, and chairs.

Please be aware that white headlights severely disturb viewing and use only parking lights as you approach the dome. Let your eyes adjust to the dark before you drive into the parking area.

There are no overnight stays and NO CAMPING anywhere on the Observatory and Nature Center property. No pets, no smoking or alcohol allowed, and visitors must carry out all trash. Adults must accompany and take responsibility for the safety and behavior of children under 16.

The seasonal sky is very unpredictable, and a viewing event may have to be delayed, rescheduled, or cancelled due to cloudiness, rain, or excessive wind. Check @skysthelmit29 or follow @STL29Palms to learn the latest status of an event or call Ray at 760-365-7897.

For more information and to see photos taken through STL’s 14” Celestron Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope, visit the STL web site at www.skysthelimit29.org. STL is a tax-exempt nonprofit organization. Donations to support Sky’s The Limit’s educational programs are gratefully accepted.

Helping the Bipartisan Opioids Bill Become Law
Families in rural areas, small towns, downtowns, and Indian Country are hurting from the opioid crisis—last year we saw more than 70,000 drug overdose deaths nationwide, many of them related to opioid use. That's why I'm glad that the bipartisan opioids legislation I helped write is now law. It is an important part of helping address the problem.
The law gives communities more tools to help encourage recovery, increases resources for prevention and treatment, and makes sure that emergency responders have access to naloxone. I'm also proud to have fought for a bipartisan provision that I wrote with Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska that will increase access to mental health services for kids in school—especially children in our rural communities—because we know our young people are feeling the effects of the opioid crisis too. Helping our students get the mental health care they need shouldn't be a partisan issue. 
I'm glad my colleagues and I could find common ground and work together on this law. Families are in crisis, and we can't sit by while they struggle.
Learn more here. 
Getting the Farm Bill Over the Finish Line 
This month I traveled to Les and Jeanne Anderson's farm in Cannon Falls and Minnesota Farm Bureau President Kevin Paap's farm in Garden City. We talked about a lot of things, but we focused in on the 2018 Farm Bill, which is at the top of farmers' and producers' minds in Minnesota, and our nation. The Farm Bill impacts the lives of every Minnesotan, and getting it passed into law is what I've been focused on as a proud member of the Senate Ag Committee.
I recently followed up with leaders of the House and Senate Ag Committees to reaffirm the need to pass a strong, bipartisan Farm Bill as soon as possible. In an earlier letter, I had outlined the importance of several provisions that were included in the Senate Farm Bill that I helped pass in the Senate with an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 86-11. These key provisions—funding for broadband expansion, a robust energy title, conservation programs, and investments in beginning and Native farmers and ranchers—are critical for the success of Minnesota's agriculture sector and are necessary components of a strong Farm Bill.
I've also been calling for expanded use of ethanol in our nation's fuel supply, and the Administration's recent proposal to allow year-round sales of E-15 responds to my call. I'm going to make sure the Administration follows through on this proposal because it will increase demand for farm products and bolster farm communities.
I know that times have been tough for Minnesota ag communities, and I'm working to help farmers in Minnesota and across the country.
Learn more here. 
Improving Access to Child Care 
Lack of access to dependable child care can take a real toll on Minnesotans—it can be a huge barrier for parents who need to work, or go to school, or who want to be involved in their community. I've heard this from families, businesses, and community leaders across the state all year—and I heard it again during a recent visit to a new child care center in Stewartville. That's why I've made it a top priority to increase access to affordable, quality child care across the state.
I recently introduced a child care bill which responds to many of the concerns I have heard from Minnesota child care providers and families. The bill would invest in child care facilities—an important part of any community's infrastructure. It would also support child care providers in areas related to safety and quality, help providers navigate important health and safety requirements, and support child care businesses. Furthermore, the bill would help states and tribes in improving the administration of child care programs and includes a community needs assessment to help determine how best to use resources in order to support communities in Minnesota and across the country.
For the sake of Minnesota's working families and our economy, we need to improve access to quality, affordable child care. I'll be fighting to pass this bill into law. Minnesota families and our economy are counting on it.
Learn more here.
Meeting and Listening to Minnesotans 
My job is to work for you, and to be your voice in Washington. Here are some of the people I've recently had the chance to meet:
I met with local leaders in Duluth who are working to address local housing challenges. I believe we need to create more affordable housing options because if people don't have a safe, affordable place to live, then it's hard to work, get an education, and live healthy lives.
In Hermantown, I stopped by Cirrus Aircraft to hear more about the company's need for skilled workers. Supporting skilled workers and helping workers get the training they need has been a focus of mine because I hear time and time again that businesses are struggling to find workers to fill the good jobs they have open. And while not everyone wants or needs to go to a four-year college, everyone should be able to get the skills they need to get a solid, good-paying job. That's why I fought to get my provisions included in a bipartisan bill to improve career and technical education that was recently signed into law.
I visited Washburn High School in Minneapolis to hear about its Farm to School program. Farm to School delivers locally grown, healthy, fresh food to students in Minnesota and across the country. It also gives students the chance to learn about nutrition, agriculture, and food. In the Senate Farm Bill, I championed provisions to support Farm to School programs because they're good for student nutrition and they're good for local farmers' bottom lines.
I'm so impressed by the Minnesotans I meet, and am committed to helping them in Washington.

Good afternoon. I would like to provide a few updates about recent developments in Congress and share some important information.  Introducing an Internet Bill of Rights  Online privacy and the protection of personal data is now a critical priority for American consumers. The government’s response to the Equifax breach, Cambridge Analytica scandal and other serious violations exposed an information gap among members of Congress. I was proud that House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi tasked me, as one of Silicon Valley’s representatives, to outline ten principles which we can use to guide legislation defining clear and concise online protections.  In consultation with the founder of the world wide web, Tim Berners Lee, and other technologists, I proposed the Internet Bill of Rights, which is further elaborated in a piece in TIME Magazine. As we continue to live more of our lives online, and as technology continues to rapidly advance, it is vital that we establish reasonable and robust protections, just as our forefathers did when laying the foundation of our nation.   Raising Wages for 350,000 Amazon Employees  Amazon has bowed to pressure after Senator Sanders and I introduced legislation taking on corporate welfare and the big companies that rake in massive profits on the backs of severely underpaid workers.  In a victory for hundreds of thousands of Amazon workers, the company announced that wages for all employees, including part-time and seasonal, will go up to at least $15 an hour. It is the responsibility of all corporations, especially those making billions of dollars, to ensure that those who work hard for them are justly compensated and can afford to put food on the table and a roof over their heads.  Fighting Airplane Noise in the South Bay  Thank you to all who have shared their concerns with airplane noise over their homes. Last month, I wrote a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) asking for the disruptive Bay Side Visual flight path to be eliminated. I am pleased to announce that the FAA responded that our request has been granted, and the route into the San Carlos Airport has been canceled. This is a big victory for all residents in the area.  Town hall  It was great to see so many of you and to answer your questions at my October town hall meeting in Milpitas.  I hope to see you at my next town hall starting at 1:00 PM on Sunday, November 4th in the multipurpose room at Braly Elementary School in Sunnyvale.  If you can’t make it, you can watch on Facebook Live. Please be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram @RepRoKhanna. 
Best,

Senator Warren Joins the Fight Against War in Yemen  The catastrophic war in Yemen continues to wreak havoc on the lives of millions of innocent civilians. Ports are still blockaded, restricting the flow of food, clean water, and medicine to the many who have been unfairly caught in the crossfire of this proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Senator Warren joined me in a CNN op-ed calling for an end to U.S. complicity in the widespread suffering caused by our military assistance of the Saudi-led coalition.  Responding to the Killing of Jamal Khashoggi  Earlier this month, journalist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi was brutally murdered, reportedly at the direction of the highest level of the Saudi dictatorship. This is just another example in a long string of human rights abuses by the Saudi regime, including the cruel bombing campaign and starvation siege being carried out by the Saudi-led coalition against millions of innocent Yemenis. I wrote an op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle calling for an end to U.S. military aid to Saudi Arabia and further reconsideration of our alliance with this authoritarian and abusive dictatorship.  Videos  We Need Medicare for All  Victory for Amazon Workers  Stop Agribusiness Mega-Mergers Now

As you may know, wildlife preservation and preventing animal cruelty have always been a high priority for me. 

That’s why I’m honored to tell you that I just received a score of 100 percent from the U.S. Humane Society for my votes and leadership in Congress this year.

As a past winner of the Human Society’s “Legislator of the Year” award, I have always fought to protect endangered species in Florida and across the globe – from the iconic manatee to the majestic African elephant.

I thought you might be interested in some of the issues highlighted below in the Humane Society’s scorecard. 

Please let me know by responding to this email if you agree that animal welfare issues should be a bipartisan issue important to all of us.

•    Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act – bans the possession, sale and trade of shark fins, which are harvested by slicing off the fins of live sharks and throwing the mutilated animals back into the ocean to die.

•    Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act – toughens laws against individuals who torture and kill animals in the filming and distribution of so-called “animal crush videos.”

•    Prevent All Soring Tactics (PAST) Act – prevents the deliberate maiming of a horse’s foot, ankle or leg to make them perform better at horse shows and competitions.

•    Humane Cosmetics Act – ends painful experimental testing on dogs, rabbits and other animals in the cosmetics industry.

•    Welfare of Our Friends (WOOF) Act – closes loopholes that allow commercial dog breeders with a history of severe animal cruelty to continue to operate.  

•    Pet and Women Safety (PAWS) Act – makes it easier for women to bring their pets with them to domestic violence shelters when they leave abusive relationships.

Dear Friends, 
 
It’s that time of year again – open enrollment season for health insurance. For many of you who receive your insurance through your job or Medicare, simply reviewing and staying on your current plan may be enough. For those of us who do not have coverage or need to renew our coverage through the Affordable Care Act, the Marketplace open enrollment starts this week – Thursday, November 1 – and lasts until December 15. Now is the time to visit HealthCare.gov to get ready for this year’s open enrollment and review your 2019 plan options.
 
MEDICARE: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recently announced the 2019 premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance amounts for Medicare Parts A and B. For more click HERE.
 
VA CARE: The Atlanta Regional Office of Veterans Affairs at 1700 Clairmont Road in Decatur is hosting a Veterans Claims Clinic on Wednesday, November 7 from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m.  The Claims Clinic offers Veterans, their families, and survivors an opportunity to speak with representatives regarding new or existing claims from the Compensation, Loan Guaranty, and Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment divisions. In addition, there will also be an Information Fair from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. in the Veterans Canteen Service area, located on the first floor, with representatives available to share information on compensation, loan guaranty, education, vocational rehabilitation and employment benefits and insurance benefits.

SOCIAL SECURITY: I’m pleased to share news from the Social Security Administration that Social Security & Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for more than 67 million Americans will increase 2.8 percent in 2019. If you or a loved one receives Social Security, please be aware of potential scams. If someone claiming to be from the Census Bureau asks you for your full Social Security number, money or donations, anything on behalf of a political party, your full bank or credit card account numbers or your mother’s maiden name, don't answer. This is a scam and fraud. The Census Bureau does NOT ask those question. For more on how to protect you and your loved ones, click HERE.

Friend, 
Words are not sufficient to express the sorrow and outrage Debbie and I feel at the act of hatred that occurred on Saturday at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. The nation mourns this unthinkable tragedy. Eleven innocent lives were engaged in a time of prayer and reflection when they were taken at the hands of bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred.  I pray for those we lost, their families, and the Jewish community worldwide who continue to be victims of violence and vitriol. Anti-Semitism has no place in our society and as a community and nation, we must condemn these actions in the strongest of terms.  
Over the past few days I met with local leaders and also attended a vigil to honor the lives of those we lost in Pittsburgh. People of all backgrounds and faiths came together to make a strong stand against hate.   
Meeting with local Jewish leaders in Ocean County  
 ￼   
At the vigil in Toms River, speaker after speaker reminded us that we must all do our part to be better neighbors. I vow to continue to bring people together to strengthen our community and ask you to join me in doing the same. For a recap of the vigil, click here.   
If I can ever be of any assistance, please visit my website or contact my office: http://macarthur.house.gov.

Eleven murdered at Pittsburgh synagogue On Saturday, a gunman opened fire on congregants of the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pa., killing 11. The assailant entered the synagogue with an AR-15-style assault rifle and at least three handguns, and he was shouting anti-Semitic slurs during the attack. The victims were mostly older individuals, including a 97-year-old congregant who survived the Holocaust. Four police officers and two others were also wounded. 
+ Jim said: “I’m sickened by what happened at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. An attack on one house of worship is an attack on them all. We must do more to keep firearms out of the hands of violent extremists.” 
Two murdered in racially-charged shooting in Kentucky Last week, a white man shot two African-Americans in a Kroger in Jeffersontown, Ky. Investigators are looking into the fatal shootings as potential federal hate crimes. The assailant tried to enter a predominantly African-American church before the Kroger shootings, but the doors were locked because congregants left about an hour earlier. The shooter has a lengthy criminal record and a history of racist activity.

Affordable Care Act open enrollment for 2019 Open enrollment starts on THURSDAY, Nov. 1. Plans are cheaper across the state than last year, and most Tennesseans will have more plans to choose from. Click here to see what will be available to you! 
+ The state legislature has also still failed to expand Medicaid, which would cover more than 250,000 Tennesseans and reduce premiums even further for those shopping on the individual market.

Brazil elects new right-wing president On Sunday, Brazil, Latin America’s largest democracy, elected the far-right Jair Bolsonaro as the country’s new president. Bolsonaro, a retired army captain, is known for his open support of dictatorship and his derogatory remarks against women, minorities and the LGBTQ community. He campaigned on fighting crime and corruption, and on a platform of restoring national pride and traditional values, President Trump tweeted that he congratulated Bolsonaro over the phone and agreed to work closely with him.  
White House invites Putin to America early next year After his trip to Moscow last week, National Security Advisor John Bolton announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin has been invited to Washington, D.C., early next year. President Trump originally invited Putin to the U.S. this autumn during the summit in Helsinki, but that occasion was postponed after Trump was criticized for siding with Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies about Russian meddling in the 2016 election. If Putin accepts the invitation, the visit to the White House will be his first since 2001.  
￼ 
Trump deploys troops to the border President Trump ordered the U.S. military to deploy 5,200 additional troops – a major increase from initial estimates of 800 troops – to the U.S.-Mexico border in anticipation of a caravan of migrants, who are still about 1,000 miles from the nearest U.S. port of entry, according to American officials. Trump called the caravan “an invasion of our Country” in a post on Twitter and said again, without evidence, that criminals were hiding among the migrants. Mexican officials have reported that the size of the group has declined due to some travelers applying for asylum in Mexico and others returning to their home country. 
+ Last night, Fox News anchor Shep Smith said: “Tomorrow the migrants, according to Fox News reporting, are more than two months away, if any of them actually come here. But tomorrow is one week before the midterm election, which is what all of this is about. There is no invasion. No one’s coming to get you. There’s nothing at all to worry about.”

Come and Read It Report
Dear Texans,  
Texas' southern border is being targeted by potentially dangerous illegal immigrants who believe they are above the rule of law. Last week, in an effort to combat these threats, President Trump ordered additional forces to deploy to the border to assist the Department of Homeland Security with their southern border security mission.  
I have fought for stronger borders since day one. It is past time that Congress do its job and secure this country by utilizing technology, more border patrol agents, and physical barriers, such as constructing a wall where needed. I am glad we have a President who understands the importance of securing our borders and doing whatever it takes to protect American families.  
Violence is Never the Answer 
Last week, our country experienced two unthinkable acts of terror. Regardless of political party, religion, or any beliefs, violence is never the answer. The prominent Democrats who were targeted by a madman with 13 improvised explosive devices (IED) experienced an act of pure hatred and terror. As a victim of a politically-motivated attack, I condemn these heinous acts, and I am relieved the suspect was arrested and that no one was harmed.  
I offer my deepest condolences to the families of those lost at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. This nation is made up of Americans with different religions, beliefs and ideals, and those who differ from you should never feel unwelcome or fearful for their lives. We must stand united with the Jewish people all across America and in our own communities. Our country is committed to standing with Israel, our strongest ally, and I hope the Jewish community knows that America is with them.
I've said it before, this violence must end. I encourage everyone in our district will join me in continuing to pray for the victims and their families, as well as thanking the brave law enforcement officers at the local, state, and federal level for working around the clock to protect us.

Pacific Northwest Waterways recognizes Jaime as ""Legislator of the Year""
￼
Pacific Northwest Waterways Association (PNWA) annually recognizes a member of Congress “for their efforts and leadership on behalf of navigation and economic development interests in the Northwest.” It was a huge honor to accept the “Legislator of the Year” award at their convention in Vancouver earlier this month.

Navigation jobs – coastal and inland – help keep our region afloat. I am humbled by the recognition of my efforts to make sure our waterways are serving the citizens and economy of Southwest Washington.

Standing with fishermen, helping preserve sustainable resources
￼
Whether it’s fishing boats being able to safely get in and out of the Ports of Ilwaco and Chinook, or ensuring that our fishermen and shellfish growers have access to the sustainable resource they depend on, I’m committed to making sure all our fishermen continue receiving the support they need to keep our region working. 

I had a productive discussion with the Coalition of Coastal Fisheries and others in Ilwaco earlier this month about the future well-being of our fishermen and the jobs they support. Among the issues discussed were my legislation to lethally remove sea lions from the Columbia that are decimating our salmon runs, and fishery disaster funding I've worked with Congressman Derek Kilmer to secure. We have more to do, and I'll keep at it in Congress to support a strong fishing industry.
Supporting our great businesses in Southwest Washington
￼
It was an honor to join the Association of Washington Business’s “Manufacturing Week” bus tour when they made a stop here in Vancouver at Great Western Malting to present them with the Green Manufacturing award. It’s great that businesses here in Southwest Washington are taking crucial steps in helping to conserve our natural resources, while still producing high-quality products.
￼
I will continue supporting businesses – large and small – that fuel our Southwest Washington economy. It was a privilege to join Great Western Malting in Vancouver recently.

SOUTHWEST WASHINGTON RESIDENTS SOUND OFF ON OREGON'S TOLLING SCHEME 

Oregon continues to move ahead with its scheme to place tolls on all lanes of I-5 and I-205, while none of that revenue would go toward either bridge and no plan exists to improve the tolled roadways. Below are just a few of the hundreds of responses I've received from Southwest Washington residents on this matter. I'll continue to press forward with my legislation that would halt Oregon's plan until the state of Washington gives specific approval.

Colynn from Vancouver: ""Plain and simple: I would have to quit my job - a job that I love. There is NO WAY I could afford the tolls across the bridge. I cannot change the hours I work, nor work from home. I would also have to give up all my doctors."" 

Vicki from La Center: ""I must travel to Portland for my health treatment and physicians' care.""

David from Vancouver: ""We have lots of family in Portland, including two of our kids. A toll would definitely impact our ability to see them."" 

Faith from Brush Prairie: ""Both my husband and I oppose the toll and don't have a choice over the times to commute for work since both of us are truck drivers.""

Larry from Vancouver: ""Tolls would be a hardship for me because I only make minimum wage and I have to go across the bridge for work."" 

Garren from Amboy: ""This will be a great burden on my business. I will no longer choose to do business in Oregon.""


PROTECTING COLUMBIA RIVER GORGE COMMUNITIES
Last week, I introduced legislation to reinstate stronger U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) safety regulation for oil trains.

My bill, the Oil and Flammable Material Rail Transportation Safety Act, would reinstate USDOT’s 2015 safety requirement, which it had revoked last month. The 2015 regulation mandated trains carrying oil or other flammable liquids at speeds greater than 30 miles per hour update their current air-controlled brakes with electronically-controlled brakes. The current air-braking system oil trains use today has been around for a century, calling into question whether the brakes are reliable enough to safely transport hazardous materials across the country.

For the sake of our Columbia River Gorge communities and our environment, we need stronger safety measures when it comes to transporting hazardous materials by rail. The U.S. Department of Transportation made the wrong call to roll back a crucial braking-upgrade requirement for oil trains, so I’m taking legislative action to correct this mistake and protect the best interests of Southwest Washington.

Rep. Blum's Office Announces Successful Casework Outcome for First District Veteran's Family
DUBUQUE-- Today, Rep. Blum's office announced a successful outcome for a family with a missing father, who was found, and needed help to have full military honors at burial.
￼


WWII Navy Veteran Raymond Woodrow Bell struggled with mental illness (now known as PTSD), and had been missing to his family for over 50 years with a last known sighting in 1968. Over the years, his daughters, one being Catherine Basten of Dubuque, had searched for their father with no success. 
￼
 On October 2nd, Ms. Basten received news from Cook County Sheriff’s Detective Jason Moran who tracked Mr. Bell to a Chicago-area nursing home, where he lived before passing away at a Chicago Hospital on September 7th. Detective Moran is experienced in complex missing persons cases, including the John Wayne Gacy investigation. Unfortunately, Mr. Bell's daughters received this news a few weeks too late.  Ms. Basten shared this news with the Office of Congressman Rod Blum, along with list of the many items would be needed prior to burial in the National Cemetery, including proof of a positive identification and separation papers from the military. The Offices of Congressman Blum, Congressman Rush, and Congresswoman Shea-Porter worked with the VA, National Cemetery, and the National Personnel Records Center to track down this information and ensure Mr. Bell's burial in the National Cemetery. 
""A World War II Navy Veteran, 90-year old Raymond Woodrow Bell was laid to rest, on Friday, October 19th at the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery outside of Chicago with full honors and I am tremendously proud that my office had been able to assist him and his family. My office worked with two other congressional offices for advice and a thanks goes out to them -- Chicago Democratic Congressman Bobby Rush, and Democratic Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter of New Hampshire offices, along with the VA, the National Cemetery, and the National Personnel Records Center who I am told put in weekend hours to find Mr. Bell’s separation documentation. A huge thanks also goes out to Detective Moran for his diligent work with this case who went above and beyond. I am grateful that we were able to assist Mr. Bell and his family to provide the dignity and respect that he so deserved for serving his nation.""

'Holding together our broken hearts': Nashville community gathers for vigil for Pittsburgh synagogue victims  The Tennessean Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Nashville, condemned hateful rhetoric across the nation as the root of the anti-Semitism that led to Saturday’s attack. “When politicians act like demagogues, more tragedies happen,” Cooper said. “There are many ways to motivate a crowd. Every politician can choose to spread hope or fear.”   Early voting in Tennessee tops 1 million  WKRN / Channel 2  There are just a few days left in the early voting period and statewide early and absentee vote totals have topped 1 million as of Monday.  Pentagon Sends 5,200 Active Duty Troops to U.S.-Mexico Border  TIME The Pentagon said it’s sending 5,200 troops to the Southwest border in an extraordinary military operation ordered up just a week before midterm elections in which President Donald Trump has put a sharp focus on Central American migrants moving north in slow-moving caravans that are still hundreds of miles from the U.S.   How Trump-Fed Conspiracies About Migrant Caravan Intersect With Deadly Hatred  The New York Times In the final days before the election, President Trump and Republicans are trying again to highlight the caravan, which he called “an invasion of our country.”   The Citizenship Clause Means What It Says  The Atlantic The authors of the Fourteenth Amendment were clear that the United States is one nation, with one class of citizens, and that citizenship extends to everyone born here.  Treasury Expects to Issue Over $1 Trillion in Debt in 2018  The Wall Street Journal The U.S. Treasury Department estimates it will issue more than $1 trillion in debt this year as higher government spending and stagnant tax revenues push the deficit higher.   Germany’s Angela Merkel says she won’t run again for party leader or chancellor  The Washington Post BERLIN — Once the most powerful politician in Europe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel admitted on Monday that she has become a lame duck, setting off a scramble to replace her and deepening the continent’s deficit of high-octane leaders.  Brazil Election: How Jair Bolsonaro Turned Crisis Into Opportunity  The New York Times A knack for turning setbacks into opportunity has been a constant for Mr. Bolsonaro, the far-right populist who won Sunday’s runoff election to become Brazil’s next president.  In sign of trade war’s toll, fewer Chinese visiting U.S.  The Washington Post China has a big weapon that it hasn’t used in the trade war — yet.

Friends, 
  
It’s been quite a month! I’ve been hearing from so many of you on issues important to our community, and I just want to start by saying thank you for sharing your thoughts and concerns. You can always send me an email or stop by our office to stay in touch. 
  
You may know that I've been working on a bipartisan basis to address the opioid epidemic that is devastating families here in Michigan, and across our nation. Too many people have seen their friends, loved ones, and communities suffer under this health crisis and are anxious for real, concrete solutions. 
  
Legislation I authored, known as the the STOP Act, would block criminals who are exploiting postal loopholes and shipping synthetic opioids into our communities. It was included in the bipartisan opioid package signed into law by President Trump last week. Read more below about how once implemented, this simple law will help keep deadly synthetic opioids out of Michigan homes.

STOP Act Signed into Law  
￼ 
Michigan has hit a tragic new record. Almost 2,000 people in our state died last year from opioid overdoses, according to newly released data from the Department of Health and Human Services. That’s a 9 percent jump from 2016, and it’s yet another indication of what Michigan families know all too well -- the opioid epidemic is pervasive and unrelenting. 
  
This is not a Republican or Democratic problem, but a nationwide one. In Congress, I’ve made it my mission to reach across the aisle and deliver results in the fight against the epidemic. That’s why I’ve devoted myself to addressing a major issue that until recently has gone largely unnoticed: the supply chain through which foreign drug dealers smuggle unbelievably deadly synthetic opioids across our borders and into our homes. 
  
Some of the strongest synthetic drugs, like fentanyl or carfentanil, can be 50 to 500 times as potent as a regular street dose of heroin and are responsible for a growing share of fatal overdoses. They are most commonly manufactured abroad, ordered on secretive “dark web” drug markets, and shipped to the U.S. through the international postal system. Under current law, foreign packages sent through the mail and delivered by the U.S. Postal Service are not required to include advance electronic data, which Customs and Border Protection and other security agencies use to detect drugs or other illegal shipments. Advance electronic data is required for private shippers like UPS or FedEx, but for more than a decade, the Postal Service has avoided similar requirements, which has left our brave law enforcement officers under-equipped to stop drug dealers from flooding our communities with opioids. 
  
I was proud to take the lead on legislation designed to close this loophole, which has now passed overwhelmingly in the Senate (99-1) and the House of Representatives (353-52) with endorsements from across the political spectrum. The Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act will hold the USPS to the same standards as private carriers and mandate advance electronic data on all international packages. 
  
I’m glad this vital legislation is moving across the finish line. With the president’s signature, we will finally be able to take the long overdue step of closing the postal loophole. Until I no longer read headline after headline about another tragic loss of a Michigander to addiction, this fight will not be over. But the STOP Act was a crucial, common-sense step for Congress to take. And a just-issued report from the USPS Office of Inspector General provides further evidence of the loophole’s widespread harm, finding that online drug dealers are well aware of the loophole and that more than 90 percent of drug sites on the dark web ship through the postal service. 
  
Once the STOP Act is implemented, international criminals will no longer be able to exploit the postal loophole to profit off American deaths. This is a victory, but it is just one step of many that I will continue to push for to keep families safe and turn the tide on this health crisis. 
  
SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act 
￼  
In my view, the STOP Act is just one piece of the puzzle to ending the opioid epidemic once and for all. I'm glad my legislation was included in a larger package of bills, collectively known as the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6), that was signed into law by President Trump last week. 
  
This legislation passed the House in an overwhelming vote of 396-14, and contains more than fifty different proposals that will help individuals, families, and communities impacted by this epidemic. The bill supports prevention, treatment, recovery support, child welfare, veterans, and research -- and this comprehensive, all-hands-on-deck response is exactly what this health crisis demands. I'm proud of the bipartisan effort to get this legislation signed into law.

Eight Bills to Fight Opioid Crisis Now Law
I am proud to report that President Trump has signed into law the historic SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which includes eight pieces of legislation that I either authored or co-authored to help fight back against the opioid epidemic that has rocked communities across Nevada. According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than 750 people died from drug overdoses in Nevada in a single year, and from 2010 to 2016, 85 percent of the opioid-related deaths in Nevada were deemed accidents.
The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act is a rare piece of legislation with strong bipartisan support, and it was designed to reduce drug abuse, expand access to treatment, provide support to caregivers and families, and even close loopholes that have led to more drugs on the streets and barriers to recovery. I want to highlight a few of my eight measures included in this landmark legislation.
• To help newborns who are suffering from painful symptoms of withdrawal due to their mothers using opioids while they were pregnant, I co-authored the Caring Recovery for Infants and Babies (CRIB) Act. One of the most heartbreaking aspects of the opioid epidemic is the fact that every 25 minutes a baby is born a withdrawal condition primarily caused by the use of opioids and other addictive substances in pregnant women. In Nevada, the number of newborns with signs of exposure to opioids has increased at a rate of 300 percent. My legislation - the CRIB Act - will help babies suffering from addiction recover in the best care setting.
• I also co-authored the Help for Moms and Babies Act, another bipartisan measure that ensures women who are receiving care for a substance use disorder in a treatment facility receive prenatal and postpartum services.
• In order to reduce prevent opioid overdoses and misuse, I co-authored the Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act. According to a Department of Justice report, misused prescription opioids are often obtained illegally using forged  prescriptions and by seeing multiple doctors. That same report found that most prescription fraud remains undetected. My bipartisan legislation would direct health care providers to use electronic prescribing for controlled substances for Medicare Part D transactions, streamlining the prescription process for both providers and their patients.
• Additionally, since the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health has reported the overdose rate is highest for the 55-64 year age range, I also made sure that my  Informing Seniors about Opioids Act, was included in this sweeping package. This measure will help educate Nevada seniors about opioid use, pain management, and alternative pain management treatments.
As the fifth most bipartisan member of the U.S. Senate, I was proud to help pass the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, and I am encouraged that the President has signed it into law. We still have more work to do, but this new law represents a positive step forward and it will go a long way toward supporting Nevada’s efforts to address the opioid epidemic and provide care to those in our communities who need it most.
Standing up for Victims of Domestic Violence
Earlier this month, the President also signed into law our Justice Served Act, bipartisan legislation that will help deliver justice to victims of violent crimes by providing funding to prosecute the rape kit backlog, resolve cold cases, and help exonerate those who were wrongfully convicted. This new law will support Nevada’s prosecutors with the necessary resources to go after perpetrators of heinous crimes and to  deliver justice to victims and their families.

As Mayor of Sparks for over 13 years and also a member of the Sparks City Council, Mayor Martini played an instrumental role in a number of projects that benefit the Sparks community.
￼ 
Whether it is his work on the North Truckee Drain project that helps prevent flooding for businesses and homeowners, or his efforts to redevelop the Sparks Marina and transform an abandoned parking structure into a beautiful apartment home community, Mayor Martini’s legacy of leadership will be preserved through the positive impact that his work will have on this community for generations to come.

Joined many Nevadans at the Old Assembly Chambers of the Nevada Capitol Building to celebrate one of Nevada’s great leaders, Governor Sandoval, at the unveiling of his official portrait. 
As always, it’s an honor to represent you in the U.S. Senate. I have offices in Reno, Las Vegas, and Washington, D.C., and I encourage you to contact us – we’re here to help you.

Dear Friend: 
Greg Walden on Bill to Combat Opioid Crisis Becoming Law: ‘This will save lives’ 
Across our district I’ve met with the victims, families, treatment advocates, medical providers, and law enforcement officers who are on the front lines of the opioid crisis in Oregon. My bipartisan legislation that President Trump signed into law last week, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, is for these people, each of whom puts a name and a face to a crisis that killed more than 72,000 people nationwide in 2017 and takes the lives of more Oregonians than traffic accidents. This is about bringing hope to American families. 
This comprehensive plan brings critical support to the communities most desperately in need, provides new tools and resources for those on the ground in this fight, and helps stop the flow of deadly drugs across our borders. 
￼ 
At the White House as President Trump signs into law the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, my bipartisan legislation to combat the opioid crisis in Oregon and across the country. Please click here to view my remarks about the importance of this new law. 
The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act will boost our overall efforts to combat the opioid crisis by advancing treatment and recovery initiatives, improving prevention, protecting our communities, and bolstering our efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl. 
Rarely can we say that legislation will save lives, but there is no doubt that this bill will do just that. We address the full spectrum of the opioid crisis -- from bringing people out of the shadows of addiction and into recovery to preventing illegal fentanyl from flowing into our country. While there is much more work to be done, this is an important step forward to help stem the tide and get communities in Oregon on the road to recovery.

President signs Walden’s bill to fight opioid crisis 
Oregon Rep. Greg Walden’s sweeping bill to combat the nation’s opioid crisis is now law. President Donald Trump signed the 660-page SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act at a ceremony Wednesday at the White House.
“Seldom can you say that a piece of legislation will save lives,” Walden said. “This will save lives.”

President Signs Landmark Water Package That Includes Walden Provisions for Oregon Farmers 
￼ 
Speaking with President Trump in the Oval Office before the signing of the America’s Water Infrastructure Act, which includes provisions I helped secure to bring drought relief for farmers in the Klamath Basin. Click here to view my remarks about the importance of this bill for Oregon. 
One day before my comprehensive opioid package was signed into law, President Trump signed into law a landmark water package that includes drought relief for farmers in the Klamath Basin. I helped secure a key provision in the America’s Water Infrastructure Act, which authorizes $10 million annually for four years to the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) to implement needed drought relief measures for the $181 million agriculture community in the Klamath Basin.  
This is good news for farmers, ranchers, and water users in the Klamath Basin who are just getting through another challenging water year. Authorizing $10 million annually for four years to the Bureau of Reclamation will assist with groundwater pumping and other drought relief measures for basin farmers that we secured in law earlier this year. 
￼ 
I talked with Interior Secretary Zinke at the White House about making sure the disaster relief funds we secured in law for Klamath Basin farmers gets to them as soon as possible. 
This will ensure needed relief makes it to irrigators who suffered added costs and losses this water year, and will help ensure we are prepared if our farmers are hit again in a future drought year. I am proud to have worked with my Oregon colleagues to secure this provision in the larger legislation, and applaud the Trump Administration for prioritizing this needed relief for farmers in the Klamath Basin. 
Importantly, this legislation also includes measures to boost hydropower development in Oregon. Hydropower generates 43% of our electricity in Oregon, and this bill will help boost the use of this clean energy resource by streamlining the permitting process for getting new hydropower projects approved faster. 
This legislation also works to modernize our drinking water infrastructure, to ensure that our families have safe water to drink when they turn on the faucet. This bill authorizes more than $4.4 billion over three years for the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund program. The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) helps local communities in Oregon provide their residents with safe drinking water, comply with drinking water rules, and improve infrastructure. 
Each of these issues have been priorities for me in Congress and I am pleased to see that they were included in this landmark water package. Click here to learn more about this bipartisan legislation.

Walden lauds Trump’s signing of major water legislation 
Key provisions for water relief in the Klamath Basin are included in a major piece of legislation signed into law on Tuesday by President Donald Trump. 
Trump signed off on the Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 Tuesday afternoon in the Oval Office, with Congressman Greg Walden, a Hood River Republican, among those attending the signing.

Walden Invites House Armed Services Chairman to Kingsley Air Base
￼ 
I invited House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (seated at head of table) to Klamath Falls to meet with commanders at Kingsley Field to hear about their priorities for the base, including making sure Kingsley is a future home of the F-35.
Kingsley Field plays a vital role in the nation’s military readiness and our local economy in southern Oregon. Recently, I invited House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry to Klamath Falls to tour Kingsley and hear from base commanders about their priorities. 
This was the first time in the history of the base that a Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee has visited Kingsley Field. I wanted Chairman Thornberry to be here on the ground to see firsthand the impressive operation at Kingsley and meet with the troops stationed there, as well as to hear about what future plans are in store for the base. 
￼ 
A powerful F-15 lifts-off the runway at Kingsley Field. I’m working to help make sure that, in the near future, there is a new generation of aircraft taking to the skies over Kingsley -- the F-35.
Kingsley is uniquely positioned to become a future training ground for F-35 pilots, and Chairman Thornberry got a firsthand look at the expansive airspace that makes the base a perfect fit for this aircraft. 
Thanks to Colonel Jeff Smith and his entire team at Kingsley for inviting Chairman Thornberry and me to tour the base, and to all the troops stationed there for your service to our country. 
￼ 
WALDEN, THORNBERRY TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF KINGSLEY AIR BASE 
Representative Greg Walden hosted a very powerful & influential congressman at Kingsley Air Base in Klamath Falls Wednesday. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry toured the base and spoke with representatives about everything Kingsley and Klamath Falls has to offer.
Their hope is that the base will become the future home of the F-35. Kingsley is currently the only training base in the country for the F-15, but the planes are old and in need of an update.

Greg Walden announces Air Force Secretary visit to Kingsley 
And just today, I am proud to announce that, for the first time in the base’s history, the Secretary of the United States Air Force is coming to Kingsley Field. 
Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson will get a firsthand look at the expansive air space, top-grade military infrastructure, and the unmatched work ethic of Kingsley’s leaders and the troops stationed there, and learn more about why the base is a fitting home for the F-35. 
Secretary Wilson and I served together in the House of Representatives, and we have been working together over several months with Colonel Jeff Smith at Kingsley Field and the Oregon Air National Guard to make this visit a success. 
I appreciate Secretary Wilson’s willingness to spend the time here on the ground in Klamath Falls to get a better understanding of the military capabilities, vast training space, and broad community support that make Kingsley Field integral to our national defense strategy and uniquely suited for the F-35. 
￼ 
Greg Walden announces Air Force Secretary visit to Kingsley Field 
Representative Greg Walden (R-Hood River) Monday announced that the Secretary of the Air Force, Heather Wilson, will visit Kingsley Field Air National Guard Base in Klamath Falls this weekend on invitation from Representative Walden.

Walden Invites New Regional Forester to Eastern Oregon to Hear Concerns from Local Community 
￼ 
Last week, I invited the new Regional Forester, Glenn Casamassa, to La Grande to hear from local officials, stakeholders, and interested members of the public about their concerns with the Blue Mountain Forest Plan Revision. This plan as currently drafted will have serious impacts on our forested rural communities in NE Oregon. 
The objections raised by farmers, ranchers, and local leaders in eastern Oregon about the Blue Mountain Forest Plan are serious and must be considered before any proposal is put into place. I look forward to working with the local community and Glenn Casamassa to find a better path forward. 
￼ 
New US Forest Service regional forester comes to La Grande 
A roomful of people surrounded Glenn Casamassa, the new U.S. Forest Service regional forester for Region 6, on Thursday as representatives from multiple Eastern Oregon counties talked about their concerns with the newest Blue Mountain Forest Plan revision…. Also in attendance was Oregon Congressman Greg Walden, who said when the newest revised plan came out, the process came to a halt.
""People didn’t feel like they were listened to,” Walden said of the revision.

Walden Recognizes Local Veteran for Service, Becomes Honorary Member of Redmond Band of Brothers 
￼ 
The Band of Brothers organization does tremendous work in Oregon on behalf of veterans across our state. Recently, I was honored to join the Redmond Band of Brothers for a meeting to discuss my efforts to improve the care they are receiving at the VA. 
I was proud to report on progress being made to get our veterans access to the care they deserve. Congress recently passed, with my strong support, and President Trump signed into law a government funding bill that provides the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with the highest funding level in history. Those funds are specifically targeted to areas of need that I’ve heard about from veterans in Oregon. We specifically boost funding for rural health initiatives, mental health care services, alleviating homelessness, and getting the VA more resources to clean up the claims backlog for veterans. 
I was also proud to present Redmond Band of Brothers Vice President, Jack Stickler, an American flag flown over the Capitol for his tireless efforts and commitment to the organization and to veterans in central Oregon. And I am honored to have been named an honorary member of the Redmond Band of Brothers, which was an incredibly humbling gesture from those who have done so much to secure our freedoms. 
Thank you to the veterans of Redmond Band of Brothers for inviting me to your lunch, and for your service to our country in uniform. 
￼ 
Helping Veterans -- Redmond Man Honored 
Click here to watch coverage of my meeting with the Redmond Band of Brothers from Central Oregon Daily. 
I’ve helped more than 6,000 Oregon veterans and their families with health care, benefits, and claims at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). If you or a loved one needs help with the VA or any other federal agency, you can reach out to my office from Oregon at 800-533-3303. I will do everything I can to get results for you. 
But veterans should not have to come to their Congressman to receive the care they need and deserve. That’s why I’ll continue to work to solve the problems at the VA, recognizing there’s more improvements needed. 
That’s all for this update. Remember, you can always keep in touch with me via email, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 
It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. Congress. 
Best regards, 
Greg Walden U.S. Representative Oregon's Second District

Friends, 
With Congress out of session for an October district work period, I have taken this valuable time to be on the road in Alabama’s Second District visiting with the people I represent and sharing with them an update from Washington. I believe this time we spend together is truly invaluable. It’s so important for me to hear from local leaders, business owners, and employees about how the issues of the day impact them in their daily lives so that I can better represent their views in Congress.
During this district work period, I spent time in Columbia, Headland, Dothan, Gordon, Luverne, Goshen, Opp, and Troy. Since parts of our district were ravaged by Hurricane Michael this month, I have been especially grateful for this time away from Washington to visit impacted communities to assess the damage and talk with our farmers on the ground.
 ￼ 
In Luverne, I had the opportunity to address the Crenshaw County Chamber of Commerce during a lunch meeting. We had a conversation about the numerous successes our unified government has had over the last two years. As I told the group, the American people are much better off now than we were before. While in town, I also stopped by Hicks, Inc. They’re the number one national wholesale distributor of fishing, hunting, marine, archery, and other outdoor products. I was very impressed by their extensive operations and impressive facility. 
￼ 
In Goshen, I visited the high school to check out their career tech facility. I was blown away by the numerous outstanding opportunities that are available to students right here in our district. Did you know that most Goshen High School students graduate having already obtained an Associate degree? It’s true. The students I met while on campus were truly remarkable young men and women.
 ￼
In Opp, I participated in a roundtable discussion with local business leaders. We had a very productive conversation about ways we can work to bring new opportunities to Opp and the surrounding communities. While I was there, I also had the opportunity to meet former Alabama football Head Coach Mike DuBose and his wife Polly. 
It has been a productive month so far, and I really appreciate the many individuals who took time out of their busy lives to talk with me. I am looking forward to many more opportunities to hear directly from the people I represent. My priority is always to be the very best representative of our shared beliefs that I possibly can. You can read my weekly column about my time on the road via Alabama Today.  
TRAGEDY IN PITTSBURGH 
I am deeply saddened for the families who lost loved ones during the horrific events at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh this weekend. These atrocious acts of evil have no place in our society, and I am praying for all those affected. 
FIGHTING BACK AGAINST THE OPIOID CRISIS 
 ￼ 
Hundreds of thousands of lives have been cut short by opioid addiction and abuse in recent years. Last year alone, more than 72,000 Americans lost their lives due to complications from drug overdose. Of those fatalities, nearly 50,000 were related to opioids. 
I am so pleased that last week President Trump signed H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, into law. This bill is a small step in addressing this huge problem that is plaguing our communities.  
You can read my column about this important legislation here. 
17 YEARS OF MARRIAGE 
 ￼ 
On Saturday, I celebrated my 17th anniversary with my husband, Riley. Thank you for 17 amazing years! 
THE WEEK AHEAD 
I am continuing to travel through the district this week, and will be making stops in Wetumpka, Tallassee, Montgomery, and Dothan. Remember that you can follow along with me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.         
It is an honor to serve you in Congress. Please never hesitate to let me know if there is a way my office can be of assistance.   Sincerely,  
￼  Martha Roby

Kansas Common Sense  October 29, 2018
Hello,
 
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
 
Advocating to Move USDA Agencies to Kansas
In August, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Purdue announced that the USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) and National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) would relocate away from the Washington, D.C. metro area by the end of 2019 – a move that will benefit the USDA, rural America and federal taxpayers for many reasons.
I penned an op-ed in The Topeka Capital-Journal highlighting why Kansas is the right place to move these entities. With the animal health corridor stretching through our state, robust critical infrastructure, outstanding academic and research institutions and an excellent workforce, a move to Kansas simply makes sense. As Secretary Purdue and USDA leadership review the over 130 expressions of interest – five of which came from Kansas communities – I’ll continue to advocate that the ERS and NIFA call Kansas home. Click here to read my op-ed.  
Arranging the Donation of Senate Computers to Kansas High Schools
I am proud to have secured the donation of five computers each to five Kansas high schools as part of the United States Senate’s Computers for Schools program. This program, administered by the Office of the Sergeant at Arms, channels surplus computers into classrooms across the country to help encourage and enable technology use in the classroom in this digital age.
Computers are a central and invaluable part of classroom learning, and I am grateful to play a part in providing students the tools they need by securing the donation of these computers. We chose these schools based on a demonstrated need for new technological resources as digital fluency is becoming increasingly more important to employers in all fields. I will continue working with local educators, parents, students and businesses to make certain our students are prepared for the workforce. 
Five computers were delivered to each of the following schools: 
	•	Ashland Jr/Sr High School
	•	Elkhart High School
	•	Kinsley Jr/Sr High School
	•	Hill City Jr/Sr High School
	•	Lincoln Jr/Sr High School
To read more on this program and the schools that received these computers, click here. 
Landmark, Bipartisan Opioids Relief Package Signed Into Law I am pleased the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, a targeted opioid package that will enable us to better prevent opioid-related deaths and treat opioid addiction, is now law. This bipartisan legislation supports research and innovation for non-addictive opioid alternatives, reauthorizes grants to states most impacted by opioids, and bolsters our customs and border protection to halt the flow of foreign, synthetic opioids – like fentanyl – to our communities. 
The provisions included in this legislation will better help reduce the number of dangerous drugs in our country and expand treatments for those suffering from opioid addiction. We will be able to lessen the burden of opioids on our country additionally through increased efforts at NIH for research on non-addictive pain management, and additional investments in mental health will help reduce the burden of opioids on our country. This is only the next step, not the final one, in our fight against these addictive and dangerous drugs. I will continue to work with my colleagues to end the scourge of addiction. 
Meeting with U.S. Diplomats and Foreign Officials in Eastern Europe Last week, I traveled with Senate colleagues to Europe to consult with elected officials, U.S. State Department personnel and foreign leaders about a number of important strategic interests to the United States, such as national security, continued Russian aggression and ongoing counterterrorism and intelligence efforts. On each of our stops, I had the privilege to visit with and learn from our country’s men and women working to promote U.S. diplomacy abroad. As a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, and as Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies subcommittee overseeing law enforcement funding, this trip was important to better understand how taxpayer funding is being utilized to accomplish strategic objectives abroad.  
On one of our stops in Chisinau, Moldova, I met with elected officials, including the Moldovan Speaker and members of Parliament, and received vital input on a range of topics. During our stop in Moldova, I also met fellow Kansan and McPherson native Charles Vetter, a commissioned Foreign Service Officer within the U.S. State Department. Charles works tirelessly to support American ideals and foreign policy overseas, and his distinguished service to our country and the State Department should make McPherson and all of Kansas proud. 
In Vienna, the delegation met with U.S. State Department embassy staff. I also met with the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Legal Attaché and their team on issues such as ongoing counterterrorism efforts, the growing prevalence of cybercrime and other law enforcement related matters. Our last stop in Europe was Tallinn, Estonia, where U.S. Embassy staff discussed various issues such as Russian aggression, the U.S. and Estonia’s military cooperation, collaboration and continued commitment, the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security’s recent efforts to stop the proliferation of certain dangerous products while also promoting U.S. exports abroad, the FBI’s role promoting U.S. security abroad, and many more. 
 ￼ 
Meeting with Kansas Cadets at the United States Air Force Academy Over the weekend, I joined several Kansas cadets at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs for a church service and lunch. One of the most meaningful responsibilities I have as a United States Senator is nominating young Kansans for our service academies as they work to serve our nation. At the Academy, these young men and women experience a world class education, go through rigorous training, develop core values and strengthen their leadership skills. The cadets I met with are some of Kansas’ best and brightest and I am proud to see how well they represent our state. 
Thanks to all of the cadets who spent their lunch hour with me, including Luke Socolofsky, Jacob Taylor, Cole Dudley, Nicholas Clark, Vance Thompson, Cole Resnik, Leah Wiegers, Charlie Bermel and Joe Harms. 
 ￼
Touring Colby Community College’s Vet Tech Program On Monday, I was in Thomas County where I toured Colby Community College (CCC). During my visit, I met with CCC President Dr. Seth Carter regarding the school’s latest initiatives and news. I also visited with Director of the Veterinary Technology Program Dr. Jennifer Martin who shared with me how students receive training through advanced technologies in veterinary medicine and their access to quality lab equipment. While on my tour of their facility, I was able to talk with students, who shared with me their experiences at the school, as well as their perspective on the current state of higher education. I appreciate the efforts of all the educators and staff at these institutions for working to help Kansas students have bright futures. Thanks to Dr. Carter, Dr Martin and the Board of Trustees for hosting my visit.
￼  
Visiting Wheatland High School in Grainfield Following my visit to Colby Community College, I was in Grainfield to tour and visit with students and staff at Wheatland High School. I visited with the math, science and art classes, and was happy to hear from many students on their fall semester, future plans and more. As we work to make careers in STEM a possibility for all students across Kansas, Wheatland High School should be commended for the special focus they place on STEM education and career-focused classes for their students. Thank you to Senior Class President Angel Mong, Student Body Vice President Ethan Beckman and Student Body President Morgan Zimmerman for leading my tour of the school, who I'm pictured with below. Thanks also to Principal Todd Flinn and Superintendent Gary Kraus for arranging my visit.
￼

Dear Friends, 
My heart continues to break for the community of Squirrel Hill and the Jewish community across our country. To deliberately target a synagogue on the Sabbath and those of the Jewish faith is pure evil. It cannot and will not be tolerated in the United States. 
This comes on the heels of a series of bombs being sent to high profile public figures. This again, does not in any way, shape, or form represent the values that we hold dear as Americans. Free speech is the cornerstone of the American experiment in self-government and is enshrined in our Constitution as the first protection guaranteed to our citizens. While free speech is a right, we also have a moral responsibility to use that speech in a thoughtful and civil way. It is incumbent upon all Americans — regardless of political party — to raise the quality of our debates.
As a former federal prosecutor, I have always had the utmost respect and appreciation for the dedicated men and women at the Department of Justice, FBI, DHS, and other law enforcement officers across this country. I want to thank them for their tireless work and applaud their swift response to both of these terrible events.
I joined Bill Hemmer on FOX News' ""America's Newsroom"" to discuss the package bombs sent to public figures and the latest on the migrant caravan. You can click here or on the image below to watch that interview.  
￼ 
Securing our Border 
Earlier in the week, I talked about the migrant caravan that originated in Honduras and is approaching our southern border. Chairman Goodlatte and I had a bill that would have closed the legal loopholes.  It included border wall funding that would have stopped this from happening, providing a deterrent, and yet every Democrat voted against it.  
Now, we need to stop this caravan from entering the United States. Today, it was announced that the U.S. military plans to deploy 5,000 troops to the southwest U.S. border in response to the caravan moving towards our border.

State of U.S. Cybersecurity 
I joined Houston Public Media’s Red, White, & Blue with Gary Polland and guest co-host Jay Aiyer to discuss the state of cybersecurity in the United States. Cybersecurity is becoming the number one issue facing our national security. With the advancement of technology and our increased dependence on computer networks, nation states, hackers, and cybercriminals are finding new ways to attack our cyber infrastructure and expose vulnerabilities. Throughout my tenure as Chairman, I have been working closely with the Department of Homeland Security to bolster our cyber defenses by elevating and prioritizing these threats.

Meetings with Constituents 
In Columbus last week, I met with community leaders to talk about how we can do a better job of investing in our local communities. 
￼ 
I met with business leaders in West Houston about the investments we need to make in infrastructure to mitigate future flooding disasters. 
￼ 
I met with the Bellville Chamber of Commerce about our successes in cutting back on job-killing regulations and our economic growth which has been spurred by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  
￼ 
In Wallis, community leaders discussed with me the issues facing the foster care facility there and the economic and social impacts it is having on the community. 
￼ 
Meeting with Mayor Eric Scott 
It was great to meet with Brookshire Mayor Eric Scott about how we can work together and improve the lives of our constituents and the local community. We are both history buffs and I appreciate the Mayor taking his time to show me the Waller County Historical Museum and the issues facing its restoration. 
￼ 
Katy ISD Celebrates 100 Years 
It was great to celebrate Katy ISD's 100 years of service to the community. They have been steadfast in their dedication to helping students succeed and have been recognized nationally for their achievements. Thank you to all of the incredible teachers who are responsible for the success of Katy ISD. 
￼ 
  
Music Modernization Act 
It was great to celebrate the success of the passage of the Music Modernization Act with local artists from ATX. This new legislation ensures that we are protecting the intellectual property of our artists so they can have better control of their creative content. I even got to hear a neat rendition of the Beatles' classic ""With a Little Help From My Friends"" by Kevin Russell of Shinyribs. Make sure to follow me on Instagram to see other cool things I'm up to. You can click here or on the image below to watch.

Legislative Update 
Last week, Members were in their districts for a District Work Period. No votes were held. 
This week, Members remain in their districts for the District Work Period. For this reason, there are no votes currently scheduled in the U.S. House of Representatives.
As always, I encourage you to visit my website, mccaul.house.gov, for more information on constituent services and legislative updates. Also, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to get the latest updates on my work in Washington and the 10th District of Texas.

The Webster Wire
Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends: 
More good news – data shows our economy continues to prosper.  The U.S. economy expanded at pace of 3.5% in Q3, following on a 4.2% pace in Q2; This is the strongest back to back quarterly growth since 2014 and has the U.S. economy on pace to reach 3% annual growth for the first time since 2005.

Today, many small businesses are struggling to find skilled workers to fill job vacancies.  We need to train today’s students to be ready for a high-tech workforce that requires high-skills.  Last week, I visited Marion Technical Institute, which is preparing their students with the skills needed to achieve success. I learned about and saw many of their programs including health sciences & radiology, commercial driver’s license (CDL), and welding.
￼  
_______________ 
On Thursday, President Trump introduced new proposals to reduce the price of prescription drugs, particularly for those on Medicare.  Using a new “International Pricing Index” (IPI), costs of physician-administered drugs will be more closely aligned with prices worldwide.  This is projected to save American taxpayers and patients $17.2 billion over five years. 
The new price index ends the practice of American patients and taxpayers subsidizing the prices of drug research and manufacturers by paying higher prices for drugs purchased in the United States versus other countries. According to the White House, historically, manufacturers charged American wholesalers almost double what is charged in other countries for the most common Medicare Part B drugs. For example, instead of paying over $1 billion a year Medicare could save more than $800 million on two drugs that treat bone disease by paying the prices other countries pay.

It was great to be with New Beginnings Youth Shelter in Brooksville last week to learn more about the work they’re doing and how we can be a better partner. New Beginnings is part of the Youth and Family Alternatives, which provides runaway and youth crisis services, community-based care foster care and adoption and prevention services. 
￼ 
_______________ 
Wednesday, President Trump signed H.R. 6, the Patients and Communities Act into law. Life is a precious gift, and in 2016, the lives of 4,728 Floridians were lost due to an opioid overdose. Providing law enforcement, the healthcare industry and local communities the tools to combat this crisis has been one of our priorities.  HR 6, the Patients and Communities Act, which passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support does just that. I thank President Trump for signing it into law so quickly. 
￼ 
_______________ 
Tuesday, I participated in the City of Webster’s annual government day when local leaders gather to discuss issues facing the community and answer questions. 
￼ 
_______________ 
Visiting every VA service center within my district has been one of my priorities as serving our veterans is a responsibility I and my office take seriously.  Thursday, I spent time at Brooksville VA Medical Outpatient Facility, touring the center and seeing firsthand the resources and services they provide veterans. I also spent time discussing issues that my office frequently hears about from our veterans. 
  
_______________
Friday was the 1st annual Hometown Heroes Community Breakfast honoring first responders in counties across my district.  I was honored to attend this breakfast and express my gratitude to our law enforcement and first responders for their commitment to keeping our communities safe.  While in Ocala, I stopped by the Chamber and Economic Partnership to drop off Hurricane supplies for their collection for our fellow Floridians in the panhandle still recovering from Hurricane Michael. 
￼
­­_______________ 
I also spent time at South Sumter Middle School, Webster Elementary School, and the Academy of Environmental Science. At Webster Elementary, in addition to speaking with teachers and school leaders during a campus tour, I was able to spend time chatting with and answering questions from 5th grade students. Meeting and talking with students is one of my favorite – and most encouraging - things to do. 
￼￼
_______________ 
Manufacturing is one of our country’s main job creators. Tuesday, I visited a local manufacturing center, the Robbins Manufacturing Company, a multigeneration family owned and operated business to discuss the importance of manufacturing and hear about what the needs are in the industry. Robbins Manufacturing produces fence posts, marine pilings, and utility poles totaling over one million cubic feet of poles and pilings in addition to over one million fence posts annually 
￼ 
_______________ 
Serving veterans is one of my priorities.  From advocating for and supporting legislation that will improve and modernize our VA system to engaging with VA liaisons and local services office on their behalf, my office has gotten back nearly $4.5 million for veterans in my district in compensation, pension or retroactive payments since January 2017.  Friday evening, I was honored to participate in the opening ceremony for the Remember Our Fallen, National Memorial Towers in the City of Crystal River.  We owe our military a debt we can never repay.

Constituent Corner
The family of a veteran in Spring Hill requested assistance from my office on an application for benefits that had been submitted a year earlier. In going through earlier correspondence, we were able to provide previously requested documents needed by the Pension Management Center (PMC) to move forward with the claim, which allowed the veteran to keep the original date of the application. Unfortunately, at this point, PMC discovered the signature page of the claim was missing. That was obtained and forwarded. Two months after contacting our office, the claim was completed with a retro check of over $20,000 going out to the veteran and monthly benefits established. 
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.  
District Update
Through the Building Blocks Ministry, adults who are mentally challenged are trained and able to volunteer at the Center among many things. They can be employed at the local businesses as well. These volunteers received the Presidential Service Award from President Trump for their volunteer work at FAITH Neighborhood Center in Groveland. Trish Kry, the Director, applied for the Award and through a six month process she was able to present the Award today. My Community Relations Representative Pam is pictured below after delivering my letter congratulation each one for their accomplishment and service.

Legislative Update
Tuesday, President Trump signed America’s Water Infrastructure Act! A priority of mine this year, developed by one my committees the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, this bill authorizes locally driven and nationally important investments in our country’s infrastructure. 
With this bill, Congress is making our ports, inland waterways, locks, dams, flood protection, ecosystem restoration and water infrastructure a priority. Not only does this bill invest in key Florida projects, it is in line with President Trump’s call to reduce red-tape and regulatory burdens.

Dear Lindsey: 
During the month of October, we have been busy hosting events across the district and meeting with local residents. A snapshot of our work throughout Contra Costa and in Washington, DC is below.

MARK'S LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Legislation to Curb Fraudulent Prescriptions Signed into Law as Part of Bipartisan, Bicameral Opioid Package
Bipartisan legislation Mark authored with Congressman Earl L. ""Buddy"" Carter (R-GA), the only pharmacist in Congress, to empower pharmacists to fully exercise their right to deny suspected fraudulent prescriptions was signed into law as part of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6). This comprehensive package will address the growing opioid epidemic. In the last 20 years the opioid prescribing rate has increased by 56 percent, bringing the risk of forged, fraudulent, or altered prescriptions to new heights. Too often these deadly drugs end up in the wrong hands. By empowering pharmacists to fully exercise their right to deny suspected fraudulent prescriptions we can help save lives and begin addressing this crisis head on. To learn more about our bill, click here.  

MARK AROUND TOWN 
Honoring Local Veterans for Promoting Peace and Serving during the Korean War 
Mark joined his fellow Bay Area colleagues to recognize 99 veterans from Contra Costa who served during the Korean War and took part in the United Nations peacekeeping mission during and after the war. Although those honored served 65 years ago, their role in promoting peace and fighting aggression in the ""Forgotten War"" must always be remembered. We owe them and their families a debt of gratitude.
￼ 
Touring the SS Red Oak Victory 
Mark toured the SS Red Oak Victory in Richmond-the last surviving ship built at the Kaiser Richmond Shipyards during World War II. The SS Red Oak Victory was preserved to serve as a museum ship, and is now part of the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park.
￼ 
Hosting 74th Town Hall in Richmond 
Mark hosted his 74th town hall and mobile district office hour in Richmond since coming to Congress less than four years ago. Meeting local residents in their communities to hear directly about their concerns and opinions is among Mark's top priorities. If you were unable to attend our most recent town hall you can watch it on our Facebook page, by clicking here.

Visiting Students at Greenbrook Elementary 
Mark visited 5th grade students at Greenbrook Elementary to share what his job is like in Washington, DC, take their questions, and talk about our nation's history.

OPINIONS FROM THE DISTRICT   
Hearing directly from you not only informs my work in Congress, but also is my favorite part of being your Representative. To share your opinions with me you can either email me or take our survey. 
Below are some of the top issues you shared with me over the last week: 
	•	95 constituents agreed with me that we should put an end to the Trump Administration's efforts to expand offshore drilling and endanger our environment and animal species.  
	•	34 constituents wrote to share their support for the Truth-In-Billing Remedies and User Empowerment (TRUE) Over Fees Act (H.R. 6987), which would advocate for consumers by requiring all television, internet, and voice service providers to advertise prices with all fees and charges included. 

LETTERS MARK RECENTLY SENT 
Letter to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos requesting an explanation of why the Department of Education is rejecting the majority of Public Service Loan Forgiveness applicants  
Two letters calling on the Administration and State Attorneys General to stop attacks and defend pre-existing condition protections for all Americans

United We Stand 
Dear Friends,

We, as a Nation, are heartbroken by Saturday’s attack at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh – an abhorrent display of anti-Semitism and hate. There is no place for violence in this country, and all places of worship are meant to be safe havens to worship and pray. 

The rising global tide of anti-Semitism in recent years must be identified and confronted with total focus and determination. We must respect and protect religious freedom – a bedrock principle and fundamental right within our great Nation. This deranged individual is a terrorist whose intention was to strike fear in a community and the country at large. His actions and goals will not prevail, and we cannot allow for his hate to fester. 

The 10th District of Georgia stands with the city of Pittsburgh, our Jewish brothers and sisters, their families, and law enforcement officers who were attacked. I pray that God brings solace and peace to their loved ones as we continue to mourn the loss of lives. 
￼

Last week, we saw more acts of hate as a madman sent pipe bomb packages to the Clintons, the Obamas, CNN, and other prominent Democrats and members of the media. Violent threats and attacks do not represent the beliefs or compassion felt and shown by most Americans. No one should be threatened, harmed, or fear for their family and safety based on their political orientation or religion. Tolerance and acceptance are fundamental qualities to our democracy, and the fabric of our discourse should always be civility.

Each of us needs to act responsibly, temper our tones, and remember that our fellow man is not our enemy.

My Week in Review
In the aftermath of the traumatic acts of the past week, it’s important to recognize those who go to work day in and day out to fiercely protect our safety and freedom. Last Monday afternoon, I stopped by Beech Haven Baptist Church in Athens to express my deepest gratitude to our local law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first responders who help safeguard our values and work to make our world a safer place. They courageously propel themselves toward danger, and they fight for the safety of others while putting their own lives at risk. May we never miss a chance to thank our officers and their families for doing a job that sometimes goes unnoticed but always is appreciated.

Congressman Hice provides a quick legislative update to the group

On Tuesday, I was grateful to participate in the Eatonton-Putnam Chamber of Commerce “Eggs and Issues” legislative breakfast. During a brief update, I shared my thoughts on President Trump’s tariff policy, our work to reduce burdensome federal regulations, and my support for expanding broadband access in rural areas, like Baldwin County. My first priority is to represent each of you in Washington, and I was happy to hear and talk about the issues that concern you the most.

As many of you know, Gwinnett County Police Department Officer Antwan Toney tragically died in the line of duty on October 20, 2018 at the young age of 30. On Wednesday, hundreds of residents lined the streets and gathered to pay tribute and honor his sacrifice. I was humbled to present Officer Toney’s family and fellow brothers in arms with flags flown over the United States Capitol to honor his life. 
￼

On Thursday, I joined folks in Covington for a Kiwanis Club meeting to discuss the latest from Washington, immigration reform, and our booming economy. The Kiwanis Clubs are a great resource for our communities, and I enjoyed hearing each of your questions regarding issues affecting our daily lives. Thanks for having me! 
￼
Congressman Hice listens to local residents about the issues pressing our Nation
First thing Saturday morning, Team Hice gathered in Jefferson County to host a Helping Our Heroes event geared toward providing breakfast hors d'oeuvres and useful information to our local veterans. It was encouraging to meet our Nation’s heroes and hear their stories firsthand. Our veterans deserve the very best we have to offer, and although I know that one event is not enough to express the extent of our gratitude, I hope that all of our local veterans know how thankful we are for their service. While there, I was also glad to update folks on the VA Mission Act, a bill signed into law earlier this year that reforms current inefficiencies at the VA, gives veterans better access to health care choices, and prevents a funding shortfall in the Veterans Choice Program. I also highlighted legislation designed to improve VA benefits that are available through the GI Bill. 

I want to especially thank Jefferson County, the American Legion, Forces United (formerly the Augusta Warrior Project), the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center, the Georgia Department of Veterans Service, and Jefferson County Vets in Action for all of their work to make this event a success. For any veterans seeking help receiving their benefits, please visit my website. My dedicated team of caseworkers would be glad to help you in any way they can.

Afterwards, I dropped by Hometown Market & Meat in Gibson to congratulate owners Fred and Rachel DeLoach on another productive year of business. As a Small Business Development Center success story, this Georgia Grown business is in its second year of operations and is dedicated to offering fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, and produce to the community. Keep up the great work!

Legislative Wins: Fighting the Opioid Crisis
For too long, families and communities all across the country, including right here in the 10th District, have suffered from the pain caused by the opioid crisis. Last Wednesday, President Trump signed H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, into law – a bipartisan legislative package that dedicates more resources to mitigating the cycle of addiction affecting the lives of so many here in Georgia. This bill takes an important step toward ending this epidemic by addressing all sides of the crisis – from addiction prevention to setting in place resources for law enforcement and families as they combat this addiction in their communities and their own homes. It is great news that this package is now law, and I am committed to continuing this strong bipartisan work to end this crisis once and for all.

Different plans for your health care Walton Tribune – 10/27 Both Hice and Johnson-Green said they’ve heard a lot about the health care issue from voters. “One thing we’ve learned about the Affordable Care Act is it certainly is not affordable, and the people in the 10th District are very much aware of this,” Hice said. “I talked to a business owner last week. Their insurance premiums have gone up 500 percent because of the Affordable Care Act.” Hice noted his 2017 vote for the American Health Care Act, a partial repeal of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as “Obamacare.” He said the newer law protects coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions and controls costs.

NEWS FROM WASHINGTON AND ACROSS WEST TEXAS
Dear Friend, 
Yet another economic report has brought good news for West Texans. Last Friday, the Commerce Department reported the economy grew at a faster-than-expected 3.5% pace last quarter. On the heels of this report, it is imperative that we not reverse course but instead keep in place policies that are working and leading to better opportunities and a renewed sense of hope and optimism for our fellow citizens. It is clear from visiting with many of you that the policies we are advocating for and advancing in Washington, DC are improving the lives of West Texans and creating a safer, stronger, and freer America. 
West Texas Road Trip 
There is nothing better than taking a road trip through District 19 to hear firsthand from the people I am so fortunate to represent. My first stop last week had me in Littlefield. It was great to catch up with Mayor Eric Turpen and the community and discuss policies affecting our region. 
￼
I also stopped out west to chat about the latest in Washington with the good people of Morton. With the economy growing stronger by the day, our nation is making advances like never before, positively impacting cities and towns throughout District 19 - that can be seen right here in Morton. 
￼ 
At my final stop, I visited with folks in Jayton - Jaybird and Lady Jay territory. In a region as rural as ours, it is important we ensure that policies in Washington support our ag producers, develop our infrastructure, shore up patient-centered health care, and strengthen our military. That is exactly what the House has been focused on this Congress. 
￼ 
West Texas Producers 
West Texas has a lot to be proud of. Our region has played a tremendous role in feeding and clothing the United States and nations around the world. The work ethic and resilience that the West Texas farmer has embodied since the beginning remains strong and true, making the future of Texas ag bright for years to come. Thank you to The Texas Lyceum for inviting me to join the quarterly meeting. 
￼ 
No Higher Honor 
Those that choose to put that sacred uniform on are the best of the best that our nation has to offer. Only a handful of those service members have been awarded the highest and most prestigious military decoration, the Medal of Honor. It was humbling to attend a wreath laying for two Texas Tech University Red Raiders bestowed with this recognition for their selfless sacrifice. Read Lubbock A-J’s write up on the event here. 
￼ 
Texas Education 
A few weeks ago, Professor Clint Inmon joined the veterans that visited Washington for the Texas South Plains Honor Flight, and last week, I had to opportunity to speak with a few of his Texas government classes at Lubbock Christian University. It was exciting to see so many of his students passionate about our democracy and interested in how our nation is governed!
￼ 
Rural Texas Tools 
In August, we held our first West Texas Rural Summit in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to analyze issues affecting our region and others like ours. A few of the issues we discussed were the opioid epidemic, rural healthcare, and economic development.
￼ 
Earlier this month, Assistant to the Secretary for Rural Development Anne Hazlett announced a new interactive data tool that will help our rural communities combat the opioid crisis by giving our local leaders the information they need to develop solutions at the grassroots level.
This goes to show that our conversations are spurring positive change in our communities. Read more about the USDA’s initiative here.  
Raider Nation Helm 
In local news, Dr. Tedd Michell was named the fifth Chancellor of the Texas Tech University System. I’ve known Dr. Mitchell and his wife for many years and had the privilege of working with him while serving as Vice Chancellor at Texas Tech. Dr. Mitchell has a West Texas way about him and the rare ability to connect with folks in academia as well as the broader community of students, faculty, and alumni. He and Janet will be a great leadership team for Raider Nation, Angelo State, and all components of the Texas Tech University System. I give him, two ‘Guns Up!' Read more on his appointment here. 
2018 Hero of the Year 
Additionally, congratulations is also due and deserving to my former boss and fellow Red Raider Kent Hance for being named the Community Foundation of West Texas 2018 Hero of the Year! No one embodies the West Texas spirit better or has contributed more to our community over the years than Kent has. During a career of service spanning from the State Senate to the U.S. House of Representatives and finally back home as Chancellor of Texas Tech, Kent Hance has left a lasting mark on our region for which all us West Texans are grateful for. I could not be happier for Kent as he receives this well-deserved recognition and am proud to call him a mentor and friend.

This bipartisan bill marks the most significant congressional effort to combat the crisis hurting Americans across the country.  ￼   RepPeteOlson  I strongly condemn the murder of @WashingtonPost reporter Jamal Khashoggi. A fundamental tenet of our nation is a free press that cannot be suppressed by acts of violence. The Saudi govt must disclose the facts surrounding the heinous circumstances of his death. My statement:  ￼ 
Dear Friend,  This weekend, we were devastated to see 11 of our fellow Americans massacred and six others wounded at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in a vicious act of religious bigotry and hatred. Anti-Semitism, hatred and violence have no place in our country and will not be tolerated. I strongly condemn this cowardly act of violence. I’ve been encouraged seeing people of all faiths come to together to reject this bigotry and lift up the hearts of this community in their time of grief. We must never let hate win.   President Trump Signs Water Infrastructure Bill Into Law   Last week, President Trump signed America’s Water Infrastructure Act (WRDA) into law. This critical law helps Houston by investing in our ports, channels, locks, flood protection and critical infrastructure projects that support our waterway transportation systems. It also includes my amendment to expedite previously authorized Army Corps of Engineers projects in areas impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. After three years of historic flooding - including Harvey - the sooner our communities can begin rebuilding, the sooner we will be prepared for future storms.  Comment Period Open For Coastal Protection Study   On Friday, the Texas General Land Office and Army Corps of Engineers released a draft proposal for a large study, which will help protect our coast and our communities from future storms. I look forward to studying the report and encourage all who are interested to review it. You can find more information and submit your comments during the 75 day public comment period here.  Talking Congress with the Country Place Women’s Discussion Group   It was an honor to join the Country Place Women’s Discussion Group to provide an update on my work in DC.

Next Steps in the Fight Against Opioids
On October 24, President Trump signed into law a landmark bipartisan bill to fight the opioid crisis.
Called the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, this legislation takes a comprehensive approach to the opioid crisis. It helps with treating addiction, reduces the availability of illegal substances, and advances the development of non-addictive painkillers.
I was proud to make significant contributions to this legislative process. Language I introduced to improve state Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) was included in the final version of the law. These reforms will make it easier for states to share and compare information, and ultimately will help doctors make more informed decisions as they prescribe drugs to their patients.
The House and the Senate each passed this new law with overwhelming bipartisan support, a sign of our commitment to solving this crisis. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act resulted from an extensive legislative process. But it is not the end of our work.
To start, some of the law’s provisions are for pilot programs that, if successful, offer a basis for further use. One example is the authorization for comprehensive treatment centers. I believe these centers will benefit people struggling with addiction, and this pilot program should be expanded and more centers authorized in the future.
The investigations continue into how so many pain pills could be available with so little apparent concern about where they were headed. As Vice Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, I have been an active participant in these examinations.
So far, we have conducted an extensive inquiry into how small towns in West Virginia received millions of pills. The investigation has included grilling drug distributors and officials with the Drug Enforcement Agency about their oversight of suspiciously large orders of pain pills.
More recently, we have opened an investigation into some questionable practices of drug manufacturers; for instance, some have understated the addictive capabilities of their products, or used inappropriate, even illegal, tactics in selling them. We need answers from these manufacturers: what did they know about the addictiveness of their products, and when did they know it?
I joined with the bipartisan leadership of the Committee in sending opioid manufacturers what I call a “nastygram” that demands they turn over specific information. If they do not give us the information the American people deserve, my colleagues and I are ready to use the powers we have, including subpoenas if necessary, to get these answers.
The same week President Trump signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, I participated in a roundtable discussion on opioid misuse in rural Virginia convened in Abingdon. It was sponsored by U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development and included federal, state, and local leaders as well as medical professionals.
In my remarks, I observed that a one-size-fits-all approach to the opioid crisis will not work. Each community is different. Rural communities have different challenges than urban areas.
Part of our discussion focused on what we can do to help rural communities rehabilitate people who overcome addiction. Sometimes a person who has battled addiction has to start from scratch: finding a new job, housing, and means of transportation. In rural areas, these assets are not always close at hand. It is important that we develop “recovery friendly” workplaces and housing options so recovering addicts have safe, welcoming points of entry back into full participation in our communities.
Tim Thomas, Federal Co-Chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission, observed at the roundtable that Appalachians are 65% more likely than other Americans to die as a result of addiction.
That’s a sobering statistic, and a reminder of the importance of this effort. So, too, are the questions and stories I hear from you. Constituents ask me often about what we are doing to battle opioid addiction. Many have experience with it because a family member or friend has battled addiction. Some have lost loved ones to addiction.
The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act provides critical tools for those fighting the scourge of opioids. But it is also in our communities that the most important actions are taking place. Let us continue to work together to turn the tide of this devastating epidemic.
If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.  You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671. To reach my office via email, please visit my website at www.morgangriffith.house.gov. Also on my website is the latest material from my office, including information on votes recently taken on the floor of the House of Representatives.

Dear Lindsey,
I write to you today with a heavy heart following the hateful acts of the past week, culminating in the brutal murder of two African Americans at a Kroger grocery store in Kentucky and 11 Jewish worshippers at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.
We mourn the loss of Maurice Stallard and Vickie Lee Jones who were assassinated allegedly for their skin color while grocery shopping, and of brothers David and Cecil Rosenthal, husband and wife Bernice and Sylvan Simon, Daniel Stein, Jerry Rabinowitz, Richard Gottfried, Joyce Feinberg, Rose Malinger, Melvin Wax, Irving Younger, and Daniel Leger who were murdered simply for being Jews.
No one in this country, which must continue to shine as a beacon of freedom of speech and religion and serve as a melting pot of cultures, should be fearful for their life because of their political views, their faith, or the color of their skin. Hate and anti-Semitism must never be tolerated in this country. This weekend we saw the destruction that bigotry can cause.
So today, I renew my fight for the bipartisan Never Again Holocaust Education Act which I introduced to give teachers the resources they need to teach their students about the Holocaust, genocide, and the price we all pay because of hate and bigotry. If we do not learn from the past, we are doomed to repeat it.
In solidarity,
￼

￼

￼
￼
￼
￼

While it’s been another busy week around the district, I want to focus today on what’s happening recently in our nation.  To say these are trying times is an understatement.  In the past week, our nation witnessed the mailing of bombs to elected leaders and the press, the racially-motivated murder of two African-Americans in Kentucky, and the anti-Semitic mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that claimed 11 lives.
Saturday’s attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue is the most deadly attack on the Jewish community in the history of our country.  But this heinous crime does not stand in isolation.  Recent memory includes the 2015 attack in a Charleston church during bible study, and the 2012 attack on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin.
I am personally heartbroken by the tragic loss of life in these and all hate crimes.  I am at the same time inspired by the heroic actions of our first responders who suppress fear and rush in when these events occur.  And I am profoundly frustrated by the inability of our nation to keep our houses of worship, our schools, and our public squares safe from such senseless violence. 
My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families, but we have to do more. We must take action with commonsense gun safety laws to make it harder for dangerous individuals fueled by hate to access firearms and mass murder innocents. And we must unite as one nation to condemn hate in all forms, including racism and anti-Semitism, and those who incite it.  
I was reminded this morning of President Washington’s famous letter to the Touro Synagogue in Rhode Island.  In it, he wished for the Jewish community of the United States the following: “May the children of the stock of Abraham who dwell in this land continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants—while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree and there shall be none to make him afraid.” 
I pray that in this moment we come together to ensure the security and sanctity for all Americans to pray and practice their faith in the sanctuary of their own houses of worship, freely, and free of fear. 
Please continue reading to learn about my recent work in and around the 10th District. 
  
BRAD AT YOUR BUSINESS VISITS 
This year, I've already visited more than three dozen local businesses in Illinois’s Tenth District to hear from management and workers alike. I always learn something during these #BradAtYourBusiness visits and they help inform my votes in Washington as I seek to create the certainty and conditions needed for businesses to grow, hire, and succeed. 
￼ 

Last week, I visited Certasun in Buffalo Grove, a home solar company serving the Chicagoland area and also toured a nearby home where they recently installed panels. I also visited StarTek Lighting America in Gurnee, which now employs more than a dozen workers designing, engineering, and manufacturing energy-efficient LED lighting. 
Both business are “green” success stories in our district. Renewable sources of energy like solar and energy efficiency improvements like LED lighting are not just needed reduce emissions and address global climate change, they are also job creators.
￼ 

  
NEW REPORT ON IMPACT OF GOP TAX BILL 
A new report produced for my colleagues Rep. Jan Schakowsky and Rep. Robin Kelly illuminates how damaging the partisan new tax bill is for Illinois families. Due to the restriction of the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction, 57,000 households in the Tenth District now face double taxation. The fact is we still need real reform of our tax code, and I remain willing to work across the aisle on real reform that is fair, fiscally responsible, and grows our economy.
Read the report here 
  
BRAD’S BOOKWORMS ELEMENTARY READING PROGRAM STILL ENROLLING!
￼ 
  
There’s still time for Tenth District elementary students to enroll and complete the Brad’s Bookworms reading challenge!
Children participating in the program are asked to read at least 10 books with help from parents, grandparents, older siblings, or other family members before November 30, 2018 and track their progress toward this goal. Young people who meet their goal of 10 books will be invited with their families to join me at a recognition ceremony celebrating their achievement.
Learn more about the program on our website.

Dear Friend,

 
Hope you had a good weekend with cool crisp days -- you've probably been outside raking leaves!
You may have caught this in the news recently, but in case you missed it, the United States was named the most competitive economy in the world, retaking the crown from Hong Kong. Since the new once-in-a-generation tax reform passed into law, American companies can finally compete without one hand tied behind their back. And, making American manufacturers and workers more competitive is key to keeping innovation, manufacturing and headquarters here in the United States.
Over the past week I visited with two Wayzata 9th grade civics classes and toured employers and met with employees at Cargill, Honeywell, Abbott and Hartfield Automation, among others. I've also continued to visit with a wide network of senior living communities.
Have a great week and please let me know whenever I can be of assistance to you or your family. Join the conversation online by visiting my website, Facebook page, Twitter, and Instagram and as always, watch the latest Erik's Correspondence Corner.
￼

 
Sincerely,
 
￼ Erik Paulsen Member of Congress
A Win in the Fight Against Opioids
Some good news: landmark legislation aimed at combatting the fight against opioid addiction was signed into law last week. It's a bipartisan bill that included measures I authored that will help prevent addiction and overdose among seniors, many of whom are at particular risk. This is the single largest congressional effort in history to combat a single drug crisis, and this law will put more resources into the hands of Minnesotans on the front lines of the fight. 
The end result will be fewer overdoses, fewer deaths due to addiction and safer communities. 
Improving Our Water Infrastructure
Also signed into law last week: the America's Water Infrastructure Act, which sets our national water infrastructure priorities: reducing flooding risk, improving drinking water quality, and ensuring our port facilities are keeping American goods competitive on the world stage.
This is a bipartisan measure that will help ensure our ports, dams and waterways are safe and usable for future generations. It's not the kind of thing that dominates the news headlines, but it's a good example of the important, bipartisan work that makes a difference in people's lives and helps our economy.
Preventing Breast Cancer
As many of you may know, October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I recently authored a measure that recognizes the lifesaving role of 3D breast tomosynthesis in the screening and treatment of breast cancer. This issue was brought to my attention by Jeni from Minnesota who lost her sister to breast cancer. Fortunately, Jeni herself survived a battle with breast cancer because it was detected early by a 3D breast cancer screening. I worked with local health care providers to draft this resolution, which encourages all federal health care programs to promote access to this lifesaving technology, calls upon private sector insurers to cover and fairly reimburse for this , and supports efforts by the public health community to publicize the merits and availability of 3D digital breast tomosynthesis.
Protecting Access to Care for Seniors
I continue to hear concerns from doctors and patients about the Administration's proposal to impose ""step therapy"" protocols on seniors enrolled in certain Medicare Advantage plans. In short, it requires doctors to first prescribe the lowest-cost treatment to a senior -- rather than the treatment they think is best for their patient. It's intended to lower costs, but it would put many patients with diseases or cancer at risk. I wrote about the concerns I've heard in The Hill, here.

Last Week in Congress
Praying for Pittsburgh and the Jewish Community
￼ Kevin speaking at the Anti-Defamation League in 2014
This week, we pray and mourn for the Jewish community in Pittsburgh and around the country after the horrific attack on Saturday, in which 11 lives were lost at the Tree of Life Synagogue. We must send a clear message: anti-semitism will not be tolerated. Unfortunately, the Third District is all too familiar with the evil of anti-semitism, as it struck our area in the attack at the Jewish Community Center and Village Shalom in 2014, where we tragically lost three members of our community. In the aftermath of that attack, our community came together in unity to stand against this evil. As I said to the Anti-Defamation League's National Leadership Summit shortly after the Overland Park shootings, ""The idea that anybody in our community, no matter what religion they are, no matter what race or culture they’re from, would have to fear being targeted, to being killed based upon that, cannot be accepted, cannot be tolerated, cannot be allowed. We must stand up."" An attack on one member of our community, or our country, is an attack on all of us. Now, our whole nation must come together and take a stand against hatred, violence, and anti-semitism. 
￼
Chairman Yoder Calls for Unity in Wake of Attempted Bombings
￼ ￼ Click here to watch Kevin discuss the mail bombs
Last week our nation was shaken by bombs sent in the mail to current and former Democratic lawmakers, but thankfully no one was injured. I strongly condemn this heinous act. Violence has no place in American politics, and this attempt to harm prominent Democratic leaders and the news media is terrorism, plain and simple. Republicans and Democrats must come together to prioritize civility and ensure that the divides between us never lead to violence. As Chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, I worked with the Secret Service and other law enforcement to closely monitor the situation as they worked to apprehend the suspect. 
￼
Economy Continues Strong Growth in Third Quarter
￼ ￼ Click here to read more from Bloomberg
The economy continues to grow at a rapid pace, and in the recent report on the third quarter shows that it grew by 3.5% - higher than forecasted. The growth was driven by strong consumer spending, a fundamental part of our economy that is the healthiest it has been in years. Importantly, the report also shows that our economy has grown by 3% over the last calendar year. Republicans have pursued pro-growth policies during this Congress, and our promise was to get our economy back to strong growth rates of more than 3%. Friday's report proves that we kept that promise, and I am committed to working on further policies that ensure our economy stays on the right track for the long term.
￼
Report Shows Action Needed on Child Care Costs
￼ Click here for the full report from ChildCare Aware
A report from ChildCare Aware shows the cost of child care remains too high. In Kansas, infant care is more expensive than average tuition at a public university. Parents shouldn't have to choose between work and their kids. That's why I introduced bipartisan PACE Act last year. The PACE Act improves and expands child care tax credits and tax-free savings accounts. My legislation fixes outdated provisions that prevent low-income families from utilizing these programs, and it helps all working parents provide safe, quality care for their children.
￼
Historic Opioid Bill Signed into Law
￼ Click here to learn more about this legislation
The opioid crisis has touched communities across the country as drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for people under the age of 50. This fall, Congress came together in a bipartisan fashion to address the misuse of opioids and the painfully damaging effects it has on our families and communities. I was proud to support H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which was signed into law by the president last week. 
This legislation is the most significant congressional effort against a single drug crisis in history. The legislation focuses on four key areas: treatment and recovery, prevention, protecting communities, and fighting fentanyl. Among other important steps, this legislation encourages non-addictive opioid alternatives, improves data to identify and help at-risk patients and families, establishes comprehensive opioid recovery centers, and provides incentives for enhanced care, coordination and innovation for treatment and recovery methods. H.R. 6 also provides tools and resources to local law enforcement to help combat illegal drug trafficking. I am hopeful that this monumental bill will help us turn the tide against the opioid crisis.
￼
Domestic Violence Awareness Month
￼
Each year, 4.7 million women are victims of domestic violence. This problem does not discriminate - it impacts people regardless of race, wealth, or identity. In Congress, I am working hard to combat this crime and protect victims. I have been a strong supporter of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and the programs under this law that fight against domestic violence. Federal funding from this bill goes directly to local efforts in the Third District that are making a huge difference every day. I support the reauthorization of VAWA, and I will continue working to strengthen these programs. For more information and resources on domestic violence, click here.

Consensus Civility Award Goes to Third District Constituent, Sunayana Dumala
￼ Kevin with Sunayana Dumala
Congratulations to my friend, Sunayana Dumala, for receiving this year’s Consensus Civility Award. I have been honored to get to know Sunayana and have seen her work every day to promote civility, community, and a sense of welcome to people around the globe. Unfortunately, I met Sunayana under the most horrific of circumstances when her husband was the fatal victim of a hate crime at a neighborhood restaurant in Olathe. While Sunayana was dealing with her intense grief and loss, she was inspired to establish Forever Welcome, a social media campaign supported by her employer to show that America is still a welcoming and safe place for current and future immigrants.
Sunayana’s message of unity and acceptance continues to spread across our region and across the world, creating a wave of positive change. I am humbled and honored to have nominated her for this important award. Congratulations again to Sunayana, and to all of the winners of this year’s award.

Journey School of Choice in KCK
￼ Kevin with Principal Rena Duewel and Superintendent Dr. Jason Dandoy
Having heard much about the Journey School of Choice (JSOC) in the Turner School District, I was glad to have the opportunity to visit last week. The JSOC provides a wonderful alternative educational opportunity for students that is individually designed for their specific needs as they focus on their academic goals. Students graduating from JSOC are well prepared for their futures having completed graduation requirements that are self-paced. Thank you to Principal Rena Duewel, Superintendent Dr. Jason Dandoy, and the teachers I visited with for taking the time to share with me this unique and successful educational program that is making a difference in Kansas City, Kansas.
￼
Manufacturing Day at Allegion
￼ Kevin with the Allegion team
Manufacturing is a key sector of our growing economy, providing quality careers and well-paying jobs to millions of Americans - including over 160,000 Kansans. It was great to join Allegion last week in Olathe during their Manufacturing Day event to tour the facility and hear firsthand from employees on the positive impact that manufacturing has in their lives. Our economy has been adding manufacturing jobs at the fastest rate since 1995, and these high-quality jobs are making a real difference for American workers. 
￼
Yoder Hosts Another Medicare Enrollment Assistance Event
￼ Kevin at the Medicare enrollment event
Last Tuesday, at my Medicare Open Enrollment Assistance Event in the KCK West Wyandotte Library, I visited with several seniors from the Third District about their Medicare options. Every year, seniors save thousands of dollars after learning about new Medicare plans at these events. Thank you to the dedicated counselors from the Senior Health Insurance Counseling for Kansas (SHICK) program, the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services Resources, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, who were on hand at the event and provided one-on-one assistance to seniors who had questions or who wished to make changes to their plans.
If you were unable to attend last week's event, you can always contact State Health Insurance Counseling for Kansas (SHICK) volunteers at 1-800-860-5260 or visit Medicare.gov for additional information. As a reminder, the Medicare open enrollment period will end on December 7th, and, if you would like to consider changes, you must do so during this time.
￼
Yoder Visits Political Science Class at Olathe North High School
￼ Kevin speaking to the Olathe North class
I started off last Wednesday with a remarkable classroom of students at Olathe North High School. These juniors and seniors, from the Distinguished Scholars Political Science class and AP Government, had thoughtful questions regarding a wide range of legislative issues both domestic and international. Thank you to Mr. Stu Stern for his excellence in teaching in preparing our future leaders.
￼
Bichelmeyer Meats in KCK
￼ Kevin eating lunch with Joe Bichelmeyer
Five generations of the Bichelmeyer Family have been providing meat to Kansas City, KS and the surrounding area since the 1890s. It was wonderful to stop by this historic small business Bichelmeyer Meats and see their operations firsthand. I enjoyed visiting with Joe and Jim Bichelmeyer, touring their operation, and discussing the latest Farm Bill. Thank you to the Bichelmeyer’s for the great tour and delicious lunch spot.
￼
Growth Energy Bus Tour
￼ Kevin with Nicona Lane and Samantha Tenpenny
Great news for Kansas farmers and biofuel producers: earlier this month, an outdated restriction that prevents E15 ethanol blends from being sold in the summer months was lifted. This change will help our farmers by increasing domestic market demand, and it will provide consumers access to a cleaner burning, better valued homegrown fuel. It was great to meet with Growth Energy in Overland Park during their bus tour to rally support for E15 ethanol blends so we can have cleaner, more affordable options at the pump.
￼
Harcros Chemicals Inc.
￼  
Harcros Chemicals is a worldwide manufacturer of innovative and sustainable chemicals headquartered in KCK, with facilities across the US. As a major competitor in the chemical industry, Harcros takes the extra step to produce effective, safe, and environmentally friendly products that are transported across the globe. October is National Manufacturing Month, and today I spent time visiting with the leadership team at Harcros and talking about important federal issues that impact this employee-owned corporation. Harcros is the source of many good jobs in our district, and I am working hard to make sure that businesses like them are able to thrive. Manufacturing is the backbone of this economy, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to support the growth and expansion of manufacturing companies like Harcros Chemicals.

Dear Friends, 
Over 250,000 individuals will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year and 11% of those cases will be in women younger than 45. October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month and I invite you to join me for a panel discussion on the emotional and mental health impacts related to breast cancer. 
￼
Many women report feelings of shock, distress, anxiety and depression during and after treatment. Challenges associated with cancer go beyond the diagnosis and are unique to each patient. Especially for underserved communities, access to affordable care is often out of reach. It's important to remember that you are not alone. 
We will hear from:  
	•	Ali Kent, survivor and board member of Bay Area Young Survivors
	•	Sasha Merritt, tattoo artist at Dragonfly Ink Cosmetic & Custom Tattoo 
	•	Dr. Dianne Shumay, Director of Psycho-Oncology at UCSF
	•	Dr. Amie Lee, Director of Clinical Operations at ZSFG Avon Breast Imaging
	•	Christy Oliger, Senior Vice President BioOncology at Genentech  
Following the panel, there will be an opportunity for audience members to ask questions and share their own experiences. Please sign up here. 
You Are Not Alone - Breast Cancer Awareness Month  Monday, October 29, 2018 7:00 p.m.-8:30 p.m. Multi-Use Building, Rm 140 City College San Francisco 50 Phelan Avenue San Francisco, CA 94112 
REGISTER HERE! 
  
We are strengthened when we discuss our mental well-being and support one another during difficult times. In addition to the panel, there will be a wide range of information available on support groups, current research, affordable healthcare services, apps, resources for veterans, and more. Please make sure you don’t miss out on this opportunity to learn about local programs. 
I look forward to seeing you tonight.

Dear Lindsey, 
Last week, many of us were shaken by the actions of criminals who attempted to attack pillars of this democracy, American leaders, free press, and freedom of religion. A civilized society has no place for cowardly acts of domestic terrorism, and the perpetrators will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. We must be able to disagree with one another without resorting to intimidation and political violence. I would like to once again thank the Secret Service, Capitol Police, local law enforcement, and federal law enforcement agencies for working so hard to keep America safe.   Last Monday, I witnessed firsthand what our men and women in blue do every day to protect the region. Thanks to the St. Louis County Police Department’s Affton Precinct, Captain Melissa Webb, and Officer Michael Costa for hosting me. A special congratulations also goes to Officer Costa who was awarded Officer of the Year by the South County Police Business Association! I’m tremendously proud of our law enforcement officers and the sacrifices they make on a daily basis to serve our community.

Our first responders are consistently working to better Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District. This past week was Red Ribbon Week, an important week sponsored by the Drug Enforcement Administration to educate and increase awareness about the danger of drugs. Many local police departments and municipalities participated in National Drug Take-Back Day, which gave people the opportunity to do their part by safely disposing of unused or expired prescriptions. The opioid crisis ravaging our nation has taken thousands of lives, and Congress is working hard to actively combat this epidemic. By passing H.R. 6, which the President just signed into law, we are providing resources for those in need and taking critical steps to get these deadly drugs off the streets. 
In our competitive economic landscape, I have worked hard to promote job growth and increase access to capital for America’s entrepreneurs. I was honored to receive the Champion of Small Business Investing Award by the Small Business Investor Alliance (SBIA). The SBIA is the leading association of lower middle market private equity funds and investors, and has invested more than $685 million in Missouri businesses over the past 10 years. Small businesses are the economic engine of our nation. I’m proud to consistently support legislation that allows them to give back to their employees, innovate, and grow.

October 29, 2018   Dear  @gmail.com, 
Americans today continue to mourn the inexcusable act of evil in Pittsburgh over the weekend. As a Christian by faith I reject such hatred and violence directed at any of God's children, and I share the hope of President George Washington who, referencing Micah 4:3-4, wrote in 1790: 
""May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants; while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid.""  
That is the cornerstone of religious liberty, enshrined in our Constitution, and it remains the belief of freedom-loving Americans across this land. Those who, because of the evil and hatred in their hearts, seek to deny to any fellow citizen their right to life and liberty deserve to face justice under our laws.  
Amid the darkness of the past several days, there were also good things to recall. Last week President Trump signed two major bills into law that will make a difference in every part of the country, including here in central and southern Illinois.  
The first bill was the America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, a culmination of bipartisan efforts in both the House and the Senate to invest in the critical water infrastructure. This includes funding for everything from the ports, channels, locks and dams that facilitate commerce; to the reservoirs, pumps, treatment plans, and pipes that bring clean drinking water to our homes and schools; to the scores of hydropower facilities that generate clean, reliable electricity. 
My environment subcommittee specifically contributed to the bill's drinking water provisions, authorizing $4.4 billion over three years to help water systems make necessary upgrades, complete major projects, and get the technical assistance they need to continue providing safe, clean, and affordable drinking water. Working across the aisle, we were able to reauthorize the Safe Drinking Water Act for the first time in more than 20 years through this bill.  
You can learn more about the investments and regulatory reforms made to our nation's water infrastructure systems HERE.   
The second major bill President Trump signed last week was the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, the most significant action taken by Congress yet in response to the opioid epidemic. This bill, which is actually a combination of many smaller bipartisan bills, addresses all angles of the opioid crisis including the manufacturing, prescribing, importation, dumping, abuse, and treatment of and for those drugs. Provisions similar to bipartisan legislation I introduced this year also will help incentivize alternatives to opioids for pain management.  
You can learn more about this new law, as well as ongoing investigations and previous legislation, HERE.  
Thank you for reading.

$922 Million Authorized for New Soo Lock at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan 
Project is vital to our national economy and our national security – and a major win for Minnesota miners, businesses, and farmers whose products move through the Great Lakes chain to manufacturers and suppliers all the way up the St. Lawrence Seaway. 
￼  The Soo Locks are the gateway through which 13 percent of our annual Gross National Product – much of it Range iron ore and Minnesota agricultural commodities – move from Lake Superior through the Great Lakes chain, supplying America’s great steel mills and manufacturing centers all the way up the St. Lawrence Seaway. In this photo, the 1,200-foot Mesabi Miner moves Range iron ore through the Poe Lock, which is scheduled to be replaced as part of the $922 million improvement project.  
Dear Friend,  
The Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan are vital to our national economy and our national security, so the President’s signature last week on the Water Resources Development Act authorizing $922 million for urgently needed repairs and upgrades is really good news. For Great Lakes Democrats and Republicans alike, and particularly for those of us who serve on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, restoration of the Soo Locks has been a major priority for many years.   It will now be up to the next Congress to actually appropriate the funds so construction can begin on a new, 1,200-foot-long lock to accommodate the 1,000-foot laker ships that originate from the Port of Duluth and Two Harbors here in Minnesota. The Locks are the gateway through which 13 percent of our annual Gross National Product – much of it Range iron ore and Minnesota agricultural commodities – move from Lake Superior through the Great Lakes chain, supplying America’s great steel mills and manufacturing centers all the way up the St. Lawrence Seaway.  So in terms of getting this new lock built, the stakes could not be higher. As I have pointed out many times before, the Department of Homeland Security has concluded that within six weeks of an unexpected closure at the Soo Locks, 75 percent of all U.S. steel production would cease, triggering a $1.1 trillion decrease in economic activity and a depression worse than what we experienced in 2008 and 2009. The steel shutdown would reverberate through the supply chain, closing down Iron Range mines along with the production of automobiles, farm equipment, appliances and parts and products vital to our national defense.

Nolan Amendment Accelerating War on Zebra Mussels, Asian Carp, Other Aquatic Invasive Species Becomes Law 
￼  In addition to the harm they inflict on loons, fish and other aquatic life, invasive zebra mussels can cause serious damage to boats, as evidenced by the swarm on this propeller. 
Invasive zebra mussels spread deadly infections to our Minnesota Loons and destroy sport and commercial fishing habitat. My amendment to the Water Resources Development Act, signed into law last week, directs the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to accelerate the battle against these invaders, along with Asian carp and hundreds of other species attacking our lakes, rivers and waterways.  Specifically, this provision directs the Secretary of Transportation to immediately undertake an intensive research effort focusing on “the management and eradication of aquatic invasive species, including Asian carp and zebra mussels.” Within six months, the Secretary is directed to submit a report to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, recommending a plan to “address the spread and impacts of aquatic invasive species.”   Back in 2014, my amendment to a previous Water Resources bill expanded the federal definition of invasive species from plants only to include aquatic invaders such as zebra mussels and Asian carp. This new provision builds on that success, helping ensure cleaner water, healthy loons, and more stability for our multi-billion dollar Minnesota-Great Lakes commercial and sport fishing industry for generations to come.  

Here We Go Again! GOP Looks to Revive Their Health Care Debacle
Their plan would have allowed insurance companies to deny coverage to millions of Americans with preexisting conditions. 
￼  Just in time for Halloween.  
The Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obama Care) proved to be an unmitigated disaster. There was nothing in the measure to like, the American people did not support it, the damage it stood to cause was irreparable, and its fate was well deserved. But last week, believe it or not, GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Republicans would likely try to revive this debacle of a bill following the November elections. So let’s review the highlights:
According to the independent Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the GOP measure stood to: 
	•	Allow insurance companies to deny coverage to millions of Americans with preexisting conditions, or make health insurance too expensive for them to afford.  
	•	Cause 24 million Americans to lose their health insurance by 2026.  
	•	Remove comprehensive health insurance requirements for essential services including Preventative Care, Emergency Room Care, Hospitalization, Prescriptions, Maternity Care, Newborn Care, Mental Health Care and Chronic Disease Management.  
	•	Cut Medicaid assistance to the elderly, the disabled, the poor and the most vulnerable people by $880 billion dollars over the next ten years – devastating rural hospitals and essential public health programs.  
	•	Allow insurance companies to charge seniors up to five times more than younger people for insurance, and raise everybody’s insurance premiums by 15 to 20 percent over the next two years.  
	•	Hand $600 billion dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans and richest, most powerful corporations. 
If Republicans were serious about real health care reform, they would join some 200 House Democrats and 19 Senate Democrats in support of a universal, single payer “Medicare for All” system where everyone pays the same premium, everyone is covered, and everyone receives top quality care. Virtually every other industrialized western nation provides health care in this way for lower cost, with better overall outcomes. It’s time for us to do the same.  

GRANT WATCH 
Duluth's Zero-Emission Electric Buses are Rolling Thanks to $6.4 Million Federal Transit Grant Secured in 2015
￼  My staff and I were honored to help the City of Duluth secure a $6.4 million Federal Transit Administration grant to replace six outdated diesel buses with these state-of-the-art, zero emission, fast charge electric buses, plus two on-route fast charge stations. 
The electric buses began rolling in Duluth last Wednesday, and my staff and I were proud to help make it happen.   Given our long, cold winters, there is no better city than Duluth to demonstrate fast-charging electric bus technology – leading the way for other cold weather cities to incorporate clean, sustainable technologies into their transit systems. That, in a nutshell, is the pitch I delivered to then Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx back in 2014 as we began our successful effort to secure a $6.4 million federal grant for the City of Duluth to replace six outdated diesel buses with highly efficient, zero-emission electric buses.   We worked hard, banged on a lot of doors, built support from the Obama Administration, the Minnesota delegation, and other Members of Congress – and finally, on February 2, 2015, we were able to announce that the grant had been approved and the project would move forward. Hats off as well to Minnesota Department of Transportation (MNDOT) Commissioner Charlie Zelle, the Duluth Transit Authority, and Duluth City leaders for their tremendous support and contributions in bringing this project to fruition. 

Our Week in Duluth
￼  My District Director Jeff Anderson joined Duluth Mayor Emily Larson, State Representative Liz Olson, and representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), St. Louis River Alliance, City of Duluth, Senator Tina Smith’s office and other stakeholders to tour the Minnesota Slip Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) project this week. Pictured above is Duluth Mayor Emily Larson speaking to tour attendees. 
￼  The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative project at the slip sites in Duluth will result in the remediation of about 37,000 cubic yards of polluted sediment in the slip. The polluted sediment is being capped with 2 feet of dredged material from clean areas of the harbor. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is a bipartisan effort that I have been so proud to champion during my time in Congress. 
Our Week in Royalton Township  
￼  Royalton Township in Pine County employed an artist to paint this beautiful rural Minnesota mural on the side of their maintenance building. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen snapped this photo of the mural. 
Our Week in Hinckley 
￼  The Region 7-E Adult Mental Health Initiatives Community Conversation was held at the Grand Casino in Hinckley. These community conversations are a part of a five county effort to identify and address mental health issues. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen attended the meeting on my behalf. 
Our Week in North Branch 
￼  North Branch Mayor Kirsten Kennedy and GPS 45:93 President Nancy Hoffman met with the Trade Delegation from Korea at the Lakes EMS facility in North Branch to discuss trade related issues. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen attended the meeting.  
Our Week in Braham
￼  The Grand Opening of the Northstar Family Advocacy Center in Braham was held last week. They are a 501(c)3 non profit organization providing services throughout Isanti County including working with children and vulnerable adults in reported cases of abuse. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen attended the opening.  
Our Week in Baxter 
￼  A Partnership Recognition Event was held at the Mississippi River Overlook Park. The partnership between the City of Baxter, the Brainerd School District, Camp Ripley, the Nature Conservancy, and the Conservation fund will add to the school forest and city park as well as protect the mission of Camp Ripley by allowing training without disturbing residential properties. In this photo, Brigadier General Lowell Kruse describes the benefits of the project for Camp Ripley. Nolan Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein attended the celebration on my behalf.
Our Week in McGrath 
￼  American Peat Technology held an open house for community members. APT is working to open a second peat mine in Seavey Township in rural Aitkin County. The event drew local residents and leaders interested in learning more about the project. Nolan Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein attended the event on my behalf.  

Finally...
Remember the Great Halloween Blizzard of 1991? 
￼  This one word Duluth News Tribune headline said it all. That remarkable Halloween blizzard dumped up to 28 inches of the Northland and much of Minnesota. We hope the weather will be more cooperative this year when trick or treaters head out for Halloween this coming Wednesday. 
￼  Trick or treating during the Halloween blizzard of 1991 - 28 inches of snow didn’t deter this brave little guy.

Dear Friend, 
Easing the Burden of Student Loan Debt
Student loan debt makes it harder and harder for graduates to get ahead. I’ve recently introduced the Student Loan Repayment Acceleration Act, legislation that would make it easier to pay off student loans. This bill would allow employers to contribute to their employees’ loans like many do for 401k plans. Every little bit helps and this can be a model for further policies to deal with the growing problem of student loan debt.  
Read my full statement on the bill here. 
ICYMI: Read about my legislation from the Colorado Sun here. 
Protecting First Responders of 9/11
I've introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), that will permanently reauthorize and fund the Victim Compensation Fund (VCF). This legislation would ensure that 9/11 first responders who become sick with certified 9/11 illnesses in the future would be covered by the VCF program. The VCF has already approved over 19,204 claims, and as more 9/11 first responders continue to grow ill, this bill will ensure they are covered by the VCF program. These heroes now live across the country, including in Colorado, and have sacrificed so much. After all they have done for us, our nation cannot and will not turn its back on them. 
A Call for Civility
In the United States we have our political disagreements and we should cherish the rights to express our disagreements. I previously spoke about civility and its importance moving forward at the weekly leadership press conference. My colleague Senator Bennet and I were sent to Washington to work together and while we have our disagreements, we always fight for the best for our state. I hope every colleague of mine in Congress will do the same.

Visiting the Front Range
I recently had the opportunity to meet with both business and community leaders. As poverty and homelessness continue to effect the lives of Coloradans, working together as a community and finding innovative solutions is crucial. The Jefferson County Prosperity Project does just that by working to end the cycle of poverty. I appreciated the opportunity to visit the JeffCo-Arvada Head Start location where I spoke with teachers and parents about the partnership with the school and the project.
￼
While traveling the Front Range from Evans to Johnstown, I had the opportunity to meet with Sunrise Community Health while visiting the Monfort Family Clinic, as well as Slager Trucking Company. I also had the chance to meet with the CEO of Slager Trucking, Donald Slager.

Defense Entrepreneurs Forum Annual Conference
Recently, innovation in the defense community was showcased in Denver as part of the Defense Entrepreneurs Forum Annual Conference. I had the privilege of speaking at the National Pitch Competition about the importance of making innovative strides in defense. Congratulations to Rebecca Fair, the co-founder and CEO of Thresher, and this year’s winner of the pitch competition.

Good morning folks - 
You sent me to Congress with a specific mission: cut wasteful spending and make Washington squeal.  
I take seriously the responsibility you have entrusted in me to make Washington more competent and less wasteful. 
As Tax Day approaches, and Iowans are forced to turn over more of their hard-earned dollars to Uncle Sam, I am taking a close look as to how efficiently our government is actually operating.
Every month, I will be researching and identifying areas of waste, abuse and inefficiencies. Then, once a month, I will give out the Squeal Award, which recognizes a Washington expense, program or concept that has proven to be wasteful and must be cut.

Squeal Award: Duplicative and Unaccountable Spending on Geospatial Data
Have you ever thought, how does the “maps” application on my smartphone work? Well, in part, it’s due to the use of geospatial data, or information associated with a specific location.
Geospatial data purchased by our government supports Iowa’s agriculture industry.  Without quality and accurate data, Iowa farmers and growers can’t map and project their crop output or fluctuations in temperature and precipitation. 
The federal government is one of the world’s largest purchasers of geospatial data. But unfortunately there is little-to-no coordination between our federal agencies on geospatial data purchasing.  This often leads to agencies buying multiple sets of the same data or maps, which wastes billions of your hard-earned dollars. 
For this reason, I’m presenting this month’s Squeal Award to federal agencies’ duplicative and unaccountable spending on geospatial data. 
We must hold our federal agencies accountable.  That’s why I’ve cosponsored the Geospatial Data Act (GDA), bipartisan legislation that will create congressional oversight of federal agencies to reduce wasteful and unnecessary spending on geospatial data. 
The GDA increases transparency and accountability across federal agencies.  This will in turn save taxpayer money, while improving the technological capabilities of the data. 
The GDA was included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act of 2018 which was signed into law by President Trump on October 5, 2018. 
It’s imperative for our agriculture community and for taxpayers across the country that we get geospatial data purchasing right.  And with the GDA in place, we should see more responsibility and better quality data from our federal agencies. 
￼ 

Do you have an example of government waste or inefficiencies that I should take a look at? Send me an email by clicking here. 
Thank you!

Wicker Points to the Lasting Impact of Tax Reform, Defense Bills
With Landmark Laws, Congress Delivers Results 
Just a few days ago, President Trump signed the “America’s Water Infrastructure Act,” adding it to the growing list of laws enacted by this Congress.  The legislation continues Congress’s practice of passing a major water infrastructure package every two years.  It also demonstrates a commitment by lawmakers and the President to ensure Americans have water infrastructure to compete in trade, along with flood protection, safe drinking water, and wastewater systems. 
Producing laws that strengthen our national security and benefit American workers has been the hallmark of the Republican-led 115th Congress.  Month after month, good ideas have turned into good policies that have gone on to win bipartisan support.  The outcome is an impressive record of legislative victories, with still more time left for Congress to take action. 
Tax Reform’s Ripple Effect
A particularly historic moment happened late last year, when Congress passed the first major overhaul of our tax code in more than 30 years.  At the center of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” is the basic idea that by making our economy more competitive around the globe, we can allow Americans to keep more of what they earn. 
Since the law’s enactment, an overwhelming majority of American workers have seen higher take-home pay.  What’s more, the benefits of tax reform are multiplying.  Energy costs have been reduced, manufacturing has increased, and businesses are giving back even more to their communities.  The tax reform package also put a long-awaited end to Obamacare’s unpopular individual mandate, which forced Americans to buy costly health insurance with fewer options.
Policy Wins for Our Troops
Equally significant is this Congress’s determination to reverse past defense cuts, which have hurt military strength.  As our troops’ resources have waned – reducing training and leaving maintenance needs unmet – potential adversaries like China and Russia have increased their efforts to gain a military advantage in critical parts of the world.
Congress is now aggressively addressing these gaps with policies that prioritize the rebuilding of our military and a reigniting of the defense industrial base around the country.  Those policies include a two-year budget agreement that significantly increased budget caps on defense funding.  Lawmakers followed up on the two-year agreement by passing timely defense authorization and appropriations bills to fund the military and set policy for the Pentagon. 
Our efforts have led to substantial gains in readiness – more training time, more exercises, and reduced maintenance backlogs – and modernization through new equipment.  Congress has given the Pentagon the resources and stability it needs to begin executing the priority missions identified in the new National Security Strategy set forth by Defense Secretary James Mattis. 
I am especially pleased that my bipartisan “SHIPS Act,” enacted in last year’s defense authorization bill, has played an instrumental role in accelerating the buildup of our naval fleet.  We are actively working toward the 355-ship fleet that our military commanders need.
A Commitment to Results 
These two major policy highlights will benefit our economy and national security for many years to come.  This Congress has also achieved many other policy victories that will help improve the lives of Americans.  Congress has enacted laws to fight our country’s opioid crisis, improve our veterans’ health-care options, and remove the regulations that stifle growth.  Lawmakers have taken action to support our communities suffering from hurricane devastation, and we are adding tough sanctions on bad actors like Iran, Russia, and North Korea. 
The list goes on, and I am confident it will continue to grow as the 115th Congress finishes its term this year.  There is no time to waste, and the momentum is strong for results.

October 28, 2018
Greetings,
This week I addressed members of the National Safety Council at their 2018 NSC Congress and Expo, where I shared my family’s experience with losing my sister to an opioid-related overdose. The scourge of opioid addiction continues to affect countless families across our great nation, and I am proud of Congress’ decision to take action to protect our communities. I was glad to see President Trump sign into law the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. This was a crucial piece of legislation I supported in Congress, and it will provide federal funding to states to help with their initiatives to combat drug addition, put into place stricter laws to prevent shipments containing fentanyl from entering our country, and allow federal funding for research on new non-addictive treatments for patients.
Texas’ energy community has helped lead the United Sates in emerging on the global stage as the number one crude oil producer, so I was honored to deliver remarks at the Texas Oil and Gas Association’s Lone Star Energy Forum to commend the industry on the role it has played in this success. A robust energy sector provides good-paying jobs to thousands of Texans, and has strengthened our state and our country. 
Charter schools have brought innovation and excellence to communities across the state of Texas. I was glad to have the opportunity to address the Texas Charter Schools Conference on Friday to express my gratitude for the educational services and opportunities Texas charter schools provide to our communities. I also highlighted my Student Opportunity Amendment, which has expanded 529 savings plans to include K-12 elementary and secondary school tuition for public, private, and religious schools, providing more power and choices for parents and grandparents across Texas.
This past summer, Cameron and Hidalgo Counties experienced devastating flooding which displaced many Texans from their homes and businesses. I joined Senator John Cornyn, Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, Rep. Henry Cuellar, and Rep. Filemon Vela in sending a letter to FEMA’s Administrator Long urging FEMA to reconsider its assessments of the flood and storm damage to Cameron and Hidalgo Counties. It is critical that Administrator Long and FEMA reevaluate the damage assessments for Cameron and Hidalgo Counties to ensure all the Texans in those areas receive the federal aid they need to rebuild their communities.
Our prayers continue to be with those Americans recovering in Central Texas, and from Hurricanes Matthew and Florence. These devastating natural disasters are a stark reminder of the importance of taking all steps necessary to prepare our homes and families for any future weather event. For those seeking preparedness information and resources, please refer to the federal and state resources listed here.

All-of-the-Above Energy 
￼
I attended the ribbon cutting for the Adams-Nielson Solar Farm in Lind. This facility will be the largest solar power plant in the state - estimated to power roughly 4,000 homes annually - and is a critical addition to Central Washington's role in serving as a great example of an ""all-of-the-above"" energy strategy. Clean energy sources, such as solar, hydropower, wind, and nuclear, provide a new opportunity to address economic needs in underserved, rural communities by diversifying the economy and creating new opportunities for jobs and economic growth. In Congress, I will continue to support efforts to improve the security and productivity of these clean, alternative energy resources.  
Certainty for Our River System 
￼ 
A Presidential Memorandum was released that moves up the schedule for the new court-mandated Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) Biological Opinion from 2021 to 2020. I have been working very hard to ensure the Columbia and Snake River dams continue to provide clean, affordable energy to the Pacific Northwest. When a federal judge overturned the current Biological Opinion, my colleagues and I passed legislation in the House to safeguard this unprecedented collaboration. The Senate has failed to act on this legislation. Moving up this deadline is a procedural win that will give more certainty to the communities who livelihoods depend on effective operations of our dams. Read more here. 
Economic Success in Yakima County 
￼ 
The Selah Chamber of Commerce invited me to speak at their general membership luncheon. I gave an update on the work I am doing to advance Central Washington's priorities and had the opportunity to hear from local business owners. We discussed job creation and economic success in Yakima County, increased access to education, and the status of federal water projects that are critical to our region.  
In Case You Missed It: Yakima County isn't the only one in Central Washington that is seeing economic success and job growth. Unemployment in Tri-Cities dropped to 4.1% in September - the lowest level since the current records began in 1990. This is excellent news for local communities! Read more in the Tri-City Herald. 
Special Care Clinic for Veterans 
￼ 
The Walla Walla VA Medical Center recently established a new Special Care Clinic, where veterans can receive optometry, audiology, and dental services. Our veterans deserve access to high quality health care that meets their specific needs. I had the opportunity to tour the new facility and learn how the Walla Walla VA is responding to the needs of veterans in Central and Eastern Washington beyond primary care and hospital services. I supported several measures in an attempt to improve services at VA medical clinics, and I will continue to act as an ally to our nation's veterans. 
Access to Local Food 
￼
I had the opportunity to visit Wray's Marketfresh IGA, tour the different departments of the store, speak with employees, and learn how they ensure access to fresh, local food. Wray's has been in business for more than six decades and has four locations in Yakima and Selah. We are fortunate to be surrounded by a diverse agriculture industry, and locally-owned grocery stores help ensure individuals and families are able to provide nutritious meals for their loved ones.  
Supporting the Fire Service 
￼ 
I was honored to address the Washington Fire Commissioner Association's 70th Annual State Convention in Yakima. Fire is, unfortunately, a disaster we are familiar with in Central Washington, but we are lucky to have dedicated firefighters who put their lives on the line to protect our communities across the state. This Congress, I have worked to improve the ways we respond to catastrophic wildfires, as well as support local firefighters in our communities. Earlier this year, the President signed legislation I supported which reauthorized a number of vital programs and grants to help address hiring, equipment, training, and other firefighters' and emergency responders' needs. I am proud to be a friend of the fire service, and I will continue to support these heroes as they work to keep us safe.
Social Security COLA Increase 
￼
The Social Security Administration recently announced a 2.8% Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) for more than 67 million Americans - the largest increase in 7 years. This increase, which will take place at the end of 2018, is great news for seniors and beneficiaries in Central Washington. I will continue to work to protect social security and ensure that my constituents receive the benefits they have earned. Read more about the COLA here. 
Thank you for reading this e-news update. It is an honor and a privilege to represent you in Congress. 
Sincerely, ￼  Dan Newhouse Member of Congress

￼
  
Over the past few weeks, I have driven around the district visiting with small business owners, speaking with local law enforcement and hearing from constituents. I kicked off the month of October at the Arizona Manufacturing Summit discussing our booming economy and the significant growth in Arizona's manufacturing sector. This past week, I visited at Eagle Motorcycle with Joe and Michelle Kuenen in Bullhead City. Earlier this month, I met with Tonto Forest Fuels Team and discussed the work they are doing to keep our forest healthy. In addition, I had the privilege of recognizing Detective Matt Hepperle for his top notch Detective skills and amazing team work with the Prescott Valley Police Department. For more updates follow me on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

Town Hall In Bullhead City 
We had a great turnout for our town hall in Bullhead City this week. We discussed how Republican pro-growth policies are working to rebuild our Main Streets and put more money back in the pockets of Arizonans.I appreciate everyone who took time to ask questions and share their comments and concerns. If you were not able to attend or ask your question you can always email me for more information HERE.   You can read more HERE.

Stopping the Invasion
As the number of migrants grows by the thousands it's becoming even more imperative that we secure our border at all cost. Since open border Democrats refuse to work with Republicans to build the wall, it's up to our military to protect our border from the most recent invasion. This week, I joined my colleagues in introducing legislation that will provide a pathway to build the wall. This is one of the many efforts I have supported in order to secure our border.

Economy Growing Faster Than Expected
Under Republican leadership our economy is booming. In the latest report, our economy grew at a 3.5 percent pace in the third quarter, which was faster than economists expected. Republicans passed the biggest gross tax cuts and reform in American history, resulting in 6+ million Americans now enjoying new bonuses, better jobs, and bigger paychecks. Arizona has demonstrated strong economic growth during the past year, with steady income and wage gains. Household median income in Arizona has grown substantially, increasing over 7 percent between 2016 and 2017, to $61,125. The unemployment rate in Arizona has fallen to a new post-recession low of 4.6 percent. The last thing we need to do right now is to move our economy backwards.

Fitzpatrick Opioid Legislation Signed into Law
￼ 
Every day we continue to be reminded of the horrific toll that the opioid epidemic is taking on our communities. As your representative, I have worked tirelessly as the co-chair of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force to combat this scourge. While there is still much work to be done, I am proud that the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act [H.R.6] was just signed into law.  
This bipartisan bill will help in our overall efforts to combat the opioid crisis by advancing treatment and recovery initiatives, improving prevention, protecting our communities, and bolstering our efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl. The legislation signed into law included my CONNECTIONS Act and REACH Out Act.
Learn more about this new law HERE.  
  
Holding Them Accountable
￼ 
This week at Bucks County Community College, our PFAS Task Force met with senior member of the U.S. Department of Defense, Environmental Protection Agency, and the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee to hold the federal government accountable to remediate PFAS contamination in our area. 
The EPA and Department of Defense must step up and act to remediate PFOS/PFOA contamination in our community. That includes the establishment of a PFOS/PFOA maximum contaminant level, covering the cost of water bills resulting from contaminated private wells and ensuring those who want health screenings receive them.
We’ve made progress on forcing the Defense Department to conduct a health effects study related to PFOS/PFOA exposure and to find safe alternatives to firefighting foams that do not include these contaminants. There is still much more work to be done. 
  
Slay Sarcoma
￼ 
 
We continued the courageous fight started by Dr. Amy Reed during Slay Sarcoma Research Initiative's annual 5k run/walk to find a cure for leiomyosarcoma. Amy Reed, a recognized physician, exemplary mother and wife, and dedicated patient-advocate, lost her battle to sarcoma last year. 
As a medical device safety champion, Dr. Reed and her husband brought aware to unsafe medical devices like power morcellators. Together we introduced legislation, the Medical Device Guardians Act [H.R.2163] and Medical Device Safety Act [H.R.2164]. We must continue to raise awareness of faulty or harmful medical devices, and advance legislation that protects patients and puts their interests first.

Walker Weekly Report
Shabbat is one of the most sacred practices of Judaism. It’s a time to celebrate faith and family. I am absolutely heartbroken that a deranged bigot would use this time to terrorize people for their faith. Violence targeted by religion or politics is abhorrent.
North Carolina stands with the city of Pittsburgh, our Jewish brothers and sisters, and the families and law enforcement officers who have been attacked.
This week we saw other acts of hate as a madman sent bomb packages to the Clintons, the Obamas, CNN, and prominent Democrats.
Violent threats and attacks have no place and do not represent the temperament and compassion shown by most Americans. No person should be threatened, harmed or fear for their family. They should not face violent attacks, bomb threats or shootings. The fabric of our discourse should always be civility.
All of us need to take responsibility, watch our tone, and remember that our fellow man is not our enemy.
Keep reading for the full update. Have a blessed week.
Sincerely, ￼ Mark Walker

HIGHLIGHTS

President Trump Signs Landmark Legislation Into Law to Combat the Opioid Crisis
On Wednesday, President Trump signed the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act into law – our landmark bipartisan legislation to combat the opioid crisis. While our work is not done, this largest congressional effort against a single drug crisis in history will help us overcome the opioid epidemic and bring hope to struggling communities.
Far too often, as I visit with communities across North Carolina, I hear heart-wrenching stories of towns plagued with addiction, families torn by drug dependence and remembrances of loved ones lost to overdoses. It’s time to turn these tragic tales into stories of triumph and opportunity. Together, through expanding access to proven treatments, a tough hand stopping the flow of drugs and a compassionate approach to ensure families aren’t fighting this alone, we can end the opioid crisis.

Hurricane Florence Federal Disaster Declaration Amended to Include Alamance, Chatham, Guilford, Person and Randolph Counties
Over the last two weeks, he Major Disaster Declaration for the State of North Carolina that was granted by President Donald J. Trump on September 14, 2018, was amended to include assistance for Alamance, Chatham, Guilford, Person and Randolph Counties. This declaration triggers the release of federal funds to help people and communities recover from Hurricane Florence.
The federal preparation and response, as well as the coordination with state and local officials, in the wake of Hurricane Florence was exceptional. I thank FEMA Administrator Long, a North Carolina native, and the FEMA team for their extensive efforts and assistance. Our office stands ready to serve every farmer, business owner, family and resident of North Carolina in every way possible.

Hosting a Townhall at Glen Raven in Alamance County
I was thrilled to host a town hall in Alamance County this week with the wonderful workers of Glen Raven. Because of our office’s efforts, President Trump signed the MTB Act into law, freeing up $71 million for North Carolina manufacturers like Glen Raven to reinvest in our community and our people.
Unnecessary and harmful taxes on materials our manufacturers need for production, but can’t find in the United States, has plagued the growth of our builders and job-creators. No more! With the reformed MTB process, our manufacturers can keep growing, hiring, and building great North Carolina-made products.

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend,

The horrific and hate-fueled attack at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pennsylvania yesterday is heartbreaking. We are a country founded on the ideals of freedom of religion. Anti-Semitism and bigotry of any kind are not welcome. We are praying for the victims and the Jewish community.

As we continue Hurricane Michael recovery efforts, please keep our law enforcement, first responders, military, and linemen in your prayers. This week, we lost three brave linemen in a tragic accident as they were working tirelessly to restore power to those in need. Local lineman, James Ussery, was from Chipley and worked for West Florida Electric. George Cecil and Ryan Barrett were both from North Carolina and worked for Lee Electric Construction Inc. Please use caution and take note of recovery workers when traveling in hurricane affected areas.

Recovering from the devastation left by Hurricane Michael will take time and resources from all levels of government. I have set up a page on my website dedicated to Hurricane Michael recovery resources that includes both federal and local aid available to Florida.
Click here to learn more. 

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is beginning to provide  Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to those in 12 counties affected by Hurricane Michael. Households that qualify can receive one month of benefits to meet their food needs. 
Click here to learn more. 

If you are having an issue with a federal agency please do not hesitate to reach out to my office. Due to damage from Hurricane Michael, the physical location of my Panama City office is temporarily closed. The phones are still being answered and staff can be reached at my Tallahassee and DC offices.

￼ 

On Thursday, Vice President Pence visited the Second District with Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson, White House Adviser Kellyanne Conway, and Governor Rick Scott. Thank you to Vice President Mike Pence for visiting the Second District and supporting our recovery from Hurricane Michael. It’s great to know we have the support of President Trump and VP Pence in the timely rebuilding of Tyndall. Vice President Pence came to town with a clear message from President Trump, ""we will rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base."" Rebuilding after this disaster will take time, but Northwest Florida is resilient and not even Hurricane Michael can keep us down.

￼ 

Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy joined me this week to survey damage from Hurricane Michael and hear from local leaders about recovery efforts. We spent time with Lynn Haven Mayor Margo Anderson and Panama City Mayor Greg Brudnicki, before receiving a briefing and tour of Tyndall Air Force Base. At Tyndall, we discussed how a rebuild should be focused on the current and future needs of the Air Force in the area. As we work to pick up the pieces and rebuild our communities, we must work together. I thank Leader McCarthy for his support during this process and I am confident the Panhandle will flourish.
Click here to learn more.
￼   Department of Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta also joined me this week to meet with businesses in the Panhandle and discuss how we can work together to support our job creators in areas devastated by Hurricane Michael.   ￼   Over the last two weeks, I have visited and met with law enforcement and emergency management in all counties affected by Hurricane Michael. This week, I met with officials in Leon and Wakulla counties. I also heard from the Florida Division of Emergency Management and the American Red Cross.   ￼   Thank you for your continued energy and enthusiasm, as reflected in your letters and Facebook posts. If you haven’t already, LIKE my Facebook page. You can also follow me on Twitter @DrNealDunnFL2. 
Thank you for the opportunity to serve you in Congress!

Home     Serving You     Contact     District     Legislation     Newsroom     About Bob 
Friends,
Our hearts go out to all of those affected by this weekend's horrific shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. I condemn all acts of violence, and Anti-Semitism has no place in our nation or in the world. We also send our prayers to the members of law enforcement who were wounded after rushing in to neutralize the shooter. God bless them all. 
While I’ve been traveling around the district, I did make a stop in Washington to join President Trump and a few of my Congressional colleagues at the White House as the President signed my legislation to combat the opioid crisis, the INFO Act, into law as part of H.R. 6. 
H.R. 6, the bipartisan SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, is the most significant legislative effort to address a single drug epidemic in U.S. history. It tackles the opioid epidemic from every angle – interdiction, treatment, prevention, and more. 
The INFO Act will help our communities access the information and resources they need to combat the epidemic on the ground. I’ve worked tirelessly with my colleagues to get this bill to the President’s desk so that we will be able to implement a comprehensive approach to solving the opioid crisis. 
￼
Latta joins Congressional colleagues as President Trump signs H.R. 6 into law
An update on recent happenings:
 In Congress
Recent Attempted Attacks on Elected Officials
We’ve seen a rash of attempted attacks on public figures and elected officials recently, including bombs sent to President Obama, the Clintons, Vice President Biden and others. This comes a few weeks after Senator Susan Collins had a letter sent to her house that claimed to contain ricin and an office of Senator Ted Cruz also received a threatening letter. 
There is no room for violence in our country’s political debate, and whoever took these actions should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. The uptick in threats on public officials, extreme rhetoric, and actual violence is deeply concerning and needs to change. I commend the Secret Service and law enforcement for their quick action in these cases. 
I echo the comments of my friend and colleague Congressman Steve Scalise, a victim of political violence, in condemning these acts and urging that terror has not place in our society.
 Latta, McNerney Launch Bipartisan Wi-Fi Caucus
Wi-Fi plays an integral role in our telecommunication infrastructure, positively affecting our economy, American businesses, consumers, and way of life. Wi-Fi is the primary technology for internet access, delivering more than half of all internet traffic and over sixty percent of mobile network traffic offload.
Rep. Jerry McNerney (D-CA) and I launched the bipartisan Congressional Wi-Fi Caucus to provide a much-needed forum for Members of Congress and staff to learn about Wi-Fi-related issues affecting their constituents. 
Discussing the challenges and opportunities when it comes to Wi-FI will help us develop the appropriate policy solutions, so the United States can continue leading when it comes to innovation and technology.
 Ensuring Ohio is an Innovation Leader
The Transportation Research Center (TRC) in East Liberty is a world-class facility and will soon  be one of the world’s largest testing facilities for autonomous vehicles. Despite these facts, TRC was inexplicabiliy left off of a list of 10 “proving ground pilot sites” compiled in the final hours of the Obama Administration. This threatened the Ohio’s facility to access resources or opportunities when it came to transportation innovation. I want Ohio to lead the way when it comes to new technology and the jobs that come along with it. I raised concerns about TRC being wrongly left off of this designation.
However, we’ve received some good news. The Department of Transportation (DOT) announced that TRC will now be on equal footing with other Autonomous Vehicle testing sites. Limiting the TRC’s ability to access Federal resources or support made no sense, and I applaud the DOT for making the right decision to put the facility on equal ground with other sites when making competitive bids.
 
Around the District 
First Responder Safety Event
I hosted first responders from around our district at an event in Lourdes University in Sylvania to discuss safety when encountering fentanyl and other narcotics. While deaths from overdoses caused by heroin or prescription drugs are leveling out, the number of deaths due to synthetic opioids like fentanyl continue to rise.
First responders have asked for a protocol on what to do when encountering fentanyl, so I asked experts at the state and Federal level for the best information to help them do their jobs in the safest way possible.
I’m hopeful that knowledge gleaned from the discussion will aid our first responders as they protect our communities.
 Touring the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge; Discussing the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative  The Great Lakes are the crown jewel of our region, and it’s essential we protect them. I appreciated the opportunity  to tour Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge recently and view a number of Great Lake Restoration Initiative (GLRI) projects and see how they are improving the overall health of Lake Erie.  The GLRI funds projects that protect and restore the Great Lakes, the largest system of fresh surface water in the world. I've been a staunch supporter of the GLRI program.  In addition, we discussed the recent passage of the America’s Water Infrastructure Act which includes provisions to protect Lake Erie from invasive species like Asian Carp and authorizes a coastal resilience study to protect the coastline of the Great Lakes.  We’re blessed to have the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge right in our backyard, and I encourage everyone to take the time to visit the refuge and view the resident wildlife. Thank you to Jason Lewis, ONWR Refuge Manager, for showing me around and for the conservation work that members of U.S. Fish and Wildlife do every day.   Four County Career Center 50th Anniversary Celebration
Four County Career Center has continuously played an important role in our region by providing career and technical education for students in Fulton, Henry, Defiance, and Williams Counties. I recently participated in the 50th anniversary celebration of Four County Career Center where I presented a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol Building to Superintendent Tim Meister. 
The ceremony also included the induction of six former students into the “Wall of Fame” and a distinguished service award for former superintendent William Spiess.
Career and Technical Education has never been more important, and schools like Four County should be the model for how to prepare young people for the workforce. I commend the teachers, administrators, and students for all of their efforts. Congratulations to Four County Career Center on 50 years of success.
 Latta Speaks at Van Wert and Napoleon Rotaries
I recently spoke at lunches held by the Van Wert and Napoleon Rotaries where I was able to give an update on what is happening in Washington. It’s impossible to speak about the country right now without speaking about the booming economy which has meant unemployment is at a 49-year low and at a 65-year low for women. 
I also talked about important work being done on the opioid crisis, career and technical education, and cutting taxes. After speaking, I took a number of questions from the audience at both events. I always appreciate being with our service organizations. Thank you to both Rotaries for allowing me to come speak!
 Bard Manufacturing Tour
Our colleges and universities play a major role in workforce development, and it’s important to foster relationships between institutes of higher learning and the private sector. In Bryan, I recently joined college administrators on a tour of Bard Manufacturing’s facility and the new James R. Bard Innovation Center.
Bard is a family owned business that engineers and manufactures precision climate control equipment for the classroom, telecommunications, equipment cooling, and commercial building markets. The new innovation center will help Northwest Ohio become a hub for engineering and innovation.  
 Ohioans Benefiting from Economy On The Rise
After continued growth, the number of jobs in the state stands at 5,638,900, which surpasses the record set back in 2000. After this record jobs peak in 2000, the Buckeye State suffered from the loss of jobs for years and was particularly devastated by the recession. However, pro-growth policies implemented by a Republican Congress and the President have meant a resurgence in Ohio.
While the entire country is seeing better economic days, Ohio has been toward the tops in terms of job creation. For instance, Ohio is ranked 6th in the country and 1st in the Midwest in terms of job growth this year. 
For Northwest and West Central Ohio, manufacturing gains are helping our local economy, getting people back to work, and increasing wages due to greater demand for workers. We don’t want to go backwards on this progress, and it’s important we continue to put in place policies that allow Ohio businesses to grow and expand.

50th Anniversary celebration
 Visiting Local Career Centers 
Career and technical education has been a policy focus of late with job openings outnumbering the amount of people looking for work for the first time in U.S. history. The booming economy has meant more opportunity for students coming out of high school with a skill or technical training. Congress recently passed legislation I support, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, to improve CTE programs and improve coordination between career centers and local Businesses.
This legislation will support efforts for local CTE programs to partner with area businesses, improve accountability, and provide more dedicated resources for job training in rural areas. 
I visited four career centers in the past two weeks: Four County Career Center in Henry County, Millstream Career Center in Findlay, Penta Career Center in Wood County, and Vantage Career Center in Van Wert. It’s amazing what these students are doing, and many of them are obtaining their certifications right out of high school and finding employment right away.  On a side note, they even let me back up an 18-wheeler on my tour of Vantage. Click here to see video of that. (Let the record show that I did not hit a cone.) 
Hats off to the staff, administrators, and students at our region’s career centers. We’re blessed to have these resources in Northwest and West Central Ohio. 
 
Latta Clean Drinking Water Provisions Signed Into Law 
Fixing and upgrading their water infrastructure is a significant issue that many Ohio communities face. The President recently signed America’s Water Infrastructure Act into law which will upgrade our nation’s waterways, aid the flow of goods, and deliver resources for needed water infrastructure projects. I worked to make sure that clean water infrastructure provisions were included in the bill, including efforts to help disadvantaged communities modernize their water systems.
The provisions remove duplicative Federal requirements and provide more flexibility to repay Federal loans so that state and local governments can better meet their water infrastructure needs without burdening ratepayers with sky-high costs.
These provisions will better ensure that Ohio communities are able to undertake projects that can ensure clean, reliable drinking water for their citizens.

News from Representative Bradley Byrne

ABOUT BRADLEY | HOW CAN I HELP | CONTACT BRADLEY | WANT TO RECEIVE MY UPDATES?
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
I’ve had quite the week meeting with folks here in Southwest Alabama, listening to you about the issues that matter most to you, and learning more from the farmers and foresters in our region.  
Listening to you is my top priority as your representative in the People’s House. With the feedback I receive, I can better set my legislative agenda in Washington to get the results you deserve from Congress. 
I want to let you know about another opportunity you have to come out and express your opinion about what is going on in Alabama and the nation before I head back to Washington for the end-of-year legislative session.  
This Monday, I will be holding a Town Hall meeting in Bayou La Batre at the Bayou La Batre City Hall at 11:00 AM. For more details, visit Byrne.House.Gov/TownHalls, and follow me on Facebook and Twitter! 
Build the Wall 
As each day passes, the security of our border becomes more and more imperative. 
The caravan of immigrants marches steadily on towards our southern border, and we must take action to keep our nation safe. This is a matter of sovereignty and security, and a mass of thousands marching on our country cannot be ignored. 
I fully support the President’s action to send troops to our border to aid the local law enforcement and Border Patrol agents already there. There are ways to come into our country legally, but this is not it. 
I have proposed legislation just this past week, along with eighteen of my colleagues in the House of Representatives, to bypass Democrat obstruction in the Senate and provide the necessary funding for a wall at the border. This bill is called the 50 Votes for the Wall Act, and I explain it fully in this op-ed for the Hill. 
Border security is national security, and we must treat it as such. 
Ag Matters! 
￼ 
This week, I had the great opportunity to meet with some of the farmers, foresters, and producers here in Southwest Alabama to learn more about what they do every day and the problems they face. This was part of my fourth annual Ag Matters tour.
On Tuesday, I had the pleasure to meet with folks at the Canfor Southern Pine lumber mill in Jackson. Not only are they the largest employer in Jackson, but they produce high-quality lumber products to states throughout the South. Forestry in Alabama started in Clarke County, and the fine men and women at Canfor continue that tradition to this day through their products and services.
During the Ag Matters tour, I visited private timberlands and held a forestry roundtable to learn more about foresters’ sustainable harvesting practices in Southwest Alabama. They are working with the Fish and Wildlife Service to find ways to both protect threatened and endangered species such as the gopher tortoise and the black pine snake while also continuing to harvest lumber to help build our future in Alabama. 
Ensuring that our environment is protected is extremely important, but we cannot unduly limit our producers to an economic disadvantage. Working together with producers and wildlife managers, we can come to a commonsense solution to this complicated issue. 
Also during my tour, I toured several farms producing peanuts and cotton that are shipped all around the world. Just this past year, I fought to get cotton back in Title I of the Disaster Package to provide greater protections for our farmers who are impacted by unexpected natural disasters. 
All told, our 2018 Ag Matters tour stopped in Tanner Williams, Chatom, Jackson, Monroeville, Huxford, and Fairhope. Our farmers are our future, and I will continue to work for greater protections for them so they can sustainably work into the future for a stronger Alabama and a stronger America. 
Town Halls Recap 
 ￼ 
Every opportunity I have to talk with the people of Southwest Alabama is an opportunity for me to learn how to better serve you. 
This past week, I held two Town Hall Meetings, one in Lillian on Monday and one in Saraland this past Thursday.  
I heard some great feedback on the issues that matter most to the people I represent in Washington. 
Educational opportunities for a more ready workforce, better infrastructure, stronger immigration policy, and a prepared military are all issues that matter to you and issues that I am fighting for in Congress. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of this email, I will be holding one more Town Hall this Monday, October 29th, at 11:00 AM at the Bayou La Batre Town Hall. For more information, visit Byrne.House.Gov/TownHalls.

After a long day on my “Ag Matters” Tour, Rebecca and I enjoyed having MacGuire with us for the South Alabama-Troy game Tuesday night. There was a great turnout for the Battle for the Belt! 
What’s Ahead   
October is nearly over and the end of the year is in sight! Before we get into the swing of the Thanksgiving and Christmas seasons, I continue to meet with folks like yourself here in Alabama to set my agenda for our final legislative session of this year.
Again, there is one more opportunity to let me know what issues matter to you this Monday at 11:00 am at the Bayou La Batre City Hall. Hope to see you there! 
Next week, I will be visiting the University of South Alabama’s Children and Women’s Hospital to learn more about the amazing breakthroughs and compassionate care available to people in our area. 
Additionally, I will be meeting with the North Baldwin County Chamber of Commerce’s Business at Breakfast meeting to provide an update on the work we have done here in Washington to bring more jobs and funds back to Main Street, making America better off now and stronger for the future.
As always, if you need help with a federal agency or have questions about anything under debate in Washington, please contact my office. You can call my Mobile office at 251-690-2811 or you can click here to send me an email directly. I also invite you to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to get up-to-the-minute updates on my travel in Southwest Alabama. At the end of the day, my staff and I are here to serve you!

ISSUES AND LEGISLATION 
October 28, 2018 
H.R. 6 Signed Into Law:
On Wednesday, President Trump signed H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, into law. This bipartisan package of legislation is aimed at combatting the opioid and drug addiction crisis that is gripping our country. My bill H.R. 3331, the Improving Access to Behavioral Health Information Technology Act, was included in the bill. H.R. 3331 takes the critical step of bringing mental health and addiction treatment into the 21st century while reducing health spending and expanding access for these treatments to underserved communities, like those in rural Kansas.
 
Iola High School Visit:
I had a wonderful visit to Iola High School this week. Thank you for Guidance Counselor Melissa Stiffler and Principal Scott Crenshaw for a warm welcome and the tour where I learned about the school’s internship program. The students at Iola can enroll in an internship program where they work at local businesses to learn career skills and receive technical educations that will prepare them for a career after they graduate. I was very impressed with the students, dedicated teachers and staff who are making this program possible. Keep up the good work!
￼
 
Meeting with Topeka RESULTS:
It was great to see the fine folks from Topeka RESULTS in the district office! We discussed the investigation into maternal mortality rates launched by the Ways and Means Committee. Through this investigation, I am committed to discovering where Congress can take action prevent these deaths. I was also glad to hear their thoughts on the need to get a finalized Farm Bill passed by Congress to give our Kansas agriculture industry the tools they need to have a productive, successful year.
 
Discussion with ACT Safe, LLC:
Thank you to the CEO and COO of ACT Safe, both from Topeka, for meeting with me to discuss the difficulties small businesses face while working with the VA. I appreciated their insight on how Congress can effectively assist Certified Service Disable Veteran Owned Businesses. 
 
ICYMI: Bilateral Trade Update:
On Tuesday, the United States Trade Representative officially notified Congress in letters to the House and Senate of the Administration’s intent to enter into three different trade negotiations with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom. These announcements are welcomed developments that, following further consultation with Congress, can greatly expand new markets and unlock these massive economies to Kansas-grown and Kansas-made products. Following an agreement last month with Canada and Mexico on a new NAFTA, I am pleased the Administration has progressed to this stage to enhanceour international trading partnerships.

October 28, 2018
From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:
Good Afternoon,
This week, I had the opportunity to hear from Snyder County Farmers about a host of agricultural issues that are important to the region. Our farmers invest so much in Pennsylvania’s economy; it is important that Congress invests in them.
￼
Building on PA’s Agricultural Success
Agriculture has a long, successful history as a major contributor to Pennsylvania’s economy. Nearly 70% of Pennsylvania’s farm related revenue is generated from livestock product sales. Milk is the most important commodity, accounting for 5.5% of the nation’s supply. Though PA-10’s agricultural industry continues to grow, there is still work to be done. I will continue to advocate for legislation that both reforms programs to increase efficiencies and maintains those that meet the needs of our area. If we are to preserve America's status as a leader in global agriculture, we must find a way to responsibly and efficiently modernize our agriculture industry to ensure that consumers have access to the safest, most abundant, and most affordable food supply in the world.
What a beautiful fall day to be on the farm. Thanks for having me!
Recognizing the Work of Growmark FS
I recently had the pleasure to visit Growmark FS in Towanda and recognize them for a national accreditation in Environmental, Health, and Safety regulations.
￼
For decades, Growmark FS has been a leader in Pennsylvania’s agricultural development, offering needed services and products to farmers across the commonwealth. As I toured this facility, I learned all that they do to exceed regulatory requirements to keep their workers and the local community safe as well as partner with their grower customers to provide agronomic recommendations that ensure productivity and promote environmental stewardship. Congratulations on this fantastic achievement.
Advocating for Comprehensive Broadband Internet
I appreciated having the chance to speak in front of the Lycoming County Association about my plan to make affordable and reliable broadband access a reality for rural communities across the country. This past August, I hosted a rural broadband roundtable to hear from stakeholders and experts in the field. I learned that the biggest challenge in providing broadband access to rural America is cost and it simply does not make sense for companies to make expensive investments in broadband infrastructure that will serve a relatively small number of customers.
That is why I introduced H.R. 6871, the Rural Broadband Connectivity Act. This bill will provide a tax credit to companies that make investments in broadband infrastructure that expands access for rural customers. My legislation will unleash private capital and incentivize companies to bridge the digital divide between big cities and small-town America. More connectivity means better living standards that will provide modern teleworking, telemedicine, digital learning, and allow our agricultural producers access to innovation that will benefit them in the fields.
Supporting Our Seniors
My dedicated staff was excited to attend the 16th Annual Lackawanna & Wayne County Senior Health Fair to update our seniors with what Congress is doing to support and meet their health needs.     
￼                                             
The purpose of this event is to promote a greater standard of living for older adults in PA-10. More than 50 exhibitors offered health screenings, giveaways, and information relating to health and wellness. As a Member of Congress, it is my job to ensure our seniors have the necessary resources to continue living healthy, independent lives.
PA-10’s Fulbright Recipients Celebrated
I am excited to hear that several outstanding students from PA-10 received prestigious Fulbright Awards during the 2017-2018 academic year. For more than 70 years, the Fulbright Program has boosted U.S. economic competitiveness, advanced national security interests, and fostered peaceful relations between emerging leaders around the globe. During their time overseas, U.S. Fulbrighters will gain valuable skills and expertise that will serve them well in all endeavors. Congratulations on this impressive achievement!
Parents and students who are interested in learning more about the Fulbright Program can visit the Department of State's website here.
PA Career Link Announces New Mobile Service 
The PA CareerLink announced the new addition of a mobile career center, the Link, that provides services to Centre, Clinton, Columbia, Lycoming, Mifflin, Montour, Northumberland, Snyder and Union Counties. The Link has seven computers, internet access, printing, and a presentation screen. Additionally, professional staff support is available for job matching, career guidance, workforce training, and employer recruitment.
If you are interested in accessing the resources of the Link, you can check out the November 2018 Calendar here.

Congressman McHenry Weekly Update 


A Busy Week in the Tenth District



With the House out of session for the week, I was thrilled to spend my week back home in western North Carolina. I started my week in the Tenth District with the Small Business Investor Alliance where I was honored to be presented with their Champion of Small Business Investing Award.

     ￼

I then traveled to Spindale were I was honored to present a flag flown over the Capitol to Isothermal Community College President, Walter Dalton and to attend the Isothermal Community College flagpole dedication.

￼

Monday evening, it was good to spend time with members of the Buncombe County Farm Bureau in Fletcher. I was honored to receive a Friend of the Farm Bureau award from North Carolina Farm Bureau President, Larry Wooten. It recognizes my legislative record supporting farmers here in western North Carolina and across the state.

￼

I began Tuesday early but I enjoyed my time in studio with Mark Starling on his morning show where we discussed some of the issues important to the Tenth District.

￼

That afternoon I headed to AC Reynolds Middle in Asheville to answer some student questions and hear more about the United Way of Asheville's roll out of it's Middle School Success program in this school.

￼

My last stop on Tuesday was to see the new building on MAHEC's Campus in Asheville. This new facility will be important in the training of physicians serving Western North Carolina.

￼

Wednesday also began bright and early but it's always good to be in studio with Hal Row on WHKY to give an update about what is happening in Washington.

￼

For my next stop, I headed to Conover where I enjoyed visiting with the students and staff at the North Carolina Boys Academy. There I heard about their program that seeks to help young men understand and experience the value of goal setting, team play, community, and—ultimately—helping to set the direction to discover God’s purpose for their lives.

￼

Later that morning I met some more of the Tenth District's best and brightest when I toured St. Stephen's High School in Hickory. I was honored to present a flag flown over the Capitol to the students, teachers, and staff of St. Stephen's High School.

￼

My first meeting of the afternoon was with the Catawba Board of Realtors. I always appreciate input about the real estate industry in the Tenth District from the realtors.

￼

I ended Wednesday with a tour of PACE@Home, a program that provides individuals with skilled nursing home care in their own homes. I also enjoyed chatting with some of the program's participants. 

￼

Thursday morning, I participated in the Charlotte Chamber Summit event to discuss the role of financial services in North Carolina with my colleague Senator Tillis.

￼

I then headed to Piedmont Community Charter School in Gastonia for a tour and to stop by several classrooms to chat with students.

￼

I stayed in Gastonia so I could tour Stabilus, the world market leader for gas springs and dampers.

￼

Friday, I began my morning with a tour of the new Maiden Police Station to learn how the building helps the Maiden Police Department better serve their community.

         ￼

I ended my week in Newton with a tour of the family owned Warehouse Distillery where they not only cultivate a passion for craft spirits but hope to empower future generations of entrepreneurs.

￼

Federal Grants for the Tenth District



One of my duties as your Congressman is helping Tenth District governments access the numerous grant programs offered by the federal government. It is always an honor to present localities with these vitally important grants and this week, I had the opportunity to once again make these presentations. On Monday, I traveled to Bessemer City because the town received two grants. The first was the USDA Rural Development grant for the construction of a new public works facility and the second was a FEMA grant to the Bessemer City Fire Department. 

￼

Last Tuesday, I was at the Black Mountain Veterans Cemetery because they received a Department of Veterans Affairs grant. The grant will fund new landscaping, roadways and infrastructure to expand the cemetery and provide services for 124,000 veterans and their families.

￼

On Friday, It was an honor to head over to the Ranlo Fire Department where I got to tour the facility and attend the Ranlo Fire and Rescue SAFER Grant Check presentation. Ranlo is one of only five departments in North Carolina to have received SAFER Grant funding this year

￼

Ending the Opioid Crisis



For too long families and communities all across the country, including right here in the Tenth District, have suffered from the pain caused by the opioid crisis. This week, President Trump signed in to law a bipartisan bill that dedicates more resources to ending the cycle of addiction affecting the lives of so many here in western North Carolina. This bill takes an important step towards ending this epidemic by addressing all sides of the crisis, from addiction prevention to providing resources for law enforcement and families as they combat this addiction in their communities and in their own homes. You can read my full statement on this historic legislation here. Learn more about the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act by clicking here courtesy of the Energy and Commerce Committee.

￼

Every day, 47 people die from overdoses involving prescription opioids. Safe disposal of unused prescription drugs is just one way we can help end the opioid crisis here in the Tenth District. Yesterday, for National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, there were over 4,000 locations where you could safely drop off your unused or expired prescription drugs. If you missed Prescription Drug Take Back Day check out my website by clicking here to find out more on how you can safely dispose your unused prescriptions drugs.





What I Have Been Reading



How the alleged bomber was caught
 
CNN 

I applaud law enforcement at the federal, state, and local levels for their quick work to ensure that this criminal was captured and ensure that no one was harmed by any of the packages that were sent. Having experienced it first hand with the shooting of my dear friend Steve Scalise, I know this kind of politically-motivated violence has no place in our country. It must be condemned by all sides of the political spectrum.


A 97-year-old, an elderly wife and husband: These are the 11 victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre

USA Today 

Please join Giulia and me in keeping the families and loved ones of the victims of this awful tragedy in your prayers. I condemn this hateful and anti-Semitic attack on this peaceful community of faith. I am also so thankful for the quick actions of local law enforcement who undoubtedly saved many lives.


U.S. GDP grows above-forecast 3.5% on consumers, inventories

Bloomberg 

Once again this week we have heard more good news about our economy. In the third quarter the U.S. GDP saw higher than expected growth at 3.5%. According to Bloomberg the data indicates the robust job market and lower taxes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are to thank for this good news.

Dear Friend, 
On Thursday this past week, President Trump signed into law H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, a bipartisan law aimed at combatting the opioid crisis. This bipartisan law combines over 70 bills from the House and Senate to combat the opioid crisis and includes the following key provisions:
	•	Aims to prevent opioid overuse by increasing drug program integrity efforts and providing resources for beneficiaries to help ensure that they are properly adhering to their prescribed pain medications.
	•	Works to eliminate current Medicare payment incentives for providers to prescribe opioids instead of non-opioid pain management treatments and expands access to non-opioid alternatives and substance use disorder treatment, including in underserved and rural areas.
	•	Educates providers and beneficiaries to reduce opioid use and promotes the development and adoption of quality measures related to opioid use and opioid use disorder treatments.
	•	Requires the United States Postal Service to obtain advance electronic data on international mail shipments, which will allow U.S. Customs and Border Protection to target high-risk shipments – including those containing synthetic opioids – for inspection and seizure at the border.
I am very proud to support this legislation which will make significant strides in addressing this public health crisis.

MEETING WITH 500 FARMERS IMPACTED BY HURRICANE MICHAEL 
For the last few weeks, my staff and I have met with farmers and those living in our rural communities to see how best we can help them recover from the impacts of Hurricane Michael. 
On Monday this past week in conjunction with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), USDA-Farm Service Agency (FSA), lenders, and agribusiness leaders, we hosted a meeting with over 500 Georgia farmers to offer information on assistance programs and hear first-hand the tools they will need to recover. 
This storm has already caused a projected $3 billion impact on Georgia’s agriculture industry, and in the coming weeks I look forward to continuing to meet with farmers and take their concerns with me back to Washington to put together an aid package that helps during this difficult time. 
If you have been impacted by Hurricane Michael, I would appreciate your input on what Congress can better do to help in recovery efforts. You can send me an email through my website by clicking here, or you can call any of our offices whose numbers are listed at the bottom of this email. We are here to help.

AF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY & TRAINING CENTER OPENS IN WR 
I had the honor of attending the ribbon cutting of the new Air Force Advanced Technology and Training Center (ATTC) in Warner Robins on Wednesday.
This new center will be an innovation hub and training center for emerging sustainment technologies that will service Robins AFB and will seek to capitalize on the government and academic talent of people in the Middle Georgia region and encourage new opportunities for local high schools, community colleges and universities. State-of-the-art training will be provided and include classroom and hands-on training for handheld lasers, additive manufacturing, cold spray, design for additive manufacturing, big data analytics and corrosion protection and prediction. 
This center builds upon the great workforce development growth we’ve seen in Middle Georgia in recent years, and I look forward to seeing the region continue to prosper for the people of the Eighth District.

Meet Richard | How Can I Help You? | Issues | Media Center | Contact Me





Friends,
 
There’s nothing like a good “Aha!” moment. We all have them – whether you’re trying to remember the name of a song, solve a problem at work, or remember what was on that grocery list you left on the kitchen counter, a light bulb in your head turns on and suddenly something clicks. In fact, Merriam-Webster defines this term as a moment of sudden realization, inspiration, insight, recognition, or comprehension. 
 
Last week, America had a real “Aha!” moment when President Donald Trump signed into law a package of bipartisan bills that will change the way we address the opioid crisis and ultimately save lives. This is the most significant federal effort against a single drug crisis in history, and I was proud to be the only North Carolina Representative to join President Trump at the White House for this important moment. 
 
￼
Rep. Hudson joined President Trump for this important bill signing.
 
As a leader on the Energy and Commerce Committee, the committee responsible for addressing health issues, I’ve been involved in shaping this opioid legislation every step of the way. I’ve been working with my colleagues, the Trump Administration, local leaders, law enforcement, health care professionals and members of our community fighting addiction to find the best ideas to combat the opioid crisis. In fact, I had three bipartisan bills included in the package, and I’m humbled to see so many people work together on this issue. It’s a reminder that amid all the rancor in Washington, Republicans and Democrats can actually set aside differences for the good of the nation. 
 
The legislation President Trump signed into law focuses on all stages of the opioid crisis, including prevention, treatment and recovery. It takes steps to protect communities from illicit drugs by empowering law enforcement and leveraging federal resources at the local level. It also gives doctors tools to identify and support at-risk patients while reducing the amount of dangerous drugs available to the public.
 
For me, my “Aha!” moment in these efforts was realizing we needed to do more and find better ways to dispose of excess opioids. I spoke with a constituent who had moved several times, and with every move she would shift her old, unused prescription pills from one medicine cabinet to the next. In fact, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association, less than 10 percent of patients dispose of their excess opioids properly. 
 
By preventing unused pain medicine from falling into the wrong hands, we can save countless lives. Think about it: when pain pills go unused, they frequently sit in medicine cabinets for months or years on end. I’ve heard firsthand from local realtors about folks posing as homebuyers just to go through medicine cabinets at open houses. And the statistics back this up – some eighty percent of heroin users first misused prescription opioids. That’s why I took the lead on finding solutions to fight this crisis from the packaging and disposal angle. 
 
Everywhere I go in our district, I regularly hear horror stories about the opioid crisis – just last month alone there were 484 overdose visits to hospitals across the state. Stanly County had the highest number of these instances while Cabarrus County and Cumberland County were close behind. 
 
With this significant federal action, we’re getting more resources to our communities and more folks on the front lines. While there’s still much work to do, I’m hopeful this bipartisan legislation will go a long way towards turning the corner on this crisis.
 
 
Until next week,
￼
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)

Remembering Deputy Turner
 
 
Wrenzie and I were heartbroken to hear that Deputy Farrah Turner passed away this week and we attended her funeral service today. I prayed with her in the hospital the day after the shooting and I am lucky to have shared that special moment with her. She was a true hero and will be so missed. Please join me in lifting up prayers for her family, the officers still recovering from the shooting, and the entire Florence community.

Restoring Fiscal Responsibility
 
 
This week, President Trump made a reasonable request of his Cabinet Members. He asked that they cut the operating budgets of their respective agencies by 5%. I was heartened that President Trump took this important step towards restoring fiscal responsibility in D.C. and I asked Speaker Ryan to follow his lead and decrease each Members Representational Allowance by 5%. Each year since I've been in Congress, I've run three full time offices while still returning at least 5% of my MRA to pay down the national debt. This is a doable way to save millions of taxpayer dollars and should be part of the solution to meaningfully address our national deficit.

Lighthouse Behavioral Health 
 
 
I had the opportunity to tour Lighthouse Behavioral Health last week and learn more about the critical services they provide to people in our community. We discussed the importance of mental health services as well as the tragic opioid epidemic. I was happy to report that Congress has taken action to combat this scourge on our communities. In fact, President Trump just signed landmark legislation that will stop the flow of synthetic drugs into our country and give law enforcement and communities the resources they need to combat this epidemic. While this battle cannot be fought from Washington alone, this was an important step forward in our fight against opioid addiction.

10/28/18 14:59,Latest from Lamar: Joining President Trump at the White House as he signed into law my bill to help Tennessee fight the opioids epidemic ,"

￼ ￼ ￼ ￼
Joining President Trump at the White House as he signed into law my bill to help Tennessee fight the opioid epidemic 
￼
Watch the above video of the White House signing ceremony. 
This week, I joined President Trump at the White House as he signed into law my legislation -- which was called “landmark” by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- to help states and local communities fight the opioid crisis. This is the most important new health care law this year—it deals with the nation’s worst public health epidemic by helping to stop deadly fentanyl from coming from China to America by mail, finding new non-addictive pain killers, and providing more opportunities for treatment. During this year, Congress has appropriated $8.5 billion to implement this legislation and support communities, families, law enforcement, and medical personnel who are fighting this crisis.
 
￼
I visited the Maryville Fire Department this week to discuss the importance of this bill and how it will help Tennesseans who are on the frontlines fighting the crisis. Watch here. 
 
Here are 10 key provisions of this legislation:
1. STOP Act—to stop illegal drugs, including fentanyl, at the border
2. New non-addictive painkillers, research and fast-track
3. Blister packs for opioids, such as a 3 or 7 day supply
4. Extends support for Medicaid patients seeking treatment from 15 to 30 days, covering all substance use disorders
5. TREAT Act—permanently allows more medical professionals to treat people in recovery to prevent relapse and overdoses
6. Prevent “doctor-shopping” by improving state prescription drug monitoring programs
7. More behavioral and mental health providers
8. Support for comprehensive opioid recovery centers
9. Help for babies born in opioid withdrawal and for mothers with opioid use disorders
10. More early intervention with vulnerable children who have experienced trauma
 
Here is what some other Tennessee leaders are saying about this bill:
Governor Bill Haslam: “Opioid addiction knows no boundaries and impacts many Tennesseans regardless of race, income, gender or age. This new law is a major step in helping fight this epidemic – it will help limit the supply of opioids, help develop a non-addictive pain killer, provide resources to provide treatment for those with opioid use disorders, and much more. I feel confident that this comprehensive plan will make a difference in the lives of Tennesseans and I thank Sen. Alexander for his leadership on this tough issue.”
Maryville Police and Fire Department Chief Tony Crisp: “Police, Fire and all first responders witness almost daily the tragedy associated with the opioid crisis that not only effects our community, but all communities across America. I am encouraged by the passing of legislation that aids in the fight of ridding our country of the epidemic.”
 
Trump Administration increases flexibility to help states lower health insurance premiums
On Monday, the Trump Administration announced states will have more flexibility to help lower health insurance premiums. The Administration is doing this by giving states more freedom in the law’s 1332 State Innovation Waiver—waivers that allow states to use innovative methods to better meet the needs of consumers in their health insurance marketplaces. In four bipartisan health committee hearings I chaired last fall, virtually every witness told our committee that the waiver application is too cumbersome, inflexible, and expensive for states to use. I tried to fix this problem in Congress, but Democrats have elevated Obamacare to the 67th book of the Bible and, in March, refused to fix even a word of the law’s waiver provision. I will continue working in Congress to help undo the damage Obamacare has done while protecting patients with pre-existing conditions.









 
President Trump signs into law bill to help keep Chickamauga Lock construction on schedule

This week, President Trump signed into law the America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 -- legislation that will ensure construction of Chickamauga Lock can stay on schedule in the coming years. This new law is one way the federal government can help improve water infrastructure, which helps protect jobs in Tennessee and throughout the country by keeping commerce flowing on our nation’s rivers. It is also a victory for Tennessee’s fishermen, as it extends the Freedom to Fish Act for five more years. Generations of fishermen have been fishing below the dams on the Cumberland River, and this law ensures Tennesseans continue to have the freedom to decide for themselves when it is safe to fish rather than wasting taxpayer dollars to unnecessarily close off important fishing areas.
 
 
 
 

 
￼
 
 
 
 
I had a good conversation with David Plazas from The Tennessean. We talked about getting results for Tennesseans, the importance of civility, and my work on the landmark opioids legislation President Trump signed into law. Read more here.

Flight on Air Force One
 On Monday, I was able to ride back on Air Force One with the President to Washington, D.C. after the Cruz rally in Houston. It was a great flight as we discussed the foreign invasion approaching our southern border. I am happy to report that the President fully agrees that under no circumstances are the thousands of illegal and criminal aliens going to be allowed to step one foot across the border into Texas.

Attending the Fourth National Space Council Meeting
￼

On Tuesday, I attended the fourth National Space Council Meeting at the National Defense University at Fort McNair in Washington, DC. Vice President Mike Pence led the council in sending six recommendations to President Trump. Importantly, the Vice President recommended the creation of a United States Space Command that would control our military space operations, as well as the establishment of the Space Force as the independent sixth branch of the military that would organize, train, and equip American space forces. I applaud the work of the Administration in prioritizing space as a unique warfighting domain. It was a pleasure to visit with the Vice President, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine (pictured below), and the rest of the Space Council and attendees. As the Chairman of the Space Subcommittee in the House, I am looking forward to continuing to work with the White House as we ensure America is the preeminent spacefaring nation in the world. Exciting things are on the horizon!
￼
Meeting with Ambassador Lighthizer
This week, while I was in Washington, I met with Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. Trade Representative, to discuss how the Mexican Government continues to bully our American manufacturer, Loadmaster Universal Rigs, Inc. We had a good discussion and my hope is that the Trump Administration continues to stand up for American business in the global markets. America should not be taken advantage of by other countries, in terms of trade, business deals, or anything else. It is time we stand strong and protect the interest of our own companies first.
￼

Military Service Academy Interviews
￼

Every year, it is my distinct pleasure to nominate sharp young men and women to different military service academies. These high school seniors work hard to gain admittance into one of the four prestigious military academies in the nation. Yesterday, we had our candidate interviews by a panel of several community leaders and business owners from across TX-36. I want to thank each of the 23 applicants for getting their necessary documents turned in, working so hard, and being willing to serve their country. (Congressman Babin visiting with interview panelists below).

Honoring Henry Childs
I am proud my office could honor Korean War veteran Henry Childs on his 90th birthday as well as the 50th anniversary of his lumber business that he started out of the back of his truck half a century ago.
￼
Lanie Brown, Regional Director of Community Relations on my staff, presented Mr. Childs with a certificate of Special Congressional Recognition for his selfless service to our country and amazing accomplishment of the American Dream. The certificate was presented at the recently restored Orange Train Depot where Mr. Childs held his first job when it was still the Southern Pacific Railroad many years ago.
Visiting with Members of the Texas Hospital Association
I met with members of the Texas Hospital Association in Pasadena to discuss various issues and concerns about healthcare policy. 
￼
Veterans Breakfast
As a veteran myself and father of a decorated Navy SEAL, I have a deep appreciation for the brave men and women who defend America and the many freedoms we all enjoy. I am also proud to represent the more than 50,000 veterans who call the 36th Congressional District of Texas home.
￼
I was able to attend the Veterans Breakfast that was held at the San Jacinto Church in Deer Park on Thursday. I am fighting every day in Congress for America’s veterans and their families. They deserve the utmost respect and gratitude for their service and sacrifice to our country. I have actively supported the passage of several bills to improve the care of our nation’s veterans — including bills to streamline the appeals process, hold VA bureaucrats accountable, end the abuse of wait lists, prioritize veterans hiring and provide a cost-of-living increase for disabled veterans. 
￼
I can assure you that protecting those who have protected us is a priority for me and will be a cause I continue to fight for. Thanks to all who attended this fantastic event! 
Conrad Shipyard

Conrad Shipyard in Orange has built North America's first LNG bunker barge. I was able to tour the shipbuilding facility this week and am both impressed and extremely proud that such an awesome product was constructed in my Congressional District. Keep up the great work!

Common Sense Gun Reform
Recently, I participated in a joint project between Time Magazine and award-winning artist JR to provide a thorough look at firearms in America.
This project highlights the perspectives of 245 Americans with various backgrounds, including advocates, first responders, and lawmakers, on the topics of gun violence, individual rights, safety, and policy. As a part of the project, I highlighted my continuing efforts to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists, and the dangerously mentally ill by expanding firearm background checks to cover all commercial sales.
The project has both an online interactive mural that contains remarks from the participants, as well as a cover story running in the next edition of Time.
You may view the interactive mural here. The cover story can be read on Time Magazine's website.

Tax Reform's Big Success
Across Pennsylvania, employers are investing more in their workers and operations. A great example of this can be found in Clearfield County, where Paris Companies is located.
Paris Companies is one of the largest private employers in Clearfield County. The company's leadership calls the pro-growth changes brought about by tax reform a ‘game-changer,' adding that the lower tax rate has allowed them to invest more into their workforce.

Meeting with the Lewistown Sentinel
While in Mifflin County last week, I stopped by the Lewistown Sentinel for an interview on everything from farm policy to the costs and supply problems Pennsylvania businesses are enduring because of tariffs.
I also updated the paper on what has been a productive two-year session in Washington.
Since January 2017, the Senate has confirmed Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, repealed Obamacare's individual mandate, rolled back onerous regulations, enacted a bipartisan package to address the deadly opioid and heroin epidemic, and passed historic tax reform. There is much more work to be done, but those accomplishments are making life better for Pennsylvania families.

Stopping the Importation of Fentanyl
Centre County officials and first responders are working to take the scourge of opioid and fentanyl abuse head on. Last week, I visited Bellefonte in Centre County to discuss my work.
In particular, we discussed the need for bipartisan legislation I introduced with Senator Doug Jones (D-Ala.) which attempts to curb importation of deadly fentanyl. The Blocking Deadly Fentanyl Imports Act would block certain American foreign aid to countries, like China, that turn a blind eye to drug dealers who import this poison into our country.
Just two milligrams of fentanyl is enough to kill the average adult. Estimates have shown that two-thirds of opioid overdose deaths in Pennsylvania involve fentanyl. We must do more to prevent this deadly substance from coming into our country.  
This legislation has broad support from law enforcement and business organizations and I was honored that first responders from Centre County stood with me in support of this important legislation.

President Trump Signs Tenney’s Bill, Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act into Law
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed H.R. 6, SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act into law. Included in this comprehensive legislation is my bill, H.R. 5723-Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act of 2018. This legislation will provide the state of New York $50,521,352 to combat the opioid crisis. My bill passed the House as a stand-alone bill in June.   As a member of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force, I have made it my mission in Congress to find a comprehensive and compassionate solution to reverse the tide of the growing opioid epidemic. Addiction is plaguing our communities and ripping families apart. Last year alone, we lost 114 people to the opioid scourge. Shockingly, our district experienced nearly 10 percent of the total opioid deaths statewide. Over the past two years, we have worked to secure over $6 billion to combat the opioid epidemic. The bill I introduced—the Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act—will identify and roll back barriers that have inhibited the use of non-opioid alternatives to treat pain. I will continue to work closely with the Trump Administration to ensure ending the opioid scourge is a top priority.

ABOUT DAVE | ISSUES | TOURS & FLAGS | STUDENT CENTER | SERVICES | CONTACT
Friends,
First, I'd like to address the acts of violence that occurred this week. Violence of any kind is absolutely unacceptable. In regards to the suspicious packages that were intercepted, I'm thankful for the hard work and dedication of the FBI, the Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies, whose tireless work led to an arrest. Their efforts kept us safe and helped to avert disaster. I am proud of how quickly they were able to locate and take the suspect into custody. 
I am deeply saddened by the shooting that occurred yesterday in Pittsburgh. Anti-Semitism, bigotry, and violence have no place in America. I stand with the victims and their families, the Jewish community, and our brave first responders. May justice come swiftly.
I think it's important for us all to keep in mind that although we may disagree on issues, we are all Americans at the end of the day. Using terror tactics to incite fear, intimidate, and harm is un-American and contrary to the principles of our great nation. Instead of focusing on that which divides us, my hope is that we can continue to hold sacred that which unites us.
Important Great Lakes Updates
I have fought tirelessly to protect the Great Lakes throughout my tenure in Congress and I'm pleased to share that the President signed the America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (WRDA) into law on Tuesday. WRDA is an important bipartisan piece of legislation that provides resources to protect the Great Lakes. 
These initiatives I fought for to benefit Northeast Ohio are included in the bill: 
	•	Language to require the Army Corps of Engineers to implement a five-year harmful algal bloom (HAB) technology development demonstration program to help identify technologies that will improve HAB early detection, prevention, and management techniques. 
	•	Language to direct the Corps to conduct a Great Lakes coastal resiliency study to coordinate a strategy across the Great Lakes to preserve the 5,200-mile coastline on the Great Lakes to protect shoreline communities in the region. 
	•	Progress in getting the Brandon Road Study across the finish line to keep harmful invasive species, like Asian carp, out of the Great Lakes. 
	•	Funding and resources to ensure safe and clean drinking water by reauthorizing the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund program for the first time in over 20 years. 
￼
I'm also pleased to announce that this week, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Buffalo District awarded a $3.4 million contract to Huffman Equipment Rental in Eastlake. This grant will be used to create a 600-foot revetment along the Lake Erie shoreline that will protect the Lake County Raw Water Pump Station. 
I was proud to support this critical infrastructure project and push for the necessary funds to get it across the finish line. This contract demonstrates the ability for federal and local agencies to come together and accomplish important work that will benefit our communities in Northeast Ohio that depend on the Raw Water Pump Station for their drinking water. I appreciate the Army Corps for working with me to get this project done. 
￼
Combating the Opioid Epidemic 
Combating the opioid epidemic has been one of my top priorities in Congress. I am extremely pleased that on Wednesday afternoon, the President signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act into law, continuing our commitment to the largest congressional response to a single drug crisis in history. 
￼
Manufacturing in Northeast Ohio 
I am honored to receive the National Association of Manufacturers Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence. Manufacturing is a key pillar of the economy in Northeast Ohio and I am proud to support policies that enable local manufacturers to create 21st-century jobs, compete in the global economy, and improve conditions for workers.
I am always glad to visit manufacturers and chat with workers, who are the backbone of our economy, about how we can continue to work together. I recently visited BWX Technologies, an innovation powerhouse in Northeast Ohio with more than 290 employees. BWXT is the sole manufacturer of naval reactors for our nation's submarines and aircraft carriers. Keep up the great work!

Medical Device Production 
Did you know that PartsSource, headquartered in Aurora, is the world's largest provider of medical replacement products? It was great to tour their facility with Mayor Ann Womer Benjamin and discuss ways we can strengthen their partnership with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to improve care for our nation's heroes. 
￼
￼
Hudson High School 
Thank you to our principals throughout Northeast Ohio for your hard work and dedication to our students. In honor of National Principals Month, I shadowed Hudson High School's Principal, Brian Wilch. On our tour of the school, I stopped by a government class to discuss how Congress operates and answered questions from a criminology class about my time as the Geauga County Prosecutor. 
It was great to learn about different programs available to students. I was impressed to learn about Hudson's Drug Free Clubs of America chapter, the largest chapter of the club in the country. This year, the chapter has over 700 students enrolled, which is nearly half of the school. With Ohio at the heart of the opioid epidemic, I believe this is a positive way to prevent drug abuse before it happens. I am extremely proud of the leadership the students have shown in establishing this chapter at Hudson - keep up the great work!

5th Coffman Bill Becomes Law...
Dear Friend:
It is an honor for me to represent our district in the U.S. House of Representatives. As always, I appreciate your time in reading this brief update.  Over the past year, the tragedy of teen suicide has shaken too many Colorado communities, from Colorado Springs and Grand Junction, to schools right here in our congressional district. While the nation as a whole is seeing increases in suicide rates among young people, Colorado is particularly affected. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the suicide rate in Colorado is nearly double the national average, and suicide is the leading cause of death among young people. While the reasons for this remains uncertain, it is clear that we, as a state and as a nation, must act to address this terrible problem. 
￼
 Natalie Pramenko, Principal of Arapahoe High School in Littleton
This past week, I went to Arapahoe High School, in Littleton, where I met with Principal Natalie Pramenko, the Director of Secondary Education Clay Abla, and the Director of Social, Emotional and Behavior Services, Nate Thompson. During our meeting, we discussed how Littleton Public Schools’ new ‘Sources of Strength’ program is working at Arapahoe High School and across secondary schools in the district to prevent teen suicide. The program partners students with individual school staff members to serve as adult advisors while emphasizing community support, resilience, and engagement.  During my visit, I was deeply impressed with the dedication and passion shared by Principal Pramenko and Directors Abla and Thompson in their innovative approaches to combat this complex problem. They explained some of the root causes of teen suicide such as a youth culture that is obsessed with social media, over prescribing psychotropic drugs to treat teen anxiety and depression, and marijuana-infused products that have extremely high levels of THC. I was very impressed with their leadership and with all that they are doing, within the challenges of diverting limited resources from other priorities, to prevent teen suicide.  
￼
On Wednesday, the President signed into law H.R. 6, the ‘Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act’. Not only am I pleased that this important bill to comprehensively address the opioid problem is now law, I am even more please that included in this landmark legislation was my bill, H.R. 4635, The ‘Peer-2-Peer Counseling Act’.   My bill, now law, requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Peer Counseling Program to engage a sufficient number of peer counselors to focus on working with our female veterans. These counselors will have expertise in gender-specific issues and services for female veterans who are separating or have recently separated from the military. The program will prioritize providing counseling services to female veterans who have experienced sexual trauma while serving in our armed forces, have PTSD or another mental health condition and/or are at risk for homelessness.  As a member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, I will continue to press the VA to recognize and adjust how it delivers services to the fact that the female population of our military will soon reach 20%. Clearly, the VA of today and of tomorrow must adapt to these changing demographics in our veteran population. I am proud to have led the effort to pass this bipartisan legislation, which will have a meaningful impact for female veterans in our district and our nation now and for years to come.  Finally, as your Representative, each year, I have the honor and privilege of nominating several outstanding young men and women to attend our nation’s service academies. This coming weekend, I will be conducting interviews for this year’s crop of applicants. I always enjoy this opportunity to meet these fine young Americans who seek to serve our nation. I look forward to providing you more details in next week’s message.  As always, I invite you to follow me on Facebook or Twitter to get the latest news it develops. Likewise, you can find all the latest news on my website. I look forward to seeing you around the district!

Stop the Caravan. Secure the Border.
 

This week a migrant caravan of thousands of immigrants started making their way toward our Southern Border. Unfortunately, we should expect more “migrant caravans” and other tactics as long as the Democrats continue to push loopholes that weaken our immigration system and make our country vulnerable.  As the Vice-Chair of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, I have been working for years to secure our border and have been a staunch advocate of building the border wall and putting an end to weak immigration policies. Now, we have a President who is willing to take necessary action to secure the border and protect American citizens.  The United States of America is not an open house for illegal immigrants. We are a country of lawfulness and will not be disrespected by undocumented immigrants who wish to bypass our immigration system and tear through our borders. Those who wish to circumvent our laws jeopardize the safety of American citizens and should not receive special treatment.  I fully back the President and his efforts to put an end to this caravan. Border security is national security and we must prioritize the safety of American citizens first. 
￼
Palazzo Youth Leadership Summit On Thursday, I welcomed nearly 400 south Mississippi high school juniors and seniors to my Seventh Annual Palazzo Youth Leadership Summit at the Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College in Gulfport. We had 39 different schools from throughout south Mississippi travel to hear from Dr. Kelly Lucas, Director of the Thad Cochran Marine Aquaculture Center, Asya Branch, Miss Mississippi 2018, and Dr. Christopher Frigo, Owner of Frigo Orthodontics.   These students will soon enter unfamiliar territory. I believe it is our duty to ensure the upcoming generation of leaders is equipped with skills that will help them be successful and achieve their goals. Right now, they have the options to pursue whatever path they choose whether that is a college education, military career, or start their own business. I hope every student left this event feeling more motivated and empowered than when they first walked into the summit.

October 28, 2018
Dear Friend,  
Last week's acts of terrorism are reprehensible. I am glad no one was injured, and I am very grateful to the law enforcement community for its swift action to identify and arrest the individual involved in these cowardly acts.  We must ensure anyone involved with political violence is prosecuted to the fullest extent under the law.  
Additionally, I was proud to be on hand for last week's bill signing ceremony at the White House. The signing of H.R. 6 enacted comprehensive new policies to combat the opioid (which I will discuss in greater detail below); however, it also marked the 25th initiative I have written that has become law since 2015. These laws may not be the flashiest, headline-grabbing initiatives, but they are improving the lives of millions of Americans. The vast majority of the items are bi-partisan and passed as part of a larger legislative package. That’s the way I work, behind the scenes and across the aisle--not caring about getting credit, but rather about doing what is best for our country, my constituents and our community. For a complete list, of my 25 bills that have been signed into law in that past three years, click here.  Please be assured that I will continue to work effectively as I tackle the issues that matter most to my constituents.   
Continue reading for a short synapsis of my work on your behalf last week! 
Fighting for our Nation’s Heroes 
In light of the VA's recent delays in processing GI Bill payments, it is even more important that the Senate pass my SITREP bill.  This important legislation ensures that Veterans are not penalized by their school when there are bureaucratic delays in processing GI Bill payments.  The Military Times wrote an article urging the Senate to take immediate action. 
￼ 
Combatting Addiction 
Last week, President Trump signed the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act. This bipartisan legislative package will strengthen our continued efforts to combat the opioid crisis by advancing treatment and recovery initiatives, improving prevention, protecting our communities, and bolstering our efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl. Two provisions I authored were included in this new law. One, H.R. 5675, requires high risk Medicare enrollees to participate in a mandatory drug management program, commonly referred to as a Lock-In. Participants select one pharmacy (can be a chain or independent pharmacy) at which to receive all medication. This improves care coordination by medical professionals and helps prevent abuse or accidental overdose. This is particularly important given that more than half of the people who overdose in Pasco County are over the age of 65. 
￼ 
The second initiative I authored in this package is the Sober Home Fraud Detection bill (H.R. 6092). This legislation provides standards for Sober Living Homes. There have sadly been several cases of addicts seeking treatment at one of these unregulated facilities who have been exploited. I believe there must be accountability for anyone seeking to profit from the exploitation of those who are suffering. These new laws will save lives.
Additionally, I enjoyed visiting North Tampa Behavioral Health in Wesley Chapel last week. It is one of the local providers of mental health and substance abuse treatment in our community. We discussed additional needs that exist as we work to remove barriers which are keeping patients from accessing effective treatment.
￼ 
Facilitating Continued Economic Success 
The Commerce Department just announced its advance estimate of economic growth in the third quarter of this year.  This report shows that we continue to be on the path of promoting economic prosperity for all Americans.  According to these newest figures, the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.5% from July to September.   
Lowering the Cost of Prescription Drugs 
I applaud the President and Secretary Azar’s bold new initiatives to lower the price of prescription drug prices which were announced last week. They are testing a variety of strategies in order to see which ones yield the best results for patients. This patient-centered approach is a nice complement to my recent legislation which has become law. My legislation streamlined the office of combination products and the FDA approval process by creating competition when none exists within the market, and it is already working! A generic version of the EpiPen was already approved through the new process created by my provision. There is no one simple solution to this complex problem. Instead, we are trying multiple strategies in order to get the best results for the American people.
Raising Public Awareness 
The Social Security Administration (SSA) is warning citizens about an ongoing caller-ID “spoofing” scheme misusing the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) national customer service phone number. SSA has received numerous reports of questionable phone calls displaying SSA’s 1-800 number on a caller-ID screen.  The reports indicate the calls display 1-800-772-1213, SSA’s national customer service number, as the incoming number on caller ID. People who have accepted the calls said the caller identifies as an SSA employee. In some cases, the caller states that SSA does not have all of the person’s personal information, such as their Social Security number (SSN), on file. Other callers claim SSA needs additional information so the agency can increase the person’s benefit payment, or that SSA will terminate the person’s benefits if they do not confirm their information.
SSA employees do contact citizens by phone for customer-service purposes, and in some situations, an SSA employee may request the citizen confirm personal information over the phone. However, SSA employees will never threaten you for information or promise a Social Security benefit or approval or increase in exchange for information.” Click for here for more information about this latest scam.

Advocating for our Community and Speaking with Constituents 
Last week I joined countless Pasco residents and community leaders in voicing my strong support of the Ridge Road extension project that is currently under review by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This is the latest in my ongoing efforts to advance this important public safety priority. I am confident that we are nearing the end of the review process and that the Corps will issue a favorable decision.  
I also enjoyed speaking to students in the AVID program at Martinez Middle School last week. These bright young leaders had great questions about the process of applying to a Military Service Academy, and about my role as their elected representative. 
￼ 
Additionally, it was an honor to give a legislative update at the Trinity Oaks Women's Association. We discussed a variety of issues including: opioids, lowering the cost of prescription drugs and the need to work in a bipartisan manner in order to get things done.

Friends, 
Across the Third District, Iowans are bringing in the harvest. Long hours in the fields, at co-ops, on farms, and in other agribusinesses are needed to keep our economy moving and to reap the seeds sowed this Spring. Each year, I hold my Bringing in the Harvest Tour which takes me to every corner of the Third District to see the progress of the harvest and talk to Iowans about the issues they are facing.  
In this week's newsletter, I wanted to take you through some of our stops and share what we discussed over this two-day tour. 
￼ 
One of our stops on the tour was the Elite Octane ethanol plant in Shenandoah. The folks there were excited about the recent announcement E15 will be sold year-round. This will give consumers more choices, boost demand for corn, reduce our reliance on foreign oil, and promote cleaner air.  
￼  
I stopped at ZFS Processing in Creston to see how this soybean processing plant was doing since opening a couple months ago. They take soybeans and turn them into soybean meal, oil, flakes, and many other materials we use in our daily lives.  
￼ 
On day two, Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig joined my tour and we stopped at Steve Baudler's farm near Fontanelle. We talked about the impact the Electronic Logging Device mandate is having on farmers and those transporting livestock. In Congress, I've been working to create an exemption for livestock haulers so they can get their animals from one place to another safely.  
￼ 
We made our way to Curtis Meier's hog farm in Clarinda. Iowans raise more pork than any other state, and Curtis, like many Iowans, works hard to deliver a quality product that is healthy and safe. They take biosecurity seriously and so should our government. That's why I introduced the Securing our Food and Agriculture Act which was signed into law by President Trump. The law makes sure our government is prepared to handle any biosecurity risks to our food supply. I've also been a strong supporter of the vaccine bank to ensure if there is ever an animal disease outbreak, we can act quickly to stop it from spreading.  
￼ 
These are just a few of our stops from the 2018 Bringing in the Harvest Tour. As I continue to travel across the Third District speaking with Iowans from every background, I remain committed to fighting for Iowa and delivering solutions to the issues Iowans are facing. 
Take care, 
￼

Dear Friend,   Thank you for the opportunity to update you on the work of the 115th Congress. I trust this finds you and your family well, as we work together to bring Hoosier common sense to Washington.

￼
Indiana thrives because of its family values and the time we spend with our loved ones. Kathy, Teddy, Ryan, and I had a great time as a family picking pumpkins at Beasley’s Orchard in Danville.
￼
Like many Hoosier families, Ryan and I love fishing together. Ryan was excited to catch his biggest fish of the season. I see how fishing teaches him the importance of patience and hard work. 
￼
As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, I visited Beverly Hills High School to learn about their school safety routine. 

Frankfort Town Hall
￼
On October 21, 2018, I had the privilege of meeting with constituents at my Frankfort Town Hall. During my eight years in Congress, I have been proud to serve and fight for all Hoosiers so they can build better for themselves and their families.  
I have enjoyed representing Hoosiers in Washington, but my favorite part of the job has been traveling over 125,000 miles throughout the 4th District to meet with all of you over the years. It is my constituents who give me my marching orders. It is always an honor to meet and speak to all of you who come to my events and voice your opinion.  
I want to thank everyone who came out to the Frankfort Town Hall to discuss the issues most important to you. A wide variety of issues were discussed, including health care, the Farm Bill, and immigration. Local issues, like the need for a weather radar in the district for safety purposes, were also brought to my attention.  
I learn so much by talking to each of you. I will take what we discussed there and bring it back to Washington. It has been the honor of a lifetime serving my constituents, and I will continue to fight on your behalf until my last day in office.  
Stopping The Caravan
The caravan making its way to America is around 7,000 strong and about 1,000 miles away from our border. A nation is only sovereign if it has secure borders. I applaud President Trump’s leadership in taking a strong stance to protect our border from the caravan. In recent days, President Trump has announced that he is deploying hundreds of soldiers to our southern border to stop these illegal immigrants. 
For too long, our immigration laws have been ignored. We have allowed millions of people to come here illegally and seek asylum in sanctuary cities. I have been a strong proponent of tougher immigration laws by introducing the SLAP Act, which would punish any elected official in a sanctuary city who refuses to comply with our immigration law. Until we build the wall, illegal immigrants will continue to threaten our security and the integrity of our laws. 
America's Safe Schools Week
As the Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, I understand the importance of cultivating a safe environment for our children to learn and grow. Our children's well-being is of utmost importance, and it should be a priority to equip professionals entrusted with our students' lives with the tools they need to keep our children safe.
I believe that we need to continue to come together as a community of professionals and learn best practices to keep our children out of harm’s way. I have hosted School Safety Summits in the past, and I look forward to my upcoming summit to speak with law enforcement and other education professionals on the skills and tools we need to further protect our students.

SOLUTIONS TO COMBAT THE OPIOID CRISIS

This week, President Trump signed into law our bipartisan package designed to combat the opioid epidemic. Included in the package were three bills I introduced. My bills help patients receive treatment for addiction through telemedicine, remove barriers to abuse deterrent medications, and provide pharmacists with tools to address fraud, forgery and abuse.

Overall the legislation, the SUPPORT Act, works to combat the opioid crisis by addressing prevention, advancing treatment and recovery initiatives, and improving efforts to fight illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl. 

I am excited and proud that this package was signed into law. While working with members on both sides of the aisle to create these solutions to combat this crisis, I learned from constituents, colleagues, and others that everyone and every community has been impacted by this epidemic in some way. 

For me, as a pharmacist for more than 30 years, I saw addiction end careers and ruin lives and families. That is what has driven me to work so hard on this legislation to address prescription drug abuse while ensuring those who truly need the medications maintain access to it. 

It is great news this package is now law, and I am committed to continuing this strong bipartisan work to end this crisis once and for all.

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CLXXXV

Monday, October 22, 2018:  Finally, this past weekend we enjoyed fall like temperatures!  I took full advantage of it beginning on Saturday as I headed to Hinesville in Liberty County for the First Presbyterian Christian Academy’s annual fall festival.  One of the highlights of this great family event is the chili cook-off challenge as I tasted all the entries and am glad I didn’t volunteer to judge because they were all delicious. 
￼
Rep. Carter at the FPCA Chili Cook-off
Afterwards, I headed to Delegal Marina at the Landings in Savannah for the annual Sons of the American Revolution Oyster Roast as I was a guest of my good friend Frank Hardeman.  Oyster roasts are great anytime in Coastal Georgia but when the weather starts to turn cooler, there’s nothing better.  On Sunday, I stopped by Bible Baptist Church in Savannah for their annual Friend Day and enjoyed seeing the many family events they had set up as well as the music of Sounds of Liberty.  Later in the afternoon, I enjoyed meeting with constituents in Ardsley Park in Savannah.  This morning, I’m in downtown Savannah as I have the pleasure of meeting with Savannah’s new police chief, Roy Minter.  Chief Minter is an intelligent, articulate man who brings a wealth of experience to the job and I am certain he will do an excellent job.  Next, I head to Rincon for the Effingham County Chamber of Commerce Business Summit where, along with my Congressional colleague from the 12th District, Rep. Rick Allen (R-GA), I bring the group up to date on Washington issues. 
￼
Rep. Carter speaking at the Effingham County Chamber of Commerce Business Summit
Afterwards, I head to the offices of the Savannah Morning News where I meet with the editorial board.  Later, I meet with members of the Savannah Homebuilders Association before heading out to Tybee Island where I meet with constituents.
Tuesday, October 23, 2018:  I’m on Hutchinson Island in Savannah bright and early this morning for the Georgia Chamber of Commerce Statewide Tour and have the opportunity to address this great group of business leaders and bring them up to date on Washington issues.  Afterwards, I head across the river for the Eastern Wharf groundbreaking.  This long awaited project promises to be a great addition to the River Street area and will add to the vibrancy and beauty of downtown Savannah.
￼
Rep. Carter at the Eastern Wharf groundbreaking ceremony
Next, I head to my Savannah district office where I meet with Dr. Van Crisco of Intent Solutions to learn more about the exciting technology that this start-up company is developing.  Afterwards, I meet with Jared Hall, a musician in Savannah with the Recording Academy which represents performers, songwriters and studio professionals across the country and in the district.  After a great meeting where we discuss policy issues important to music creators, I head to Derst Baking Company, the oldest continuous manufacturing business in Savannah.  Now owned by Flowers Foods out of Thomasville, GA, Derst Baking Company was founded in Savannah in 1867 by Captain John Derst who was a Captain with the Savannah Fire Department.  Captain Derst fought in the Civil War but, after being injured, walked from Atlanta to Savannah where he went to work for the Fire Department and opened a small bakery. 
￼
Rep. Carter touring Derst Baking Company
Today, Captain John Derst’s Old Fashion Bread as well as other baked goods from the company can be found throughout the Southeast.  My final stop of the day is in downtown Savannah where I meet with constituents.
Wednesday, October 24, 2018:  I’m out on Wilmington Island early this morning for a meeting with constituents before heading to the airport and flying to Alma in Bacon County to meet with constituents.  Afterwards, I head to Waycross in Ware County where I meet with constituents before heading to Offerman in Pierce County to also meet with constituents.  My final two stops meeting with constituents are in Jesup in Wayne County and Ludowici in Long County before I head back to Savannah.  On my way back to Savannah I have a phone interview with a student from the University of Mississippi College of Pharmacy to discuss how I became involved in the political process and how other pharmacists can become involved.
Thursday, October 25, 2018:  I have the honor this morning of speaking to the Coastal Law Enforcement Officers Association in Pooler and bringing them up to date on law enforcement issues in Washington, including the opioid legislation that was signed into law yesterday by President Trump.  
￼
Rep. Carter speaking at the Coastal Law Enforcement Officers Association meeting
The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act is a combination of 58 bills that were passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee that I serve on and address the opioid epidemic.  I sponsored three of these bills and, while there is no silver bullet that will cure this epidemic by itself, these bills will help tremendously.  Afterwards, I head to Jekyll Island in Glynn County for the annual Brunswick State of the Port Address where we hear of the great progress that continues at the number two roll on- roll off-port in our country.  Combined with the great leadership from the Georgia Ports Authority, everyone in attendance is reminded that the success of this great port can be largely attributed to the dedicated workforce that takes so much pride in their work.  Afterwards, I head back to Savannah and during the drive I have a phone interview with a student from the University of Georgia Grady College of Journalism before heading to the airport for a trip to Houston, TX, where I will be the keynote speaker at the Pharmacy Compounding Centers of America (PCCA) annual meeting.
Friday, October 26, 2018:   PCCA is headquartered in Houston and provides more than 3,200 independent community compounding pharmacy members across the United States and worldwide with drug compounding ingredients, equipment, education and assistance. 
￼
Rep. Carter speaking to PCCA
I work closely with this group on their issues in Washington and have great respect for the important work they do for their patients and the services they provide.  I am honored to have the opportunity this morning to address the group and bring them up to date on issues in Washington.  Afterwards, I head to Shenandoah, TX, for a tour of The Woodlands Compounding Pharmacy owned and run by Jasper and Keisha Lovoi that specializes in preparing customized compounded medications.  After learning about the wide range of services that this state of the art facility provides and touring their impressive lab, I head to the airport for my return trip home.

Congressman Smith's E-news: October 27, 2018  
￼ 
I enjoyed this beautiful Nebraska sunrise on my way to Kearney High School last week. 
 
Opportunities for Third District Youth 
As I travel the Third District and visit our schools, I never cease to be amazed at the intelligence and drive of our students. Their informed curiosity over key issues facing our country has left a particularly strong impression on me this summer and it is this curiosity I seek to nurture through my outreach efforts.   College students interested in gaining firsthand experience in the legislative process are invited to apply for an internship with one of my offices during the spring, summer, or fall. Interns are provided the opportunity to assist with constituent services, attend events, and work side-by-side with my staff on policy issues.  Another way I interact regularly with students is through the Third District Youth Advisory Council, which is open to high school juniors and seniors. Through in-person meetings, Facebook forums, and conference calls, I meet with this group throughout the school year to discuss the matters they find most important. Applications for the 2019-2020 school year will open in the spring.  I also take great pleasure in welcoming school groups to Washington, D.C. on the steps of our nation’s capital. From 4-H groups to Close-Up programs and others, the summer is the busiest time of year for these visits. If you have a group of young people who would like to visit Washington, D.C., my office is always available to assist in arranging tours of the Capitol, White House, and other national sites.  For White House tours, I encourage your group to contact my office three months in advance to comply with its security protocols.   As a young person, my interest in politics was sparked by my grandfather who served as a Seabee during World War II and it is because of him that I cherish our responsibility to bring the next generation of Nebraskans into civic participation. If you know someone who would be interested in applying for an internship with my office, please encourage them to do so.   I welcome active engagement from Third District students of all ages and always appreciate hearing their ideas for America’s future.    
Meet with Me This Week

President Trump Signs Vital Opioid Legislation into Law!
This week, President Trump, with First Lady Melania Trump by his side, made an incredible announcement ... H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, was signed into law! This legislation included more than 70 initiatives to address this crisis that is affecting far too many families here in the 6th District and across the nation. Specifically, this new law: 
	•	Will help stop the flow of fentanyl into the US by requiring the US Postal Service to obtain the same basic information from all international shippers that is already required of private shippers like FedEx;
	•	 Expands treatment options by expanding Medicare coverage of medically-assisted addiction treatment and easing some of the federal restrictions on Medicaid funds used for residential treatment centers with more than 16 beds;
	•	Provides significant new resources in federal grants for additional awareness, prevention, treatment, and long-term recovery.
While new reports just out this week indicate that number of fatal drug overdoses has fallen for six consecutive months, these new resources and reforms will help ensure that we continue to make progress. One life lost to opioid addiction is one too many.
American Wages Growing and Rising Faster
A stronger economy has been fueled by tax cuts and regulatory reforms, and this stronger economy means greater opportunities for all Americans.
In fact, the lowest-income earners are seeing a rise in wages. The bottom 10% of full-time salary and wage workers have seen an average of 4.9% annual growth over the past 4 quarters. Wages are just one part of a worker’s overall compensation package. Benefits and bonuses matter too. That’s why it is so encouraging to see companies continuing give bonuses and expand employee benefits.
In September, unemployment dipped to its lowest since 1969. We continue to have more job openings than people actually looking for work. 
You can see the Joint Economic Committee’s full report by clicking here. 
Just In: 3rd Quarter GDP is 3.5%
This week, the Bureau of Economic Analysis announced that GDP growth for the 3rd Quarter hit 3.5%. This continues the strong growth trend following the enactment of tax cuts earlier this year. As the holiday season approaches, consumer confidence remains at its highest in decades.
Honored to Stand with the Johns Creek Veterans
￼ 
What a great evening catching up with the veterans of Johns Creek and the Johns Creek Veterans Association’s monthly meeting. One of the most important aspects of any congressional office is the casework — our work to help the every day citizens of the district. We’ve handled hundreds of cases in the past year and a half, with about 20% of that casework focused on helping our veterans.
If you or a loved one could use assistance navigating the VA, we are honored to help you. We are here to help you and your family with any issue related to the federal government. 

 ￼ 
It was awesome to get the chance to meet with two groups of Girl Scouts this week. Hmmm...could there be a future Congresswoman among these bright young ladies?!

THE SCALISE CAPITOL REPORT
Let's Do Our Part to End Political Violence These past few weeks we've seen reports of Republican officials being physically assaulted, and Democrat leaders being targeted with mail-bombs. Thankfully, a suspect has been caught in the mail-bomb attacks. Once again, the men and women of our law enforcement community have proven that they are the best in the world, and I join President Trump in expressing my sincere gratitude to them for their swift apprehension of the man suspected of these acts of terror. Let this serve as another reminder that threats and violence have absolutely no place in American politics, or anywhere else in our society.  The violence and threats that we have seen run in direct contradiction to the free exchange of ideas and perspectives that is so vital to the health of our great democracy. If we are to stem the tide of violent acts and violent rhetoric, then it is crucial we all do our part to break down the divisions in our country and remember always to treat those with different beliefs than our own with the same respect that we would treat our neighbor who might disagree with us.

 Meeting with Louisiana businesses I was excited to meet recently with Louisiana businesses during a conference hosted by the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry (LABI). Small businesses are the backbone of Louisiana’s economy, and we discussed issues ranging from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted earlier this year, to the success we’ve had in Congress working with President Trump in rolling back unnecessary, costly, job-killing regulations in Washington. The latest economic news continues to confirm that Republican pro-growth reforms are working to create high-paying jobs and get this country back on the right track. Just last week, the World Economic Forum ranked the U.S. economy as the most competitive in the world! The benefits to hard-working families are clear, and wages have continued to go up. This summer we saw pay and benefits increasing at the fastest pace in 10 years! We need to keep this growth going, and as your Congressman, I will continue fighting to advance a bold vision that does just that!

 Helping Our Neighbors in Florida Recover From Hurricane Michael Over the years, so many people across this country have given their time and donated to charities so families in Louisiana could recover from storms. Last week, I helped return the favor as we traveled to Florida’s panhandle to provide meals to those working to rebuild from Hurricane Michael. I joined with New Orleans restauranteur Tommy Cvitanovich (from Drago’s) to provide 2,000 meals to families, and to thank the law enforcement officers who are working day and night to help rebuild and to keep those communities safe. In America, we all stick together and help our neighbors in need. With all of our help and prayers, the strong and resilient people of Florida will fully rebuild and recover from this latest storm.

Dear Friend,
As I write this, a 7,000-person migrant caravan is marching across Mexico towards the United States’ southern border. From the politicians that helped inspire and form the caravan to the immigration holes it highlights, it should serve as a wakeup call showing our need for a more secure border. It’s a massive, unprecedented look in slow motion at almost every aspect that makes up our broken immigration system...KEEP READING HERE

Weekly Update: I Support Our Children’s Future By Congressman Rob Wittman October 27, 2018  Strengthening America’s education system is important in fostering innovation and promoting our economic security. This week, I held two Career and Technical Education (CTE) Symposiums in two areas in the district. The first took place on Monday at Germanna Community College in Fredericksburg and the second one in Hanover at American Legion Post 175. I’ve held these symposiums in order to connect education institutions with local businesses and the private sector, and to help ensure the curriculum for our students reflects the needs of the workforce. 
￼
 Currently, businesses across America are facing a severe talent shortage due to a lack of vocational education and technical training. One of my top priorities is promoting CTE and STEM programs as a way to cultivate skillsets needed in today’s workforce and connect students with good-paying jobs. We must be preparing our young people and provide them with the necessary skills and knowledge to compete in a global economy.  These symposiums are a great way for students to see what opportunities are available to them after high school. Not all students are on the path to a four-year college degree. By 2020, demand for STEM jobs will be higher than any other occupational focus including healthcare and service industry, with an estimated 9 million jobs. Almost of half of these jobs will require less than a four-year degree, paying an average of 15% more than non-STEM related jobs to people with similar academic background.  I have made it my mission to meet with all of the CTE programs in the First District and we have a had a lot of success. In May, I held my first symposium at the University of Mary Washington’s Stafford campus, where, again, teachers, businesses, students, and education officials came together to discuss partnership opportunities and ways Congress can help our students cultivate tangible skill sets. With students facing record education-related debt averaging $37,000, and less than 30 percent of college graduates working in jobs related to their major, CTE offers a great alternative. 
￼

Congress has been working hard to bring even more, real change to our students. I was proud to support the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, which is now signed into law. The Perkins CTE program controls over $1 billion in grants for federal, state, and local CTE programs. The reforms include expanding access to CTE programs, helping schools create partnerships with the business community so students can cultivate skills in demand by the labor market, improving and modernizing schools’ CTE programs, and giving states and localities more control over how to spend CTE dollars.

Last year, my legislation, the Domestic Maritime Centers of Excellence Act, passed the House as part of the National Defense Authorization Act and was signed into law by the President. This bill advances the capabilities of two-year community and technical colleges to assist the federal government and industry in securing the talent pipeline for domestic maritime industry jobs. This bill not only helps promote participation in STEM and CTE but will create a talent pipeline for our shipbuilders and repairmen in order to sustain and grow our Navy's Fleet.

It is our responsibility to prepare students for the demands of our current society and to provide unemployed Americans with an outlet to reintegrate into the workforce. I will always continue working for what is right for our young people.

 Dr. Allison's Step Towards a Cure



Earlier this month, the esteemed 2018 Nobel Prize winners were announced from Stockholm, Sweden.  In accordance with Swedish scientist Alfred Nobel’s will, the Nobel Prize celebrates those who “have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind” within five fields: Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace.  Just a handful of exceptional men and women have been honored each year since 1901. 
This year, among the brilliant men and women honored from around the globe is Houston’s own Dr. Jim Allison. 
￼
Dr. Allison was shocked when he heard the news.  The boy who grew up in Alice, Texas – and who lost his mother and uncle to cancer at a young age – had been working to find alternative treatments to radiation and chemotherapy, but he never dreamed he’d one day make a groundbreaking discovery towards cancer’s cure that would merit a Nobel Prize. 
Through their research of T cells, Dr. Allison and Japanese immunologist Tasuku Honjo found a way to unleash a patient’s own immune system to fight against cancer cells.   
Now known as the Godfather of Cancer Immunotherapy, Dr. Allison has helped create drugs to treat common forms of cancer like melanoma, lung cancer, and Hodgkin's lymphoma.   
But don’t let Dr. Allison’s resounding success let you think it’s been easy.  “Science is a long and frustrating road,” he announced at a press conference.  “There’s no instant gratification… You’ve got to be comfortable with a lot of failures to get there.” 
Dr. Allison also acknowledges how critical teamwork is when it comes to medical research.  Without funding through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) and private funding, he says many of the therapies that currently treat millions of cancer patients worldwide simply wouldn’t exist.   
Thanks to the perseverance and dedication of Dr. Allison and his team, scientists are one step closer to curing cancer.  And thanks to them, it’s not a question of if we will cure cancer, but when. 
I’m proud this discovery came from Texas.  But Dr. Allison is not the only Nobel Laureate from the Lone Star State.  There are at least 10 Nobel Laureates living in Texas today, and even more Texans who have been honored with Nobel Prizes since they were created more than a century ago.  
In 1946, former University of Texas professor Hermann J. Muller won a Nobel Prize for his research showing X-rays can cause genetic mutations, proving the danger of radiation for the first time. 
Jack Kilby, inventor of the handheld calculator and thermal printer, won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2000 for building the first integrated circuit while working for Texas Instruments in 1958.  He then went on to teach electrical engineering at Texas A&M University. 
Just last year, University of Texas alum Michael W. Young won a Nobel Prize for his discovery of the gene that controls our biological clock, including processes like sleep and metabolism throughout the day.  
Each of these incredible discoveries, and many more being made each day at labs across our state, have pushed the needle forward on our understanding of the world we live in.  But there’s always more we can learn.  Thomas Edison once said, “When you have exhausted all possibilities, remember this: you haven’t.”   
There’s so much more we can discover, and with science advancing at practically lighting speed thanks to minds like Dr. Allison’s, I know we’ll have more answers soon. 
I encourage all young boys and girls – from Alice, Texas, and all across our state – to look up at Dr. Allison and all of Texas’ Nobel Prize winners and know that whatever you set your mind to, the sky is the limit.

COMBATING OPIOIDS FOR OK-02 
On Wednesday President Trump signed the federal opioid bill, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act included a number of my office’s priorities including: 
·         The Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act (H.R. 3528)
·         The Tribal Addiction and Recovery Act (H.R. 5140)
￼

The Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act (H.R. 6082) passed the House by a vote of 357-57, but was not included in the final package. I am continuing to push the Senate to pass H.R. 6082 before the end of the year. 
SERVICE ACADEMY NOMINATIONS 
Do you know anyone who may be interested in joining a service academy? Attending a U.S. service academy is an invaluable experience that shapes young men and women into strong leaders and military officers. Nominations are available for the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy, and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.

MY WEEK IN OKLAHOMA
I had the opportunity to cut the ribbon for the Build Your Future program and address students from across Northeastern Oklahoma. Build Your Future is a program put together by community leaders to expose high school students to career technology education and the opportunities in the construction field. Currently unemployment is at a historic low of 3.7% and the construction industry is expected to grow by 25% in the next year. These jobs can average in the $50,000 and $60,000 pay range. A very good wage for young Oklahomans willing to work hard.

Thank you for having me at the Build My Future ribbon cutting!

Guns in America
325 million people. More than 265 million guns. 35,000 deaths a year. And one 227-year-old constitutional right.
A Time and JR Project
￼
To tell this uniquely American story, TIME partnered with JR, the artist and photographer known in part for his murals around the world that portray communities in all their complexity. In three U.S. cities profoundly affected by guns—Dallas, St. Louis and Washington, D.C.—we invited people to share their views and describe their experiences in a search for common ground.

In all, JR filmed and photographed 245 people—hunters and activists, teachers and police officers, parents and children—to create this mural for TIME’s November 5, 2018, cover.

If You’re Not Scared About Fascism in the U.S., You Should Be

When fascism starts to feel normal, we’re all in trouble.
By Jason Stanley
Video by Adam Westbrook and Japhet Weeks
The author is a professor of philosophy at Yale University.
While calling President Trump a fascist may seem like an exaggeration, it might not be that far from the truth. Should we be worried? Jason Stanley has spent the past decade studying fascism, from Mussolini to Duterte. In this video op-ed, he argues that yes, we should be worried: If Americans are not vigilant, fascism could become a new reality in the United States.

Women Are Running for Office—And Funding Democrats—Like Never Before
A wave of women is grabbing 2018 by the ballots.
By Kara Voght and Dave Gilson, Mother Jones
“The women are in my grill no matter where I go,” Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) groused in early 2017 as he was dogged by some of the many grassroots activists spurred to action by the election of President Donald Trump. Since then, the women-led “resistance” has fueled a wave of Democratic candidates and sparked hope that female voters will stop Trump in his tracks.  See Jane Run
1992 was declared the “Year of the Woman” after 24 women won House seats for the first time and four new women joined the Senate. In 2018, there has been a surge in women running for Congress. Three-fourths of them are Democrats, and 68 percent are challengers or running for open seats.

On Wednesday October 24, 2018, I led Congressmen Henry Cuellar (TX-28) and Filemon Vela (TX-34) and Senators John Cornyn (TX) and Ted Cruz (TX) in a letter to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator William ‘Brock’ Long requesting that FEMA reconsider their denial of damages reported by Cameron and Hidalgo Counties in their applications for Public Assistance (PA) resulting from this summer’s recent severe storms and flooding. 
I thank local, state, and federal officials for their continued efforts to assist in recovery efforts for Cameron and Hidalgo Counties and for calling on us for aid. I urge Administrator Long to reconsider the current damage assessments and recognize the flawed process that made these determinations. Our constituents are not asking for favors, only the consistent application of law to the facts.

Recently, I visited the newest Pic N Pac location in Seguin, Texas and met with members from the Texas Food and Fuel Association (TFFA) and the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS). More businesses in Central and South Texas equal more jobs and a stronger economy. I thank TFFA, NACS, and Pic N Pac for having me!

On Friday, October 19, I attended a ceremony recognizing the completion of the City of Floresville’s newly constructed U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and to announce $888,556.85 in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding for Wilson County. Construction of the Floresville wastewater treatment plant was made possible with $9.47 million in federal funding from the USDA through their Rural Development Program. Following the ceremony, I announced more than $888,000 in FEMA funding for Wilson County for damages from the 2015 Memorial Day Weekend Flooding. 


Rep. Cuellar Announces Grants for the City of Mission
￼

On Monday, October 22, I announced two grants for the City of Mission; a $1,022,828 federal grant to the Mission Fire Department from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Staffing for Adequate Fire & Emergency Response (SAFER) Program as well as a $500,000 grant for the City of Mission from the National Park Service (NPS) for the revitalization of Birdwell Park. FEMA’s SAFER grant will help strengthen the fire department’s emergency response through increased funding to hire nine additional firefighters. The NPS’s Land and Water Conservation Fund works to provide funding for local and state park projects. These funds will be used to reinvigorate Birdwell Park, including adding new tennis courts and a revitalized trail system with distance markers, water fountains, and other amenities. 


Rep. Cuellar Announces Funding for City of Roma’s Bus Terminal
￼

On Monday, October 22, I announced $700,000 at the groundbreaking ceremony for the City of Roma’s New Bus Terminal. The new terminal will decrease traffic congestion, create a new economic anchor for Grant Street, open up a new hub for transportation coming in from Mexico, and will serve as a link to job opportunities. I have diligently followed this infrastructural need since funds were initially earmarked by Congressman Doggett in 2005, and will continue to serve the transportation needs of the district. 


Operation Stonegarden Announcement in Hidalgo
￼

On Tuesday, October 23, I announced $4.5 million to Hidalgo County through DHS’s Operation Stonegarden. These funds will work to supplement the border efforts in the county, including paying out over-time, covering equipment costs, and reimbursing interagency operations. As a longtime supporter of border protection, a focus of my work on the Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee has been aiding the men and women who protect our nation every day. 


Operation Stonegarden Announcement in Starr County
￼

On Tuesday, October 23, I announced $2 million in funding to Starr County through DHS’s Operation Stonegarden to strengthen coordination between agencies on all levels so that we may continue to fortify our borders. I worked diligently to secure this funding through my efforts on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee as a continuation of my dedication to the men and women who protect our nation along the border every day.


Operation Stonegarden Announcement in Zapata
￼

On Tuesday, October 23, I announced $300,000 to Zapata County through the Department of Homeland Security’s Operation Stonegarden. This funding will supplement the efforts of the U.S. Border Patrol through equipment cost reimbursement, coverage of interagency operation costs, and overtime funds. As a longtime supporter of security for our borders, these funds will cover agency costs and strengthen agency operations. Congressman Cuellar (TX-28) presents DHS Operation Stonegarden grant in Zapata on Tuesday. Pictured from left are Border Patrol Agent Juan Galindo, Zapata County Sheriff Alonso Lopez, Congressman Henry Cuellar, Zapata County Judge Joe Rathmell, District Attorney Isidro “Chilo” Alaniz, Chief Deputy Raymundo del Bosque, and Zapata County Commissioner Precinct 2 Olga Elizondo.

Weekly Review
 



October 23

Small Business Legislation: Last month, the House passed two bills by overwhelming margins. I voted no on both bills because they would advantage some small businesses over others. My belief has always been that government shouldn’t pick winners and losers in the commercial marketplace.
They’re both benign sounding bills with good intentions…but unfortunately bring with them the unintended consequence of picking favorites. And I think that’s a bridge too far for those of us who believe in market principles and limited government.
H.R. 6368, the Encouraging Small Business Innovators Act, would change the formula that the federal government uses when rating subcontractors. It passed 389 to 6.
The bill would change the formula by which federal government subcontractors are rated in a way that benefits companies that have taken part in one of the Small Business Administration’s grant programs - either the Small Business Innovation Research program or the Small Business Technology Transfer program. Click here to read more.

2018 Water Resources Development Act: Yesterday, the president signed the 2018 Water Resources bill into law. There were several wins for the Lowcountry in this bill, but before I get to that, I wanted to share two observations. 

One, the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) is one of the few examples of regular order in Congress these days. As you may remember, regular order means taking an idea through the full committee process of debate rather than air dropping an idea into the Floor with none of the back-and-forth that the committee process guarantees. These bills have been coming up for regular two-year authorizations, and in this regard, the Water Resources Development Act represents Congress functioning as it should. 

Two, it’s also one of the rare instances of financial responsibility in Washington, given that the bill is fully offset by deauthorizing old projects to make room for new ones. Again, what this means in plain English is that you stop spending on other things so you can spend on this thing. Obviously that’s not the way Congress has been working for quite some time, given the view that says we can spend on both without any decrease in other areas of spending. 

Our office was able to work with the Committee on the inclusion of three important topics that have direct impact on the Lowcountry. Click here to read more.

National Debt as a Threat to National Security: “The continually increasing debt is the biggest threat we have to our national security.”
That’s what Admiral Mike Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said...and I’ve mentioned this on more than one occasion because of the geometric growth in our debt. It’s something I have long believed and long championed, and it’s for that reason that this summer, I joined with 34 of my Republican colleagues in signing a resolution introduced by Congressman Andy Biggs to recognize the national debt as a threat to national security.
It took us 200 years to accumulate $5 trillion in national debt. It took just eight years for it to double from $5 trillion to $10 trillion under the presidency of George W. Bush. It doubled yet again from $10 trillion to $20 trillion under President Obama. And it’s just over $21.2 trillion today…
...and these numbers are on an upward trajectory. Click here to read more.

Every Kid Outdoors Act: Under the category of more circling back and catching up on past votes, I wanted to circle back to one vote that I missed when I stayed home in anticipation of what then looked to be a monster storm hitting our district. As it turned out, Hurricane Florence never materialized, and I went back up for votes. But I was struck by this vote for the way it’s another example of government waste, inefficiency, and redundancy.
Not everything that government does has to be codified by law.
Law should be reserved for things that matter, not scoring political points in an election year. But that’s not how things work, so many laws passed in an election year are about political gain rather than policy change.
Such was the case with H.R. 3186, the Every Kid Outdoors Act. It would codify an existing program at the Department of Interior that provides 4th graders free entrance to National Parks around our nation. The bill passed 382-2, but I would have voted against it, because I do not believe that there is a need to codify this program into law. It’s something the agency already does, and has discretion to do based on existing law.
Here are a few more details that may lead you to the spot I found myself in observing what happened here…. Click here to read more.

Hi Friends,  
  
This week, I questioned President Trump's former campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, as a part of the ongoing joint investigation into the troubling actions of the DOJ and FBI leading up to the 2016 election.  
  
As you know, many claims have been made that the unverified dossier compiled by Christopher Steele and paid for by the DNC was not the basis of the Trump-Russia investigation led by former FBI Agent Peter Strzok.  
  
According to these folks, there were many other legitimate reasons to investigate then-presidential candidate Donald Trump – one of them being George Papadopoulos. But after my questioning with him under oath, I can say I find it very hard to believe this is the case. 
  
￼ 
  
Rep. Ratcliffe speaks with Dana Perino on Fox News about George Papadopoulos questioning 
  
What my questioning did confirm is that Papadopoulos was a 28-year-old policy adviser who'd been on the job a month at the time the Trump-Russia investigation was launched, and to this day he's never been to Russia nor met knowingly with anyone associated with the Russian government. 
  
This poses further questions that must be answered about why the FBI allegedly used him as the basis to launch the one of the highest profile investigations in recent times, and I’m committed to continuing my work on this important investigation until these questions are answered.
  
Tune into Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News Sunday at 10 a.m. to hear more about my questioning with George Papadopoulos.

Today is National Prescription Take Back Day
 
￼
Do you have old or unused prescriptions laying around the house?   Today, is National Prescription Take Back Day which is a safe, convenient, and responsible way to dispose of excess prescription drugs, while also raising awareness of the opioid crisis and the potential for abuse of medications.  In April, the DEA collected more than 470 tons of unused prescription drugs at nearly 6,000 collection sites nationwide. These medications, when not collected or properly disposed of, easily fuel the opioid crisis gripping our nation, and cause harm to family and friends.  Help fight the opioid epidemic and safely dispose of unused prescriptions.   CLICK HERE to find a take back site near you.   
Historic Legislation to Fight the Opioid Epidemic Signed Into Law
 
￼
The opioid crisis is wreaking havoc on communities in my district and across the country and Congress took action. This week, President Trump signed comprehensive legislation to combat the epidemic from all angles.   This is the most significant congressional effort against a single drug crisis in history.  H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act will help in our efforts to advance treatment and recovery initiatives, improve prevention, protect our communities, and fight illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl.   I’ve held numerous roundtables in the district asking first responders, law enforcement, and health care experts what they need from the federal government to help address this issue locally and this package contains many provisions that will address those issues.  Some of the highlights include:  -Expand access to treatment and recovery services, including establishing comprehensive opioid recovery centers -Improve data to identify and help at-risk patients and families -Give law enforcement tools to get dangerous drugs out of our communities -Improve access to federal resources for local communities -Crack down on foreign shipments of illicit drugs  Click here to learn more about this legislation and more action Congress is taking to fight the opioid epidemic.  


￼
This week, I visited The Pavilion Behavioral Health System in Champaign and met with the staff who are on the front lines of the opioid epidemic. The legislation signed into law will help to fight the epidemic from all angles, including increasing access to the treatment services people need to overcome addiction. 
 
￼

Everywhere I travel in the 13th district, I hear stories like Elisha's. Everyone has their own stories as to how opioids have affected them or their loved ones.

This historic legislation is an important step in our continued efforts to fight the opioid epidemic. While we are making progress, there is still much to be done and I will continue to fight back so we can ensure no family loses a loved one to addiction or an overdose.

10/27/18 10:17,We Must Restore Civility,"Share on: 
￼￼ 
 
￼
￼


Dear Friend,  America is the world’s greatest democracy and beacon of hope to millions across the globe.  Sadly, our democracy was attacked this week through attempts to terrorize and harm former Presidents Obama and Clinton, Vice President Biden, Secretary Clinton, the media, and other public figures. These heinous acts are reprehensible, they have no place in our country, and those responsible must be brought to justice.  I am grateful for the swift action of the Secret Service, FBI, and local law enforcement in intercepting these packages and thank them for their continued work and selfless efforts every day to guard against these threats and keep us safe.  This week’s events are also an important reminder to all of us.  Our common beliefs in liberty, justice, free speech, and the right to peaceably assemble bind us together as Americans and make our nation stronger.  We must restore civility in political discourse and remember there is far more that unites us than divides us.  A Truly Humbling Honor  On Tuesday, I was incredibly honored that the City of Maple Valley renamed 231st Street in Maple Valley, ""Dave Reichert Way."" It means so much that the citizens of Maple Valley have sought to recognize my work on their behalf over the last five decades, first in the King County Sheriff’s Office and today as their Member of Congress.   It is especially meaningful to me that Maple Valley chose to rename the street on which the King County Sheriff’s Office Hicks-Raburn Precinct resides.  Sergeant Sam Hicks and Detective Mike Raburn were my dearest friends and partners in the Sheriff’s Office.  Sadly, both men lost their lives in the line of duty while courageously serving their community. The precinct honors their memory, service, sacrifice, and friendship.  It has been my great privilege to serve the community alongside such incredible citizens and leaders, and I am truly humbled and appreciative of this exceptionally kind tribute. 
￼
Recognizing World Polio Day  On Wednesday, we paused to imagine a world without polio.  While the United States is polio-free, children around the world continue to suffer.  Here at home we must also continue to be vigilant, because with an increasingly mobile global citizenry, it only takes one traveler to reintroduce the disease to the U.S.  On World Polio Day, we recommit our efforts to once and for all put an end to this disease.  As Co-Chair of the Global Health Caucus, I have proudly championed efforts to fund polio eradication programs, and will continue to do so as Congress finalizes its work on the Fiscal Year 2019 spending bills.   Bipartisan Comprehensive Opioids Package Signed Into Law  Communities throughout Washington’s 8th District, the state, and nation continue to struggle with the growing opioid crisis.  Fortunately, there is new reason for hope as additional help from the federal government is now on its way to local communities and those on the front lines fighting this crisis every day.  The President signed into law comprehensive opioid legislation to combat the crisis from all sides.  The law helps communities most in need, provides new tools for law enforcement to crack down on synthetic opioids, and helps stop the flow of drugs across our borders and into our communities.  I am proud the package also includes the STOP Act that I supported to end the shipment of opioids through the international mail system.  While we have more work to do, enactment of this opioids law is an important step forward, and we will not stop until we beat this crisis.  
￼
 TODAY - National Prescription Drug Take Back Day  One way that each of us can help combat the opioid crisis is through the safe disposal of unused prescription drugs to help prevent diversion into the wrong hands.  Today is the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. In April, during DEA’s last take back day, nationwide over 949,000 pounds of prescription drugs were collected – that is 474.5 tons of drugs taken out of communities, creating safer environments for all of us. Click HERE find a collection site near you to dispose of unwanted, unused, or expired prescription drugs. 
￼
 Major Water Infrastructure Legislation Becomes Law  This week, I was also glad to see America’s Water Infrastructure Act signed into law. This important legislation supports critical water infrastructure projects in Washington State. As a state that shares a border with the Pacific Ocean, our ports, inland waterways, locks, and dams must be continually held to the highest standards to protect Washingtonians. This law provides funding that could benefit local projects such as the Tacoma Harbor Navigation Project and the Seattle Harbor Deepening Project.  District Happenings   Saturday: Halloween Harvest Festival   Come out to the Halloween Harvest Festival and Les Gove Park Trunk-or-Treat! The event welcomes kids ages 2-10 and their families. There will be games, crafts, a photo booth, and Trunk-or-Treating around Les Gove Park's trail.   EVENT DETAILS:  When: Saturday, October 27, 2018, 2:00pm - 5:00pm Where: Auburn Community & Event Center, 910 9th Street SE, Auburn, WA  Wednesday: Trick or Treat in Ellensburg  Join the community for a safe, family-friendly Trick or Treat in Ellensburg! Vendors in Downtown Ellensburg will be providing candy and treats for costumed trick-or-treaters. Look for a sign in the windows of downtown businesses, which indicates participation.   EVENT DETAILS:  When: Wednesday, October 31, 3:00pm – 6:00pm Where: Downtown Ellensburg (Between 1st Ave & Main St. and 5th Ave & Pearl St.), WA  Thank you all for joining me for this week!  Sincerely,
Dave

10/27/18 10:10,"Together, We Can Stop Harmful Discharges","News from Congressman Brian Mast
￼ 
THE TORTURED COAST
￼ 
Lindsey - 
I introduced the Stop Harmful Discharges Act because the current management of Lake Okeechobee is putting special interests ahead of the health and human safety of the communities east and west of the lake. 
We cannot tolerate water managers continuing to keep an artificially high level of water on Lake Okeechobee that results in toxic discharges destroying our community and putting people's lives at risk.
The Stop Harmful Discharges Act makes public health and safety, including prevention of toxic cyanobacteria and the integrity of the Herbert Hoover Dike, the primary project purpose for the management of Lake Okeechobee. 
More than that, the bill ensures that clean water reaches Everglades National Park, the Florida Bay and the Caloosahatchee Watershed to help restore the natural habitat. It does all this without diminishing the importance of the stability of the Herbert Hoover Dike, water access for the Miccosukee and Seminole Tribes, or ongoing Everglades restoration projects. 
That's why, since we introduced the bill, we've been building widespread support from other Members of Congress, environmental groups like the Rivers Coalition and clean water advocates like Erin Brockovich. 
Together, we can finally force the Army Corps to prioritize the health and safety of our community. To learn more about the bill, watch our newest episode of the Tortured Coast here:

Working to Eliminate Veteran Suicide
The men and women in our armed forces provide an invaluable service to our nation; protecting us from danger and ensuring we can keep the freedoms we hold dear. Unfortunately, all too often when these same men and women return home from war or after separating from service, they feel left behind with nowhere to turn. As a Vietnam-era veteran, I saw many of the young men with whom I served return from overseas to protests and a nation that did not appear to want to welcome them home or appreciate the sacrifices they made to protect our freedoms while they were gone. While the climate for our returning servicemembers is fortunately not the same as it was in the 1960s and 1970s, too many of our veterans still feel there is nowhere to turn, and that suicide is their only option. I want to tell all our nation’s veterans: you are not alone, and suicide is not your only option.  
As Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs (HVAC), I promised to do everything possible to ensure our country takes care of those who served in our defense, and I will continue to follow through on this promise. Last month, HVAC held a hearing on the persistent and heartbreaking topic of veteran suicide. In a recently released report, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) stated that in 2016, approximately 20 veterans took their own lives every day, and sadly that number has not changed. As a physician and veteran, I believe it is extremely important to not only continue to raise awareness, but to seek out innovative solutions, partner with communities, and improve VA health practices to help veterans learn of other treatment options and services available if they are in need.  
Over the past several years, VA has increased funding and invested resources to address the high number of veteran suicides; and despite our efforts the amount of deaths has not decreased. In the recent HVAC hearing, the Committee reviewed the research released by VA to come up with a plan on ways to better expend resources to reverse this trend. One statistic I found completely staggering was 14 of the 20 veterans who committed suicide did not seek medical care from the VA. Why is that? Unfortunately, we cannot ask these veterans why they didn’t seek treatment or what they found lacking in VA health care; we can only work to reform the system and make it more accessible to those veterans in the most need. It is one thing to outline how a program should work, but for every veteran who is not properly referred for treatment, for every veteran who is not admitted due to a shortage of staff or beds, for every veteran who feels they have been ignored or dismissed, we run the risk of needlessly losing another veteran to suicide.  
The issue of veteran suicide is not a new problem, and it’s one I’ve worked on since I first arrived in Congress. Along with HVAC Ranking Member Tim Walz, I founded the Congressional Invisible Wounds Caucus, which seeks to prioritize the needs of servicemembers who are suffering from the invisible wounds of war, such as PTSD. Over the years, the caucus has been able to highlight several innovative approaches to treating veterans in crisis, but these statistics continue to show more needs to be done.
We need to target the cause of these suicides by identifying those at high risk; recognize the unique barriers that certain veteran populations face; and use that information to advance our approaches that offer the promise of preventing suicides among veterans. I, along with my colleagues, have worked tirelessly to follow through on our promises to veterans – to provide the best possible care our service men and women deserve. In 2007, VA launched the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL), a 24-7 toll-free phone line to connect veterans contemplating suicide or otherwise in crisis with qualified crisis responders. Unfortunately, there was mismanagement of the program and action was needed. In an effort to fix the problems plaguing the VCL, I supported the No Veterans Crisis Line Should Go Unanswered Act, a bill that was signed into law on November 28, 2016. Thanks to the implementation of this law and follow-up Committee hearings, VA has increased the number of VCL call centers from 2 to 3, increased the total number of VCL employees, and decreased the number of VCL calls that are transferred to a backup call center from a 30 percent rollover rate in 2016 to a .16 percent rollover rate to-date in 2018.
More recently, Congress and the Trump administration established key laws to improve VA’s mental health services. VA is now expanding mental health services to all separating servicemembers for 12 months following separation from the military, the time frame shown to be the highest-risk period for suicide among veterans. Thanks to the work of HVAC, veterans with Other-Than-Honorable discharges now have the ability to seek VA mental health services for conditions that possibly contributed to their unfavorable separation status, a critical lifeline for which they were not previously eligible.  
The past two years I have championed the VA MISSION Act, a transformational piece of legislation that I introduced and was signed into law on June 6, 2018. The VA MISSION Act will ensure veterans seeking VA care – including mental health and suicide prevention support – are able to access the care they need, when and where they need it.  Additionally, this law contains provisions that establish peer specialists in patient aligned care team settings to increase services for mental health, substance use disorder and behavioral health in a primary care setting. To meet the needs of veterans at-risk of suicide, VA has requested and Congress funded $8.6 billion for mental health care in fiscal year (FY) 2019, an increase of 5.8 percent over FY 2018. This reflects a trend of significant annual increases in VA mental health funding going back several years. We still have work ahead of us, but as Chairman of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I will continue to make caring for our veterans my highest priority.

WORKING TOGETHER TO FIGHT HUMAN TRAFFICKING
￼
Human trafficking is modern-day slavery, and we all need to work together to fight it. 
This week I met with local law enforcement leaders, community organizations, and advocates to discuss identifying, reporting, and preventing sex-trafficking.
I was grateful for the chance to hear about lessons learned, the barriers they face, and what more we can do to end this scourge.
Congress took action earlier this year by, passing the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), which was signed into law in April. It gives law enforcement new tools and makes it easier for states to crack down on websites that support and facilitate trafficking.
I look forward to continuing to work with these dedicated Hoosiers who make our community a better, safer place.
SIGNED INTO LAW: BIPARTISAN OPIOID BILL
￼
For too long, families and communities across the country have been devastated by the opioid epidemic. This week we took a big step toward ending this crisis.
H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, was just signed into law. This bipartisan, comprehensive legislation will provide critical tools and resources to help those on the front lines of this fight. 
￼
It will also build on the legacy of Dr. Todd Graham with provisions named in the Hoosier doctor’s honor.
Before he was tragically killed last year over an opioid prescription, Dr. Graham was dedicated to treating patients not only for their pain but for the underlying causes. That is why I worked to include this measure to advance the model of care he championed.
￼
I’m hopeful we can help end the opioid epidemic by improving access to non-opioid pain treatments and enabling doctors to better treat patients and prevent addiction.
The opioid epidemic is taking a terrible toll on our communities. This vital new law will help Hoosiers work together to prevent and treat addiction and assist in recovery. 
HEARING FROM HOOSIERS
I am inspired by the hardworking Hoosiers I meet around our community who truly make a difference in people’s lives. I’m grateful to work with them to find commonsense solutions for our communities.
Here is a little more about some of the great work I learned more about this week:
￼
Senator Todd Young and I met with Hoosiers who have benefited from a great program called Homes for Heroes that gives back to local heroes like first responders, servicemembers, veterans, teachers, and health care providers.
￼
Bailey’s Cabinets in North Judson is a family-owned business that creates jobs and keeps our economy moving. I got an inside look at how this local business is working to expand its capabilities and hire more hardworking Hoosiers.
￼
The services provided at Bella Vita Pregnancy Resource Center are life-changing to many Hoosier women and families.
￼
The Goshen community came together at the annual Ride to Remember to honor our fallen police, firefighters, and servicemembers who answered the call to serve. 
￼
While their children are being treated, Michiana parents can feel a sense of comfort and hope thanks to the wholehearted commitment of the Ronald McDonald House staff and volunteers. 
As always, it is a privilege to represent 2nd District Hoosiers in Congress.

10/27/18 9:43,Strengthening Social Security + Medicare,"￼ 


Hoosiers,

It has been only ten months since the House of Representatives passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but already our economy has seen a world of difference. 

Thanks to these historic cuts, Hoosier families in Indiana’s Ninth Congressional District have seen their tax bill decrease by an average of 13.3%, allowing them to keep more of their hard-earned money and send less of it to a wasteful Washington.

For businesses, consumer confidence is at its highest level in 18 years, meaning the large and small companies that support our communities are investing in their firms and in their employees. At least six million workers across the country have received bonuses, better benefits, or pay increases due to tax reform. Unemployment is at a 49-year low. Wages and paychecks are rising at the fastest rate in 9 years. 

As the good news from tax reform keeps adding up, things are looking especially optimistic for seniors. 

According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), payroll and individual income tax revenues increased by 4%, or $105 billion, largely reflecting increases in wages and salaries. Thanks to tax reform, the CBO expects wages to rise by $1.2 trillion. That means more money flowing into our programs on which seniors rely and which I fight for everyday – Medicare and Social Security.
 
Hoosier seniors who rely on Medicare and Social Security can feel confident that the tide is beginning to turn as tax reform lifts our economy and lifts solvency for these programs.  As more Americans get higher paying jobs and contribute more in payroll taxes, the solvency of these programs increases. 

In Congress, I’m honored to fight for our country’s seniors, who have paid into these programs for decades, and make sure our country is keeping our promises to them. Earlier this year, I received the ‘Guardian of Seniors’ Rights Award.’ Supporting legislation, like tax reform, that put our seniors first and ensure their financial and healthcare security, is always a priority of mine. 

For Hoosier families, businesses, seniors, employers, and job seekers, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act proves again that reducing taxes is one of the most effective ways to create better futures and opportunities for generations to come. 

Be of good cheer,
￼

Landmark opioid legislation signed into law



Dear Friend:  
Welcome to your weekly update. As always, you can learn more about these and other legislative issue at my website: upton.house.gov. 
Landmark opioid legislation signed into law 
On Wednesday, President Trump signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act into law. The new law represents the largest legislative effort to combat a single drug crisis in history.
This allows the United States Postal Service to scan packages for illicit opioids such as fentanyl, increases funding for comprehensive recovery centers, and allows Medicaid to cover more treatment options for patients struggling with addiction.
I am pleased the law includes two of my provisions, H.R. 5002, the ACE Research Act, which increases funding for research on new, non-addictive pain medications and H.R. 5800, the Medicaid IMD ADDITIONAL INFO Act.  
On Thursday, I joined local lawmakers in Benton Harbor for an opioid town hall to discuss the resources available for those battling opioid addiction. 
National Prescription Drug Take Back Day 
￼
As part of my ongoing efforts to combat the opioid epidemic in Michigan, I wanted to raise awareness of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s Prescription Drug Take Back Day to provide citizens with the opportunity to safely get rid of excess drugs, helping to prevent the possibility of any accidental overdoses or abuse by others. 
Drop off your old medication in a safe and convenient way today from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 pm. To find the closest site near you, please visit: https://takebackday.dea.gov/

Opportunity Zones can spur economic opportunity for all
Opportunity Zones are a new bipartisan community development program established under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to encourage long-term investments in low-income urban and rural communities nationwide by providing investors with tax incentives. 
This means, there are trillions of dollars of capital unlocked for investment where demand is high and talent is readily available in neighborhoods throughout Michigan – from Detroit to St. Joseph. 
I am pleased to partner with Maurice Jones, president and CEO of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) to promote this game-changing tax program that can spur opportunity for all.

Caravan 
On October 12, a migrant caravan left Honduras with the stated intention of entering the United States.These caravans have been an issue for years, and have increased in size recently due to lax immigration policies. Our country has some of the most generous asylum laws in the world. We have diplomats and consular officers posted around the world to assist those who face violence and persecution find safety. Despite the ease and generosity of our established process, the members of these caravans have decided to enter the country by whatever means necessary, even illegally crossing the border.
As this caravan makes its way through Mexico, it will probably increase in size. It is incredibly difficult to gather intelligence on the caravan; it is loosely organized, moving, and in a constant state of chaos. While knowing the makeup of the caravan is hard to do, reports indicate that individuals from countries other than South America are traveling as well making this a very concerning situation.
President Trump has already authorized additional troop deployments to the border. I fully support his decision to use the military to act as a stopgap for personnel shortages in the border patrol. When the caravan reaches our borders, it will be met by American law enforcement. This whole situation highlights the need to secure our Southern border. Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy recently introduced a bill, H.R. 7059, that would fully fund border wall construction. Building the wall will provide an unparalleled return on investment in terms of national security.
FAQ (What folks have been calling/texting my office about this week)
Q: I've been hearing on the news that there are pipe bombs being found in the mailboxes of prominent politicians, what are your thoughts on this?  A: This sort of action is condemnable no matter what the motives are or if the device was created with the intention to detonate or scare. This crime goes against all our values as Americans and the perpetrator(s) should be charged and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. As a former bomb disposal technician I know firsthand the training and resources available to our bomb squads and I have the utmost respect for what they do. I expect that our law enforcement will conduct a rigorous investigation into these explosive devices with the assistance of our mom techs. I've also done a few interviews on this topic this week so you might want to skim the ""In the News"" section of this newsletter to hear more of my thoughts on this.

Over the past few days, various suspicious packages containing bombs were found targeting certain public officials and former lawmakers. Congressman Rick Crawford (R-AR) and Congressmen John Delaney (D-MD) have condemned the acts of terrorism and discuss whether the divisiveness leading up to midterms played a key role in these attacks.

U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Ark., knows a thing or two about bombs and the harm they can do.Decades ago, he served as an explosive ordnance disposal technician in the Army. ""I'm a second-generation bomb tech. My dad was a bomb tech, too,"" the Republican from Jonesboro said.From 1985-88 he was assigned to the 56th Ordnance Detachment in Fort Indiantown Gap, Pa. In that role, he dealt with his share of suspicious packages.

President Trump Signs Major Opioid Package Into Law
This week President Trump signed H.R. 6, the bipartisan opioid package into law. This bill will help expand access to treatment, improve prevention programs, and give law enforcement the tools they need. H.R. 6 is a substantial step in the right direction in fighting this epidemic. 
We were proud that H.R. 6 includes 4 of our bills: 
·         POWER Act (HR 5176) helps reduce repeat overdoses 
·         ALTO Act (HR 5197) encourages alternative pain treatment
·         Emmett's Law (HR 5695) improves info sharing between providers & families
·         AIDD Act (HR 5628) increases access to safe Rx disposal

McKinley Talks Agriculture, Rural Water, Healthcare Issues
This past week we have traveled across the district to discuss agriculture issues, rural water issues, and several others. We met with members of the Preston County Growers Co-op and Masontown City Officials, and spoke at an economic development conference in Wheeling.  
We also had the chance to host three round tables in the district this week. Two were held in Preston County to discuss agriculture and rural water issues, while the third was spent at Ruby Hospital in Morgantown to review new updates and talk to providers at the facility. As the husband of a critical care nurse, I appreciate the vital role doctors and nurses play in the delivery of care.

McKinley Introduces Pre-Apprenticeship Bill 
Many students today want to follow an apprentice-based route, but not all are afforded the opportunity to learn applicable skills. West Virginia deserves a well-trained workforce to help build our future, and apprenticeships are critical to our success. Rep. Norcross and I recently introduced the PATH Act to support pre-apprenticeship programs that help train underrepresented individuals. This is an important step to help close the skills gap, and I am glad to be a part of it.   Click here to read more

The Washington Rundown 
There are just 10 days left until Election Day- do you have a plan to vote? 
This week, federal authorities made an arrest in connection with 12 explosive devices sent to prominent current and former government officials and outspoken political activists.  Devices were addressed to former President Barack Obama, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, actor Robert De Niro, CNN television offices, and others.  Meanwhile, the White House is considering taking executive actions to block men and women, many with small children, from seeking asylum at the U.S. border.  The White House is also preparing to deploy as many as 1,000 unnecessary U.S. troops to the southern border in a costly exercise with no evidence of effectiveness.  This week, President Trump claimed he will protect people with pre-existing conditions; however, his actions say otherwise.  With the support of the Trump Department of Justice, Republicans continue to pursue a lawsuit in federal court attempting to strike down the Affordable Care Act’s protections for the 130 million people with pre-existing conditions, including millions of North Carolinians.  
Local Students Attend Service Academy Day 
Students, parents, and educators from across North Carolina's First Congressional District attended Congressman Butterfield's Service Academy Day in Durham last weekend to learn about the nation's military academies.   
￼ 
Each year, Congressman Butterfield has the honor of nominating a limited number of young people from North Carolina’s First District for appointment to the following U.S. Military Service Academies: the U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Military Academy (West Point), and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. 
Interested students who meet the eligibility requirements should send their completed application packet to Congressman Butterfield’s Durham office by November 15, 2018.

Butterfield Joins Community to Remember Dr. Brenda Armstrong 
￼  Photo from The Duke Chronicle | Dr. Brenda Armstrong examining a patient. Oct. 21, 1992 | Photo by Jason Laughlin 
On Tuesday, Congressman Butterfield joined the community in celebrating the life of prominent physician and Duke University School of Medicine professor, Dr. Brenda Armstrong.  Dr. Armstrong died on October 7 at the age of 69.
Dr. Brenda Armstrong was a native of Rocky Mount and was a world renowned doctor at Duke University, where she worked for more than 20 years.  Dr. Armstrong was the second Black woman to become a board-certified pediatric cardiologist in the United States.  She was among the first black students to attend Duke University in the 1960s. 
Congressman Butterfield spoke at Dr. Armstrong's memorial service on Tuesday, stating in part: 
""I was honored to have known Dr. Brenda Estelle Armstrong since we were toddlers.  Our parents were friends.  Our mothers were founders of the Wilson-Rocky Mount-Tarboro Chapter of Links, Inc.   Brenda’s father was the President of the National Medical Association and Secretary-Treasurer of the Old North State Medical Society. 
""We honor the life and work of a great American.  Brenda’s parents would have been very proud.   Thank you, Brenda Estelle Armstrong.  A life well-lived.""

On my weekly ""Capitol Hill Report,"" I spoke with Brian Fancher of KLMJ Radio in Hampton and Seth Boyes of the Dickinson County News about the Farm Bill, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and border security.
Q&A: Elections Matter
Q. What is fundamental to our system of self-government? Q. What is Congress doing to protect the integrity of  U.S. elections? 
Quick Links
Opioid overdose deaths are preventable, yet there are still more than 100 every day. It's a complicated problem that requires creative, comprehensive and collaborative solutions. That's why I'm encouraging Iowans to participate in the 16th National Prescription Drug Take Back Day TODAY, Saturday, October 27, 2018. Drug Take Back programs are an important piece of the puzzle and serve as a way for everyone to help reduce the devastating impacts of the opioid crisis. You can learn more about National Take Back Day or find a collection site near you here. 
The 2018 farm bill is at a standstill in conference committee. My payment limit amendment, which passed with broad support in the Senate farm bill, would close the ‘actively engaged’ loophole that allows people who don’t work on farms to get substantial subsidies at taxpayers’ expense. I urge my colleagues on the conference committee to keep the purpose of the farm bill at the forefront of their decision-making and to close current farm bill loopholes that cripple young, beginning and small farmers while rewarding those who don’t need assistance.
Senator Mike Lee of Utah and I wrote a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging the Trump administration to adopt a safe third country agreement with Mexico similar to an existing agreement between the United States and Canada. Safe third country agreements require migrants seeking asylum to make their claim in the first country of arrival rather than passing through to another country. Entering into a safe third country agreement with Mexico would send a message to our partners across Central America that they too must share the burden of unsanctioned mass migration. 
Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois and I wrote an op-ed about our proposal to lower prescription drug costs. It is supported by 76 percent of Americans as well as Democratic and Republican senators, the AARP, doctors, hospitals, insurance companies and the Administration, and would require pharmaceutical companies to disclose list prices for their medications in direct-to-consumer television advertisements. It would also boost competition and help Americans struggling with high and skyrocketing drug costs. 
When a well-meaning citizen comes forward with information relevant to the Senate Judiciary Committee’s work, I take it seriously. But in the heat of partisan moments, some people do try to knowingly mislead the Committee, redirecting resources away from important work. That's why I referred Julie Swetnick and her attorney, Michael Avenatti, to the Justice Department for criminal investigation relating to a potential conspiracy to provide materially false statements to Congress. Among other issues, they contradicted their own allegations regarding Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in news reports. I don’t take lightly making a referral of this nature, but ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future.
The Air Force recently suspended it’s purchasing of $1,280 cups after an inquiry I sent to Secretary of the Air Force Dr. Heather Wilson. Secretary Wilson’s response letter was encouraging, but left important questions unanswered, which is why I sent a follow up letter seeking additional answers. I applaud the efforts by the Airmen at the base who noticed wasteful spending and took it upon themselves to come up with a better solution; however, I remain concerned that there are not adequate protocols in place to prevent further reckless spending.

Dear Friends,

Today is Arkansas Drug Take Back Day, and we must continue working together to combat the current prescription drug and opioid crisis. Every ten months, overdoses kill as many Americans as in the 15 years of the Vietnam War. This is an absolute tragedy. But there's hope, and help is on the way. 

Drug Take Back Day
￼
At the University of Arkansas Little Rock Police Department, one of the collection sites, I talk about local and national wins for Arkansans. Listen here. Our state received $13 million in grants from our recent $1 billion in Congressionally approved funds to help counter the opioid crisis. I strongly supported these efforts in Congress. It’s critical that we take steps like turning in our unused medications and do our part to help. 

I am grateful for the statewide leadership in combating the epidemic by Governor Hutchinson, Lieutenant Governor Griffin, Attorney General Rutledge, and State Drug Director Kirk Lane. For more information on Arkansas collection sites and recovery centers, along with how you can help, click here.

Giving Hope to Arkansas Families
￼
On Wednesday, we marked our successful progress with the president signing into law a comprehensive opioid bill that includes nearly 60 individual pieces of legislation we passed in the House this year with my support. We are taking significant steps to provide Arkansans and Americans with the help they need. Read more here. 

Visiting North Little Rock's Union Pacific 
￼ 
Brandon and Kyle (pictured above) showed me around Union Pacific Railroad (UP) and Jenks Shop in North Little Rock. Did you know that every 10 years or 1,000,000 miles, UP completely overhauls their trains? They took me through the process their trains go through to keep their machinery up to their high standards.

I was also proud to visit the hardworking, incredibly skilled team at the Jenks Shop while I was there. This is an important locomotive shop on the UP system. It was great to see fresh paint on the 4141 train, which is named after our 41st President, George H.W. Bush. 

Preserving the Natural State
￼
As an avid outdoorsman, I was delighted to join Ray Tucker and Bryan Hendricks' show, Arkansas Outdoors on 103.7 the Buzz, to discuss Congressional efforts to promote wildlife conservation in the Natural State. I'm taking action to preserve and expand the Flatside Wilderness, protect the long-term health of our state's iconic Buffalo National River, and establish a lasting fund to reduce the maintenance back log at the National Park Service. Listen here. 

Serving our Communities
￼
I enjoyed being a part of Arkansas AmeriCorps' Opening Ceremony this week. It's always good to be with my dear friend, Sanford Tollette, and the Pfeiffer Kiwanis Camp kids. The room was full of excited young Arkansans ready to start or continue their national service through the various AmeriCorps programs in our state. Serving others is the key to building strong communities. I'm wishing those who took their oath of service best wishes on their new adventures.

Thank you for taking time to keep up with the work I'm doing on your behalf. If I can be any assistance to you or your family, please reach out to my office at (501) 324-5941 or Hill.House.Gov. 

Sincerely,

October 26, 2018 
Dear Friends, 
Over 250,000 individuals will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year and 11% of those cases will be in women younger than 45. October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month and I invite you to join me for a panel discussion on the emotional and mental health impacts related to breast cancer. 
￼
Many women report feelings of shock, distress, anxiety and depression during and after treatment. Challenges associated with cancer go beyond the diagnosis and are unique to each patient. Especially for underserved communities, access to affordable care is often out of reach. It's important to remember that you are not alone. 
We will hear from:  
	•	Ali Kent, survivor and board member of Bay Area Young Survivors
	•	Sasha Merritt, tattoo artist at Dragonfly Ink Cosmetic & Custom Tattoo 
	•	Dr. Dianne Shumay, Director of Psycho-Oncology at UCSF
	•	Dr. Amie Lee, Director of Clinical Operations at ZSFG Avon Breast Imaging
	•	Christy Oliger, Senior Vice President BioOncology at Genentech  
Following the panel, there will be an opportunity for audience members to ask questions and share their own experiences. Please sign up here. 
  
You Are Not Alone - Breast Cancer Awareness Month  Monday, October 29, 2018 7:00 p.m.-8:30 p.m. Multi-Use Building, Rm 140 City College San Francisco 50 Phelan Avenue San Francisco, CA 94112 
REGISTER HERE!
  
We are strengthened when we discuss our mental well-being and support one another during difficult times. In addition to the panel, there will be a wide range of information available on support groups, current research, affordable healthcare services, apps, resources for veterans, and more. Please make sure you don’t miss out on this opportunity to learn about local programs. 
I look forward to seeing you October 29th.

10/26/18 21:17,fighting back on this trade war,"￼
""It hurts American manufacturers like us because we're paying a premium and it gives an advantage to all our global competitors.""  ""Although we're getting offered a band aid package for one year, we would much prefer free trade.""  ""What I can tell you is that if we don't get immediate relief, we can be shut down in the next 20 to 30 days.""  That's what Missouri businesses and farmers have to say about the Administration's trade war.
These tariffs and trade policies have had a crippling effect on Missouri manufacturing and agriculture, putting some companies in an endless loop of red tape and maybe even forcing some to shutter completely -- and I won't stand for it.
We're looking at billions of dollars of losses in Missouri because of this trade war. It's already cost Missouri jobs and hurt our farmers and ranchers -- I just can't understand why we'd dramatically escalate it.   But instead of reversing these policies that hurt American consumers and small businesses, the Administration is selling them out, most recently with another $200 BILLION in tariffs on Chinese goods. 
Farmers are getting bailouts instead of access to markets, manufacturers just can't get an answer on applications for exclusions on the products they make (right here in America).
Our manufacturers can outcompete anyone, but right now they're just not getting the level playing field they need to do it.
That's why I wrote to our U.S. Trade Ambassador, asking him why his office is ""causing severe damage without providing any opportunity to mitigate the unnecessary economic harm,"" and it's why I've been holding the Administration's feet to the fire to get answers for Missouri producers.
Missouri farmers and workers deserve better than uncertainty and lost jobs. And I won't stop fighting for them. Claire

10/26/18 21:03,(no subject),"Lindsey – We are facing an alarming public health emergency. The opioid epidemic is impacting thousands of communities and too many Americans have lost their lives from opioid overdoses.

As a doctor, I’ve seen the heartbreaking toll this has taken on so many families. But tomorrow, you can help do something about it. 

Saturday is National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day – please see where you can drop off your unused or expired prescriptions at https://bera.house.gov/drugdropoff

It is likely that a child, friend, or family member could stumble onto old or expired drugs in your medicine cabinet. Tomorrow, you can help save lives by disposing of them safely.

Please feel free to forward this message to anyone you know so they can take part. 

Be well,

Week in Review
Today, it was reported the U.S. economy grew at a 3.5% pace in the third quarter, which was much faster then the expected rate. Last week we saw the U.S. was announced as the world's most competitive economy. This news continues to show the progress this country is making and these numbers show it is only up from here!


￼


On Wednesday, the President signed historic legislation to combat the opioid crisis in our country. This comprehensive legislative package includes nearly 60 individual pieces of legislation, which will all provide more resources to fight the ongoing epidemic, and to help treat opioid addictions. 

￼

Our contribution to the package of 60 bills is H.R. 4841 the Standardizing Electronic Prior Authorization for Safe Prescribing Act of 2018. This will establish an electronic standard for prior authorizations in Medicare. The legislation will help move pharmacies and doctors away from faxing the prior authorization forms and encourage them to communicate in real time through electronic means.
The bill consists of two main ideas: to prevent the delays caused by the current system of non-electronic/real time prior authorization requests so that Medicare patients receive prescriptions as soon as possible, and by making the process electronic, there will be an improved oversight in the system to ensure patients are only receiving approved medications. 
National Prescription Drug Drop Off Day
 On Saturday, October 27th the DEA will be hosting a 'Prescription Drug Drop Off Day' at thousands of locations across the country. This day is used to ask Americans to safely dispose of unused medications. At the last National Take Back Day, the DEA collected 900,000 pounds of prescription drugs.   Locations include local police stations, retail pharmacies, and communities. To find a location near you in AZ-06, visit TakeBackDay.DEA.Gov.  
￼
Visiting with Ciox Health
￼
My team and I had the opportunity to visit Ciox Health this week to discuss the work they are doing to ensure veterans’ health records are shared securely and timely across the VA health system. Stakeholders in the public- and private-sector, including Ciox, have worked hard over the last decade to improve the framework for sharing and managing healthcare information. However, there are still roadblocks that prevent patient records from being transmitted easily without compromising patient privacy and safety, and without incurring tremendous costs to the healthcare system.   As a member of the bi-partisan Healthcare Innovation Caucus, I will continue to advocate for innovations ito improve care for patients. Learn more about the Healthcare Innovation Caucus here: https://kelly.house.gov/press-release/house-leaders-launch-bipartisan-health-care-innovation-caucus. 
 
Speaking to AZ Real Estate Brokers 
￼

 Thank you to the Phoenix Chapter of Institute and Real Estate Management (IREM) for inviting me to come speak to a group of brokers about Tax Reform and real estate in Arizona. The discussion involved how the recent tax cuts passed in the House will benefit Arizonans, how it will reduce the loopholes in the previous tax code, and how it has strengthened our economy over the last 9 months. 
 Smart City Breakfast Panel
 ￼
Thank you to Valley Partnership for inviting me to moderate a panel discussing Smart Cities in Scottsdale. We discussed how technology will play a role in Arizona's infrastructure, the regulatory landscape, and what role the federal government plays in assisting states in modernizing their state infrastructure. 
Legislative Update
￼

Recently the Ways and Means Committee launched an investigation into the rising death rates among mothers during and after childbirth. 

Data from the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health has shown that there has been an increase in maternal mortality post-childbirth in the last 30 years. The committee is taking action to determine why maternal mortality is now on the rise and is inquiring on how federal agencies, states, and hospitals can help to address this issue. 

Across the country, maternal mortality review committees have found that 63 percent of pregnancy-related deaths could have been prevented. Many causes include dangerously high blood pressure or significant blood loss. Both of these causes can be monitored and mitigated.

Border Security Update

The Secretary of Defense has authorized as many as 800 U.S. soldiers to be dispatched to the US-Mexico border in response to the incoming Central American caravan of migrants currently located in Mexico. These troops will join the 2,100 National Guard soldiers already conducting border operations. The additional troops will act to provide mission-enhancing capabilities to assist with ongoing U.S. Customs and Border Protection initiatives. This support will enhance the Department of Homeland Security's ability to enforce it's overall border security mission.



President Trump Signs the Music Modernization Act
Earlier this month President Trump signed the Music Modernization Act which updates licensing and royalty laws to benefit music creators and enable them to more easily collect the royalties due to them. I had the pleasure of voting in favor of this bipartisan legislation and was excited to see the President sign it into law in the Roosevelt Room of the White House.
This week, I met with local musicians and members of the Recording Academy to discuss the success of the Music Modernization Act, and additional ways to benefit the arts and musicians. I look forward to building upon the success of the Music Modernization Act as we continue working in Congress to reduce regulation and grow our nation’s economy.

Congressman Marchant Receives NRF’s Hero of Main Street Award
This week I was honored to receive the National Retail Federation’s Hero of Main Street Award. This award recognizes legislators who support the countless retailers that make up Main Street businesses across the United States. Legislation such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduces taxes and spurs economic growth through investment and increased wages, has a tremendous effect on these companies and their employees. I will always be committed to supporting the American middle class through these policies and I look forward to continuing the tremendous progress we have made this year.

Beware of Identity Theft Scams
￼  Each week my office receives dozens of calls and letters from constituents who have been targeted for, or have become victims of, identity theft. Criminals are targeting vulnerable individuals, such as senior citizens, with schemes to defraud them of money and earned resources. These criminals often call disguised as the IRS, Social Security Administration, and even your local police chief.   Recently the Fort Worth Star-Telegram published an account of a scammer attempting to impersonate Bedford Police Chief Jeff Gibson on the phone.  Earlier this month the United States Social Security Administration released a FRAUD ADVISORY, warning citizens of another phone scam where an individual identifying themselves as the Social Security Administration's Inspector General calls stating social security numbers are in danger of being deleted.  If you believe you are being targeted for identity theft, or believe you have become a victim, please contact your local police department immediately. Additionally, you can visit the Federal Trade Commission's website to report identity theft at www.identitytheft.gov

Super Typhoon Yutu strikes;
Trump approves disaster declaration

When natural disaster strikes, as happened again this week with Super Typhoon Yutu, the role of the congressional office is to make sure that all federal resources reach the Marianas fast. We also do everything we can to keep people informed about restoration of services, where to get assistance, and any other news that we think will help. Find our regular updates on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and at sablan.house.gov. Your congressional office on Saipan is now open. 

Typhoon Yutu Update - October 26, 2018

The Federal Emergency Management Agency briefed the congressional office at 4:00 pm EST today and reports the following --

Request for Disaster Declaration
CNMI Governor Ralph Torres submitted a formal request for expedited Major Disaster Declaration for the Northern Mariana Islands as a result of Super Typhoon Yutu during the period of October 24, 2018 and continuing. The Governor has asked for Individual Assistance & Public Assistance, including direct Federal assistance for Tinian, Saipan, Rota, Agrihan, Alamagan, and Pagan, and Hazard Mitigation for the Commonwealth.

Food, Water and Shelter: 17 shelters are open serving 981 occupants across all three islands. Stores, restaurants, laundromats reopening. CUC to set up water stations for residents within next 24 hours while well systems are being repaired. FEMA Region IX looking into short and long term housing for survivors. 14 generators at water wells, left in place by FEMA after Typhoon Soudelor are not working, but should supply 80 percent of Saipan water needs, once operational. 

Public Health: Health assessments underway in Saipan, Tinian. No current requests for patient evacuation. HHS to assess med center in San Antonio. CHC, Tinian health center running on generator power. Dialysis centers open. No reported damage to Rota Health Center. 

Energy: Gas stations reopening. All 3 islands without CUC power. Saipan has generator fuel, but distribution challenging due to road debris. On Tinian, all feeders down; power plant compromised; distribution system completely destroyed; island relying on generators. 

Communications: Banks, ATMs reopening. Significant damage to cell towers throughout islands; cell reception intermittent. 

Transportation: Major and most secondary roads are accessible. Saipan and Tinian ports remain closed. Saipan International Airport is restricted to military flights only with commercial outbound flights expected to begin Sunday, October 28. There will be no inbound flights until further notice. 

Safety & Security: Lodging identified for 300-400 emergency responders. Government offices, schools closed until further notice. 
 
 

More CIP for water possible

The Marianas could see twice as much funding for water projects thanks to the America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, signed into law by President Trump on Tuesday. The new law doubles the authorization for the Safe Drinking Water Act from the current $1 billion to $1.95 billion in 2021. This money is why CUC can now report all households on Saipan have 24-hour water. When I came into office, the Marianas only received $286,000 from the Safe Drinking Water Act. But in 2010 I began increasing the insular area set-aside from 0.33 to 1.5 percent. The result, an average of $3.5 million annually or $34 million in total. A similar change in the set-aside formula for the Clean Water Act has meant another $37 million. The two programs work together. One brings water into the home. The other helps make sure that disposal is environmentally sound. The new law also cancels a proposed deauthorization of $20 million for Saipan water infrastructure, from the 2007 Water Resources Act. The Army Corps sought the deauthorization for this and hundreds of other projects nationwide, but Congress pushed back. Keeping the $20 million authorization means we can keep working for that funding in the next Congress. We need the money: the Environmental Protection Agency estimates $198.4 million is needed in the Marianas to provide potable water to all households and protect our environment. 
 

Scott agrees Wagner-Peyser

Rep. Robert C. Scott (D-Virginia), Ranking Member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce has committed to working with me to make the Marianas eligible for Wagner-Peyser assistance, when Congress takes up reauthorization of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. Scott is expected to chair the Committee, if Democrats regain the majority of the U.S. House of Representatives in January. And WIOA is up for reauthorization in the next Congress. During the last reauthorization in 2013, I worked to make the Marianas eligible for Wagner-Peyser. The Republican majority, however, was focused on shrinking the number of employment service grants and would not add American Samoa or the Marianas to Wagner-Peyser. Nevertheless, overall funding for all programs increased by 17 percent. In 2016, the Marianas received $2.54 million and currently the Marianas has been awarded $1.43 million for dislocated workers and grants for $1.43 million and $564,079 for dislocated youth to receive job training and placement assistance. Wagner-Peyser would add about $300,000 to that amount. I also increased the fee that employers pay for each CW permit in my Northern Mariana Islands Economic Expansion Act in 2017. That increase adds another $600,000 or so for training U.S. workers. 
 
 

Bigeye quota sale okayed

The Northern Mariana Islands may again this year sell 1,000 metric tons of its bigeye tuna quota to U.S. longline fishing vessels based in Hawai’i. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration made the announcement this week. Marianas fishing vessels are given a quota of 2,000 metric tons of bigeye annually to take from around our islands. Since 2014, however, the Marianas government has been allowed to sell half that limit to U.S. interests fishing in other waters. The sale has been worth about $250,000, depending on the current price of bigeye. Proceeds from the sale fund fisheries development projects that are included in the Marianas Marine Conservation Plan. In June, NOAA changed the status of bigeye populations in the Pacific Islands from “subject to overfishing” to “not subject to overfishing.” Overfishing means that the stock is being harvested too quickly to allow for maximum sustainable yield. 
 

 

100% score with AAUW Action

Thanks to the American Association of University Women Action Fund for giving me a score of 100% for work in the 115th Congress. The AAUW’s Congressional Voting Record reflects my stand on issues that are a priority for women and families, including equal pay. Among legislation that AAUW scored was the Paycheck Fairness Act, H.R. 1869, which strengthens penalties for equal pay violations and creates an award for employers who eliminate pay discrepancies between men and women. Women in the United States are typically paid 80 cents for every dollar paid to men. The bill also sets up a grant program to train women in the negotiation skills needed to get pay equity. The Paycheck Fairness Act was referred to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, where I am a member. But Republican leadership chose not to help women. It is my hope that this will change in the next Congress with Democrats in charge of the Committee. 
 
 

Northern Mariana Islands congressional staff help hundreds of constituents with immigration problems. To keep up-to-date, we regularly attend the Congressional Conference hosted by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Held at the USCIS California Service Center, the Conference also gives us the opportunity to build face-to-face relationships with the Service Center personnel who process the CW and H2B petitions filed by Northern Marianas employers. Ms. Frances Diaz of the Washington congressional office attended this year’s conference.

October 26, 2018 
On Tuesday I had the honor of again joining the president to bring more water to the Central Valley. In the Oval Office ceremony, he signed into law my New WATER Act as part of America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (WRDA), which authorizes financing of new water storage projects. I’ve been fighting since day one in Washington to build more water storage for our farmers and neighbors at lower costs. This is a huge accomplishment for the Valley years in the making, allowing proposed projects to be built. We can now celebrate future generations having access to the water they need and deserve. 
My New WATER Act provides financing for water projects throughout the western United States, including new reservoirs, below ground storage projects, recycling and desalination projects. For Sites Reservoir alone, this policy will save hundreds of millions of dollars in construction costs and significantly lower prices for water users. In California and across the west, this means billions of dollars saved as we build the necessary infrastructure to capture the plentiful run-off from the Sierras which can be used to irrigate the Valley and save for the dry years. During the rains of 2017, we saw how our inadequate storage quickly filled reservoirs, wasting water, and led to flooding and levee breaches – issues I secured language for in WRDA. 
￼  
Additionally, the WRDA bill enhances long-delayed and badly needed local flood protection for more than 50,000 Valley residents. Recently in Manteca, I hosted the highest ranking civilian responsible for water infrastructure in the Army Corps of Engineers, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Rickey “R.D.” James – who joined us at the White House on Tuesday – to ensure quick completion of ongoing construction and prioritization of the projects in the bill. The Army Corps is responsible for managing these projects and R.D. James saw firsthand how critical water infrastructure is in Stanislaus and San Joaquin County, including the levees near Manteca that were breached in 2017. These levees are currently being restored with federal funding. To build on these infrastructure improvements, I also inserted language into WRDA that makes additional levee authorizations in San Joaquin County eligible for federal resources to protect our communities, and I included language to expedite the feasibility study of the Mossdale Tract, or Reclamation District 17, which includes the French Camp veterans treatment facility. 
For more information about what I’m doing to secure water storage for the Central Valley and fight the Sacramento water grab, visit Denham.house.gov/water. 
Fighting the homelessness crisis Our Central Valley community is facing an ongoing homelessness crisis with over 130,000 homeless estimated in California, and I’ve been taking it on in Congress with legislation that will directly help groups here at home who are working to fight homelessness locally. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development recently announced over $330,000 in housing assistance for persons with disabilities and over $115,000 in rental assistance for homeless veterans in San Joaquin County, and yesterday, I hosted a follow-up homelessness roundtable meeting at H.O.S.T. (Helping Others Sleep Tonight) House in Patterson to discuss their self-sufficiency education program. H.O.S.T House has help move individuals off the streets and onto their feet. They approach everyone for what they are, unique individuals with different behavioral challenges. The City of Patterson and I honored their achievements by presenting a proclamation stating their contribution to our community.  
￼  
Local businesses contributing to our national security Yesterday I brought U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Thomas Moore to Newman Flange and Fitting to discuss the Central Valley’s important role in shipbuilding for the U.S. Navy and the jobs locally owned companies provide for communities across the Valley. Our Central Valley economy is on the rise thanks to pro-growth policies, and our local businesses are providing good jobs for our skilled workers and supporting our military. Vice Admiral Moore oversees our national workforce that develops, delivers and maintains the Navy’s fleet. It was his first time to the Valley and to Newman Flange and Fitting – a locally owned, American company that produces a variety of products for U.S. Navy aircraft carriers. Because of companies like this, the United States is the only country that has the ability to build and maintain a large fleet of world-class carriers. 
The number of skilled-labor jobs available in the Central Valley is growing, due in large part to a strong economy and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Since I took office in 2011, we have seen an unprecedented drop in unemployment in the Central Valley. In January 2011, Stanislaus and San Joaquin Counties has an unemployment rate of 18 and 18.1 percent, respectively; today, those numbers are down to 5.3 and 5 percent. Additionally, median household income among the two counties has increased from an average $47,464.50 to $63,223 per year, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau reports.

Fear Will Not Stop Us


￼
Saluting Our Heroes
Once again, we salute heroic law enforcement officers and postal employees doing the dangerous work of intercepting any remaining mail bombs and bringing those responsible to justice. The goal of terrorists is to instill fear. We will not allow them to diminish our commitment to building a brighter future for communities across America. 
￼ 
I listened with great interest to the President’s remarks this week. Members of Congress all take an oath to support and defend the constitution and protect the American people, and that is our first responsibility. 
However, President Trump’s words regarding these attacks ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence.  Time and time again, the President has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and his actions: expressing support for the Congressman who body-slammed a reporter, the neo-Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville, his supporters at rallies who get violent with protestors, dictators around the world who murder their own citizens, and referring to the free press as the enemy of the people. Democrats will continue to fight For The People and will not let fear deter us from advocating for a better life for all Americans. 
Hunters Point Clean-Up 
At this critical point for the Hunters Point clean-up, I am proud to have fought in the Congress to secure an additional $60.4 million in federal funding above the President’s budget for excavation, resampling and rescanning of the base – on top of the $36 million in base clean-up funding I secured for the Shipyard in the 2018 omnibus funding bill. These funds will ensure that every area touched by Tetra Tech EC will be retested, and the health and safety of the Bayview-Hunters Point Community will be protected. 
Bayview-Hunters Point residents deserve our relentless commitment to an open, transparent clean-up that holds Tetra Tech EC accountable for its outrageous data manipulation and falsification. We must ensure that this breach of the public trust can never again happen, and provide proper oversight to ensure that the Navy fulfills its responsibility to thoroughly clean up the Shipyard.
In my time representing San Francisco in the U.S. Congress, it has been my honor to have secured over $1 billion for the clean-up of the Hunters Point Shipyard. Our community deserves to know that these investments are being made in a safe, smart and transparent manner, and to have all the resources and information they need to guarantee the health and safety of themselves and their families.

My office recently assisted a 501(c)(3) non-profit that was erroneously charged a $2,333.89 penalty for a late filing after the organization requested an extension from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). With an annual operating budget dependent on various grants and personal donations, this penalty would have posed a considerable hardship for them as they have been in the district for 37 years. My office requested a review by the IRS and consideration of a payment plan for the penalty. As a result, the IRS waived the $2,333.89 in penalties.

Here are a few things I thought you'd want to see: 
  
1. Strong Economic Growth 
  
￼ 
  
The U.S. economy grew at a rate of 3.5% in the third quarter, beating expectations once again. This clearly demonstrates that our economic agenda is working and getting results.

2. Fighting The Opioid Crisis 
  
￼ 
  
We've got to stop the spread of opioids through our communities in Georgia and across the country. It's time to tackle this epidemic head on, and the law President Trump signed this week gives states the necessary tools to see that mission through.

WRAPPING UP THIS OCTOBER WORK PERIOD...
 Earlier this week, President Trump signed comprehensive, bipartisan opioid legislation into law to address the opioid crisis in America – an important step in the right direction to end addiction to deadly illicit drugs. 
￼
Tomorrow is National Prescription Take Back Day and thousands of community sites around the country are participating in take-back events, allowing the public to safely dispose of unwanted medications. Please help us raise awareness of prescription drug abuse by disposing of unwanted, unused, and expired prescription drugs at a Georgia-12 collection site. To find a collection site near you, please visit https://takebackday.dea.gov/.
It has been a busy past two weeks. I attended the Downtown Statesboro Rotary Club Meeting. 
￼

It’s always great to see so many familiar faces and discuss some of my work on behalf of Georgia’s 12th district.
I had the opportunity to tour Ogeechee Technical College, where I heard about how they are partnering with the local business community to strengthen career and technical programs for young professionals in the area. 
￼

￼
The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, which President Trump recently signed into law, is having a significant impact right here in Georgia-12.
I visited Briggs and Stratton, where over 100 new jobs were announced earlier this year at their Statesboro plant. 
￼

Small businesses are continuing to flourish in our red-hot economy thanks to pro-growth, pro-American policies.
I also toured Viracon – a leading single-source architectural glass manufacturer that provides glass solutions for commercial buildings. 
￼

Thanks for showing me your operation and for your continued commitment to providing innovative products and reliable service.
I had a great visit at Walker Pharmacy and RJ Pope Menswear – two small businesses in the heart of Bulloch County.
￼

￼
We had great discussions about some of the challenges they face and how I can assist them.
At Vidalia High School, I stopped by a few classes to speak about my work for Georgia-12 and the importance of a quality education. 
￼

￼
As a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, I’m committed to ensuring our young people are prepared for the future—and the future is bright for these young scholars!   In Effingham County, I attended the 2018 Chamber of Commerce Business Summit Luncheon with my friend and colleague, Congressman Buddy Carter (GA-01).
￼

￼
We had a vibrant discussion about America’s economy, growing jobs, and the economic impact that the deepening of the Port of Savannah will have and is already having on the area.
In Hazlehurst, I visited Beasley Forest Products. 
￼

As the largest production sawmill in the United States and a leading manufacturer of quality matting products, Beasley is the largest employer in Jeff Davis County with 923 employees!
I also stopped by the Hazlehurst Rotary Club meeting to give an update on healthcare, tax reform 2.0, the 2018 Farm Bill, and my work on the House Education and Workforce Committee. 
￼

Thanks for having me!
I stopped by the Douglas Rotary and Exchange Club meetings to help celebrate the Exchange Club’s Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. 
￼

￼
Thank you to all of our brave first responders who constantly put their lives on the line for the safety of others.
I also stopped by the Carl Vinson VA Medical Center in Dublin to discuss their recent improvement to three stars - I will continue to work with the VA to ensure that we provide our veterans with the best possible care. 
￼
This Congress has been hard at work to pass meaningful legislation for our veterans, with over 20 signed into law and nearly 50 more passed in the House of Representatives. After serving our country, our veterans deserve the best, and I will continue to work tirelessly on their behalf.
Share your thoughts with me! You can email me ⇒  HERE, contact any of our offices or join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.

Tom at Finger Lakes Community Health in Geneva. 

￼
We had a wonderful time at the Steuben County Farm Bureau to celebrate their 100th Anniversary. We wish them many more years of advocacy for farmers in NY-23.







Dear Neighbor,
We care about ensuring that those in rural areas get the care they deserve.
Now, with the advancement of technology, rural health centers are able to connect with specialists across the country that are able to provide patients with high quality care without travelling to a larger hospital or healthcare center.   It’s called “telehealth” and it is a cost-effective and efficient way to deliver care, and we are proud supporters of this advancement in medical technology.
The bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act was signed into law and proved to be a major accomplishment for patients, their families and the healthcare community.
The act provides:
	•	$8.75 billion in funding for National Institutes of Health (NIH).
	•	Removes barriers in sharing and analyzing information to increase collaboration in research to fight dangerous diseases.
	•	Incentives the development of therapies for serious and rare diseases.
	•	Invests in research through increasing NIH funding
	•	Streamline the connections between scientific discovery and drug/device development.
We recently had the opportunity to sit down with medical professionals at Finger Lakes Community Health and had a hands on experience with the technology they use on patients.
As always, please reach out to any of our offices if you have questions or need assistance.
Until next time, 
Tom

NEWSLETTER-MN07: Updates

Detroit Lakes High School Social Studies teacher Tom Johnson
 
Dear Friends,
 
At a time when divisions between Americans appear so great, lawmakers must lead by example to bring folks together. We must promote civility through our actions and remember that it is in the nation’s best interest for us to work together to address the nation’s challenges. This week, I visited a high school American Government class in my hometown of Detroit Lakes where I enjoyed taking students’ questions and sharing my experience with them. Senator Klobuchar and I gave an update on the Farm Bill to folks at the American Crystal Sugar Company. We also toured Lakeshirts in Detroit Lakes and the Textron/Arctic Cat Facility in Thief River Falls. Local and county officials met with me at the Thief River Falls Airport to talk about future maintenance and expansion projects. The airport is increasingly being used to transport manufactured goods, making it a vital part of the community’s infrastructure. 
 
Sincerely,
￼ Congressman Collin C. Peterson
Minnesota 7th District
 
Detroit Lakes High School Visit
￼
 
I was excited to meet with Detroit Lakes High School Social Studies Teacher Tom Johnson and his students on Thursday morning to have a wide-ranged discussion. Students from Mr. Johnson’s American Government class wrote letters to me asking all sorts of questions and conveying important issues. After reading through their letters and speaking with Mr. Johnson, I decided to answer their questions in person. I spoke about how I became a Congressman and the duties that it entails. I am very thankful to Mr. Johnson and his class for making time for me and wish the best of luck to the students with their studies.
 
You can read an article about my visit in the Detroit Lakes Tribune.
 
Farm Bill Update at American Crystal Sugar Company
￼

Senator Amy Klobuchar and I visited American Crystal Sugar on Sunday to check in on the sugarbeet harvest and to give an update on the Farm Bill. We remain focused on enacting a five-year farm bill before the end of the year. Negotiations in the Conference Committee have been promising, but the fact is that the final bill will have to draw bipartisan support if we want to get it to the President’s desk. I will continue to work across the aisle to reach the agreements necessary to make that happen.
 
You can read more about this visit in this article from the Bemidji Pioneer.
 
Textron / Arctic Cat Tour
￼
 
I was glad to have Senator Amy Klobuchar and Republican Congressman Roger Marshall of Kansas’s First Congressional District join me at the Arctic Cat Facility in Thief River Falls on Monday. I enjoyed the presentation on the history of Textron and seeing the manufacturing of their Arctic Cat Snowmobiles, ATV’s, and Side by Sides in operation. Arctic Cat employs about 1,600 people in Minnesota, many of them in this facility in Thief River Falls.
 
Lakeshirts Tour in Detroit Lakes
￼
 
On Wednesday, Senator Klobuchar and I toured Lakeshirts in Detroit Lakes as part of the Detroit Lakes Chamber of Commerce’s Tour of Manufacturing. Lakeshirts is a local company that manufactures and designs custom clothing. We were able to see the local company’s facility and learn about its history in Detroit Lakes. Lakeshirts was started in the basement of founder Mark Fritz’s childhood home in Detroit Lakes and has grown to employ over 500 people. All their products are produced in the U.S. and you can find them in stores across the nation.
 
Thief River Falls Airport Meeting

I met with local and county officials at the Thief River Falls Airport to discuss the airport’s role in the local economy this week. Recently, this airport has seen increased traffic as more freight is being flown out from local manufacturers, making funding for expansion and repairs a vital issue in this community. 
 
Headwaters School of Music & Arts
￼
 
I visited Headwaters School of Music & Arts in Bemidji to learn about their mission to share the arts with the community. Students shared their talents with me as Pastor Preston Hoiseth, the School Board President, showed me around. The Headwaters school is a private non-profit school that gives students the chance to take lessons in music, sculpting, painting and other fine arts. As a musician myself, I appreciate Headwaters School work teaching young people about the arts.
 
Delta Waterfowl Big Stone Lake Area Chapter Dinner
￼
 
Last week, I joined the Big Stone Lake Area Chapter of Delta Waterfowl in Ortonville to visit with area sportsmen. I always enjoy the opportunity to get together with like-minded sportsmen and women who enjoy spending time in the field as much as I do. I appreciate the work these local conservationists do to create habitat for our migratory bird populations so we, and future generations, can have great hunts for years to come. 
 
Border to Border Broadband
￼
 
My staff attended the Minnesota Border to Border Conference this week. I continue to hear the need for more access across the district and am working on several initiatives at the federal level to expand broadband to all rural areas including the Office of Rural Telecommunications Act (H.R. 5497) and leading letters to the FCC to increase funding for the Universal Service Fund (USF).
 
Association of Minnesota Counties District 3 Meeting
￼
 
The Association of Minnesota Counties, District 3 meeting was held in Viking this week. District 3 includes Kittson, Mahnomen, Marshall, Norman, Pennington, Polk, Red Lake and Roseau Counties. Discussions brought up the Enbridge Pipeline court case, state tax conformity, the Minnesota Licensing and Registration System (MNLARS), the opioid crisis, school security, broadband funding, and ongoing issues like transportation funding and state buffer implementation on ditches. Folks also celebrated the retirement of Dr. Joe Bouvette, the District Director, who was a Kittson County Commissioner for 32 years.
 
Discussing Workforce Issues with Senator Amy Klobuchar
￼

Senator Amy Klobuchar and LeRoy Stumpf of my staff visited employers and community leaders in East Grand Forks on Monday. The discussion focused on the housing shortage in western Minnesota, the shortage of workers, and the lack of available training opportunities.
 
Central Minnesota Manufacturers Association (CMMA) Bayer Built Tour
￼
 
My staff aide Jacki Anderson attended CMMA’s tour of Bayer Built in Belgrade. The tour provided a better understanding of the precise work that goes into the products that Bayer Built produces for contractors and consumers. These opportunities always provide great insights into the needs of employers and their employees as they continue to build successful businesses and create jobs in the 7th District. 
 
Highway 23 Coalition
￼
 
On Friday, the Highway 23 Coalition held their general membership meeting in Spicer. This growing coalition is raising awareness about the needs and benefits of filling in the gaps along Highway 23, including the four lane expansion. I look forward to working with the Coalition to find federal funding for this project and for other infrastructure projects that are needed around the 7th District.
 
Northwest Private Industry Council Meeting
￼
 
The Northwest Private Industry Council, represents seven counties in northwest Minnesota and has a regional plan to “maximize resources to lift up the prosperity of the local community and region.” At a time when so many employers are looking for workers, this meeting addressed the prospects of hiring someone with a past criminal record. Emily Baxter showed the audience a graph (photo on the right) of the federal and state prison population for 1925 to 2015. Policies like mandatory sentencing, three-strikes-and-you're-out, and increased alcohol and drug convictions caused much of this increase. Currently, there are about 1.5 million people in prison in the U. S. While the United States has only 5% of the world’s population it houses 25% of the world’s prisoners at a total cost of $80 billion a year.
 
Minnesota Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics
￼
Kristen Williamson, Laura Perdue, Donna Gjesvold, Andrew Doherty, and staff aide Rebekah Solem 
 
A delegation representing the Minnesota Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics stopped by my Washington office this week to visit with my staff. The group was in town for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Food & Nutrition Conference. The meeting focused on malnutrition, which can be difficult to diagnose in part because there is no universally accepted definition. The nutrition professionals in the meeting talked about how malnutrition can contribute to illness and lead to more expensive hospital stays. They also discussed the importance of collaboration in the medical community between doctors, nurses, and professional nutritionists in helping to identify and treat individuals who are malnourished.
 
National Forest Products Week
￼
 
National Forest Products Week begins on the third Sunday in October. October 21-27 is a week to celebrate our forests and the many things they contribute to our society. Forest products are sustainable and readily available, making them an important economic resource in rural communities across the country. These products have long been used in manufacturing and construction, but advances in technology continue to find new uses for them. As co-chair of the Working Forests Caucus, I continuously support finding new uses for forest products.

Farm Bill Update
My staff continues to meet on the farm bill, working to finish the bill as quickly as possible. We are coming to agreement on multiple titles and will have language available for the other farm bill conferees to review when Congress reconvenes in November. In my discussions with farmers throughout the district, many have conveyed to me the importance of finishing the bill before the 2019 crop year. They should know that Chairman Conaway, Chairman Roberts, Ranking Member Stabenow and I all share the common goal of passing this bill before the end of the year. Nobody benefits from partisan positioning or from delaying until the 116th Congress, so we’re pressing ahead to finish our work.
 
Combatting the Opioid Crisis
This week, President Trump signed a comprehensive, bipartisan piece of legislation into law to combat the opioid epidemic. Included in the legislation are provisions to expand opioid treatment for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, accelerate the development of non-addictive medications, and increase the use of telehealth services for rural communities. I supported the legislation (H.R. 6) when it passed the House, and hope that Congress will continue to take meaningful and consequential action related to opioid prevention, treatment, and recovery.  
 
Open Enrollment for 2019 Health Care Coverage
The 2019 open enrollment period begins on November 1, 2018 and ends on January 13, 2019. Enrollees can explore their options and learn about available tax credits on MNsure.org. This year, individuals earning up to $48,560 per year and families of four earning up to $100,400 per year may be eligible to save on their premiums. According to the Minnesota Department of Commerce, premium rates in 2019 are 20% lower than they would be without Minnesota’s reinsurance program, which I organized federal support for in 2017. 
 
2018 Eating Disorders Champion
This week, the Eating Disorders Coalition (EDC) recognized me as a “2018 Eating Disorders Champion.” The distinction is based on my support for research, treatments, and funding related to eating disorders in the 114th and 115th Congresses.
 
This Week in American History
￼
 
On October 26, 1960, Calvin Griffith decided to move his Washington Senators to Minnesota, renaming the team the Twins. The Minnesota Twins are one of two current Major League Baseball teams who once played in Washington, D.C. under the Senators name. The other being the Rangers, whose owners relocated the team to Texas in 1971.
 
What’s the Story?
￼
 
When Minnesotans visit my office in Washington, they often ask about the quilt that hangs prominently on the wall as they enter. In 2017, I was honored to accept this Quilt of Valor from members of the Douglas County 4-H Chapter. Quilts of Valor are made to show appreciation for those who served our country in the armed forces and comfort them when they return home. A Quilt of Valor must be constructed of high quality materials and sewn by machine or hand. Quilts of Valor are not given to recipients, rather, they must be awarded. I humbly accepted this quilt on behalf of all of Minnesota’s veterans, and I proudly display it in the front of my Washington, D.C. office.

Dear  , 
I wanted to provide you with some important updates from my week traveling eastern Connecticut. 
￼  Congressman Courtney tours construction progress along the New England Central Rail 
Construction Progress Continues on New England Central Rail TIGER Grant Project 
￼
This week I had the chance to stop in Stafford to check-in on construction progress along the New England Central Railroad (NECR). In 2014, I helped secure a U.S Department of Transportation TIGER Grant which is being used to upgrade the rail line, doubling its current cargo capacity and significantly increasing the commercial value of the Port of New London, which has  been vastly underutilized as a commercial shipping hub. Once this project is finished, it will be a game-changer for eastern Connecticut. The TIGER Grant project has created about 100 construction jobs in north-central Connecticut and the final product will expand industry and create more new jobs across our region as shipping increases in the coming years. 
The NECR is a subsidiary of the Darien-based Genesee & Wyoming railroad company, and it is a critical north-south freight rail backbone for New England - providing on-dock transatlantic access for container ships at the Port of New London at the south end, and interchanging with the Canadian National Railway at the Vermont border. 
The TIGER Grant upgrades along the Connecticut portion of the NECR will allow the rail line to handle new freight car shipments weighing up to 286,000 pounds. The project is upgrading the existing line with new continuous welded rails, 15,000 new crossties, and 15,000 tons of ballast. 
This is a great example of a successful federal-state-private partnership that has resulted in the project coming in under-budget by over $3 million. The surplus funds will be used to make additional infrastructure improvements along the rail line.
￼  Congressman Courtney visits with future manufacturers at Windham High School Early College Opportunity Program 
Windham High School Invests in Connecticut’s Manufacturing Future 
On Thursday, I had the opportunity to visit Windham High School's Early College Opportunity (ECO) Program with Superintendent Dr. Patricia Garcia and tour their new manufacturing and computer lab. The ECO Program at Windham High School is a four-year program where students can complete high school while dually enrolled in college courses—which means Windham students get a leg-up on the competition by working towards debt-free Associate Degrees in manufacturing before even finishing high school.  
The Windham ECO Program started in 2015 and is one of only four programs using the ECO model in the state. Windham ECO is a partnership among the Windham Board of Education, General Dynamics-Electric Boat, Quinebaug Valley Community College, the Eastern Connecticut Workforce Investment Board, and the Eastern Advanced Manufacturing Alliance. In June, they opened a new manufacturing and computer lab that allows students to use state-of-the-art 3-D printers, CNC routers, and other equipment not traditionally available to students interested in manufacturing until after high school.  
With Electric Boat expanding their workforce by 15,000 jobs over the next decade, graduates from the Windham ECO program will be uniquely positioned for employment. This program is a true model for how to get students interested and engaged in STEM and manufacturing futures, and I look forward to watching this program grow.  
￼  Congressman Courtney and U.S. Department of Energy SEP Grant Administrator Henry Fowler hear from farmer Jack Collins about the benefits of his new compost-to-energy system 
Enfield Dairy Farm Goes Green with the Help of the U.S. Department of Energy 
Today, I stopped by Collins Powder Hill Farm in Enfield—a 5th generation family dairy farm—to view a new green energy project they’ve been working on with the Connecticut Farm Energy Program and the U.S. Department of Energy. With the help of about $60,000 of state and federal investment, the farm was able to install a compost aeration and heat recovery system, which is the first of its kind in Connecticut. The project was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy State Energy Program (SEP). Last year, the President threatened to eliminate SEP, and I was glad to support its continued funding through the Energy and Water appropriations bill last month.  
This compost project is demonstrating an alternative to larger, more costly renewable energy installations at other dairy farms in the region. Not only is this system generating energy that the farm is using for heated air and water in their milking parlor, but it is also producing value-added compost at a faster rate than a traditional composting system. With fluctuating energy costs and an increased focus on lowering carbon emissions, this compost aeration and heat recovery system pilot project is helping pave the way for dairy farm modernization and efficiency in Connecticut.  
￼  Congressman Courtney poses with his favorite--Cub Scout Pack 50’s Scarecrow 
Rep. Courtney Takes “Straw Poll” of Stafford Scarecrow Contest Submissions 
My October wouldn’t be complete without a stop in downtown Stafford to see the scarecrow applicants for the Garden Club’s annual contest. The Stafford Garden Club is in its 4th year of this contest that truly brings the community together.    As we look forward to trick-or-treaters and some much-needed fun next week, the Centers for Disease Control has created a helpful webpage with Halloween safety tips and activities for kids.  
I hope everyone has a happy and safe (and spooky!) Halloween, and as always thank you for taking a moment to read my weekly update. If you have any questions or concerns about the information in this newsletter, you can contact me through my website or by calling my Norwich district office at 860-886-0139.

Suspected Bomber will be Brought to Justice
Justice will be served for the suspected bomber who targeted President Obama, Secretary Clinton, and others. Actions like these run counter to our core American values and serve to do nothing more than divide and terrorize our country. I am grateful for the Secret Service, the FBI, and local law enforcement who work tirelessly to keep our country safe.

Tackling the Opioid Crisis Head-On 
The opioid epidemic claims over 100 lives every day.
Congress came together this week to reverse this dangerous trend when the President signed into law a bipartisan opioid package, the largest effort Congress has ever undertaken to address this crisis. I was proud to take part in this historic moment.   The enactment of this landmark bill builds on our commitment to tackling the opioid epidemic head-on. This package is the result of months-long work in both the House and Senate to provide our communities with the resources they need to increase our safety, prevent addiction and encourage recovery. Two measures I championed were included in the package - the STOP Act, which gives law enforcement the tools they need to identify and intercept shipments of deadly synthetic opioids through the U.S. Postal Service, in addition to the Medicare Opioid Safety Education Act, which bolsters opioid education for Seniors on Medicare. 
I had the privilege of meeting Dee Dee at the ceremony, a Dutchess County resident who is recovering from addiction. She’s a local seamstress working at Unshattered in Hopewell Junction, a non-profit whose mission is to provide women battling addiction a pathway to employment, independence, and a better chance at maintaining their sobriety.  Read more about this new law here: https://bit.ly/2qfbUK1  
￼

￼

Honoring our Brave First Responders
I am thankful for the service and sacrifice of the many police officers, firefighters, and emergency personnel who are on the front-lines of public safety. I attended the First Responders Mass at St. Peter’s Church in Rosendale on Sunday. Father Burke invited me to attend this important service, and I was grateful to be alongside local law enforcement and firefighters to honor the many brave men and women who help keep us safe.   
￼

Improving our Nation's Water Infrastructure 
This week, a comprehensive water infrastructure bill was signed into law by the President. This legislation was the result of a bipartisan, bicameral effort to provide much-needed updates to water infrastructure in New York and across the country.
This package provides for the maintenance of key water infrastructure, such as locks and dams, ensures families have access to safe drinking water, and in Upstate, ensures the Hudson River remains navigable. I am proud to be a part of the House’s Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and to have worked across the aisle on this important bipartisan initiative.
Read more about this critical, bipartisan infrastructure package here: https://bit.ly/2JiJA1Y 

Protecting our Lands
In Upstate, we have a profound appreciation for the natural world and the pristine lands that surround us. Land conservation is an important way in which we safeguard the environment and support numerous industries, including farming, forestry, and tourism. I object to the IRS proposal to limit the deductibility of conservation easements, which would upset a long-established status quo and have a negative impact on those looking to donate their lands for public benefit.
In New York State alone, charitably-motivated private landowners, working with over 80 qualified non-profit land trusts across the state, have permanently protected over 700,000 acres of land using conservation easements. Earlier this month, I joined local conservation groups to send a letter to the IRS objecting to this proposal and expressing my concerns about the effect it would have on our environment and local economy.   Promoting land conservation has been one of my greatest priorities during my time in Congress. I am a cosponsor of legislation to permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), one of our nation’s most important conservation programs. Communities across our district have benefited from LWCF- sponsored projects, including the FDR Historic Site in Hyde Park, Ticeteneyck Mountain in Ulster County, and the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River. This past spring, I supported a government funding bill that dedicated $2 million of LWCF funding for the purchase of the Boniello parcel of land along the Appalachian Trail in Pawling. I look forward to continuing my support for the LWCF as well as my work with local communities, stakeholders, and my colleagues in a bipartisan manner.

Read the letter I sent to the IRS here: https://bit.ly/2qdQJaY

Honoring Blossom Rozman of Ellenville
I joined members of the Ellenville Regional Hospital community to honor Blossom Rozman, a local Ellenville resident who has spent decades serving the greater Ulster community. Through her passion and dedication, she continues to work to improve the world around her.
Among her many activities and accomplishments, Blossom was vital to the implementation of the holocaust studies program in the Ellenville Central school – the first full-year program of its kind in the country. She has also participated in numerous organizations, including serving on the executive board of the Ellenville Regional Hospital Auxiliary and as past president of the Sisterhood of Congregation Ezrath Israel.
Throughout Upstate, I am thankful for the driven and compassionate individuals like Blossom who have committed themselves to strengthening our communities and building a better future.
￼

Unemployment Rates Continue to Decline in Upstate
As September marked the lowest level of U.S. unemployment since the Vietnam War, we saw local jobless rates fall in communities throughout Upstate.
Although economic growth and lower unemployment rates are a positive sign for the many hard working New Yorkers, we must ensure workers have the training to fill high-skill job openings and continue to work to make New York a place where young people want to stay, businesses want to grow, and families want to lay down roots.

Serving our Upstate Veterans 
It was great meeting many local veterans at my Dutchess County Veterans Resource Fair on Saturday. This event brought together representatives from various local, state, and federal agencies and community outreach programs to provide veterans with resources and guidance about benefits available to them. Our veterans have made countless sacrifices for our state and nation, we owe it to them to ensure they have the care and benefits they deserve.

October 27th: Drug Take-Back Day
A 2016 study shows that over 6 million Americans misused prescription drugs, a majority of which were accessed from a home medicine cabinet. With the rising tide of drug abuse and addiction, we need to do all we can to secure our homes and families.
This Saturday, October 27th, is National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day. Find the location closest to you to safely dispose of your expired or unused prescriptions: https://bit.ly/2CGZLop

WEEK IN REVIEW
￼
To start off this week's From the Front... I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nation’s capital, including Robin Miller of Rogers, Miranda and Michael Redzich from Rogers, Sandra Jones of Western Grove, and the McFadin family from Siloam Springs. Safe travels back to the Natural State.
I’m thrilled to announce that the Womack family continues to grow. I am now a grandpa of three boys! Welcome to the world, baby Luka. We are exceptionally blessed! 
￼
I began my week in Arkansas's Third Congressional District with a visit to Pea Ridge Primary School. I had a wonderful time and was able to surprise my grandson Kaden for lunch! It brings me so much joy to watch him learn and grow. We then headed to his kindergarten classroom for storytime. The kids had a great time reading together.  
Schools should always be safe environments where students can thrive. I sat down with school superintendents from Pea Ridge, Bentonville, Siloam Springs, and Rogers to discuss school safety and other education policy issues. It was great to hear their thoughts, learn about the challenges facing our schools, and get updates on the work being done in the classroom. Meetings like this help me to better understand what Congress can do to further support our local schools and help students succeed.
￼
Small businesses strengthen our communities by providing jobs and promoting economic growth. It was great to hear directly from several Pea Ridge business owners and managers for a roundtable meeting. We had productive discussions on tax reform, infrastructure, and regulations! Amazing to hear how historic tax cuts have provided them with the opportunity to invest in their workers and companies – and further pursue their American dream. Small business optimism is strong, and the proof is in our roaring economy. Thanks to Mayor Crabtree and all of the small business owners and entrepreneurs for their time and thoughtful conversation. 
On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to address the Fayetteville Chamber of Commerce at the Excellence in Business Awards. These awards are given to investors who exemplify excellence in best business practices and dedicate themselves to the growth and success in our community. Congrats to this year’s honorees.
￼
I then stopped by Central States Manufacturing in Lowell to tour their facility and hear more about the company’s culture of employee ownership. They manufacture metal roofing, siding, and associated building components. As an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) business, Central States Manufacturing enables employees to own company stock. They discussed how this type of model allows for every person on their team to be personally invested in their work. It was great to get a tour of their facility and learn more about how their unique structure drives their success.
￼
One of the best parts of being your Congressman is being able to meet remarkable people from our district. It was a privilege to present WWII veteran and Bentonville resident William “Pat” Patterson with a Congressional Gold Medal to honor his service with the Office of Strategic Services. The OSS was America’s first spy agency and played a pivotal role in helping the U.S. and its allies defeat Axis forces.
During WWII, the OSS handled a variety of roles, including establishing secret intelligence networks and supporting resistance forces throughout Europe and Asia. Lt. Patterson served behind enemy lines in China in the Cryptographic and Message Center. The organization eventually developed into our modern-day CIA and U.S. Special Operations Command.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
￼
The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian honor that Congress can bestow, and Lt. Patterson and all the patriots of the OSS earned this recognition. We owe our Greatest Generation a debt that can never be repaid. Their heroic actions will forever be engrained into the memory of our nation. On behalf of a grateful country, God bless Lt. Patterson and thank you for your service. A special thanks to his family and two of his friends – who were also WWII veterans – for being part of this special presentation.
On Thursday, I headed to Fort Smith for another busy day! It was great to be with the Fort Smith Chamber of Commerce for their annual meeting, where I received an update on business growth and workforce development in the area. There is lots of economic development and opportunity in our region. We want to keep building on that momentum and strengthen our competitive advantage. Our pro-growth, pro-business agenda in Congress will continue to support these goals. 
￼
My next stop was to the new Applied Process facility. After strong results, they invested in their infrastructure and expanding capacity in Fort Smith. They highlighted how the robust workforce in AR-3 has allowed them to be competitive, productive, and efficient. I also got a firsthand look at their manufacturing process. The company produces products for a range of companies, including those in the aerospace, automotive and railroad industries. 
￼
I was honored to receive the ""Friend of the Farm Bureau"" award from the American Farm Bureau. Farmers and ranchers are a vital part of our state and national economy. They help feed and fuel Americans and ensure the safety and security of our food supply. I will always work in Congress to advocate for policies that support them. A big thank you to Arkansas Farm Bureau President Randy Veach and all of the Arkansas farmers and ranchers who took time out of their hectic days to present me with this recognition! 
￼
This morning, I stopped by Northwest Technical Institute's open house. There were lots of motivated and engaged high school students ready to learn about programs and workforce development opportunities. Through technical training and skills education, these young adults will create their own paths to success. 
Some good news to end the week: The U.S. economy grew at 3.5% in the third quarter, beating expectations. Strong consumer confidence and pro-growth policies continue to produce a booming economy!

10/26/18 17:47,"Rep. Grothman Newsletter - GDP Growth, FEMA Update & More","￼ 
  

GDP Growth 
Today, the Bureau of Economic Analysis announced that the United States saw an increase of 3.5 percent GDP growth in the third quarter. This announcement marked the best two quarter stretch the country has seen in four years. Additionally, this news indicates that the economy is now on pace to experience its best annual performance since 2005.

Today's announcement is yet again another sign that the U.S. economy continues to prosper and move in the right direction. Lower unemployment and faster wage growth are among the several other indications that the economy is continuing its positive push forward. 

Business investment is on the rise and Americans are feeling good about their financial stability once more! As we move forward, I will ensure that the 6th district continues to feel the benefits of pro-growth policies and an economy that gives back to the people of Wisconsin and the United States.

FEMA Update 
Many areas throughout the 6th district were affected by the storms and flooding Wisconsin experienced in the months of August and September. Late last week, the administration approved Federal funding for communities throughout Wisconsin impacted by the severe weather conditions.

In communicating with FEMA, I have discovered that while many constituents have called into FEMA at an earlier date requesting support, this does not mean that they are registered for potential federal relief through FEMA. Constituents must register in order to receive consideration, regardless of actions they may have taken in the recent past.

Constituents can register for relief support by visiting http://www.disasterassistance.gov, by using the FEMA app, by calling into 1-800-621-3362, or by visiting a recovery center in the area. Once registered, individuals will be contacted by an agent to set up a date and time for an official inspection of damages. FEMA inspectors will have documentation to prove that they work for the organization and will not be requesting any monetary return or payment for the inspection. 
If the constituent’s claim is denied, they will need to submit a written and signed appeal, in addition to providing a repair cost estimate from a private builder or contractor. I will keep you updated on the situation as it progresses. For more information click here.

DEA Take Back Day
This Saturday, October 27th, from 10am-2pm, law enforcement departments, organizations and communities throughout the country are participating in the DEA National Drug Take Back Day in an effort to draw awareness to the ongoing opioid epidemic plaguing so many areas across the United States. DEA Take Back Day presents an opportunity for individuals to dispose of unused or expired medications in a safe and responsible manner. 

By participating in DEA Take Back Day, community members can help prevent prescription medication from getting into the wrong hands. Countless instances of young children and adolescents obtaining opioids and prescription drugs from medication cabinets and accessible areas throughout households have left families in despair and caused disruption in the community.

Ensuring that unused medication is disposed of responsibly is the first step in combating a crisis that has swept across the country. Join me this Saturday in participating in DEA Take Back Day and making the community a safer place for everyone. For details and a list of collection sites throughout the 6th district click here.

Dear Lindsey, 
Condemning Violence  
Like so many Granite Staters and people across the country, I am horrified and outraged over the attempted mail attacks on government leaders, advocates, and journalists this week. These violent and hateful acts have no place in our society, which is proudly built upon the First Amendment and a free press. I applaud law enforcement for promptly investigating this serious matter and making an arrest, and I urge all Americans to practice our core values of inclusivity, diversity and acceptance. 
Supporting Our Youth  
I was proud to join Senators Shaheen and Hassan on Monday to announce a $35,000 USDA Rural Development grant to the Pemi Youth Center to support the renovation of a building for the afternoon teen center in Franklin. Learning and growth does not stop at the end of the school day, and these funds will allow Pemi Youth Services to reach more teens in Franklin with their afterschool programming to support academic success and raise awareness about the threat of substance use disorder. As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, I’ll continue to push for USDA Rural Development program funding so that we can continue to direct resources to rural communities throughout New Hampshire. 
Coming Together to Fight the Opioid Epidemic 
I’m thrilled my colleagues and I were able to come together to send the President the much-needed and commonsense opioid legislation he signed into law on Wednesday. In addition to reauthorizing the critical Office of National Drug Control Policy, which I fought for, this legislation also includes the STOP Fentanyl Deaths Act, a bill I introduced to help public health laboratories better detect synthetic opioids like fentanyl and alert public health officials and law enforcement. I look forward to seeing the positive impact this legislation will have on the lives of Granite Staters and their communities, and I remain committed to working with Democrats and Republicans to further strengthen our nation’s response to the opioid epidemic. 
Making Prescription Drugs More Affordable 
While I am encouraged by the direction of the proposals President Trump outlined yesterday to overhaul how Medicare pays for certain drugs, we need to do more to truly cut the outrageous prices of prescription drugs. To provide real relief to consumers in the Granite State and across the country, we must end the stranglehold pharmaceutical companies have on prescription drug prices and fully give Medicare the ability to directly negotiate costs. I urge the President to keep his campaign promise to make drugs more affordable by calling for this much-needed change. 
I want to hear from you 
As always, please feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns or ideas you have. You can contact my Washington, DC office at 202-225-5206 or my Concord office at 603-226-1002. Thank you for all the wonderful contributions you make to New Hampshire, and I hope you enjoy your weekend!

Dear Friend,  In the 1980s, I traveled with a Jesuit priest to a Guatemalan refugee camp in Southern Mexico.  The people there had fled from the horrific political violence raging all around Central America.  On the heels of many innocent people getting killed, including four American nuns in El Salvador, it was my attempt to show solidarity with the people suffering and evaluate what could be done.  Fast forward to now.  We have a caravan of at least 7000 people making their way from Central America to the United States.  In the last 30 years, the dynamics of incomplete border control, insufficient federal enforcement, and exploitation of the poor by unscrupulous corporations has created a magnet for those seeking a better life.  Central America has aided this exodus by outsourcing its internal political and economic problems to the U.S.  Let’s be clear: No one is entitled to enter America illegally.  Generosity cannot flow from chaos.  Law and order create the conditions for justice and compassion.  A caravan is not the way to enter America.  It undermines good immigration policy.  It is unfair to those waiting in line and following the law.  It is a grave setback to proper harmonious relationship with Central America.  The dynamics around immigration are complex and multi-layered.  Using the most conservative estimates, more than 12 million people illegally remain in the U.S.  This old statistic, however, is being challenged by a new Yale study indicating that the true number of illegal immigrants could be as high as 30 million.  While most illegal entry is from our southern border, roughly 40% is due to overstaying a visa.  This summer we saw heart-wrenching reminders of the struggle to properly balance law enforcement with humanitarian considerations.  Although the policy of separating children from their parents is no longer in place, a widely unknown fact is that children often cross the border alone.  While the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) goes to great lengths to ensure the proper care of the 12,000 unaccompanied children already here, there is ongoing abuse of our asylum laws, with unrelated and unscrupulous adults posing as guardians to ensure their own entrance into our country.  In an ambitious attempt to meet multiple challenges, the House of Representatives recently voted on legislation to stiffen internal enforcement, modernize our immigration laws, and significantly increase border resources.  The House legislation moved towards a merit-based immigration system, provided new funding for more humane shelters, created an accelerated judicial review process, and made accommodations to resolve the anxious ambiguity faced by Deferred Action Childhood Arrival (or DACA) recipients, who were brought to this country through no fault of their own.  I supported these initiatives, but they, unfortunately, did not have sufficient support in the House.  In the meanwhile, we continue to increase border resources at a steady rate and step up enforcement against vicious criminal gangs like MS-13.  One overlooked priority not often discussed in the highly partisan debate over immigration is our foreign policy engagement with the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.  In an attempt to move the immigration debate off the Mexican-American one-yard line, for several years we have aggressively worked with these nations to foster just governance, end corruption, and improve economic opportunity—all to stem the pressure for economic migration.  Across administrations, we have spent on average $600 million a year on this effort.  In this volatile moment, the effectiveness of this policy is being put to the test.  America is a kind and welcoming nation, opening her arms to persons seeking refuge, their own good, and the deeper values of our country.  Good and ordered immigration policy is based on hospitality, capacity, and the person’s prospect for assimilation.  Put simply, it’s about justice and generosity.  While individuals within the caravan may need our help, a caravan cannot roll over these principles.   Sincerely, ￼  Congressman Jeff Fortenberry

Press Release of the Week [1 of 2]: Rep. Loudermilk Praises Law Enforcement, Emphasizes Civility
 
 
Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-GA) issued the following statement after federal authorities arrested a man in connection to a string of suspicious packages sent to nationally prominent individuals: 

""I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to national, state and local law enforcement for their quick and efficient work in identifying and apprehending a suspect in the recent terroristic acts of mailing suspected bombs to nationally prominent individuals. 

“For a while now, I have been advocating for a return to civility in politics; and that requires all of us, elected officials, activists and all citizens to stand up for what we believe in while respecting those who may disagree. I have experienced firsthand an act of political terrorism, when a deranged man opened fire on me and my colleagues at a Republican baseball practice last year. That single act of hatred has left physical and emotional scars on those that were there, which are likely to last a lifetime. Before and since, my family and I have had threats of violence against us, and while this has not deterred me from working for the people of Georgia, it has had an effect on my family, my staff, and my friends.

Press Release of the Week [2 of 2]: Rep. Loudermilk Co-Sponsors Bill to Secure our Borders
 
 
Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-GA) issued the following statement after he co-sponsored the Build the Wall, Enforce the Law Act of 2018: 

“Republicans in the House remain focused on our national security, and securing our borders is the most important step in keeping America safe. We must continue to work to fix our borders and our broken immigration system, because every single day drug runners, sex traffickers, criminal gangs, and gun runners exploit our borders for their criminal activities. This bill, introduced by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), would go a long way in making America more secure.”

SERVING YOU  |  MEDIA CENTER  |  LEGISLATIVE WORK  |  OUR DISTRICT
 
October 26, 2018
 
 
 Dear Friend,   This morning I was honored to receive the Trailblazer Award at the Lights on Afterschool Summit for my work advocating for afterschool programming.   Afterschool programming is incredibly important and plays such a vital role in lives of young people – improving attendance and academic aspirations, reducing risky behaviors, promoting physical health, and so much more. Few tools are as effective at promoting development and keeping kids safe as quality afterschool initiatives.   Since my time as Mayor of Providence, where I founded the Providence After School Alliance which provided thousands of students with hands-on learning opportunities, I’ve been a strong advocate for afterschool programming.  In Congress, I have continually advocated for robust funding for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program, which provides critical funding for afterschool programming. When the President proposed the elimination of federal funding for afterschool programs, I led the fight to restore these funds, and the result was a $20 million increase in federal funding. I also helped lead an effort supporting reauthorization of this program, and every year I’ve led the bipartisan appropriations request.   I promise to remain a strong advocate for critical afterschool programming that helps keep young people on a solid track to success.  MANUFACTURERS SUMMIT  The manufacturing industry has a long history in Rhode Island. The industrial revolution began in our state and continues to contribute to many strong manufacturing sectors today. That’s why this week I was happy to join Senator Reed, Senator Whitehouse, and Congressman Langevin at the Rhode Island Manufacturers Association’s (RIMA) first ever Manufacturers & Congressional Summit where we discussed some of the concerns facing the manufacturing industry in our state.   This industry provides good-paying jobs and is helping to rebuild our middle class. In Rhode Island, this industry currently employs more than 41,000 people, roughly 8.5 percent of the workforce in our state. But for years we have seen these good jobs shipped overseas.  The high-level nature of the manufacturing industry in the U.S. means that many of the jobs require additional training and skills development. It is estimated that over the next decade nearly 3.5 million manufacturing jobs will be needed but 2 million are expected to go unfilled due to a skills gap. We need to make sure that when these positions become available the workforce is ready to fill them.  House Democrats have come up with a plan to help address this skills gap and are calling for expanding registered apprenticeships and work-based learning programs, as well as providing a new tax credit to employers to train and hire new workers, and creating a network of thousands of partners between businesses, career and technical programs, public school, and community colleges.  I have been proud to support legislation aimed at helping this sector of our economy grow. I will continue to advocate in Congress for policies and funding to advance the manufacturing industry in our state, and allow Rhode Island to reclaim its identity as a leader of manufacturing and innovation.  CODAC 40TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION   On Thursday, I attended CODAC’s 40th Anniversary Celebration in Newport and was honored with their Champion Award. For over four decades, CODAC has provided outpatient opioid treatment to countless Rhode Islanders.  The opioid crisis has hit our state particularly hard, with the Center for Disease Control ranking Rhode Island with the ninth highest drug overdose death rate in the country.   I’ve been proud to help secure over $12 million for Rhode Island this year to help fight this epidemic. But in order to fully confront this crisis, we need a comprehensive approach engaging every level of government, stakeholders, nonprofits and the private sector working together. We need a strategy that includes resources for folks struggling with addiction to get the health care they need to address this disease; greater awareness of the over-prescription of opiate painkillers, as well as ways for folks to dispose of their prescription drugs after they’re done. We must also focus on the preservation of human life by equipping more first responders with naloxone and treating an overdose first and foremost as a medical emergency.  ELECTRIC BUS LAUNCH   This past Monday marked a step forward in terms of Rhode Island’s commitment to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels as we celebrated the state’s first electric buses. These zero-emission buses will help reduce tailpipe emissions in our state and improve air quality and public health.   The funding that made this project possible was from a settlement with Volkswagen who misled the public about their emissions by installing illegal software.   As a country, we need to continue moving away from our dependence on fossil fuels and put policies in place that encourage investments in our public transportation systems and green initiatives. These types of investments will help move Rhode Island and the country forward, while being responsible stewards of the environment.   House Democrats have put forth a bold plan, A Better Deal to Rebuild America, which would invest $1 trillion dollars and create more than $16 million jobs. This plan would build sustainable, resilient infrastructure that would help strengthen and connect communities while protecting clean air and water.   We need to be making investments that will help improve hardworking American lives every day while keeping them healthy and protecting our environment. Making sure that people have access to an efficient, reliable public transportation system is one vital part of this.  
RIBBON CUTTING CEREMONY   Today I joined community members and leaders for a ribbon cutting ceremony in Providence. The ceremony was in celebration of a 128-unit complex that will offer affordable apartments for seniors and families. This project was taken on by RI Housing and was supported by Low Income Housing Tax Credits, among other funding sources.  Affordable housing is a critical issue in our state and country. So many families are working harder than ever but unable to get ahead with stagnant wages and the rising costs of living. And too many hardworking families in our state are still struggling with issues related to housing security, even as we slowly recover from the housing crisis.   In Congress, I was proud to co-sponsor the bipartisan Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act which would increase the allocation of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit by 50% and would provide more opportunities to expand this important tax credit.   Continuing to expand programs like this will help all families achieve access to a clean, safe, affordable home, which provides a base for families to thrive and prosper.   CITIZENS BANK PELL BRIDGE RUN   Last Sunday, I participated in the Citizens Bank Pell Bridge Run which each year raises money for local nonprofits in our state. I was amazed by the strong turnout from our community in support of these organizations. Everyone who participated could have been somewhere else on an early Sunday morning, but they decided to show up to raise funds for their community and the great organizations in our state.   
As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns, please call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov.

Senator Maggie Hassan  
See below for highlights of my week fighting for the priorities of Granite Staters.
Visit my website for more updates at Hassan.Senate.Gov. 

This Week: Bipartisan Opioid Legislation Signed into Law 

This week, I joined the President at the White House for the signing of critical bipartisan legislation that will help support those on the front lines of the devastating opioid crisis. 
This bill includes a number of measures that I authored or cosponsored to strengthen our efforts to combat this epidemic, including ensuring that the hardest-hit states, like New Hampshire, receive their fair share of resources, expanding access to medication-assisted treatment, establishing comprehensive opioid recovery centers for those struggling with addiction, supporting law enforcement in their efforts to curb the shipment of deadly fentanyl into the United States through the postal service, and more. 
This bill has many other priorities for New Hampshire, and you can read more about it here. 
With the President signing this bipartisan legislation into law this week, we must immediately turn our focus to the next measures that will help strengthen treatment, prevention, recovery, and law enforcement efforts. The urgency of this crisis demands nothing less. 
This week, I also visited two career and technical education centers in New Hampshire and saw the critical work that they are doing. 
As Governor, I was proud to sign legislation into law to help fund the new Dover Regional Career Technical Center and it was great to visit this week and see its career and technical education programs in action. 
￼  
I also toured the Concord Regional Technical Center and saw where students are learning and building the career and technical skills they need to succeed in the 21st innovation century economy. 
 ￼ 
Today I was in Shelburne for the North Country Veterans Conference. Our veterans have sacrificed bravely in defense of our freedoms, and we must continuously work to uphold the values that they so valiantly fought to defend. As part of those efforts, I’ll keep working to ensure that our service members, veterans, and their families have what they need to thrive in civilian life. 
Learn more about how I’m working across party lines to support veterans here. 
I took this photo of New Hampshire’s snowcapped mountains on the way. 
￼ 
I also was proud to recognize Hannah Guillemette of Bedford as October’s Granite Stater of the Month this week. 
￼ 
Hannah, a high school freshmen, has made it her mission to address bullying in schools through her anti-bullying and kindness campaign “I’ve Got Your Back,” also known as “IGYB,” which she started while she was in middle school. She began by distributing 600 IGYB wristbands with a mission tag prompting her peers to be inclusive, kind, and respectful to each other, and the effort quickly grew and has touched almost 30,000 people across New Hampshire and 14 other states. 
You can read more about her efforts here and if you’d like to nominate someone to be the Granite Stater of the Month you can click here.  
Tomorrow is National Prescription Drug Take Back Day!

The California Transit Association's 53rd Annual Fall Conference 
It was a pleasure to give opening remarks this week at the California Transit Association's 53rd Annual Fall Conference in Long Beach. The theme of the conference was “Transforming Transit: Redesigning Our Future,” and it focused on the trends that are reshaping public and private transportation into a new system inspired by technology, big data, and increasing rider expectations.  
I have been disappointed by the incredibly slow pace of the Federal Transit Administration to approve federal funds for important local transit projects. Delays in Washington, D.C., increase project costs as local procurement agreements and other construction bids expire. I hope that in the months ahead, we can push the Administration to award these funds as Congress has directed. 
Despite the transit-related problems we face in Washington, D.C., I thought the conference’s forward-looking theme was appropriate, given that transit agencies have been at the forefront of transportation innovation, adopting low- and zero-emissions technology and partnering with autonomous vehicle manufacturers to reimagine how Americans will get from A to B in the years ahead. Transit will play a key role in our response to many the key challenges of the coming decades, including climate change and the affordable housing shortage.

Nostra Culpa (Our Fault)   Last week, some of you might have noticed that the On The Hill section of the newsletter appeared to be written in Latin.   Well, yes and no.   The large paragraph most certainly was in Latin. However, it was not a translation of something we planned to run. It is actually a scrambled excerpt from a work by 2nd Century BC Roman philosopher and politician Cicero. For the past 50 years or so it has simply been referred to as “Lorem Ipsum,” and it is used as placeholder text in graphic design and publishing. It is a helpful tool when laying out something like a newsletter.   However, the main problem with Lorem Ipsum is that it’s possible to forget to replace it with the actual content you want to use. This is what happened in the last issue of the newsletter. Thank you to those who brought it to the attention of my office, and I’ll work with my staff on some steps to make sure it doesn’t happen again. 
  
￼ 
Each week hundreds of constituents contact my office to share their views on a variety of topics. I have recently received many messages from constituents expressing their concern regarding reports of banned drugs found in pork, poultry, and beef in the United States. Below is a portion of my response to those messages: 
“As you may know, a recent Consumer Reports investigation suggests that traces of banned or restricted drugs, such as Ketamine and Phenylbutazone, have been found in meat supplies.  This report raises serious concerns about safeguards to protect the U.S. meat supply.
I am concerned about the contents and safety of the food we eat.  I am contacting the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to request for an investigation to determine whether we need to enforce stronger regulatory standards for the safety and quality of the food we eat. 
As your Representative in Congress, I support the important public health mission of the USDA and Food and Drug Administration.  I will continue to monitor this issue and press the USDA to make sure that Americans are not exposed to contaminated meat, and ensure that the Department has the resources necessary to uphold our food safety standards.”  
If you have written in to me, please continue to do so. If you have not, I encourage you to share your views and concerns with me, as it is the best way for me to find out which issues you care most about.   You can find out how to contact me on my website by clicking here.

Romualdo Pacheco, A Man of Many Offices   Romualdo Pacheco, Jr., the first Hispanic American to serve in the House of Representatives, was born in Santa Barbara, California in 1831 to a wealthy and prominent Alta California family. 
By the time he became a U.S. citizen under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, and at only the age of 17, he was already a wealthy maritime businessman and rancher in his own right.  When California became a state in 1850, Romualdo ran for public office, becoming the first treasurer of San Luis Obispo County, one of the first members of the county’s board of supervisors, and one of the county’s first superior court judges. He ran for, and was elected to, the California State Senate in 1857 and re-elected two times, serving until 1863.   A staunch foe of slavery and secession, Romualdo briefly fought on the side of the Union as a brigadier general in the California state militia. In 1863 he was appointed state treasurer by Governor Stanford, an office for which he would later win an additional term. 
After losing a second full term as state treasurer, in 1871 he was elected Lieutenant Governor of California. When Governor Newton Booth stepped down to accept a U.S. Senate seat in 1875, Romualdo became the 12th Governor of California. He remains the only Hispanic American to serve in that capacity.  
After serving out the ten months remaining of the governor’s term, he ran for a U.S. House seat, defeating incumbent Peter D. Wigginton by just one vote. Wigginton contested the results, but the California Secretary of State certified the election results and Romualdo headed to Washington, D.C., representing a district that ran the width of the state from San Francisco to the Mexican border.  Wigginton, however, appealed the election results and eventually prevailed, leading to the overturning of the election and the unseating of Romualdo in 1878. He had been a Representative for less than four months.  A year later, Wigginton retired from Congress, and Romualdo successfully won the seat in September 1879 and served until 1893.

Long’s Short Report – Annual agriculture tour  By Rep. Billy Long  We kicked off our Missouri 7th Congressional District annual agriculture tour on the 18th of October, at the Southwest Research Center in Mt. Vernon, Missouri. Since agriculture is so vital to Missouri’s economy, my offices in Springfield and Joplin stay in close contact with our farmers and agricultural community. My staff and I meet with farmers and industry leaders year-round, then once a year we load up on buses and tour different farming operations as a group. This year we started off by visiting the fine folks at Edgewood Creamery in Purdy, Missouri. Next, we stopped by the largest elderberry growing operation in North America at Innovative Natural Solutions, also located in Purdy. Little Flat Creek Ranch was our next stop and then it was on to the Andrew Jackson Farm in Wentworth. Our last stop was at Gleonda Angus Farms in Miller, Missouri. Each stop showcased a different part of Missouri’s agriculture industry.  The agriculture industry employs nearly 400,000 people and spans more than 25 million acres of land. In 2016 alone, Missouri’s agriculture industry generated $88 billion. Compared to the rest of the country, Missouri ranks as one of the leading states for beef cattle, rice, goats, turkeys, hay, soybeans and hogs among other agriculture commodities.  Edgewood Creamery is owned and operated by the Fletcher family, who originally started off only producing milk, but expanded to produce other dairy products. During our tour, the Fletchers showed us firsthand how their dairy products were made and the value they put on customer care.  Innovative Natural Solutions is a unique and rapidly growing business that produces elderberries, which have recently become quite the hit across the U.S. Its berries are in stores all across Missouri as well as up and down the East Coast.  Little Flat Creek Ranch is also located in Purdy. Unlike other typical ranches, Little Flat Creek Ranch offers families the opportunity to hunt and fish, something not normally associated with ranches. Located on 1,500 acres, Little Flat Creek Ranch is closely associated with the Catch-A-Dream Foundation. Catch-A-Dream grants once-in-a-lifetime hunting and fishing experiences to children 18 years old or younger who have a life-threatening illness.  Our fourth stop was at the Andrew Jackson Farm, located in Wentworth. Similar to many farms in our district, the Andrew Jackson Farm is a family owned operation that has been passed down over three generations. They were proud to show us their show goats as well as the day-to-day hard work that goes into operating a family farm.  The fifth and final stop of our agriculture tour was Gleonda Angus Farms in Miller. Similar to the Andrew Jackson Farm, Gleonda Angus Farms has been passed down for generations since 1917. The Gleonda Angus Farms has expanded its operations from only raising cattle to opening their first farm store. It was great to see yet another family farm and how its operations change over time, but the mission remains the same.  The men and women I met with during the agriculture tour were another reminder of the important job I have in Washington to reduce red tape for this industry.

Secretary of the Army Visits Picatinny Arsenal My Longstanding work with the Army Corps of Engineers Salute: Harry Ettlinger, a Monumental Man   
Secretary of the Army Visits Picatinny Arsenal
Yesterday, I was pleased to welcome the Secretary of the Army, Mark Esper, to Picatinny Arsenal.  In a letter earlier this year, I invited Secretary Esper to visit the Arsenal to gain a better understanding of how this vital installation contributes to the strategic readiness of the Army as well as the Navy, Marines and our Special Forces.
I have been privileged to represent the men and women of Picatinny Arsenal for almost 24 years in Congress.  Every time I pass through the Cannon Gates I learn about another technological marvel the scientists, engineers and technicians here discovered and fielded to our warfighters to ensure we maintain our advantage against our adversaries on the battlefield. I am pleased Secretary Esper was able to see, firsthand, this tremendous institution and its critically important work.
Secretary Esper and I were accompanied by Brigadier General Alfred Abramson, Commander Picatinny Arsenal and PEO Ammunition and Mr. John Hedderich, Director US Army Armament Research and Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC).  We received presentations on a sampling of technologies, including several lethality integration efforts that Picatinny develops and manages for the Department of Defense.
Picatinny is designated the Joint Center of Excellence for Guns and Ammunition, providing products and services to all branches of the U.S. military. The Arsenal provides 90 percent of the Army's lethality and also works closely with the Navy, Marines, Air Force, our special operations community and the armed forces of partner nations.
 
My Longstanding work with the Army Corps of Engineers  
When I was sworn into Congress 24 years ago, I was honored to be selected by my colleagues to serve on the Appropriations Committee, which included being placed on the Energy and Water Subcommittee.  Throughout the vast majority of my tenure in Congress, I served on this critical subcommittee, becoming the Ranking Member (2007-2010) and eventually the Chairman (2011-2014).  Even today, as my responsibilities have broadened considerably as Chairman of the full Appropriations Committee, I take special interest in the work done by the subcommittee and its excellent Chairman, Mike Simpson (ID).  
The Subcommittee has the all-important responsibility for funding the Department of Energy (DOE), including our vital military and civilian nuclear energy programs, as well as, the Army Corps of Engineers.  Through my 24 years of work on this committee my guiding principal was “what can I do for New Jersey.” Each and every year, our annual spending bills supported Corps projects that protect New Jersey communities and help grow our state’s economy.
As you may know, the responsibilities of the Army Corps of Engineers include protecting our nation from natural disasters and responding when emergencies occur, while also maintaining our infrastructure and navigable waterways like ports, rivers and harbors, developing recreational sites and promoting environmental stewardship.
As one of New Jersey’s only members on the Appropriations Committee, I worked hand in hand with the entire New Jersey delegation, regardless of political party, to provide funding for critical Corps projects across the state. I met regularly with other members and their constituencies to learn about these projects, as well as, hosting the Commanders of both the Philadelphia and New York Districts, and Corps leadership in Washington, to receive updates on their progress in our state.
In no other time was my bipartisan cooperation with the members of New Jersey’s Congressional delegation, as well as, delegations from the surrounding states, more important than in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.
We all remember how Superstorm Sandy destroyed entire neighborhoods, left thousands homeless and created a path of destruction that we are still recovering from. But, the New Jersey Delegation, banded together, rallying support from across the entire Congress to approve the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act in 2013, which included the “Frelinghuysen Amendment,” increasing spending in the bill by $33 billion to help immediately respond to the disaster and sustain a long-term recovery in New Jersey and New York.
The funds included in my amendment and other annual appropriations bills are being used to complete a tremendous amount of work that will lower the storm risk for many communities. This includes support for dozens of beach and flood control projects from Cape May to Sandy Hook, as well as a number of projects along the Passaic River Basin in northern New Jersey.
Another, example of the historic and bipartisan work to benefit our state includes my 20 year effort to complete the Harbor Deepening Project at the Port of New York and New Jersey.  Largely through my efforts on the Energy and Water Subcommittee, the federal government provided close to $900 million to deepen the channels through the port to 50 feet allowing the newest generation of container cargo ships to access our region, ensuring the port maintains its vital role as an economic engine providing thousands of jobs and creating billions of dollars.
You can learn more about the great work that is being done by the Corps in our state by visiting the New York District website here and the Philadelphia District website here.
 
Salute: Harry Ettlinger, a Monumental Man
This week, we pay a fond farewell to Harry Ettlinger, formally of Rockaway Township.  A friend of long standing, that I met years ago as a ‘patron’ member of the Jewish War Veterans (JWV), Harry Ettlinger, never told me over numerous, riotously funny breakfasts of our Leon E. Cones JWV Post, of his status as a ‘Monument Man’.
When he did, he downplayed his role, but showed me an old photograph of him in uniform by a cave that he had saved, which figured prominently in the recent book by Robert Edsel (my inscribed copy is at the Morris County Library, a gift).
He had a funny, sparkling sense of humor, and when I asked him over twenty years of lox and bagels, of his critical role of saving some of the world’s most valuable art treasures from destruction by the Nazis, or theft from others who knew where they were hidden, he said he was just doing his job. A most ‘unusual job,’ he said!
He is indeed a monumental figure who will never be forgotten!
You can read more about Harry’s remarkable life in the Daily Record article here.

Helping deliver quality health care

Dear Lindsey,
Protecting patient-centric health care for Minnesotans is a top priority of mine, and I’ve taken numerous votes and drafted or supported various pieces of legislation to this end.
Many of my colleagues and I have voted time and time again to establish a health care system that protects the most vulnerable Americans—the elderly, children, and those with preexisting conditions.
For example, throughout my time in Congress, I have voted to reauthorize funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), so families in need can make sure their children have access to the care they need.
Additionally, I’ve supported protections to Medicare for current and future beneficiaries, while also working to expand the program. I am a cosponsor of the “Protecting Seniors Access to Medicare Act”, which repeals the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) established under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), due to the concern that the board will end up independently reducing Medicare payments—or denying coverage—without proper Congressional approval.
I have also worked to expand Medicare to include reimbursements for various telemedicines, including stroke telemedicine in the “Creating Opportunities Now for Necessary and Effective Care Technologies (CONNECT) Act” and the “Furthering Access to Stroke Telemedicine Act of 2017”. It is critical that Medicare begins to encourage and cover newer technologies that increase care and streamline costs.  
Earlier this session, my Republican colleagues and I worked to pass health care reforms that would help meet the individual needs of families in Minnesota and across the country. Under this legislation, we also made sure that those with preexisting conditions were guaranteed issue and renewability of coverage of their health care plans (Section 137 of H.R. 1628).  Unfortunately, this effort was eventually blocked in the Senate.
Moving forward, Americans deserve to have health care coverage that works for them and their unique needs, and I’m proud to have supported so many efforts to deliver expanded access to quality and affordable care.
As I work on this and other issues, I always like to hear directly from you.  Please share any thoughts you may have through my website, and sign up for my e-mail newsletter for the latest updates from Washington, D.C. and around the district. You can also stay on top of my work by following my Facebook and Twitter pages. Please feel free to call my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-2271 or my local Burnsville office at 651-846-2120 with any comments or for assistance with a federal agency.

Sincerely,

￼ 
 
Broadband Investment On The Rise Again 
This week, US Telecom released a report that shows investments in broadband deployment increased by $76.3 billion in 2017, which is $1.5 billion more than the industry saw in 2016. This increase comes after a two-year decline during which annual broadband capital expenditures fell a total of $3.2 billion, when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) moved to impose common carrier regulatory classification—commonly known as Title II—on broadband providers in 2015. This incredible growth is a result of a series of pro-investment steps taken by the FCC, and our pro-growth republican-led policies in Congress. As Chair of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee, I have been working with my colleagues in Congress on both sides of the aisle to remove barriers and cut red tape in order to enable more private sector broadband investment. I have been especially focused on getting more broadband deployed in rural Tennessee, where the digital divide remains all too real. While there is still much more work to be done, this report is encouraging news and proves that our pro-growth policies are working!
President Trump Signs Landmark Opioid Package Into Law 

On Wednesday, President Trump signed into law the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act.  This bipartisan landmark package of solutions will provide critical support to Tennessee communities struggling with the opioid crisis. It will give those fighting on the front lines new tools to treat addiction and will slow the flow of illicit drugs being imported across our borders. 
￼
Two of my bills were included in the final package.  The best way to keep these dangerous drugs off the streets is to keep them from entering the country in the first place, so my bill, the Stop Illicit Drug Importation Act, streamlines and enhances the Food and Drug Administration’s tools to stop dangerous drugs like fentanyl from coming into the U.S. through the international mail.  The Medicaid DRUG Improvement Act ensures states have tools in place to prevent opioid addiction for their Medicaid enrollees, while also giving states the flexibility to determine the best approach for their programs.
Another provision I championed, the IMD CARE Act, reforms a Medicaid provision that prevented people with substance use disorders (SUD) from receiving treatment in most residential facilities.  This critical change will ensure that patients are able to receive the right care in the right setting so they can be successful in their recovery.

The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act boosts resources for law enforcement, ensuring that our first responders have the tools and training they need as they respond to this crisis and work to get these drugs off the streets.  The bill also removes barriers that prevent people from getting the treatment they need to get better. Thank you, President Trump, for signing these solutions into law and helping us continue our fight against this epidemic in Tennessee and across the country. 

2018 Champion of Music Award 

On Wednesday, we were delighted to welcome local members of the Recording Academy to our office during their district advocacy day, and I was so grateful to be presented with the 2018 Champion of Music Award! I have had the great honor and privilege of representing the Nashville area for many years - a place where men and women from across the globe have flocked to chase their dreams. After achieving near impossible levels of success, these artists deserve to be fairly compensated for their work. That’s why throughout my time in Congress, I have been a champion for singers, songwriters, producers, and everyone else who is a part of the creative process. And that’s why I was so thrilled to finally get the Music Modernization Act signed into law earlier this month - a solution that I worked on for more than five years.  
￼
This law is one of the most significant pieces of copyright legislation ever passed, and will help make the internet and the digital marketplace a fairer place for music artists of all kinds.

Cutting Red Tape 

Working together with Congress, the Trump administration has achieved historic levels of regulatory reform and repeal. Recently, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a report detailing some of these successes. For fiscal year 2018, federal agencies achieved $23 billion in net regulatory cost savings across the government, issuing 176 deregulatory actions and just 14 significant regulatory actions - a 12 to 1 ratio. And since January 2017, a total of 2,253 regulatory actions have been delayed or withdrawn.  
￼

In Congress, we used the Congressional Review process to repeal 17 Obama-era regulations, which saved the American economy $4.1 billion in costs. We promised to drain the swamp in Washington, which meant taking undue power away from bureaucrats who never face voters, and giving it back to you - the American people, and your elected representatives. I will continue to defend this country against harmful and unnecessary regulations that make it harder for Tennessee families and small business owners to get ahead.

White House Announces National Spectrum Strategy 

On Thursday, the White House announced it will create a National Spectrum Strategy to improve spectrum management and support next-generation networks. Spectrum refers to the radio frequencies allocated to the mobile industry and other sectors for communication over the airwaves. The advent of 5G wireless technologies means higher speeds and greater connectivity and convenience for all Americans, but will only be possible with the effective and efficient management of spectrum. I commend the White House for taking this critical step to develop a National Spectrum Strategy, which will in turn help ensure that there is enough spectrum to handle increases in internet and wireless traffic, secure U.S. leadership in 5G, and unleash innovations of the future. The Trump administration has also called for the creation of a Spectrum Strategy Task Force and asked federal agencies to review how spectrum can be shared with private sector users. The world is on the cusp of the 5G revolution, and we stand ready to ensure America leads the way in innovation and investment.

National Prescription Drug Take Back Day 

The DEA is hosting a National Prescription Drug Take Back Day tomorrow, Saturday, October 27 from 10:00 am until 2:00 pm. Our state and our country continues to fight the opioid and drug abuse epidemic, and I encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity to remove any unwanted, unused, or expired prescription medications in your home and bring them to one of the Take Back Day sites.

Friends, 
This week we have much to be thankful for. I, for one, am thankful for the hardworking men and women of our law enforcement institutions and their efforts to catch the perpetrator who sought to harm our nation's public servants. This behavior will not be tolerated, and I am confident that law enforcement officials will bring them to justice. Moving forward, we must maintain order and respect for one another regardless of political affiliation. We cannot let fear and anger overcome our humanity.
I am also thankful for the recent rise in real wages for low-income workers. This week's economic reports show that wages for the bottom 10% of full-time wage and salary workers have averaged 4.9% annual growth over the past four quarters. The number of applications for unemployment benefits dropped last week, especially amongst women. For the last two decades, the share of prime-aged women participating in our labor force has been in decline, but we have begun to see a reversal of this trend over the past three years. Our strong economy has brought labor-force participation among women aged 25 to 54 up to 75.2%. 
Current-dollar personal income increased $180.4 billion in the third quarter, with personal savings resting at $999.6 billion. Deregulation and tax reform are bringing millions of jobs and opportunities back to those who need them most!

Disaster Relief
Last Friday, President Trump announced a Federal Disaster Declaration for counties in Kansas impacted by the major weather events over Labor Day weekend. The severe storms consisting of straight-line winds, and flooding which hit Riley, Clay and Marshall Counties, damaged people’s homes, buildings and businesses, and the local infrastructure. The President's disaster declaration allocates federal funds, on a cost-sharing basis, to aid in the recovery and reconstruction of these communities. This will certainly help in the rebuilding process, but it is critical that we also recognize our state and local emergency response teams who assisted during the storms and floods, and have continued to help residents and property owners during this challenging time of clean up and repair.

￼
Bringing Order to 
the Border
On Thursday, President Trump firmly stated that the Honduran migrant caravan will not be allowed to enter the country illegally. Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, is expected to order 800 American troops to reinforce vulnerable areas along the border. Regardless of political affiliation, it is clear that our current immigration laws are broken. As elected officials, we must set aside partisan bickering and develop a solution to this urgent crisis. I have sympathy for those working to enter the U.S., but we are a country of laws that must be upheld. Without national security and clearly defined borders, our country would cease to exist.
            
￼
A Prescription 
for Hope
This week, President Trump signed the most significant measure against a single drug crisis in history! Having been classified as a national Public Health Emergency earlier this month, I am thrilled to see we are tackling the Opioid Crisis head-on. H.R. 6, known as The Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, fights drug trafficking on our borders, improves access to treatment centers, and educates prescribers, as well as veterans, on the addictive properties of certain drugs. Of course, there is still much work to be done on the state level, but this is a major leap towards creating healthier American communities.  

￼
World Polio Day
October 25th was World Polio Day: a fantastic opportunity to renew our promise to every child who suffers from this debilitating disease. This year's theme, Bold Steps to End Polio, focused on the tremendous progress that has been made in creating a polio-free world. Developing countries such as Nigeria have gone two years without new diagnoses, while others such as Afghanistan and Pakistan only encountered 22 cases in the past year. The World Health Organization, in conjunction with its partners in the United Nations Children's Fund, Rotary International, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and U.S. Centers for Disease Control, will continue working alongside governments and frontline health care workers to annihilate polio for good.

Dear Friend, 
This week, the working conditions of pregnant employees at Memphis’ XPO Logistics warehouse became national news and I continued to work toward solutions. I also praised the Memphis Business Journal’s “40 Under 40” honorees, let you know Open Enrollment at HealthCare.gov begins next week, expressed concern about the bombs sent to current and former public officials and other public figures, drew historic parallels between Watergate and Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe, watched as the President misled the public about a caravan of migrants from Central America, expressed dismay at the President’s disgraceful reaction to the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, held a “Congress On Your Corner” at Parkway Village, noted that Saturday is ""National Prescription Drug Take Back Day,"" invited veterans to my annual Veterans Day event, offered U.S. Capitol Society calendars to Memphians and provided a health tip involving childhood vaccinations in honor of World Polio Day. Keep reading to learn more about my week and follow me on Twitter and Facebook to see more updates as they happen.  
Seeking Solutions to Working Conditions at XPO Logistics    Honoring Memphis Business Journal’s “40 under 40”  Previewing 2019 Plans on HealthCare.gov  Expressing Concern about Pipe Bombs  Recalling Saturday Night Massacre  Reacting as President Misleads Public on Central American Caravan  Responding to Trump’s Evolving Reaction to the Murder of Jamal Khashoggi  Holding “Congress On Your Corner”  Noting Saturday's ""National Prescription Drug Take Back Day""  Inviting Vets to My Annual Veterans Day Event  Offering U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars  Signing Up for “Congress On Your Corner” and this e-Newsletter  Weekly Health Tip  Quote of the Week  


Seeking Solutions to Working Conditions at XPO Logistics 
On Sunday, The New York Times took note of an ongoing dispute over working conditions at XPO Logistics’ southeast Memphis warehouse, bringing to light a history of alleged pregnancy discrimination, sexual harassment, and unsafe and hazardous working conditions. The exposé further detailed stories of women whose horrific experiences dealing with grueling heat, and strenuous physical labor, in some cases despite the explicit recommendation from medical professionals for their patients’ employers to lighten their duties, led to miscarriages. Last October, another Memphis XPO Logistics worker at the same warehouse, Linda Neal, died of heat exhaustion after management denied her medical aid, before she passed out and even after she had lost consciousness. Twice earlier this month, I went to the warehouse to talk with constituents who allege that company employees are being sexually harassed and work in unsafe conditions. I also wrote to the company’s CEO with my concerns and notified the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the U.S.Department of Labor. I am endeavoring to hold a meeting with all parties in the near future and intend to bringthe matter to the attention of my Congressional colleagues on the House Education and the Workforce Committee to urge them to investigate and exercise oversight into the conditions at XPO Logistics in Memphis and nationwide.  
Honoring Memphis Business Journal’s “40 under 40” 
￼ 
This week, the Memphis Business Journal named its annual ""40 Under 40"" honor roll, and I want to congratulate them all. I was pleased to see my former Senior Legislative Assistant and transportation expert Michael Fulton, now the Government Affairs Director at the Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority, recognized for his exceptional skills. I also want to give a shout-out to my friends State Representative Raumesh Akbari and Shelby County Commissioner Tami Sawyer for being named to this prestigious list. This younger generation of leaders is making Memphis a better place. 
Previewing 2019 Plans on HealthCare.gov 
￼ 
Starting Friday, consumers are able to preview 2019 plans and prices before Open Enrollment for health care under the Affordable Care Act begins this coming Thursday. As in previous years, window shopping lets consumers browse plans without logging in, creating an account, or filling out the official application.  Starting Thursday, November 1, consumers can log in to HealthCare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596 to fill out an application and enroll in a 2019 Exchange health plan. This year, open enrollment runs only through December 15. I will be making use of every possible means to make my constituents aware that the time available to sign up has been limited compared to the enrollment periods during the Obama Administration -- six weeks shorter than it was in 2016. For more information on signing up for health care, see Healthcare.gov. 
Expressing Concern about Pipe Bombs 
All week I have been dismayed that pipe bombs have been sent to prominent current and former elected officials and other public figures in what has so far been, mercifully, a series of unsuccessful terror attacks. I am grateful for the continued hard work of law enforcement to safely remove the bombs and investigate and bring to justice those responsible. 
Recalling Saturday Night Massacre 
￼ 
Last Saturday, October 20, was the 45th anniversary of the Saturday Night Massacre when Richard Nixon tried to get his Attorney General to fire the Special Prosecutor looking into Watergate. The parallels to the perilous situation we are in today are obvious and troubling as a potentially vulnerable Special Counsel Robert Mueller continues to look into Russian interference in the 2016 election. It is clear we must pass the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act (H.R. 5476) I have cosponsored so the Mueller investigation, which has already produced guilty pleas and felony convictions among President Trump’s inner circle, can proceed to its conclusion.
Reacting as President Misleads Public on Central American Caravan  
All week, I followed the confused and misleading reaction of the President to a caravan heading north from Central America. At one point, he claimed “Middle Easterners” were part of the group but, when challenged by the press, acknowledged he had “no proof.” This irresponsible language is unacceptable but shows the importance of a free press. Trump’s effort to frighten the public with misleading, dishonest and made up stories needs to be called out. 
Responding to Trump’s Evolving Reaction to the Murder of Jamal Khashoggi 
The President has moved 180 degrees from first appearing to accept Saudi Arabia’s claims that Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi left its Istanbul consulate unharmed to now finding plausible that the Saudis killed him.I have signed on to several letters to the Trump Administration and to the Saudi government urging a full and fair investigation in this matter and ensuring that the perpetrators are brought to justice. The President has so far failed to stand on principle and show the Saudis that America doesn’t tolerate and will punish this kind of thuggery.    
Holding “Congress On Your Corner”  

As your representative in Congress, part of my job is making sure your concerns and issues with federal agencies and federal benefits are dealt with fairly and expeditiously. My office held a “Congress On Your Corner” event Friday at the Parkway Village Branch Library to help with Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits and military service issues, Small Business Administration (SBA) loans and services, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) home loans, federal grant applications, visa and passports, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issues and more.  My office will hold an evening “Congress On Your Corner” for those who can’t make our daytime events, on Monday, November 26, at the Benjamin Hooks Central Library, 3030 Poplar, from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m.  
Noting Saturday is ""National Prescription Drug Take Back Day"" 
Saturday is the federal Drug Enforcement Administration's ""National Prescription Drug Take Back Day."" It is a coordinated opportunity to get rid of extra pills that may be sitting around, including and especially prescription opioids, to reduce the risk of misuse.

Inviting Vets to My Annual Veterans Day Event 
￼

Weekly Health Tip 
￼ 

Each week, I share a health tip in the hope of promoting a healthy lifestyle for residents of the 9th Congressional District. As always, it is best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine or lifestyle. 
Wednesday was World Polio Day, set on the October 24 birthdate of virologist Jonas Salk who first developed a vaccine against the crippling disease.  This year’s recognition of World Polio Day marks the 27th year that polio has been eradicated from the Americas. Over the past 30 years, we have reduced the number of confirmed cases of polio 99.9 percent -- from 350,000 in 1988 to just 22 last year. The worldwide effort to rid the planet of this scourge is led by the United Nations’ World Health Organization. Read about its efforts here. As someone who was stricken with polio in my youth, I know how important vaccines are.  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends children get vaccinated against polio at appropriate ages.  The CDC’s recommendations can be found here. 
Quote of the Week  
￼  
“Our Republic and its press will rise or fall together. An able, disinterested, public-spirited press, with trained intelligence to know the right and the courage to do it can preserve that public virtue without which popular government is a sham and mockery. A cynical, mercenary, demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself. The power to mold the future of the republic will be in the hands of the journalists of future generations.” – Joseph Pulitzer, North American Review, May 1904 (Plaque in the lobby of the Columbia School of Journalism in New York City). 
As always, 
I remain 
Most sincerely,

Breast Cancer Awareness October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, a time where we honor and remember our family and friends whose lives have been impacted by breast cancer. While investments in treatments and new technologies have contributed to a decline in the number of breast cancer deaths in the U.S., it is still a leading cause of cancer death among women.  This is personal to me and all the Michiganders who know someone, or are suffering themselves, from this disease. That is why I am committed to raising awareness and supporting investments in research, treatments, and early detection of breast cancer. In September, I voted for, and the President signed in to law, a bill that increases funding for the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion and provides increased funding for the DOD Breast Cancer Research Program. As October comes to an end, let us commit once again to finding a cure and raising awareness for breast cancer.  
Rural Broadband Many rural communities in Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula lack access to high-speed broadband and internet services. In today’s world, this technology is a necessity for economic growth and a better quality of life. Earlier this month Michigan based, Packerland Broadband, completed a deployment of expanded broadband internet in the Upper Peninsula. The introduction of upgraded internet connections is a critical next step for the future of Michigan’s First District. I recently joined several of my colleagues in introducing legislation that would incentivize companies to bring broadband to underserved areas.  Greater connectivity means an improved standard of living and more opportunities for things like digital education, telemedicine and business development.  Great Lakes  Last month, I had the distinct honor of being named Great Lakes Legislator of the Year by the Great Lakes Maritime Taskforce. The Great Lakes are the economic lifeblood of Michigan’s First District, and I have made it a priority to promote their health and security. Just this week, the President signed the America’s Water Infrastructure Act, which included authorization for a new Poe-sized lock at the Soo Locks. This legislation also provides increased resources for harbor maintenance and dredging, research for eradicating Asian Carp and Zebra Mussels, and increased efforts for monitoring unregulated contaminates in our water systems.  
Opioid Legislation  This week, President Trump also signed in to law, H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, our next step in addressing the opioid epidemic. In Michigan, we have not been immune to the devastating impacts of substance use disorder; I’ve heard from members of our communities from recovering addicts, caretakers, medical professionals and law enforcement, about what the needs are locally and how we can work together to end addiction. H.R. 6 provides increased access to treatment, more resources for families in crisis, and better tools to prevent fraud and abuse within our nation’s prescription drug supply chain. I am proud of the bipartisan work done so far, but I know there is still much to be done if we want to end this epidemic once and for all.

The Hill Report   A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions Week of October 22 - October 26, 2018
This week, President Trump signed into law two critical pieces of legislation that I supported to protect North Texans and improve the future of all Americans. On Tuesday, the Water Resources Development Act of 2018 became law, ensuring the health of our water resources infrastructure. In North Texas, we know firsthand the importance of strong water infrastructure, not only when it comes to economic growth and success, but also the safety of our communities from potential flooding disasters. Specifically, this package responsibly reauthorizes the Levee Safety Initiative and the National Dam Safety Program through 2023 to help protect American communities and families from losing everything when these destructive natural disasters strike.  The President also signed into law H.R. 6, SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, to combat the opioid epidemic. This package of bills marks the most significant congressional action against a single drug crisis in our nation's history. I strongly supported this lifesaving legislation and am glad to see another monumental step taken toward fighting this public health crisis and ending America's deadliest drug epidemic.   These new laws are just one example of Republicans upholding our promise to deliver results over rhetoric. From rolling back the red-tape regulations issued by the previous Administration to unleashing the free market with unprecedented tax cuts, we are committed to continuing to improve the lives of all Americans. We have also approved millions of dollars in funding for border security to ensure the safety of our communities, especially in Texas, where we feel the impact of the border crisis most. Congress also passed federal funding legislation for over 80% of all annual discretionary funding before the end of the fiscal year – a critical step in reining in spending and returning to the regular federal funding process.

Events in the District  Wylie High School  Last Friday, I was delighted to join my friends in Wylie to perform the coin flip for this year’s Wylie HS vs. Rowlett HS matchup. I have always believed that participating in team sports teaches invaluable life lessons like teamwork, trust, accountability and commitment to our young men and women, and it was great to join these two wonderful schools for some North Texas Friday Night Lights. While the home team was able to jump out to a lead and hold on for the win, I applaud both teams, their coaches, the school administrators, and the parents who showed up in the rain to cheer their team on for a great competitive game. 
￼  Congressman Sessions at the Wylie High School vs. Rowlett High School Football Game.  
'Tax Cuts Work' Tour  In Texas, we believe that fewer regulations, lower taxes, and more freedom are the keys to success. This week, I was delighted to spend time with North Texans and participate in a rally, hosted by the Job Creators Network, that highlighted the tremendous benefits of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Hearing the testimonies this week given by small business owners, doctors, job creators, and families in my district who have both seen the effects of tax reform and been able to keep more of their hard-earned money each month, is the reason why my colleagues and I will continue working to lower taxes and produce real results on behalf of the American people. My efforts are far from over.

Protecting North Country History 
￼  
Today I visited Fort Ticonderoga as they unveiled their upcoming expansion. I’m proud to help secure nearly $250,000 in federal funding through the Institute of Museum and Library Services’ (IMLS) Museums for America Grant program to assist Fort Ticonderoga in this important effort. Our region thrives on the tourism and commerce we generate from our unique historical heritage, and Fort Ticonderoga is a pillar of our area’s culture. As a child, I remember spending many days at Fort Ticonderoga with my brother and parents, exploring the grounds and watching historical reenactments. The expansion we announced today is great news not only for our tourism economy, but for the countless families like my own that will be enriched through the educational programs at Fort Ticonderoga. Thank you to everybody who joined us today, and thank you to all the board members, volunteers and the Ticonderoga community for their continued support of the Fort and its mission. 
IMLS grants are essential for protecting our rich North Country history and for sharing our way of life with visitors from around the world. I’m cosponsoring the Museum and Library Services Act, which provides critical support to museums like Fort Ticonderoga, libraries, and other educational organizations through a variety of funding streams. To learn more about this legislation, click here. 
Strengthening North Country Communities 
￼  
This week, I joined Learning, Employment, Assistance & Partnership (LEAP), the Community Action Agency in Washington County, at a Community Action Roundtable where I was recognized for my efforts to increase funding for the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) program. CSBG grants are critical for local agencies working to tackle issues ranging from poverty to combating the heroin and opioid epidemic, and we must prioritize their funding. 
I am grateful to Washington County LEAP and the numerous community organizations that attended the Community Action Roundtable to discuss the implementation of CSBG funding and presented ideas for future projects to help those in need. I will continue working in Congress to ensure the CSBG program is supported so that our district’s low-income families receive the resources they need to thrive. Click here to read more about the roundtable. 
Ticonderoga Elementary School 
￼ 
I had a great visit to Ticonderoga Elementary School this afternoon. The staff at Ticonderoga Elementary work hard to ensure our students are well-prepared to continue their education in the years ahead, and I’m grateful to see their work firsthand. I'll keep working in Congress to ensure our schools have the support they need to help students succeed.
Combating Addiction and Saving Lives 
￼ 
President Trump signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act into law this week. This comprehensive package delivers important support to prevent opioid addiction, encourage treatment and recovery, as well as initiatives that will keep our communities safe. Local organizations like Substance Abuse Prevention and Recovery of Clinton County (SPARCC), the Essex County Heroin and Opioid Prevention Coalition (ECHO), and the Jefferson County Alliance for Better Communities are doing important work in the fight against this epidemic, and I am proud to be their partner in Congress. I will continue working to advance policies that promote recovery and save lives. Click here to read more about the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. 
￼ 
National Prescription Drug Take Back Day is tomorrow, October 27th from 10:00 am to 2:00 pm. Prescription drug abuse touches our communities in ways that have grave effects on everyday lives. National Prescription Drug Take Back Day represents an important opportunity to raise awareness of prescription drug abuse by disposing unused, unwanted, or expired prescription drugs at participating collection sites. To find collection sites across the North Country, click here.

10/26/18 15:00,Harvey Dent Said It Best.,"￼
This week, I had the honor of giving the 2018 Joseph Story Distinguished Lecture at the Heritage Foundation. The Heritage Foundation is one of the most important institutions in our nation’s capital. For decades, it has led the way in promoting policies that advance freedom, prosperity, and individual liberty.
For my address, I thought it would be appropriate, and timely, to share my thoughts on the politicization of the judicial confirmation process. In my 42 years on the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have participated in the confirmation of over half of all federal judges who have ever served, including all sitting members of the United States Supreme Court. 
￼ 
Click Here to Hear My Thoughts About the Confirmation Process 
I’ve seen a lot of judicial nominees in my time. I wish I could say the confirmation process has improved, or at least stayed about the same, but it hasn’t. It’s declined—precipitously. The judicial confirmation process, simply put, is a mess.
It hasn’t always been this way. Both sides used to work together, or at the very least, used to try to treat each other’s nominees fairly. The delay tactics that have become so commonplace used to be pretty rare. 
Things are just so nasty right now. And unfortunately, I don’t see a way out of it, not as long as both sides are engaged in all-out warfare. If things are going to improve, it’s going to take some real effort at rebuilding trust, and perhaps a leap of faith or two. The last time we saw this was when the Senate minority decided to work with the White House to give the President’s Supreme Court nominees a fair shake. I led that effort. I think it was good for the country. 
I’m hopeful something like that can happen again. I can’t say I’m optimistic that it will, but things can change. As our good friend Harvey Dent likes to say, the night is darkest just before the dawn. 
 
Sincerely,
  ￼ 
Orrin

Supporting a Stronger and Safer 7th District 
 


Dear Neighbor, 
This week, I was proud to join House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady at Three Brothers Bakery to celebrate the largest tax cut in history.  
￼
 The average family in our area is keeping an additional $2,700 per year of their hard-earned paychecks because of last year’s tax cuts. It is money that can be used for a mortgage payment, a down-payment on a car, or to save for their children’s education. 
These tax cuts, coupled with the money I secured in last year’s disaster relief bill for Harvey survivors, will further support the flourishing economy and the resilient spirit of every Houstonian in District Seven. 
I’m very grateful for Janice and Robert Jucker’s hospitality at their Braeswood bakery location. Three Brothers has endured hardship, including four floods, Hurricane Harvey, and a fire. Throughout every disaster, the bakery continued to pay their employees, and it never once occurred to them not to rebuild. They exemplify the true Houstonian spirit.  In addition to my work to ensure our community becomes stronger than before Harvey, I am focused on making District Seven safer for our kids. Each year, more than 11 million Americans abuse or misuse prescription pain medicines. In many cases, unused or expired prescription drugs in family and friends’ medicine cabinets become the source for many to start and continuously fuel their addiction. Everyone knows old leftovers in your refrigerator can make you sick. But leftover drugs in your medicine cabinet can be much more harmful—they can kill.  
￼
 Twice a year, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) proclaims a national day to ask all Americans to safely dispose of unused medication. Each Take Back Day, thousands of pounds of prescription drugs are disposed, helping to prevent incidents of drug abuse and misuse across the nation. At last year’s National Take Back Day, the DEA collected a record-breaking 900,000 pounds of prescription drugs, more than the weight of three Boeing 757s. 
Tomorrow on National Take Back Day, police stations, retail pharmacies, and community centers will be hosting prescription drug take back events at over 4,000 locations. You can find a local drop off site to return your unused medication here.  
I encourage you to go to your medicine cabinet and check for any unused or expired medications, including opioids. If you cannot make it to a drop off site tomorrow, many retail pharmacies have drug disposal programs on site, and you can request mail-in disposal envelopes here. Let’s fight together to keep these drugs off our streets.
To let me know your thoughts on these or any other issues, you can email me here.
It is an honor and privilege to represent you and Texas in the United States House.   Sincerely,   ￼  John Culberson

The Veterans History Project
If you are a veteran, or know a veteran, who is interested in telling their story about serving in our nation's military, a great opportunity to do so will be coming to Iowa on November 9. In conjunction with the Library of Congress, I’ll be hosting a “Veterans History Project” event in honor of Veterans Day. The event will take place on November 9, 2018, from 8 a.m. – 4 p.m. CT at the Iowa Gold Star Military Museum in Johnston. 
The Veterans History Project collects and makes accessible firsthand interviews and narratives of United States military veterans from World War I through the present. I am inviting Iowa’s veterans to contribute by participating in a 30-minute to an hour-long taped interview about their military service. Interested veterans should call my Veterans Fellow, Dave Allen, at 515-288-1145 or email him at VeteransFellow_Grassley@grassley.senate.gov to RSVP. Only 32 slots are available and are reserved on a first-come-first-served basis. 
A caseworker from my Des Moines office and a representative from the Veterans Benefits Administration will also be present for all Iowa veterans, regardless of participation in the Veterans History Project, to receive assistance with federal issues.
Family and friends of veterans attending are welcome to join as the museum will be open and free of admission. I will be present at 3 p.m. CT to award veterans service medals and meet with Iowans.  
Iowa has a rich history of service members fighting on behalf of our country. This is an opportunity for Iowa’s veterans to tell their stories and document their contributions to American history for future generations.

Touring Llano River Flood Damage

This week, I got to see some of the catastrophic water damage left behind along the Llano River stretching from Kimble, Mason, and Llano counties. Neither words nor photos do any justice to how devastating this flash flood has been on these families and communities. To see homes completely gutted with all of some folks’ memories and personal belongings piled up in their front yard, strikes a chord of gratitude in your soul.

While meeting with county officials, community disaster relief volunteers, and state aide— I witnessed what makes this district so special. The heart of Texans and their compassion for their neighbors in need is remarkable. Please take a moment to say a prayer for the flood victims, the recovering communities, the volunteers, and local leaders fighting to reclaim normalcy over the next several months.

You can find more information about resources available to flood victims here.

OCTOBER 26, 2018
￼

￼ 

Dear Friends, 

One thing I hear from residents throughout the Second District is the need to stop our nation's ongoing opioid crisis. Sadly, anyone can fall victim to opioid use disorder, and perhaps you or someone you know has been personally affected by what many are calling the ""crisis next door."" I am proud to say that this week, President Trump signed into law the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6), a package of bills including my own that will combat the opioid crisis.

After hearing from folks around the country, particularly in states like Kentucky who have been hit hardest by this epidemic, my colleagues - Republicans and Democrats alike - came together to address the opioid epidemic from all sides. I introduced the Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers Act (H.R. 5327), which creates a grant program for treatment facilities to offer all FDA-approved treatments for opioid use disorder, as well as to provide residential rehabilitation, recovery housing, and community-based and peer recovery support services. 

This is important because currently, facilities usually offer only one method of treatment - but the opioid epidemic can affect anyone, and there is no one-size-fits-all treatment for substance use disorders. Under the Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers Act, which was included in the final SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, patients will have the option to go to facilities that offer all possible treatments, so they can find what works best for them. 

The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act includes over fifty pieces of legislation focused on prevention, treatment and recovery, protecting communities, and fighting the illicit fentanyl trade. You can read more about the bill here. 

￼


People often ask me what they can do to help combat the opioid crisis in their own communities. One way to do so is through National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. Tomorrow, Saturday, October 27, you can bring your unused prescription drugs to locations throughout the Second District to properly dispose of them. This is a great way to ensure that your prescription drugs do not get into the wrong hands. You can find a full list of locations in the Second District here. 

￼

Finally, as the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act is implemented, federal grants will be available to states, communities, and organizations to help those who are combating the opioid crisis on the ground. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Justice will have more information regarding these grants when they are implemented. For more information regarding the grant application process, you can call my office at 270-842-9896.

Sincerely,

Combating the Opioid Crisis
￼ 
Our country is facing a crisis – one that is destroying families and communities across America, and dishearteningly, one that hits close to home. In 2016, 1,526 Hoosiers died of an opioid overdose.
This week, President Trump signed into law comprehensive legislation to combat the opioid crisis, which I was proud to vote for in the House. In bipartisan fashion, this Congress and the Trump administration have been able to provide local and state officials with more resources than ever before to help prevent and treat those suffering from opioid addiction. Additionally, we are committed to protecting communities and fighting fentanyl. Together, we will work to defeat this crisis and save lives. Click here to learn more about this important new law. 
GI Bill Payment Delays
When we make a promise to our veterans, we have to follow through on it. It is unacceptable that VA would place the education of our veterans in jeopardy by promising them a regular payment, which our veterans rely on, and then allowing excessive delays when payments are due. 
Far too often we find the department’s information technology (IT), which underpins nearly every VA function, is inadequate to deliver on promises made. As Chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Technology Modernization Subcommittee, I am committed to looking across VA and making sure IT systems are being improved in an effective and fiscally responsible manner. 
Chairman Phil Roe recently announced the subcommittee will hold an oversight hearing on VA’s GI Bill payment delays on November 14.

Dear Friend,  Did you know that in 2016 alone 1,375 Texans died from an opioid overdose? Almost half of those deaths were from prescription drugs. This Saturday, October 27th, is the DEA’s 16th National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. This event provides a safe, convenient and responsible way for folks to dispose of their extra prescription drugs to help prevent unintended drug overdose or loss of life. On the last Take Back Day, over 949,046lbs of drugs were collected nationwide, with 82,978lbs collected in Texas alone, the most out of any state.   On Saturday, there will be multiple collection sites in our district. You can search for the site closest to you here. For more resources and information, visit www.takeback.dea.gov.   I hope you’ll join me this Take Back Day, October 27, as we work together to end the opioid crisis. I'm honored to represent you in Congress. For more information or to sign up for my E-newsletter, please visit my website, www.olson.house.gov.     Very respectfully, Pete Olson

10/26/18 13:05,Blaine’s Bulletin: National Substance Abuse Prevention Month,"￼ 
October 25, 2018

BLAINE'S BULLETIN

I am proud to work alongside my colleagues and the Trump Administration in our effort to fight the opioid crisis, but as I sat down to write this week’s column I reflected on just how hard our country has fought. Each day, one hundred Americans lose their lives to opioid addiction, ripping them from their loved ones. With one in three Missouri families affected by the opioid crisis, this is the fourth time this year that I have shared important news with you regarding the crisis sweeping our nation.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed into law H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act. This law is the latest in a string of comprehensive solutions constituting the most significant congressional effort against a single drug crisis in history.
The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act fights back by providing for expanded access to treatment and recovery services. It also establishes comprehensive opioid recovery centers. The law gives our local law enforcement officials tools to protect us by intercepting opioids and getting them out of our communities. Additionally, it provides grants for local communities to combat the ever-growing dangers of synthetic drugs, such as fentanyl. Finally, this law enhances prescription drug monitoring programs to end high prescribing rates.
Through hard work and cooperation, Congress and the Trump Administration have advanced many solutions to help combat the opioid crisis, but our work is not done. This month marks the seventh annual National Substance Abuse Prevention Month. According to the 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 6.2 million Americans misused controlled prescription drugs.
During the month of October, please do your part to talk to friends, family and loved ones about ways to prevent substance abuse. Studies show that the majority of those 6.2 million Americans obtained drugs from family and friends, or even their home medicine cabinet.
This Saturday, October 27th the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) will hold National Drug Takeback Day, providing an opportunity for you to safely dispose of unused prescription drugs before they become a danger for friends or family. Last year, nearly one million pounds of prescription drugs were collected from more than 5,321 collection sites.
I urge you to check your medicine cabinet for unused opioids such as Vicodin, Oxycontin, Percocet, Opana, tramadol, Kadian or Avinza, just to name a few. If you don’t need it, please safely dispose of your left-over drugs for the safety of your friends and loved ones.
Thankfully, we are on the path to combatting the opioid crisis. With each law we pass, we are one step closer to ending it altogether, but Congress cannot do it alone. I urge everyone in our district to be vigilant. Talk to your family about the dangers of opioid abuse and keep your loved ones safe.
For more information on collection sites near you visit takebackday.dea.gov.

Dear Friends,  
 I hope you're all having a wonderful Friday. There's lots to be proud of this week in Wisconsin. From our strong and growing economy, to our tradition of supplying the nation with our forest products, Wisconsin is leading the way.  Before the weekend starts, let's take a moment to review this momentous week. 
People Are Back To Work In Wisconsin 
For eight straight months now, Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been at or below three percent. And there are more than 100,000 job openings in Wisconsin than there are people looking for work.   Our unemployment rate has never been consistently this low, and there are more Wisconsinites working than ever before.  This is great news for our growing economy! Click HERE or the image below to share the news of Wisconsin's strong workforce. 
￼ 
We're Proud Of Wisconsin Forests! 
Wisconsin is home to 17.1 million acres of forestland and 1,200 forest product companies. These companies help support jobs, families, and towns throughout the state. During National Forest Products Week, we celebrate all that our essential and sustainable forests do for our Wisconsin economy.  Click HERE or the image below to help celebrate National Forest Products Week. 
￼
 Great Opportunity For College Students Or Recent Grads   Attention college students or recent grads: my Washington DC office is now accepting applications for Spring internships. It's a great way to serve your community and get involved in the political process.   For more information on the internship, click HERE or the photo below. Also be sure to share these opportunities with any interested students!

Congresswoman Beatty Celebrates Grand Opening of the National Veterans Memorial and Museum 
Today, Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) celebrated the grand opening of the National Veterans Memorial and Museum in Columbus, Ohio. Beatty pushed for national designation legislation that was eventually signed into law on June 21, 2018.
The museum, located at 300 West Broad Street in Columbus, Ohio, is a civic landmark to honor, connect, inspire and educate all Americans about the service and sacrifice of our nation’s more than 41 million veterans. It is the only public museum of its kind that exists for the exclusive role of sharing the experiences of veterans across all eras, conflicts and branches of the military.
“Over the course of the past three years, I have seen firsthand the National Veterans Memorial and Museum go from dream to reality,” Beatty said. “This museum is the brainchild of former Ohio Senator John Glenn, and I cannot think of a more fitting tribute to him and the many brave men and women who answered the call to serve than this beautiful facility. That is why I was so honored to help earn national designation—and in that spirit want to thank the entire Ohio Congressional Delegation for working together in a bipartisan fashion.” Beatty continued, “As the daughter of a World War II veteran, I know that freedom is certainly not free, and am confident many more Americans will better understand the service and sacrifice of our nation’s veterans on and off the battlefield because of the National Veterans Memorial and Museum.”
￼
The National Veterans Memorial and Museum will open on October 27, 2018.
The museum broke ground for construction in December 2015, following the generous donations from Les and Abigail Wexner, the State of Ohio, Franklin County, and many other foundations and corporations.
The entire Ohio Congressional Delegation were cosponsors of the national designation legislation.

DELIVERING FOR OH-15

As your Representative to Congress, helping to bring federal dollars back to the 15th District to support the priorities in our community is an important job responsibility.  Recently, several organizations across Central and Southeast Ohio have received a number of grants to further their projects and help make our communities safer, healthier, and more prosperous.   
KEEPING SCHOOLS SAFE
￼
As a father, I want to ensure the safety of all of our kids as we send them off to school.  That is why I was a supporter and cosponsor of the STOP School Violence Act, which was signed into law in March.  Following its passage, Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (D-OH) and I led our colleagues from Ohio in a letter to the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to help ensure that our state received grants to prevent school violence before it happens.  Now, Ohio schools are the beneficiaries of nearly $700,000 to provide critical resources for students and teachers to recognize and prevent acts of violence to keep our kids safe.  
MAKING COMMUNITIES HEALTHIER
￼
In 2016, with my support, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) was signed into law so that communities across the country can create unique, tailored solutions and successful collaborations to help their neighbors overcome addiction.  Nowhere is that more evident than in Fairfield County. I was proud to assist in securing a $500,000 grant to implement the Fairfield County Overdose Response Team (Project F.O.R.T.).  This is 50 times the amount the County was originally seeking, and will be used help support survivors of non-fatal drug overdoses, and their families.  It is an important collaboration between law enforcement and first responders, recovery specialists, and more, that will truly impact the Fairfield County community for the better and help save lives. 
ENCOURAGING PROSPERITY
￼
 Photo: Athens News
Time and time again, public-private partnerships have proven to benefit our communities, which is why I am thrilled to have assisted the Voinovich School at Ohio University in securing $750,000 from the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) to support its Social Enterprise Ecosystem (SEE) program.  By encouraging the use of for-profit business strategies to improve social outcomes, SEE focuses on entrepreneurial and business development, workforce development and preparedness, and critical infrastructure, including broadband access.  It is estimated that this grant will result in service to 32 local communities and $3.8 million in economic growth.   
No matter the problem, we know that there is never a one-size-fits-all solution.  That’s why grants are incredibly important: they give communities in the 15th District the flexibility they need to do what is best for their neighbors.  I’m proud to stand as a resource for organizations, and for more information on available federal grants, click here, or call my Washington, D.C. office at (202) 225-2015, my Hilliard office at (614) 771-4968, my Lancaster office at (740) 654-2654, or my Wilmington office at (937) 283-7049.

Going to bat for steelworkers in Cowlitz County
￼
￼
When I was made aware of the tariff issue facing Steelscape in Kalama, I stepped in to help protect the 300-plus jobs there and the supply chain that impacts so many other jobs in our region. Fortunately, I was successful in getting the administration to remove our trusted trade and security ally Australia from the list of target tariffs. I want manufacturing jobs staying right here in Southwest Washington, and I'll work to make sure they do.

It was so fun to join Steelscape’s Family Day celebration last month to meet employees and their families and tour the new Innovation Center.
￼
I also had the privilege to celebrate Bridger Steel’s grand opening at the Port of Kalama recently. It’s refreshing to see growth and good-paying, new jobs come to Southwest Washington. And to Amalak Women’s Service Organization – thank you for the delicious desserts!
Supporting charities doing the most good in our communities
￼
It was an honor to attend the Salvation Army’s ground breaking ceremony earlier this month in Vancouver. The Salvation Army and other charitable organizations are often the first ones to step up and extend a helping hand to the most vulnerable members of our community. 
 
I’m pleased when I'm able to offer support at the federal level to bolster organizations that are doing the most good in our local communities.

ASSISTING SOUTHWEST WASHINGTON RESIDENTS
HELPING A VETERAN SCHEDULE A NEEDED SURGERY

Mr. Jack Cartwright of Onalaska reach out to our office for help because he had been waiting for the Veterans Choice Program (VCP) to authorize a surgery he was told he needed. Our office reached out to the Puget Sound VA asking why he was waiting for so long for authorization to schedule the surgery. We found out the issue was that his VCP consult had expired because too much time had passed since his previous surgery to address a blood clot. We had the VA call him and set up a new consult. Now Mr. Cartwright is out and about following a successful surgery.

Are you having trouble with a federal agency?

If you or someone you know needs assistance with a federal agency, please contact my Vancouver office at 360-695-6292, or through my website jhb.house.gov. While we can't guarantee an outcome, we will try our best to assist in any way we can.

PROUD TO EARN ""GUARDIAN OF SMALL BUSINESS"" AWARD FOR SUPPORTING SOUTHWEST WASHINGTON SMALL BUSINESSES

From craft breweries to tech startups, Southwest Washington boasts some of the most innovative and unique small businesses anywhere. I’m proud to receive the “Guardian of Small Business” award for my work to support the little guys. 

Whether it’s supporting the recent 20% tax savings for small businesses, cutting unnecessary regulations that mire employers from growing their operations, or helping preserve quality health care plans, it's my honor to stand up for small businesses and the contribution they make to Southwest Washington communities.

Fighting to protect and secure our borders
￼
Border Patrol agents block a caravan that illegally entered the United States earlier this year. (Courtesy, U.S. Customs and Border Protection.)
What’s New:  We are a nation of laws and we must not allow illegal immigrants to take advantage of our country. Currently, there is a migrant caravan made up of thousands of Central Americans marching toward our southern border in an attempt to exploit our nation’s laws. The caravan originated in Honduras and has now crossed into Mexico, picking up thousands of people as it heads north. Further, another caravan of thousands of migrants is forming in Guatemala as we speak, preparing to follow suit. These migrant caravans serve as a reminder of the need for stronger border security and the critical importance of ending sanctuary cities in our country.
Why It Matters:  We must protect and secure our borders and individuals who want to enter the United States must do so legally. The rule of law is a fundamental foundation of our country, and it must be protected. Attempting to exploit our laws and cross our borders illegally is a direct attack on our national sovereignty.
We are facing a border crisis with illegal immigrants and drugs – like the meth devastating Montana – entering our country. Millions of illegal immigrants are already harboring in sanctuary cities across the United States. These massive caravans of migrants demonstrate the need to end catch and release and sanctuary cities once and for all. The Department of Homeland Security has confirmed there are individuals within the caravan who are gang members or have significant criminal histories. These caravans must be stopped.
What’s Next:  I support President Trump’s efforts to secure our nation. Further, I strongly support legislation that would withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities and I helped introduce bills that would close the catch and release legal loophole. Rest assured, I will continue fighting to uphold the integrity of our nation’s laws, protect and secure our borders, and keep Montana’s communities safe.

Do you support enforcing the rule of law and preventing the migrant caravan from entering our country?

Dear Lindsey,
Attacks on current and former national leaders are unacceptable. These acts have no place in America. 
 
We may have different backgrounds, have different opinions and have different political affiliations, but an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. 
 
We live in a wonderful country, held together by our Constitution which embodies the God-given right to free speech. Freedom of speech allows us to settle our disagreements with words -- not violence. 
 
What might our Founding Fathers think about the current state of our politics? I often think about what kind of advice the father of our nation, George Washington, might give us today.
 
I recently spoke on the House floor about the need for civility in our public discourse and about Washington's warnings to a future America. The single most important element that holds together our nation is UNITY.
 
If we are to live freely and want to defend the America we know and love, we must act civilly. It is past time to put the country ahead of ourselves.
 
Take a brief moment to invest in civility and watch my remarks on the House floor below:
 
 
￼
As always, it is an honor to serve you in Congress.
God bless,
￼

Dear friends, 
This newsletter provides my constituents with all the necessary information available to enroll in individual health insurance coverage for the upcoming year. Covered California’s open-enrollment period began on October 15, 2018, and continues through January 15, 2018. If you, your family members or friends do not receive health insurance through your employer, you can sign up during this time period. 
Covered California is the only insurance marketplace in California where eligible consumers can receive financial assistance to help pay for their health insurance. According to federal law outlined in the Affordable Care Act, if your annual income is between $16,643 and $48,240 for an individual, or between $33,948 and $98,400 for a family of four, you will qualify for federal tax credits to help you afford your health insurance coverage. Over 1.1 million Californians – many of your neighbors, friends and family – are paying an average of $115 per month to get coverage that has a monthly premium of over $575. This financial help brings coverage within reach for those who do not receive health insurance from their employer or are enrolled in Medicare. 
To sign up, call Covered California’s Service Center at (800) 300-1506. You can also apply online at www.CoveredCA.com, or have a certified enroller contact you through the ‘Help on Demand’ feature. If you have any questions, there is free, confidential assistance offered by more than 20,000 certified agents and enrollers throughout California who stand ready to assist you, and can be found at http://www.coveredca.com/get-help/local/. 
My Palo Alto office is also available to assist you at (650) 323-2984. Although we are prohibited from directly enrolling individuals in health insurance plans, we will have pamphlets from CoveredCA available for your use in the office and can help you find free, confidential and expert help in our community. 
According to Covered California, California’s drop in the uninsured rate represents the largest in the nation for any state, with more than 3.7 million Californians obtaining health insurance coverage through Covered California and Medi-Cal since the Affordable Care Act launched in 2014. Nationally, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the ACA has slashed the uninsured rate almost in half, but we’ve done an even better job in California. 
I remain committed to building on this progress to further reduce the number of uninsured constituents and provide them with affordable health insurance. 
 All my best, ￼  Anna G. Eshoo

10/25/18 18:18,new update:,"￼ 
Lindsey – My job is to serve you, regardless of politics, and make a positive impact in people’s lives.

My staff and I have worked hard to do that – and I’m please to say we’ve delivered for Sacramento County families in a number of ways.

We’ve now helped more than 11,000 people in Sacramento County with everything from Social Security issues to stalled tax refunds. We’ve also helped veterans with housing, supported critical infrastructure projects, helped keep our neighborhoods safe, and much more. That’s what Making Government Work for Sacramento County is all about.

Here's an update on just some of my work. Please feel free to forward this to anyone you know.


Supporting Sacramento County Veterans:

￼
Earlier this year I was honored to present Alan, a Vietnam veteran and Citrus Heights resident, with his Purple Heart.

I’ve cared for veterans as a doctor and have seen their sacrifices firsthand. I’ve been working to fix problems at the VA since my first month in office and have directed my office to do all it can to help local veterans and servicemembers.

• Helping Veterans’ access their earned benefits and health care: My office has now helped more than 2,600 service members and veterans in Sacramento County with their backlogged benefits, health care issues, and more. We’ve also helped recover more than $2.3 million owed to servicemembers and veterans in our region. 

• Completing the Mather Veterans Village for homeless and disabled veterans: I worked with local community leaders to make the new Mather Veterans Village a reality. My office secured the federal housing vouchers that were needed to complete this project, which provides housing for homeless and disabled veterans.

• Serving local veterans and their families: I helped secure funding for the Volunteers of America of Greater Sacramento and Northern Nevada to serve veterans in our region. This federal grant is helping them prevent veteran homelessness, support health care, and provide child care for veterans.



Honoring Promises to Seniors:

￼

As a doctor, I’ve cared for many seniors and know how much they depend on Medicare and Social Security. We must honor the promises we’ve made to our parents and grandparents so they can have a secure and dignified retirement. 

• Helping local seniors with Social Security and Medicare: We’ve helped more than 1,600 people in our district with their Social Security and Medicare issues. We’ve also helped return more than $1.8 million in earned Social Security and Medicare benefits.

• Protecting Medicare Advantage: More than 100,000 seniors rely on Medicare Advantage in Sacramento County. I introduced and helped pass legislation to roll back a flawed health insurance tax, which saved the average senior enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan $350 in 2017. I’ve also successfully worked with both Republicans and Democrats to stop Medicare Advantage cuts.

• Preventing spikes in Medicare premiums: Many seniors on Medicare Part B were facing a possible 52% increase in their premium costs in 2016. According to the AARP, this would have been the largest premium increase in Medicare’s history. I supported a two year bipartisan budget agreement that prevented this premium spike.


These are just some of the ways we’ve been serving our community over the years – and we’re not done yet. 

It’s a privilege and an honor to serve you in Congress. Please always feel free to contact me.

Be well,
￼
Ami Bera, M.D.
Member of Congress

Dear Lindsey, 
From Quincy to Peoria and many stops in between, it was a great week in the 18th District. I was provided an update on the Quincy Riverfront Development project, joined Peoria veterans leaders in unveiling a new memorial in Peoria, and visited the pumpkin canning facility, Seneca Foods in Princeville, to get a fresh look at what exactly goes into our pumpkin pies! Please continue scrolling along to read about the rest of our week in the 18th District.

A Positive Step Towards Free Trade
￼ 
As I have stated time and time again, free trade is vital to the economic prosperity in Illinois' 18th District. With 95% of the world’s population living outside of the United States, expanding and opening markets around the world for our exporters will allow them to remain competitive in the global economy. The Administration's announced intent to enter trade negotiations with Japan, the EU, and the UK is an important step towards high-standard trade. I look forward to consulting with both the Administration and my colleagues on the Committee on Ways and Means to ensure the needs of farmers and businesses in central and west-central Illinois are priorities in these negotiations.

Honoring Our Veterans
￼  ￼ 
I joined Peoria leaders to unveil the new war memorial downtown named, “The Final Salute.” The memorial honors post-WWII casualties from the Korean War, Vietnam War, Gulf War, as well as current and future conflicts.   Freedom is certainly not free and this memorial will serve as a strong reminder that many members from our community have given the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedoms.   Special thanks to all who attended today, including Medal of Honor recipient Hal Fritz, Memorial Committee Chair Steve Sonnemaker, and Vice-Chair Bruce Thiemann.

Illinois' 18th Congressional District produces almost all of the pumpkins found on store shelves around the country, making central Illinois the pumpkin capital of the world. I had the pleasure of stopping by one of the producers, Seneca Foods in Princeville, to tour their facilities last week. I enjoyed our discussion about the company and the importance of global trade to the agricultural community.

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Due to Senator Baldwin’s continued efforts, bipartisan legislation including a requirement that federally funded water infrastructure projects use American-made iron and steel was signed into law this week. 
Senator Baldwin has long championed stronger Buy America standards and her Made in America Water Infrastructure Act requires that 100 percent American-made iron and steel is used in water infrastructure projects funded by the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. The bipartisan Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) signed into law this week by President Trump includes a five-year extension of Buy America requirements for water infrastructure projects funded by the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. 
“A five-year Buy America standard is better than the status quo and President Trump has taken an important step forward on our shared goal of making sure taxpayer money is not spent supporting foreign workers,” said Senator Baldwin. “I will continue fighting for a permanent Buy America commitment from Washington that rewards our Made in Wisconsin workers and manufacturers.” 
On April 18, 2017, while visiting Kenosha, local media asked President Trump if he supported Senator Baldwin’s permanent Buy America standard. President Trump said “I do,” and also said, “I agree with her 100 percent.” The bipartisan WRDA legislation signed into law this week includes a Buy America requirement through at least 2023. 
“As we invest in our nation’s water infrastructure, American taxpayers expect—now more than ever—that the iron and steel products incorporated into these taxpayer-financed projects will be melted, molded and made in America by American workers and the foundries and mills that employ them,” said Neenah Foundry’s Municipal Products Group Vice President Scott Hoffman. “On behalf of Neenah Enterprises of Neenah, Wisconsin, our deep appreciation goes to Senator Baldwin for her leadership in securing a five-year extension of the procurement preference for American-made iron and steel products for drinking water infrastructure. Senator Baldwin has been a leader on a multitude of Buy America efforts to ensure that taxpayer-financed public infrastructure uses castings produced in American foundries like Neenah.”
The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund is a federal-state partnership that acts as an infrastructure bank to help ensure safe drinking water in all 50 states and territories. Baldwin’s legislation would require all of these projects to use American-made iron and steel. Eligible projects include improving drinking water treatment; fixing or replacing old pipes; improving the source of the water supply; replacing or constructing finished water storage tanks; or any other infrastructure projects needed to protect public health. 
Read more about Senator Baldwin’s leadership to push for a permanent Buy America commitment from Washington that rewards our Made in Wisconsin workers and manufacturers here.

Dear Neighbor,   Too many times in recent years, we’ve learned of a new mass shooting horror - Aurora, Newtown, San Bernardino, Orlando, Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, Parkland, and so many others. Each time we hug our loved ones close and ask, “When will this end?”  We can only reduce the risk of these massacres if Congress acts, but that means a lot more than just holding a moment of silence. It means passing common-sense gun violence prevention legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases. It means no longer letting the NRA get in the way of even the most basic legislation like banning bump-stocks and providing funding for gun violence research. And, I believe, it means acting to remove military-style weapons of war from our communities.  I shared my thoughts with Time recently as part of the magazine’s tremendous Guns in America project. Time journalists interviewed 245 of Americans with varying views on guns and gun violence, as renowned artist JR filmed and photographed us. The result is the cover story for the Nov. 5 edition of the magazine and a stunning online interactive experience that truly delves into where we stand on this vital issue. Take a look and hear the voices: 
￼
As you’ll hear, I believe we must listen to the kids whose lives have been indelibly marked by gun violence.  This issue divides us deeply, even within our 15th District. But for as long as we can’t speak to each other reasonably about it, more Americans will die needlessly. We don’t have the luxury of silence and inaction.  As always, it is an honor to serve you in the U.S. Congress. Please visit my website or contact my East Bay office at 510-370-3322 if we can be of service in any way. To stay connected, join me on Twitter @RepSwalwell and Facebook.  Sincerely,   ￼ Eric Swalwell Member of Congress

Friends,
Our economy hasn’t been this good since the Reagan Era! We are making history with the lowest unemployment rate ever, middle class tax cuts, record-setting deregulation, monumental strides in our foreign relations, strengthening our military, reforming the VA, combating the opioid epidemic, confirming conservative judges, and the list goes on. The American people wanted a leader that was going to deliver on their promises, and that is just what we got with President Trump. While there is still work to be done, there is no denying that our nation is better off now. I am proud to support a President that continues to make the people’s priorities his own. The progress over the last 20 months has been enormous – take a look HERE. 
I have been getting a lot of feedback on the positive impact President Trump’s actions have had on South Carolina’s economy. Bottom line – we are absolutely soaring on the job front. Since President Trump took office, more than 3.5 million jobs have been created, and our unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been in decades. We are coming up on the sixth straight month of having more job openings than job seekers. South Carolina is looking at a 3.3% unemployment rate, and our employment gains are on the rise. According to the South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce (DEW), just in September 2018 we had over 300 new jobs created in the construction industry, over 200 in the education and health services industry, and over 200 in the manufacturing industry. While many were sadly interrupted by Hurricanes Florence and Michael, our state has luckily had an incredible amount of support from Governor McMaster’s office and businesses have been able to get back up and running again. For more information, check out the DEW’s statement that was released last week.   
President Trump and Congressional Republicans have ushered in an era of huge economic success for our country – it’s truly remarkable what will happen when you cut taxes, eliminate red-tape, and implement pro-business, free-market policies: 
	•	US regains title of world’s most competitive economy (Fox Business) 
	•	US job openings climb to record 7.1 million – exceed number of unemployed Americans (Market Watch)

	•	Youth Unemployment Hits 52-Year Low (Wall Street Journal) 
	•	 Small business optimism at 35-year high (Fox News) 
	•	U.S. Small-Business Owners' Optimism at Record High (Gallup)
	•	 Job satisfaction hits 51 percent, highest level since 2005 (The Hill)
	•	‘Rip-roaring hot' jobs market sees private payrolls surge by 230,000, highest since February (CNBC)
As always, it is an honor to serve as your Congressman. Your feedback is invaluable as it helps me better represent you in Congress. Should you have any comments or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to one of my offices in South Carolina or Washington. Also, don’t forget to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for real time updates on my work for the Third District.

10/25/18 16:39,Update from Rep. Collins: Local Wins and the Opioid Battle,"
￼ 



October 25, 2018 

Dear Friends,
I hope this finds you well as we reflect on the progress we've made on issues important to Northeast Georgia, including winning local television programming for orphan county residents, passing a landmark bill to battle the opioid epidemic, and honoring fallen heroes. 
Delivering Relief to Opioid Victims 
Earlier this year, I introduced the Substance Abuse Prevention Act to deliver practical solutions to people impacted by America's opioid crisis. This week, President Trump signed that bill into law as part of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. The Substance Abuse Prevention Act reauthorizes funding for drug courts—which we've seen help Georgians by rescuing people from addiction and lessening the strain on the justice system—and for federal, state, and local law enforcement task forces to fight drug trafficking, among other initiatives. 
By passing the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, Congress has prioritized American families and directed more than $8 billion to fight the opioid epidemic, which steals thousands of lives each year. Working with the Trump Administration to invest in a healthier, safer America by treating and preventing opioid addiction is a promise that I'm proud to have kept on behalf of people across Northeast Georgia. 
  
￼ 
  
Winning Access to Local TV for Georgians 
For years, I've been fighting alongside residents of Georgia's orphan counties, who have been asking for access to Georgia programming. Currently, these communities are limited to satellite TV coverage from North or South Carolina, but that's finally changing. I authored language in the 2014 Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act Reauthorization Act to give orphan counties the chance to petition the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to move into a different TV market area if their residents support that change.   
My team and I worked with Franklin County to help the county petition the FCC to join a Georgia media market so that residents have access to news, weather, and sports coverage from their own state. The FCC granted Franklin County's request this September, which is great news for that community and other orphan counties who want to receive in-state programming. I look forward to continuing these efforts with Northeast Georgians who want improved access to local coverage. 
  
￼
Two years ago, the Carothers family lost a father and husband in the line of duty. U.S. Marshal Patrick Carothers was a hero who ran toward danger in order to serve others, and we honored him this week with the Congressional Badge of Bravery.
  
Fighting for Handicap Access and Community Control
Northeast Georgians rely on their local post offices each day, but Elberton's post office remains inaccessible to residents with limited mobility. Last October, I wrote to the U.S. Postal Service because there was no ramp, walkway, or elevator available to individuals with limited mobility.  
Now, a year later, the Postal Service has still not made the post office fully handicap accessible. In fact, it has also declined a common sense request from local residents who wanted to use local resources to open the facility to everyone. 
I am more concerned than ever that people who depend on the Elberton Post Office are being denied a solution that would enable residents with limited mobility to access a public facility, so I've formally asked the U.S. Postal Service for answers about what's behind their decision and their inaction. I hope that we can make progress on this front soon, and I will continue advocating for a solution for the Elberton community. 
  

￼
The AP Government students at Cherokee Bluff High School asked me insightful questions about the issues that matter to Northeast Georgians this week. We talked about free speech, student loans, and becoming active, inquisitive readers.
  

Representing the priorities of Georgia's 9th District remains a humbling responsibility. If you'd like to keep up with the latest news about the policy improvements I support and why they matter to Northeast Georgia, I invite you to sign up for my regular newsletters. You can also follow me on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.

Dear Friend,
Welcome to your weekly update. As always, you can learn more about these and other legislative issue at my website: lance.house.gov. 
Landmark Opioid Legislation Signed Into Law 
A sweeping bill to combat the nation’s opioid crisis is now law. President Donald Trump signed the the “SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act” at a ceremony Wednesday at the White House.
The new law represents the largest legislative effort to combat a single drug crisis in history. 
Among other things, it allows the United States Postal Service to scan packages for illicit opioids, increases funding for comprehensive recovery centers, and allows Medicaid to cover a larger array of treatment options for patients struggling with addiction.  The measure strengthens efforts to stop the flow of illegal narcotics such as fentanyl and to cut down on opioid prescriptions in favor of non-addictive painkillers.
I am most proud of the fact that the new law includes legislation – the Eliminating Opioid-Related Infectious Diseases Act – that I authored to confront the rising cases of HIV, hepatitis C and other infections stemming from drug-use. 
Social Security announces 2.8% increase 
I am pleased to announce a 2.8% Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) increase for more than 67 million Americans in 2019. 
The COLA is one of the Social Security’s most important protections, which ensures benefits keep up with inflation. 
Social Security also recently expanded their Compassionate Allowance List, which has enables them to identify and fast-track cases where individuals have diseases that are most likely to be approved for disability benefits.
Social Security is an earned benefit that Americans have paid into throughout their entire lives and I am committed to preserving and strengthening this vital program for today’s and tomorrow’s seniors. 
Clean Water legislation signed into law
President Trump recently signed into law water resources legislation authorizing projects to improve infrastructure at ports, inland waterways, locks, dams and flood mitigation. 
Included in the new law are two provisions I authored.  One measure would instruct the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite a study of the feasibility of removing the Warren Glen Dam in the Musconetcong River between Warren and Hunterdon counties.  The dam is often cited as an environmental hazard and is decades out of commission. In addition to making the Musconetcong Watershed area safer, removal of this dam would also foster a larger habitat for fish like the American shad which have been declining.
A second measure concerning the Rahway River and expediting completion of the Army Corps’ study for better flood risk management was also part of the new law.  That project has been stalled for years but is facing renewed interest at my request. 
Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization signed into law 
The President recently signed the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act into law. 
This five-year reauthorization provides long-term stability for the Nation’s aviation community, continues investment in airports across the country, improves America’s competitiveness in the global aviation sector, strengthens passenger protections, and ensures the safety of the system for the traveling public. 
Also tucked in the FAA reauthorization is my legislative language forcing the FAA to create a plan to better manage local pilots inconvenienced by flight restrictions around Bedminster during visits by the President. 
Back in New Jersey 
With no votes in the House this week, I am hard at work in the Seventh Congressional District. 
Yesterday I joined Mayor James Dodd in touring the damage along West Blackwell and North Warren Streets following Monday’s massive fire in Dover.  I was also Succasunna this week to praise Habitat for Humanity and the volunteers who will help provide homes to those in need. 
I also announced more than $600,000 in federal FIRE grants for Raritan Township, Quakertown, Clinton and High Bridge fire departments.  And I visited the Cranford campus of Union County College to congratulate the school on receiving a $1.5 million award from the National Science Foundation (NSF).

ISSUES 
Dear Friend, 
We are excited that early voting started this week in Texas, and a historic turnout is expected. Early voting runs through November 2nd, and y'all should visit votetexas.gov to learn more.  
Issues with Early Voting in Bexar County 
Our democracy only works if people actually have the opportunity to cast their ballots and show their political preference. So far, this election has not been run very smoothly in Bexar County. I joined State Senator José Menéndez (District 26) this week in a press conference to shed light on early voting issues we’ve seen.  
 ￼ 
This includes outdated voting machines with no paper records, system glitches, incorrect voter information, staffing shortages and lack of accommodations for disabled voters. You can read a transcript of my remarks here.  
You can read coverage about this press conference in the San Antonio Express-News. You can also listen to coverage on Texas Public Radio or watch my interview with KENS5.  
The Administration's Treatment of Migrant Children  
It was great to join my colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee in a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alexander Azar and the Department of Justice (DOJ) Attorney General Jeff Sessions on a new video teleconference hearing initiative requiring detained unaccompanied immigrant children to appear in their immigration court proceedings by video. 
The challenges to due process for vulnerable immigrant children that are posed by these hearings are too numerous and severe to overcome. That’s why we called on DOJ and HHS to terminate this initiative. You can read the full letter here. 
District Update 
Team Castro hosted senior office hours at the Willie M. Cortez Senior Center; attended the opening of the Texas Department of Transportation open-house; joined the National Disability Employment Awareness Month as the City of San Antonio issues a City Proclamation; and met with the Recording Academy.

The Fight to End Alzheimer’s 
It was great to join the Alzheimer Association’s Walk to End Alzheimer’s in San Antonio. Alzheimer’s is a truly terrible disease and we must continue working together to fund research and find a cure.

National Drug Take-Back Day
Friend,

This Saturday, October 27th, is the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) Drug Take-Back Day. Mark your calendars: from 10AM - 2PM, you can properly dispose of expired, unused, and unwanted prescription drugs at certain locations in our communities, hosted by local police and sheriffs' departments.

Drug Take-Back Day is part of the effort to fight the opioid epidemic impacting so many of our friends, families, and neighbors here in Ohio's Second District. Fighting the opioid epidemic starts at a local level, with members of the community helping each other with both recovery and prevention. It is up to each of us to raise awareness and take steps to cut the supply of prescription opiates, which too often act as a gateway to heroin and other dangerous drugs.

￼

Locations all across southern and southwest Ohio will be collecting unwanted prescription drugs for disposal this Saturday. Click above to find a nearby collection site. For more information about National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day in our communities, check out the DEA website here.

In your service,
￼

P.S. President Trump just signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, our biggest commitment yet in the fight against opioid addiction. This bipartisan package of bills is targeted towards advancing treatment and recovery initiatives, improving addiction prevention, protecting our communities, and bolstering efforts to fight deadly synthetic drugs like fentanyl.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Oct 25, 2018

Federal Grant Awarded for Opioid Response Program Planning In 14 Michigan Counties

Washington - Yesterday, President Trump signed H.R. 6 into law. This sweeping legislation addresses the opioid crisis that has ravaged our nation. Today, HRSA awarded $400,000 in grants to Michigan, with $200,000 designated to The Michigan Center for Rural Health. Congressman Jack Bergman released the following statement:  ""The opioid epidemic has swept our nation, tearing families apart through the grasps of addiction. Unfortunately, rural communities in Michigan's First District are no exception, and in some cases, have even higher rates of opioid addiction than urban or suburban communities. It's imperative that state, federal, and local officials continue to work together with community leaders to best address this crisis in our neighborhoods. I''m proud of the work our rural health clinics do, and I'm pleased HRSA provided this grant to this great organization,"" said Bergman.  Over the last 20 months Rep. Bergman has held multiple roundtables across the First District of Michigan with Healthcare providers, law enforcement officials, EMS leaders, county officials, addiction treatment professionals, and those fighting the chains of addiction to discuss best practices to address this crisis in our back yard.   See below for the Michigan Center for Rural Health release on today's Grant announcement:
The Michigan Center for Rural Health (MCRH) was awarded a $200,000 Rural Communities Opioid Response Program (RCORP) planning grant by the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) to focus on opioid use disorder in the following 14 northern MI counties (Alcona, Alpena, Cheboygan, Clare, Crawford, Gladwin, Kalkaska, Lake, Montmorency, Ogemaw, Oscoda, Otsego, Presque Isle, Roscommon). Over the next year, MCRH will help facilitate the work of the newly formed Northern Michigan Opioid Response Consortium (NMORC).
The NMORC was assembled to coordinate efforts, and identify areas of best practice for replication and expansion, pinpoint gaps in care and develop solutions, leverage state resources to address system and policy issues, and reduce the duplication of efforts in 14 northern MI counties. The planning grant will focus on the areas of prevention, treatment, recovery and workforce. NMORC is governed by a Board of Directors and consortium members include hospitals, community health centers, local public health departments, community mental health agencies, local community-based organizations and state of MI agencies dedicated to addressing opioid use disorder.

My fight to combat fringe litigation and reduce red tape
￼
Within the Fleecer Mountains Project area, spruce budworm-defoliated Douglas-fir regeneration with Douglas-fir beetle-killed trees, Jerry Creek. Photo: fs.usda.gov
What's New:  A federal judge in Montana recently maintained an injunction against an important forest management project in the Beaverhead-Deer lodge National Forest. The Fleecer Mountains Project would improve forest resiliency and support wood products jobs by providing over 34 million board feet of timber. Planning for this project began in 2009—and nearly a decade later it is still being blocked due to fringe litigation!  The court said the Forest Service did not adequately consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service following new sightings of lynx in the forest. This rationale was based off the terrible standard that the Ninth Circuit’s Cottonwood ruling imposed. The Forest Service has already completed another round of analysis concerning the lynx, but now they’re being told the “new information” requires even more paperwork. Both the Trump Administration and the Obama Administration disagree with the Cottonwood ruling, and I have introduced legislation alongside Montana Representative Greg Gianforte to fully reverse that disastrous decision.  Why It Matters:  The Beaverhead-Deer lodge National Forest is experiencing the devastating consequences of insect infestation, and forest health continues to deteriorate. Because of this court ruling and the underlying Cottonwood decision, the Forest Service cannot begin its commonsense project to allow targeted salvage of the dead and damaged trees and create a more resilient landscape. This hurts the environment and local economies surrounding this National Forest.  What’s Next:
The Forest Service must now go back to the drawing and do MORE paperwork in response to the court’s ruling. It’s appalling that this project—which was created with public input and support—is still not being carried out. I will continue to fight against fringe litigation and to fully reverse the disastrous Cottonwood decision and I urge all Montanans to join me.

PHOTO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich tours the upgraded facility of SolAero Technologies in the Sandia Science and Technology Park in Albuquerque, October 23, 2018.
October 25, 2018
Dear Friend,
New Mexico has long played a leading role in protecting our national security and advancing scientific innovation. As I work to bolster the missions at our state's military installations and national labs, I am also focused on boosting the private tech industry, improving the process to transfer innovative technologies from research and defense labs to the private sector, and creating new high-tech jobs.
This week, I was pleased to tour a great example of a homegrown business that is creating good-paying jobs and positioning New Mexico as a national leader in emerging high-tech fields. SolAero Technologies manufactures solar cells for space power applications. The company has worked with the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque to develop more efficient solar cells for small satellite and low-Earth-orbit missions. SolAero's cells can provide more power for less weight to satellites used by the military and commercial space companies.
On the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have been an ardent supporter of the small-satellite and space testing missions at Kirtland that are replacing current systems with with an agile, low-cost system architecture resulting in lower production costs and increased performance. These missions are saving taxpayer dollars, making us safer, and creating opportunities for innovative local companies like SolAero to develop and supply our military with state-of-the-art technologies. SolAero recently completed a $10 million upgrade to its facility in the Sandia Science and Technology Park, where it now employs 320 people, up from 250 in early 2017.
I am committed to doing all I can to foster opportunities to grow new high-paying science and manufacturing jobs. That's why I am advancing policies that help mature technologies developed at our national labs to build high-tech manufacturing businesses with great potential to grow. We also need to educate our students and retrain our labor force for a lucrative high-tech job market.
If we are going to diversify and strengthen New Mexico's economy, we must target areas where we have the potential to create jobs and major new industries. If we support creative homegrown companies like SolAero and build a skilled workforce, we can build a vibrant and thriving economy.
Sincerely,
￼

Click here if you have trouble viewing this email
￼
Dear Friend,
Throughout 2018, my district office has received countless calls from constituents sharing their troubling experiences with poor mail delivery service. From damaged packages to mail arriving at the wrong address or going missing for weeks at a time, these serious issues are prevalent and persistent across the Fifth District. You deserve to have confidence in the delivery of life-saving medicines, bank statements, passports, and other important documents.
I brought up these complaints with Postmaster General Megan Brennan in August, and despite verbal assurances that the U.S. Postal Service would address the problems, Chicagoans continue to suffer. That’s why I recently sent the Postmaster General a follow-up letter demanding immediate answers regarding the causes of delivery issues and additional information on the steps the USPS will take to prevent these problems going forward.
Now, I want to hear from you. After an outpouring of feedback on a recent Facebook post, I’ve created a survey to learn more about your experiences with mail delivery and ways you believe USPS can improve the situation. I hope you will share your thoughts, and I thank you for calling attention to these failures that demand our attention.
Click here to take the two-minute survey.

10/25/18 13:37,Signed into Law,"￼ 


Hoosiers,  Yesterday, President Trump signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6) into law. I pushed for the strong, comprehensive approach that H.R. 6 takes on our nation's continued fight against the opioid epidemic.  The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act is a compilation of more than 50 bills to forge ahead in our historic fight to provide tools to Hoosier families and communities hit by the scourge of opioid addiction. H.R. 6 addresses:
	•	Treatment and Recovery. Improves and expands access to treatment and recovery services and establishes comprehensive opioid recovery centers.  
	•	Prevention. Encourages non-addictive opioid alternatives to treat pain and addresses high prescribing rates while enhancing prescription drug monitoring programs.  
	•	Protecting Communities. Gives law enforcement tools to get dangerous drugs out of our communities and the resources to better intercept illicit opioids at international mail faciliites.  
	•	Fight Fentanyl. Cracks down on foreign shipments of illicit drugs and provides grants for local communities to combat fentanyl.
We all know someone, whether it's a family member, a friend, or a neighbor, who has been affected by this crisis. That's why I won't stop fighting for commonsense measures, like H.R. 6, to curb the tragedies caused by illicit opioids in our country.

Be of good cheer,
￼


P.S. Saturday is Drug Take-Back Day. From 10AM-2PM, you can properly dispose of expired, unused, and unwanted prescription drugs to support ongoing efforts to combat the opioid epidemic that is facing our communities. Click here to find a drop-off location near you.

Hello, 

As your voice in Congress, I've always made it a priority to be accessible and available across all ten counties in Eastern Washington. This Congress, which began in January 2017, I've had 12 town hall events, and hosted nearly 1,000 meetings with constituents. 

Just last week, I launched an interactive map on my website to be more accountable and transparent to you. 

￼ 
To date, I've logged thousands of miles listening to people across Eastern Washington, and I'm taking action to deliver results for you. Here is a look at my work this Congress by the numbers (as of October 19, 2018): 

113,620 - Emails, letters, and phone calls to constituents who reached out 
3,232 - Constituents who enjoyed a Capitol tour from my staff

Dear Friends, 

It’s hard to believe that it’s been a year since Jennifer Kepner – a loving mother, devoted wife, and U.S. Air Force veteran – passed away from cancer caused by her exposure to burn pits. 

I remember sitting at Jennifer’s kitchen table like it was yesterday. Despite her ongoing battle with pancreatic cancer, Jennifer’s first concern was for her husband Ben and their two young children. Her second concern? The many veterans who – like her – contracted rare cancers and chronic conditions resulting from their exposure to toxic burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan. 

￼ 

Jennifer’s final wish was for her fellow veterans to be spared the pain she and her family endured. Her empathy is the reason we are fighting to end the use of burn pits and get exposed veterans the care they have earned and deserve. For the first time in nearly a decade, we’ve gotten new legislation on burn pits signed into law, and a renewed focus on burn pits thanks to the formation of the bipartisan Burn Pits Caucus. Because of Jennifer, the momentum is on our side. 

Jennifer lived a life defined by service and patriotism. Her legacy inspires me to this day and pushes me to work harder to live up to her memory and carry forward her final wishes. 

Thank you for joining me to remember Jennifer, 

￼

GROWING WASHINGTON'S SPACE INDUSTRY
Dear Friend,
Washington state boasts a diverse range of innovative sectors, including an exciting local space industry. Our space industry supports more than 6,000 jobs and generates $1.7 billion for our economy. To sustain economic growth in our region, we must have an open dialogue between policymakers and industry leaders to understand the challenges and opportunities ahead and how we can best prepare for those.
That’s why I joined House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD), whose district includes NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, for a roundtable discussion hosted by Aerojet Rocketdyne along with other companies leading Washington state’s space industry. The dialogue focused on how to continue developing our space expertise and Congress’s role in supporting new innovations to benefit all Americans. The discussion was part of Rep. Hoyer’s “Make It in America” initiative, which aims to produce favorable conditions for U.S. businesses and expand economic opportunity for American workers. 
Retaining a competitive workforce, supporting STEM research, and enhancing the workforce pipeline are critical to producing a robust economy. Learning from space companies about their challenges and which strategies can help foster success was an invaluable experience. I remain committed to supporting policies that encourage entrepreneurship and advancement in this new and growing sector.
As always, my office is here to serve you. If you have questions or comments about the topics that matter most to you, I encourage you to contact me through my website. You may also keep up-to-date on what I’m doing by following me on social media or signing up for my eNewsletter.

￼   Landmark Opioid Legislation Signed Into Law
I joined President Trump and the First Lady at the White House for the bill signing of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT Patients and Communities Act, with a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators, Members of Congress, NIH Director Francis Collins, Loudoun County Sheriff Mike Chapman, and other Cabinet Members and Administration officials. 
This is the culmination of years of work by thousands of people to address our nation’s opioid crisis. As a member of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force, I have advocated for Federal policies that support our local law enforcement, healthcare treatment providers, and help address the root cause of this epidemic. Congress appropriated unprecedented funding of $6 billion this year to address this public health crisis and included as part of H.R. 6 are provisions of my bill, H.R. 5473, the Better Pain Management Through Better Data Act, to facilitate better clinical data and standards on non-opioid alternatives. I got to speak with NIH Director Collins about the research that NIH is doing on non-opioid alternatives and the increased funding we provided for it.

Dear Friend, 
Four years ago, I came to Congress as an economist and a college professor. I believed it was just plain wrong for the students I was teaching to graduate and not know if there would be a job out there for them.
I began working on a pro-growth agenda. I know hard-working American families built this nation, so we should do what we can to put money back into their hands. And we should get government out of the way by reining in unnecessarily burdensome regulations.
Some in DC cautioned that this strategy wouldn’t work. I am pleased to report that the state of the American economy is EXCELLENT.
We are in a period of strong growth where businesses of all sizes are expanding and are reaching record-level optimism.
	•	Since January 2017, the economy has added 3.8 million jobs.
	•	The U.S. unemployment rate for September sank to 3.7% -- the lowest since 1969. The African-American unemployment rate hit its all-time low of 5.9% in May, the Hispanic unemployment rate hit its all-time low of 4.5% in July, and the unemployment rate for women is at its lowest in 65 years at 3.6%. 
	•	In August, the number of job openings hit an all-time high at 7.14 million. In fact, there were more job openings than workers even looking for jobs.
	•	Wage growth is at its highest it’s been in 17 months.
	•	An average American family (married with two kids) will save $2,917 in taxes this year.
	•	A single taxpayer will save an average of $1,400 in taxes this year.
	•	Confidence in the government’s economic policies rose in October to its highest level in the past 15 years – surpassing very strong economies in Singapore, Germany, Japan and Switzerland.
	•	Q2 GDP growth was confirmed 4.2%, the fastest rise in 4 years.
	•	In FY 2018, this administration eliminated 12 regulations for every 1 new significant regulation passed.
	•	This administration’s regulatory reform efforts have led to $23 billion in cost savings.
	•	In September, NFIB’s Small Business optimism index was at its third highest reading in the survey’s 45 year history and the National Association of Manufacturers’ optimism survey is the highest ever.
	•	Consumer confidence hit 138.4 in September, very close to the all-time high of 144.7 achieved in 2000.
Gone are the days of gloomy reports of unemployment and an economy stuck in neutral. This is why Americans trust Republicans over Democrats with handling the economy by 15 points and more than half of Americans now rate the economy as good or excellent.
The last thing we need to do right now is to move our economy backwards.
	•	During the previous administration, there were at least 21 tax hikes enacted. 
	•	The Congressional Budget Office and Tax Policy Center both showed that average tax rates rose under President Obama. 
	•	Americans suffered more binding regulations and growing government, as well as increased borrowing and spending. During the Obama presidency, there were 20,642 new regulations added. 
	•	In the first 21 months alone, Obama’s administration imposed $245 billion in burdensome regulations. 
	•	The American people felt it, too. In 2015, NBC reported only 34% of Americans believed the American dream still holds true. 59% of Americans said the next generation would be worse off than the current one.
And a nonprofit think tank has reported that families in Virginia’s 7th District would lose $40,621 in take home pay over the next 10 years if Democrats are successful in their desire to roll back the tax cuts.
As an economist and representative of Virginia’s 7th District, I will continue to be an advocate for a pro-growth agenda that benefits Virginia families.

Thank you,

￼

THE BIPARTISAN OPIOID BILL IS NOW LAW
￼
For too long, families and communities across the country have been devastated by the opioid epidemic. Today we are taking a big step toward ending this crisis.
The president just signed H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, into law. This bipartisan, comprehensive legislation will provide critical tools and resources to help those on the front lines of this fight. 
￼
It will also build on the legacy of Dr. Todd Graham with provisions named in the Hoosier doctor’s honor.
Before he was tragically killed last year over an opioid prescription, Dr. Graham was dedicated to treating patients not only for their pain but for the underlying causes. That is why I worked to include this measure to advance the model of care he championed.
￼
I’m hopeful this legislation will help end the opioid epidemic by improving access to non-opioid pain treatments and enabling doctors to better treat patients and prevent addiction.
￼
Additionally, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act includes provisions to:
	•	Expand access to addiction recovery services;
	•	Give Medicare beneficiaries access to more treatment options such as Medication-Assisted Treatment;
	•	Establish comprehensive opioid recovery centers;
	•	Improve efforts to help at-risk patients;
	•	Enhance prescription drug monitoring programs;
	•	Support law enforcement efforts to combat dangerous drugs;
	•	Prevent shipment of illicit opioids in international mail;
	•	Crack down on synthetic drugs; and
	•	Provide local communities additional resources to address the opioid epidemic.
The opioid epidemic is taking a terrible toll on our communities. It is my hope that this vital new law will help Hoosiers work together to prevent and treat addiction and assist in recovery. 
As always, it is a privilege to represent 2nd District Hoosiers in Congress.

10/25/18 6:16,We Must Lower Prescription Drug Prices," ￼    ￼   ￼

￼
Prescription drug costs are too high for Montanans, period. 
￼
Too many seniors on a fixed income are forced to choose between keeping the heat on and purchasing their lifesaving prescription drugs, and too many Montana families are forced to break the bank just to afford the medicines their kids need to live healthy lives.  That is why I am holding pharmaceutical companies accountable to lower prescription drug prices for all Montanans.  My bill, the CREATES Act, gives generic drug makers access to samples of name brand drugs so they can get more affordable versions on the market. This bill will bring down the costs that you pay. This bill will also decrease the federal deficit by $3.9 billion over the next decade because of cost savings to Medicare.   Montanans are too often left in the dark while prescription drug companies set prices.   I’m also sponsoring the SPIKE Act to bring more transparency to prescription drug pricing. This bill will force pharmaceutical companies to disclose detailed information about why they are raising costs.   And I am also pushing to prevent pharmaceutical middlemen from charging unjustified fees that raise drug prices for the rest of us.  These are common sense proposals that all Montanans can get behind.   My bills will protect Montanans from another painful round of prescription drug price hikes because you should never have to lay awake at night worrying about how you’ll pay for the prescriptions you and your family need to stay healthy.

October 24, 2018 

Aloha, 
  
I am pleased that Hawai‘i will be receiving more than $200 million to improve the Ala Wai Canal and watershed, reduce flood risks in the area, and strengthen flood warning systems. This major investment will make sure the Army Corps has the funding it needs to strengthen the canal and protect residents against flooding.  
  
We need a comprehensive approach to dealing with our country's opioid epidemic.  The bipartisan legislation passed earlier this month includes several of my provisions that will expand the use of telehealth to treat opioid addiction and increase funding for non-opioid pain treatment.  As always, please contact my office in D.C. or Hawai‘i if there is anything we can do. We are here to help.  Mahalo, 
 


Brian Schatz 
United States Senator 



Addressing the Opioid Epidemic
The U.S. Senate passed sweeping legislation to address the nation’s opioid crisis, including measures authored by Senator Schatz. Senator Schatz’s provisions would fund new research on non-addictive, non-opioid alternatives to treat and prevent pain and expand the use of telehealth to treat opioid addiction. 
  
“Opioid addiction is a national epidemic, and we need a comprehensive approach to address it,” said Senator Schatz. “Our bill will use technology to help connect health care professionals with more patients and help providers access the continuing education they need to treat addiction. It also invests in more research to find alternative treatments for pain so that we can try to stop opioid addiction before it starts.”
  
The Schatz provisions will: 
	•	Increase access to substance use disorder treatment through telehealth technology under Medicare. The provision eliminates originating site geographic restrictions for telehealth services to treat substance use disorders;
	•	Fund training for health professionals to treat opioid addiction based on the Project Extension for Community Health Outcomes, also known as the ECHO model. The ECHO model has already successfully helped states like New Mexico increase the number of physicians qualified to dispense or prescribe medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction; and
	•	Give the National Institutes of Health more authority to spur research on the understanding of pain and the discovery of non-addictive painkillers to help treat chronic pain.

Connecting with the Hawaiian Community
Senator Schatz was invited to address the Annual Native Hawaiian Convention.  He discussed some of the challenges indigenous groups face at the Supreme Court and new policies that will affect the Native Hawaiian community.  Senator Schatz, a member of the Appropriations Committee, also gave an update on increased funding for Native Hawaiian health and education programs. 
￼


Protecting Against Flooding
Legislation to improve water resources and infrastructure in Hawai‘i and across the country was passed by Congress and sent to the President for his signature. The sweeping bipartisan bill includes more than $212 million to improve the Ala Wai canal and watershed, reduce flood risks in the area, and strengthen flood warning systems. 
￼
According to a plan developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Ala Wai Canal and the watershed that flows into it requires significant upgrades to prevent catastrophic flooding in the event of a major storm. The federal funding in the legislation passed earlier this month would go towards implementing the Army Corps’ plan to reduce flood risks by improving the flood warning system, and constructing six in-stream debris and detention basins in the upper reaches of Makiki, Mānoa and Pālolo streams, one standalone debris catchment feature, three multi-purpose detention areas in open spaces through the developed watershed, and concrete floodwalls averaging 4 feet high along one or both sides of approximately 1.9 miles of the Ala Wai Canal.

New meaningful actions to reverse meth epidemic in Montana
￼
Senator Daines discussed meth’s negative impacts on the Fort Belknap Indian Community with leaders and representatives of those tribes. Art from a Fort Belknap tribal member depicts those negative impacts.
What's New:
This week President Trump signed into law bipartisan legislation to combat the meth and opioid crises in Montana and across our country. Methamphetamine in particular is destroying families and communities across our state, and it disproportionately impacts Native American tribes. This new law includes the resources and reforms needed to combat both epidemics.  I recently took to the Senate floor to highlight key provisions in this new law, including my Mitigating METH Act, which expands opioid crisis grants to include Indian tribes as eligible recipients. The new law also includes the STOP Act, a bill I championed to help stop opioids and drugs from crossing the border or being shipped through the Postal Service. And it reauthorizes the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area and Drug Courts programs that help fight against drug use in Montana.
Why It Matters:  In Montana opioid overdoses have claimed the lives of 700 people since 2000. In addition, we have seen a 415% increase in meth cases this decade and a 375% increase in meth-related deaths. And increased meth use has also resulted in a sharp increase in foster care cases, which is why I authored a separate new law making it easier for children in the system to remain with their parents in a safe, clinical setting while the parent receives substance abuse treatment.  Almost all meth in Montana is produced in Mexico and smuggled over the southern border, making it important that we work alongside Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to stem the flow of drugs entering our country. In a recent hearing with CBP, I urged them to prioritize securing the border to prevent meth from entering our communities.
What’s Next:  I applaud President Trump for signing this important legislation into law. It recognizes that the best way to combat this epidemic is encouraging coordinated efforts between federal, state, local, and tribal partners. I will continue to work with Montanans to help ensure this law is implemented as effectively as possible.   Share your story:   Has your family been impacted by the meth or opioid epidemic? Share your story with me HERE.
Best Wishes, 
￼

10/24/18 19:30,INVITE: We Believe Survivors - Domestic Violence Awareness Month,"October 24, 2018

Dear Friends,

Violence against women is rampant. Seventy percent of women worldwide will experience physical or sexual abuse by an intimate partner in their lifetime. In the U.S., nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner. One in five women and one in 71 men in the U.S. have been raped in their lifetime.
                                  



The impact of sexual trauma is severe and very difficult to overcome. In addition to being physically and psychologically scarred, victims are often re-victimized by being discredited and dismissed. This was on blatant display during the Justice Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. His testimony in response to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s reporting of sexual assault was a slap in the face to survivors across the country. This fall, Republicans in Congress failed to reauthorize VAWA, the Violence Against Women Act, beyond a three months extension until after the election.

Women deserve better. That’s why I am hosting a panel sending a clear message: We believe survivors. I hope you will join me for this important conversation that will focus on healing and recovering from trauma.

During the event, we will explore the transition from victim to survivor. I will moderate a panel with

Congressman Al Green's Statement on Bomb Threats 
(Houston, TX) - On Wednesday, October 24, 2018, Congressman Al Green released the following statement regarding the suspicious packages discovered this week:
“Today, our country is in a state of alarming apprehension as we learn of the suspicious packages sent to Mr. George Soros, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former President and First Lady Obama, John Brennan at the CNN New York headquarters, former Attorney General Eric Holder, as well as Congresswoman Maxine Waters (CA-43). To say that these are collective coincidences defies logic. This is an assault on our democracy, an attack on our free press, and, most obviously, a threat to our safety. We have no way of knowing who may next receive one of these suspicious packages. We have no way of knowing whether these suspicious packages will be intercepted and properly handled before they reach the hands of the intended or if they will be detonated en route and cause harm to an innocent person regardless of their views. 
“Each of the recipients of these suspicious packages has been the brunt of President Trump’s incendiary rhetoric. While he may see his statements as mere words, they are capable of inciting injurious actions. As America’s Commander in Chief, his words may be internalized by many as a call to action. 
“Mr. President, you set the tone and tenor for our nation. If you continue to use dog whistle politics, someone will suffer more than apprehension.”

Dear Friend, 
Progress on Opioid Package 
I’m pleased to share that, last month, the House of Representatives took action to address one of the most serious crises in our country: the opioid epidemic. We passed a package of bipartisan bills that included legislation I authored. The three bills -- H.R. 5722, H.R. 5790, and H.R. 4684 - focus on preventing addiction through access to mental health care, providing access to treatment alternatives that help individuals avoid opioids, and ensuring the best possible recovery for those who are working to overcome addiction. These three bills touch on the entire scope of the opioid crisis. They have bipartisan support and were crafted with the help of experts to target specific moments in the treatment process that can mean the difference between life and death. And with the President’s signature on October 24, I am proud that these bills are now law.  
Working with local students on gun violence 
Unfortunately, there is still much work left undone this Congress. One such example is addressing gun violence. This past year, we experienced some of the worst mass shootings in our history, but nothing has been done. Finally, after yet another tragic shooting, this time in Parkland, Florida, robbed us of 17 more lives, our country seems to have reached a turning point. Across the country, students who know they should not have to fear for their lives going to school have said enough is enough, and already, their actions have led to major retailers curbing their sales of guns, corporations cancelling support for the NRA, and more. I’ve been privileged to meet with many of these students from schools like Marjory Stoneman Douglas, and students from Pasadena and Alhambra, to talk about their experiences and their resolve to change our laws. 
I met with a remarkable class at Alhambra High School and I saw that resolve in action as they presented me with a gun violence resolution they had written themselves. The amount of research and work that the students, under the leadership of Mr. Sanchez, put into this resolution is truly impressive. They had vigorous debates on each provision, from banning assault weapons to implementing true universal background checks. They had a vote on each of those provisions.  They were thoughtful and impassioned as they presented their views to one another and to the public. And it worked. The resolution was adopted unanimously by the Alhambra Unified School District. I was so impressed by their work so last month, I introduced the students’ resolution as H.Res. 1076. 
A movement is growing, and these students are not afraid to stand up to the NRA if it means saving their lives. And I’m proud to stand with them. 
Funding the federal government 
On Friday, September 28, the House took our final votes before we return to Washington in November. We accomplished some things, but much remains for when we get back. 
First, we avoided a government shutdown by passing a “minibus” appropriations package that funds the Departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education for Fiscal Year 2019. The bill also extended funding for the rest of the government until December 7, 2018. This spending package helps to take us away from the brink of another government shutdown, while avoiding many of the problematic poison pills – like a border wall or defunding Planned Parenthood – that Republicans have sought. In addition, it provides robust funding for programs like the Low-Income Heating Assistance Program (LIHEAP), Head Start, and the National Institutes of Health. It also walks back one of President Trump’s attacks on women by fully funding the Title X Family Planning Program. Other victories in this package include an increase in the maximum Pell Grant award and language directing the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to submit a family reunification plan for those separated at the border to Congress. However, this bill is not perfect. Defense spending remains disproportionately high, while also preventing actions to close Guantanamo Bay. And while the September shutdown was avoided, the deadline was only pushed back a few months. That means passing a reasonable budget while avoiding the next government shutdown will be at the top of our agenda in November. 
Tax Scam 2.0 
But passing a fair budget has become much more difficult thanks to the Republican Tax Scam, which has ballooned our deficits to pay for tax cuts to the wealthiest few. That damage was made worse last month as Republicans followed up with another series of bills – H.R. 6756, the American Innovation Act of 2018, H.R. 6757, the Family Savings Act of 2018, and H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018 - to make the new tax law’s temporary provisions for individuals permanent. Provisions for businesses organized as pass-throughs, which pay taxes through the individual system, would also be made permanent. Other provisions include making permanent the doubled estate tax exemption to $22 million per couple, the $10,000 cap on the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), the cap on mortgage interest deduction, and the limits on the casualty loss deduction. The Tax Policy Center estimate that these bills will add over $3 trillion to the debt in its first ten years of implementation. 
This is another handout to the wealthiest Americans while leaving the middle class to pick up the tab. Already, the first Tax Scam has failed to deliver on the promise of higher wages. In fact, while corporations and shareholders are getting richer, only 4.4% of Fortune 500 workers have seen a raise or bonus. This Tax Scam 2.0 will build on that failed record by giving the top 0.1% of Americans with average incomes over $4 million per year an average tax cut of $105,000 in its first year alone.  That $105,000 tax cut exclusively for the 120,000 wealthiest Americans would be larger than the entire annual income for more than 120 million individual American households – before taxes – in that same year. And in order to pay for this, Republicans want to slash vital programs like Medicare and Social Security. I will fight to make sure working families don’t have to pay for the rich to get richer. 
Sincerely, 
￼

Dear Friend,

It's time for another update from Congress!  Last month saw a final push in Washington to fund to the federal government and pass legislation.  And this month, I had the opportunity to hold events in the San Diego area and meet with constituents around the 53rd District.  Please see below to read my E-newsletter.

Warm regards,

Congress Avoids Government Shutdown

Congress passed a number of spending bills to fund the federal government and avoid another shutdown.  The president signed the $854 billion spending package just before the September 30 deadline, despite earlier threats to veto any bill that did not include funding for his border wall.  I was glad to see members of Congress put aside differences to work on this issue together and pass a spending bill in time for the new fiscal year, which began on October 1. 

House Passes FAA Reauthorization Bill

The House of Representatives passed a reauthorization bill that would fund the Federal Aviation Administration for five years in a bipartisan vote of 398-23.  The bill includes a provision to allow regulators to set minimum standards for leg room and seat size on airplanes due to safety concerns.  

The 2,000-page funding bill also requires a government study on whether shrinking or reducing bathrooms in favor of more seats on board airplanes creates problems for passengers accessing the restrooms.  I joined the majority of my colleagues in voting yes on the bill. 

Working to Create Opportunities for Students
￼
Discussing the importance of bipartisanship in Congress.

I joined the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, DC to discuss the importance of working across the aisle on behalf of our students. As a senior member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, I spoke about my efforts to promote college affordability, equity in education, and quality apprenticeships.  Recently, I introduced the bipartisan APPRENTICE Act, a bill that would promote the expansion of apprenticeships across the country. 
 
Perfect Score for Supporting Equality

Human Rights Campaign released its legislative scorecard measuring support for equality in the 115th Congress.  I was honored to receive a perfect score of 100 for supporting several bills in Congress that promote equality.  Whether it's leading the fight to end Don't Ask Don't Tell or joining to secure marriage equality or working to overturn Trump's discriminatory transgender ban in the military, I remain dedicated to being on the frontlines in the struggle for full equality.

Cosponsored Legislation

H.R. 1147, Fair and Equal Housing Act, which would provide consistent and explicit non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people in housing by adding “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” as protected characteristics under the Fair Housing Act.

H.R. 6649, 3D Printed Gun Safety Act of 2018, which amends chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, to prohibit the publication of 3D printer plans for the printing of firearms.  3D-printed guns pose a significant public safety risk because they could be made undetectable and untraceable.

H.R. 6885, Conserving Ecosystems by Ceasing the Importation of Large Animal Trophies (CECIL) Act, a bill that would prohibit import and export of any species listed or proposed to be listed as a threatened species or endangered species.

Global Speaker Series: Understanding US–China Relations
￼
Making opening remarks during the U.S.-China panel discussion.

I hosted another successful panel discussion as part of my ongoing Global Policy Speaker Series. Partnering with experts from the 21st Century China Center at UCSD, the event focused on U.S.-China relations.  The expert panel discussed topics ranging from economics and trade to military and security issues between the U.S. and China.  Click here to watch.

Service Academy Information Night
￼
Speaking to students and parents about our nation's service academies.  

I held a Service Academy Information Night for students interested in serving our country and attending our nation's prestigious military academies.  Each year, I bring together academic advisers from each of the academies, along with advisers from local ROTC programs, to answer questions and provide resources for high school students and their families.  It is a great privilege to be able to nominate worthy candidates to attend our nation's service academies.
 
Protecting Mail Delivery
￼
Meeting with local letter carriers in North Park.

I joined local letter carriers in denouncing Trump's plan to privatize the United States Postal Service. I am opposed to this proposal because if mail gets privatized, private companies may drive up prices on businesses and consumers and that would be bad news. Employees and customers would get the short end while the president's rich friends on Wall Street would reap the rewards.  Click here to read my statement.

Visiting Our Local Schools
￼
Speaking to a class of 12th grade students at Eastlake High School.

I had thoughtful discussions with two bright classes at Eastlake High School and the San Diego School of the Creative and Performing Arts. These visits always inspire me to ensure we are doing all we can to provide our children with a world class education.

National Commission on Service Roundtable
￼
Discussing the importance of service with members of the commission.

I participated in a roundtable with the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service.  The commission was created by Congress to consider methods to increase participation in military, national, and public service and to review the military selective service process.

This event was a part of a series of public events the commission is hosting across the nation throughout 2018 and 2019.  During the roundtable, I spoke to the commissioners about ways that we can increase participation in national service programs.

Medicare for All is a threat to your health care

Dear Lindsey,
Throughout my time in Congress, I have had a strong focus on protecting and improving a patient-centric health care system for Minnesotans and Americans across the country.
Unfortunately, some of my colleagues in Congress have thwarted reform efforts and have instead doubled down on a single-payer system-- the socialist Medicare for All plan.
Despite misleading promotions of Medicare for All, this plan threatens the quality and effectiveness of health care. According to the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA), ""evidence on the effectiveness of single-payer systems suggests that a ‘Medicare for All’ plan would reduce the longevity and health of Americans, despite greater insurance coverage.”
Medicare for All would cripple the American health care market, markedly cutting payments to providers by more than 40 percent—diminishing quality and availability of care.
The CEA states, with a fiscal note of $32.6 trillion, “the high taxes needed to fund Medicare for All would lead to a decline in household incomes of $17,000 annually after taxes and health care expenditures—a 19% decline.” This would devastate the budgets of hard-working individuals and families across the country, with no way out.
Under a single-payer system, individual choice to purchase insurance plans would be completely stripped. All employer-offered and private health insurance benefits, as well as competition from the private sector would be illegal. Medicare for All would call for government-distributed health care “for free”, with no consumer input and all consumer payback responsibility.
A single-payer system would threaten the well-being of Minnesotans and Americans across the country. You and your neighbors deserve to have health care coverage that works for them and their unique needs, which is why we must focus on a doctor and patient-centric system and not move toward a government-centric Medicare for All system.
I will continue to work for the individual health care needs of members of the Second District. As I work on this and other issues, I always like to hear directly from you.  Please share any thoughts you may have through my website, and sign up for my e-mail newsletter for the latest updates from Washington, D.C. and around the district. You can also stay on top of my work by following my Facebook and Twitter pages. Please feel free to call my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-2271 or my local Burnsville office at 651-846-2120 with any comments or for assistance with a federal agency.

Sincerely,

Boozman Bulletin: New Tool to Fund Water Infrastructure Projects  
Yesterday, President Donald Trump signed America’s Water Infrastructure Act into law. I was honored to attend the signing ceremony at the White House because there are historic reforms included in this bill that change how we fund water infrastructure projects.
I’m particularly pleased that it includes my innovative solution to updating our water and wastewater infrastructure. With this new tool in the toolbox, we will be able to help state and local governments overcome the barriers that have stalled water infrastructure improvements for far too long. Fixing our crumbling infrastructure is a national priority and this new policy initiative I authored creates another option for any community, including those in rural America, to address overdue water infrastructure upgrades, 
The new program will combine the best aspects of two existing funding programs to make the process easier and more affordable for states to meet their underserved or unmet water infrastructure needs. It will increase access to previously unavailable funding sources for small and medium-size communities, while removing high application fees which often prevent rural communities from applying for funding.
￼

This policy change is the result of months-long negotiations. It blends the best ideas available to ensure this common sense, bipartisan approach will work effectively and efficiently while providing millions, and potentially billions, in project dollars to communities that have traditionally not had access to these types of funds.
Making this change will allow a multitude of vetted water and wastewater projects to receive funding without the Environmental Protection Agency having to process thousands of additional applications. 
With support from a diverse group of senators, this new initiative to address overdue water infrastructure upgrades has the opportunity to yield dividends across the country. The fact that this new policy has support from lawmakers with vastly different political ideologies, underscores an important point.
Infrastructure investment is not a rural issue, or a big city issue. It is not a red state problem or a blue state problem. This is a national emergency, and we must put partisanship aside and work together to provide safe and reliable drinking and wastewater services to every part of our country.
This message is echoed by the diverse voices in the industry and advocacy community, on both a national and state level, who advocated for this idea.  
Dennis Sternberg, Executive Director of Arkansas Rural Water Association, applauded the policy update to extend these authorities to states. “We are very pleased a version of Senator Boozman’s bill was included in the package. Small and rural communities have more difficulty affording public wastewater service due to lack of population density and lack of economies of scale. Rural America is very appreciative for the help.”   
 

Quick Takes: 
	•	Improving Services for Air Travelers: Earlier this month President Trump signed into law the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. I supported this five-year reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration because it provides protections for air travelers from being bumped after boarding and from shrinking seat sizes as well as modernizes airport infrastructure and enhances transportation safety and security.  
	•	Celebrating Arkansas Black Hall of Fame Inductees: Six individuals with Arkansas roots will be inducted into the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame on Saturday. I recognized the accomplishments and achievements of this distinguished group of men and women on the Senate floor. Watch the speech here. 
	•	Recognizing Arkansas Veterans: The ‘Salute to Veterans’ series honors the service and sacrifice of Arkansas veterans who served our nation in uniform. In the latest edition, I recognized Vietnam veteran Lt Col (retired) James Hudson. Hear his memories about his military service and his work to advance our air superiority. His entire interview is preserved in the Library of Congress Veterans History Project.   
	•	Removing Unnecessary Prescription Drugs: Research has found that the majority of opioid abusers get their drugs from friends and family, often lifting pills from a familiar medicine cabinet. Removing them from homes helps reduce experimentation and overdoses. Saturday is Arkansas Drug Take Back Day. Get rid of old and unused prescription drugs at a nearby drop-off site.  
	•	Connect on Social Media: Stay up to date with what I’m doing for Arkansans via social media. You can find me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

News from Representative Lou Barletta 
￼
 


 
 October 24, 2018  
Fighting to End the Opioid Epidemic in Pennsylvania 
￼
Nearly 10,000 Pennsylvanians have died due to drug
overdoses in the last two years alone. 
Since 2000, more than 300,000 Americans have died from overdoses involving opioids, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly two million Americans will suffer from opioid addiction just this year.  That’s not to mention the 130,000 children over the last decade who were born having already been exposed to opioids and suffering from withdrawal by no fault of their own.
And while every community across the country has been impacted by the opioid crisis, it has disproportionally devastated the Appalachian Region, which includes more than 50 counties in Pennsylvania.  Just last year, over 5,000 Pennsylvanians died from drug-related overdoses – a 15 percent increase from 2016.  Many of those individuals were 25 to 44 years old and in their prime working years, creating a significant challenge to economic growth in communities hit hardest by this epidemic.  From employers who can’t find skilled workers to fill their jobs, to those suffering from addition that prevents them from receiving a steady paycheck, the total economic burden of prescription opioid misuse in the U.S. is estimated to be $78.5 billion a year.  We must address the issues that are creating these economic hardships. 
￼
To raise awareness about the opioid crisis, I told the story of
Brayden Schlier of Lehighton, who was accidentally suffocated by
his mother at just six weeks old when she fell asleep on top of him
after getting high on opioids. 
That’s why I wrote H.R. 5294, the Treating Barriers to Prosperity Act of 2018, which President Donald J. Trump signed into law today as part of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act.  My bill addresses the negative impacts of opioid addiction on labor force participation and economic development by allowing Pennsylvania communities to use Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) funding to fight this crisis.  Specifically, ARC funding can be used for everything from attracting doctors to putting in broadband for telemedicine, spurring economic growth and helping those struggling with addiction by breaking down barriers to employment.
With Pennsylvania being one of the states hardest hit by this epidemic, finding solutions to the opioid crisis has been one of my top priorities in Congress, and the Treating Barriers to Prosperity Act is just one example of the bipartisan, real-world solutions I have brought to our state.  I applaud President Trump for signing this important legislation into law and giving communities across Pennsylvania the tools they need to combat the opioid crisis.





How You Can Help Combat the Opioid Crisis 
 
As part of my ongoing effort to combat the opioid crisis in Pennsylvania, I wanted to make sure you are aware of an opportunity to help by participating in National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day.  Every year, the Drug Enforcement Administration holds Prescription Drug Take-Back Days to provide citizens with the opportunity to safely get rid of excess drugs, helping prevent the possibility of any accidental overdoses by children or abuse by others.  This Saturday, October 27, you can drop off your old medication in a way that is safe, convenient, and responsible from 10 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. 
￼
National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day provides all of us with an opportunity to raise awareness about the opioid crisis, while also preventing excess drugs from falling into the wrong hands.  To find the collection site closest to you this Saturday, please visit https://takebackday.dea.gov/.   
Together, we can take another step toward defeating the opioid epidemic.

I wanted to let you know about an important bill I sponsored to help reduce opioid addiction. The measure was signed today by President Trump.

In fact, it is my 16th legislative proposal to be signed into law since coming to Congress. Six of those measures were signed by former President Obama, six by Trump and four by George W Bush. 

My latest proposal creates a national database to give patients information about managing pain without using addictive opioids.

The list of 16 accomplishments cover issues important to our district, such as protecting Medicare and Social Security, helping veterans, fighting red tide, improving foster care for children and banning the slaughter of American horses.

Some of those proposals originated from the people I represent in Manatee, Sarasota and Hillsborough counties. And virtually all were achieved by working with colleagues from both parties on a bipartisan basis.

Nothing is impossible if we work together. If we had more civility and less partisanship in Washington, we would get more done for the people.

My work in Congress has earned high marks from independent groups that track effectiveness and bipartisanship. The Center for Effective Lawmaking, a respected non-partisan research group run by the University of Virginia, ranked me one of the most effective members of Congress from either party. (click here). 

Another study by the non-partisan Lugar Center and Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy called me one of the most bipartisan members of Congress. (click here). 

As the co-chair of Florida’s bipartisan 29-member congressional delegation, I have always believed that no single party has the market cornered on good ideas.

The new law signed today will help address the growing drug epidemic in Florida and across the country. 

Drug addiction is destroying too many families and claiming far too many lives. I hope my legislation gives doctors and patients the information they need to seek out safer alternatives to managing pain.

Please let me know if you need any more information on this bill or any of the others I mentioned. And keep your tremendous ideas and input coming. I work for YOU!

Dear friend, 
I wanted to keep you updated on the work I'm doing on behalf of Wisconsinites:
Fighting for Wisconsin Communities  Last week, I toured through areas impacted by last month's flooding, including Wonewoc, Elroy, and Ontario.
As I’ve visted with communities and families across the state, I have seen our spirit of strength and resiliency in times of adversity. The President’s disaster declaration will be a welcome relief for many that have been flooded out of their homes and businesses. I look forward to continuing to work with FEMA to ensure the additional federal resources are well-utilized

Last Week in Congress
U.S. Regains Place as World's Most Competitive Economy
￼ ￼ Click here to read more from the Wall Street Journal
We came into the 115th Congress with a fully Republican government for the first time in over a decade. The centerpiece of our agenda was to grow the economy at a rate that the American people haven’t seen since the Great Recession. And that’s exactly what we’ve done. The U.S. has recently regained its status as the world’s most competitive economy for the first time since 2008 thanks to strong economic growth. The report on global competitiveness specifically cited America's ""vibrant entrepreneurial culture,"" ""competitive labor market,"" and ""nimble financial system"" as reasons for regaining the top spot in the world.
Today, unemployment lines across the U.S. are the shortest since 1969 – nearly 50 years ago. For the first time since 2000 there are more jobs available than there are unemployed Americans, and all indications point to sustained, long-term growth in the economy. The economic surge we’re seeing is a direct result of the pro-growth policies like reforming our 30 year-old, broken tax code. This is the Great American Comeback.
￼
U.S. Job Openings Hit Record Level
￼ ￼ Click here to read more from CNBC
Job openings in our country have passed 7 million for the first time, showing that the job market is stronger than ever. This number is far more than the number of unemployed workers in the country, which is currently around 6.2 million. Plus, in a sign of high confidence in the economy, the number of workers who quit their jobs in order to find better jobs is 12.7 percent higher than it was a year ago.
In addition to job availability, workers are also seeing their wages rise. According to the Wall Street Journal, blue collar wages are actually rising even faster than white-collar pay. In fact, wages for the bottom tenth of income earners rose faster than other income brackets, and high-profile companies like Amazon are announcing major pay increases. These number confirm that our economy is booming, and that this boom is providing new opportunities for all Americans.

Around the District
Yoder Highlights Work to Combat Type 1 Diabetes
￼ Kevin with Kerri Lindsay and her two sons, Melissa Cooper, Garrett Brown, and Jessica Brown
Families representing the JDRF Kansas City Chapter have been visiting with me for several years now, and it is so exciting to see these kids again to learn about the tremendous strides being made in the research and development of treatments and ultimately a cure for Type 1 Diabetes. During this visit, Garrett took the time to show me how his Artificial Pancreas works to monitor his blood sugar and adjust insulin doses as needed. This device was just a dream a few short years ago when we first met. As a leader in Congress on efforts to increase federal investment in medical research, I am again inspired by this group and their advocacy for the critical research necessary to beat this disease that affects over 30.3 million adults and children in the U.S. I recently supported legislation in Congress to renew the Special Diabetes Program, which has provided over $3 million to The University of Kansas Medical Center to support their efforts to advance therapies to cure, prevent, and treat Type 1 Diabetes.
￼
Friends In Service of Heroes
￼ Kevin with Jerry Ingram, Max Deweese, and Paul Chapa
It was wonderful visiting with some great Americans, including WWII veterans Jerry and Max, at FISH - Friends In Service of Heroes in Overland Park last week. Thank you to Paul Chapa for your leadership and commitment to our vets through this program. I was proud to report that we’re spending more on our vets than any time in history, improving the quality of service at the VA, and fulfilling our promises to those who serve our country.
￼
Step Up for Down Syndrome Walk
￼ Kevin with Sara from the NDSS and Step Up Walk participants
I was proud to join the Step Up for Down Syndrome Walk on Saturday, benefitting the Down Syndrome Guild of Greater Kansas City. Together, we have gotten the ABLE Act signed into law, increased opportunities for individuals with Down Syndrome to find good jobs, and improved methods for people with disabilities to save up for financial independence. I am excited to continue our partnership for all kids to fulfill their dreams!
￼
KCK Congressional Forum Celebrates 50 Years
￼ Kevin with Edwardsville Mayor ""Tiny"" McTaggart, Congressional Forum President Bill Epperheimer, and Loretta Colombel
I am glad to be a part of the 50-year tradition of the KCK Chamber of Commerce's Congressional Forum, which we celebrated on Friday at Sporting KC's Children's Mercy Park. The Congressional Forum has been here through decades of challenges and successes in both our community and our country, and I am proud to be part of a line of Representatives who have joined this group to discuss the issues of the day. Thanks to the members young and old for keeping the tradition going.
￼
Yoder Hosts Medicare Enrollment Assistance Event
￼ Kevin at last week's Medicare enrollment event
I was proud to be able to sponsor a Medicare Open Enrollment event in Johnson County last week, providing seniors the opportunity to meet with a Medicare counselor and talk about new options for coverage. Thank you to the local, state and federal counselors who took the time to meet with seniors, saving some Medicare enrollees well over $1,000.
￼
National Manufacturing Month at Hipower Systems
￼ Kevin speaking at the Hipower Systems ribbon cutting
October is National Manufacturing Month - the perfect time to visit Hipower Systems and celebrate with a ribbon cutting ceremony at their new headquarters in Olathe. Hipower Systems is a home grown manufacturer of power generation and power distribution equipment, with corporate partners around the globe. I was honored to visit Hipower Systems and learn about their operations, from design, engineering and manufacturing to sales and support here in the Third District. Hipower Systems has invested more than $40 million in the new plant, which will produce a new line of portable generators, creating new jobs and opportunities in Olathe. Special thanks to Samuel Silva for the invitation. The National Association of Manufacturers reports that optimism among manufacturing is at an all-time high right now, and this will mean expanding operations and more high-quality manufacturing jobs for American workers going forward.
￼
Kansas Hospital Association
￼ Kevin with representatives from Shawnee Mission Health, the University of Kansas Health System, and Children's Mercy 
We are fortunate to have access to some of the best hospitals in the country right here in the Third District. It was good to catch up with leaders at Shawnee Mission Health, the University of Kansas Health System, and Children's Mercy to talk about important policy issues facing hospitals today. It is clear that Congress must provide stable payment policies, continue to work to increase transparency and lower prices on prescription drugs, and provide tools to combat the opioid crisis as drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for people under the age of 50. I also toured the Emergency Room at Shawnee Mission Health and heard from health care providers dealing with the opioid crisis here in Kansas City and how they are working to combat this epidemic.
I will work and continue to lead efforts in Congress to increase federal investment in medical research funding, which has huge impacts on the daily work done at these hospitals. Thank you to hospital leadership and staff who took the time to meet with me and who serve the patients and families in the Third District of Kansas every day.
￼
Giving the Basics
￼ Kevin helping pack boxes of supplies at Giving the Basics
Giving the Basics is a true Hygiene Hub in our community, providing personal care products to schools, police departments, shelters and pantries across the metro area. I enjoyed a tour of the warehouses, both old and new, and even got to pack boxes of items that will be distributed to one of many shelters that partner with the organization. It’s such an inspiration to see the commitment and dedication of the staff and volunteers who are working to ensure everyone, from students to seniors, has the basic needs that so many of us take for granted. Thank you to Teresa and Kelley for all you do.
￼
Cub Scout Pack #3395
￼ Kevin with Cub Scout Pack #3395
It was a treat to visit with Tiger and Cub Scouts from Pack #3395 last Monday in Leawood. We read parts of the U.S. Constitution, discussed the three branches of government, and I enjoyed taking their creative questions. It was an honor to be able to pass out pocket Constitutions to the scouts, so that they continue their growth in service and civic duty with our nation's founding documents in hand.
￼
Tallgrass Creek Retirement Community
￼ Kevin speaking to residents at Tallgrass Creek
I enjoyed visiting Tallgrass Creek Retirement Community in Overland Park, to talk with seniors about important issues facing our nation like the economy, prescription drug prices, and my work to preserve and protect Medicare and Social Security for this generation and the next. In the House, I have supported efforts to close the Medicare Part D Donut Hole, help make drug prices more transparent, and replace the old Medicare cards with new, safer cards that do not show Social Security numbers. 
￼
Yoder Receives Defender of Housing Award
￼ Kevin with the Defender of Housing award
I was honored to receive the Defender of Housing award from the Home Builders Association of Greater Kansas City last week. The award is given to members of Congress who support policies that help make the American dream of homeownership possible for more people. I also toured a new home building site in the area to see firsthand the impact that a strong housing market is having on our district.
￼

Fact of the Week
According to the National Association of Manufacturers, for every $1.00 spent in manufacturing, another $1.89 is added to the economy. This is the highest multiplier effect of any economic sector.
In addition, for every one worker in manufacturing, there are another four employees hired elsewhere.
Third District Trivia 
The national unemployment rate is currently 3.7%. How low is the unemployment rate in Kansas right now?
Send your answers to haley.brady@mail.house.gov and the first correct response will receive a shout out in next week's newsletter.
Congratulations to last week's winner David Viebrock!
Last week's answer:  According to the Farm Bureau, the average U.S. farm feeds 165 people each year.
National Prescription Drug Take Back Day
￼
Drug overdose is the leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 50. One way we can help slow this crisis is by turning in unused prescriptions. Click here to find a collection site near you.
Lenexa Chili Challenge
￼
The Lenexa Chili Challenge was a huge success on Friday, with so much good chili and so many great people!
NASCAR at the Kansas Speedway

Dear Lindsey,
            I hope you’re doing well! This October, I’ve spent a great deal of time meeting with constituents, visiting local organizations and businesses, and working with my staff to help 9th District residents with a wide range of issues. I wanted to share some of that with you and highlight the work that I’ve been doing on behalf of the 9th district recently.
            I also wanted to take this opportunity to remind you to vote! With so much going on in our country, make sure you don’t miss your chance to cast a ballot and make your voice heard. Early voting has already begun in Illinois. For more information on how and where to vote, visit the following website:
https://www.elections.il.gov/infoforvoters.aspx
Legislative Priorities
            One of my greatest priorities in Congress has always been to protect, strengthen, and expand earned benefits like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Recently, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell was on Bloomberg discussing his intentions to go after these treasured programs that Americans have earned by paying into them every single month. This has been the Republican plan all along. First they exploded the deficit with multi-trillion-dollar tax cuts for billionaires and wealthy corporations. Now, they’re using the deficit as an excuse to come after Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to pay for it. These attacks are nothing new. Earlier this year, the Seniors Task Force, which I co-chair, released a report detailing the constant and never-ending Republican attacks. You can read it here.
            I won’t stop fighting for our earned benefits. I am a founding member of the Expand Social Security Caucus, which my colleagues and I recently launched. Watch the video below to learn more:
￼
            Another one of my priorities is to lower health care costs, especially the skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs. A life-saving drug is 100% ineffective when it is unaffordable. Drug companies are making record profits and receiving government benefits left and right while everyday Americans have to decide between paying rent and buying the medicines their family members need to survive. That’s why last week 15 of my colleagues and I sent letters to the CEOs of 5 pharmaceutical corporations that benefit from corporate tax breaks and publicly-funded research, demanding answers to the problem of soaring prescription drug prices. It is unconscionable that these corporations are using their multi-billion-dollar tax savings to benefit wealthy stockholders instead of to make their drugs affordable. We need answers about why the taxpayer dollars they receive don’t benefit taxpayers – and we need them now. This week, Americans for Tax Fairness announced that the total amount of stock buybacks authorized by corporations since the Republican tax bill passed in December 2017 now exceeds $750 billion.
            October is National Disability Employment Awareness Month and October 15th marked the end of Hispanic Heritage Month. Click the links in this sentence to read my statements on both of these important commemorations. You can read my statement on Hispanic Heritage Month en español here.
Recent District Meetings
￼ ￼
            Recently, I met with community leaders, faith leaders, hospital representatives, and immigration advocates to discuss the ravaging effects that President Trump’s proposed changes to the Public Charge rule could have on health care access for legal immigrants in our community. The President’s proposed rule is cruel and discriminatory. It will cause children to go hungry, women to lose health care, and families to lose housing. You can read more about the rule and let the Administration know what you think of it by following this link.
￼
            Earlier this month I stood with Senator Dick Durbin and my friends at the Syrian Community Network to protest President Trump's inhumane decision to close America's doors by reducing our refugee admissions level to a mere 30,000. I believe this number must be raised significantly – to at least 75,000 if not higher. As our community knows well, diversity is strength. The United States can and should be doing more to help the global refugee crisis. On a related note, I have been outspoken about the need to be compassionate and supportive of the caravan of refugees heading towards our country from Honduras.
￼   ￼
￼
            I love seeing my constituents at work. In early October, I had the privilege of touring two wonderful businesses on the same day. First, I toured the ThermalCare manufacturing plant, where more than 120 union strong workers are employed making industrial water cooling equipment. Next I visited the Evanston ReBuilding Warehouse, a non-profit that promotes the reduction of waste in landfills through sustainable building practices. They sell low-cost materials and use the proceeds for job-training & development. I also sat down with members of the West Ridge Chamber of Commerce, where I discussed taxes, health care, immigration and many more issues with local small business owners. What an honor to have these great places of work in my district!
Firefighter Assistance Grant
            All of us depend on firefighters and first responders for safety. That’s why I was so happy to see that a $1.4 million grant was recently awarded to 16 fire departments in the 9th and 10th Congressional Districts of Illinois. The grant will allow the fire departments to significantly upgrade their communications capacity, leading to more responsive and effective emergency services for thousands of people. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, Rep. Brad Schneider and I all sent letters of support for this grant. I am proud to have played a part in ensuring that federal dollars meaningfully benefit communities here in Illinois.
            I hope you have found this information helpful. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact my office. As always, I welcome your input, comments and questions about policies, legislation and issues. Please call, write or email me to let me know your opinions and thoughts.
Sincerely, ￼ Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky Member of Congress  Share this on:  ￼  ￼

Dear fellow South Carolinians,  Thank you for subscribing to my weekly e-newsletter, and please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.   Women Veteran’s Event With Veterans Day approaching, I hope you will join me on November 10th in Columbia for a special event honoring South Carolina’s women veterans. All South Carolinians, whether you are a veteran or just a proud American, are encouraged to RSVP and come!  In addition, I recently was happy to announce a special keynote speaker: my friend and colleague, Sen. Joni Ernst. As a combat veteran herself, I am so excited to welcome her back to the Palmetto State and look forward to having her join us at the event. I have no doubt that her passion, story, and mission will resonate with South Carolina’s 43,000 women veterans.  You can learn more about the event here, and RSVP at www. scott.senate.gov/veteransrsvp  ￼ 
Opportunity Zones Late last week, the Treasury Dept. released its first set of rules regarding the Opportunity Zones legislation. Opportunity Zones will not be another bureaucratic process burdened by red tape, but rather a streamlined, efficient process that allows for investments to truly help communities in need. America’s governors, mayors and other local leaders can begin to bring development, hope, and prosperity to some of the most challenged places in our country.  You can hear me talk about the new regulations here, and read my full statement here. 
 Sincerely, ￼  Tim

Restoring Clean Drinking Water 
for Our Children 
and Holding Polluters Accountable
￼

I was proud to stand hand-in-hand with local officials, the Sierra Club, Clean Water Action, and the League of Conservation Voters at the Well Field Superfund site in Fair Lawn to announce North Jersey’s clawing back of $19.5 million from polluting companies to expand and upgrade the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) groundwater clean-up efforts at the site, a victory for clean drinking water for our children, our seniors, and our families.

Keeping North Jersey’s water and air free of pollution is a not a Democrat or Republican issue, it’s just good for New Jersey. This critical investment by the EPA in our community will hold polluters accountable for their damage to our neighborhoods and benefit all who call Fair Lawn home – in jobs created by the clean-up efforts, in improved property values surrounding the Well Field site, and in local families' access to clean water.

The full video of our event can be found HERE.


Breaking the Partisan Gridlock in Congress  for All Americans 

The Problem Solvers Caucus has had enough of the gridlock and we're prepared to buck the status quo and pass common sense legislation on everything from infrastructure to health care. As Co-Chair of the Caucus, I led nineteen Members in committing to only vote for a Speaker of the House who will support House Rules reforms to “Break the Gridlock.” In Washington, I'm proud of every Member standing for Break the Gridlock reforms so we can vote on bipartisan ideas for the good of the American people.""

Clawing Back Dollars to Keep Jersey Communities Safe on ‘Coffee with a Cop’ Day

In honor of national “Coffee with a Cop Day,” I visited the brave men and women of the Washington Township Police Department to tour the new equipment they have clawed back through federal excess equipment programs. Since last September, Washington Township's first responders have secured $110,000 worth of equipment, including a cargo trailer, forklift, and a utility truck for use in water rescue and flooding emergencies. 

This new equipment is another great example of North Jersey towns boosting the return on investment from our federal tax dollars through programs that protect our children, families, and seniors with the money we already send to Washington. This year, we announced that the Fifth District has clawed back $290 per household from Washington – 16% higher than in previous years – to support our local schools, boost storm preparedness and response, and fight crime and terror.

More information about federal grants available in your town can be found HERE.

In June of 2016, Corrie Besaw of Sussex got a notice from the Social Security Administration saying her disability insurance benefits had been terminated. Because she was still qualified to receive them under the Department of Disability Services’ guidelines, Corrie filed to have them reinstated and was approved. But after 11 months and multiple visits to the Social Security offices in Newton, the benefits never restarted because of a bureaucratic glitch.

Corrie contacted my office this summer, and we reached out to the Social Security Administration on her behalf. We got her benefits restarted, and she received $15,000 after not receiving a payment for nearly a year. One of my proudest roles as your representative is to be an advocate for you within the federal government – whether it’s assisting you with Social Security or Medicare benefits, navigating claims with the V.A., or with nominations to one of our military service academies.

‘Josh on the Job’ Helping Seniors with  Habitat for Humanity
￼

For decades, our seniors in North Jersey took care of us, and now it is our responsibility to take care of them. That’s why I was honored to join a crew of longtime volunteers with Habitat for Humanity of Bergen County – the self-styled “Greyheads” – to lend a hand assisting Irene Ade, a 90 year-old Washington Township senior, with keeping up her house and property.

Keeping North Jersey affordable for Irene and her fellow seniors is key to helping them save their hard-earned money and stay in New Jersey. That’s why I helped pass the HOME Act, bipartisan legislation that makes it more affordable for Habitat for Humanity to help seniors like Irene.

Last May, I also announced my Three-Part Senior Security Strategy to cut Social Security taxes on seniors, eliminate double taxation, stop the government from withholding seniors’ Social Security benefits if they are behind on debt payments, and to do all we can to combat the latest Medicare scams. 

More information about my Senior Security Strategy can be found HERE.

“Congressman MacArthur hasn't forgotten Parkland and it is refreshing to see a politician cut through the noise and focus on fixing what's broken."" –Andrew Pollack 
  
Friend, 
I announced three bills I have been working on for months that will enhance our schools and community safety efforts. Following the horrific events in Parkland, I met with local advocates, law enforcement officials, and students to hear their concerns and ways they’d like the federal government to address safety improvements in schools. I’ve also been grateful to have the opportunity to work alongside Andrew Pollack, a school safety advocate who lost his daughter, Meadow, at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Through Andrew’s leadership, he’s created a comprehensive and effective agenda to make schools safer and honor the life of his daughter. I am thankful for his partnership and his willingness to take this unfathomable pain and turn it into action to save others. 
I have not forgotten Parkland and we must continue to do all we can for kids, parents, and teachers. 
  
Fostering Relationships Between Law Enforcement and Mental Health Professionals 
I introduced the bipartisan Mental Health and Public Safety Partnership Act. In many towns across the country, there is a gap between mental health and law enforcement services that needs to be filled. Fostering relationships between law enforcement officials and social workers will better serve our communities and enhance safety throughout our communities. Ocean County has already taken steps to address this need. The On P.O.I.N.T. program, which creates a partnership between Ocean Mental Health Services and the Stafford Township Police Department, has been successful in connecting local law enforcement officials with mental health professionals. 
  
Establishing Innovative Tools to Report Threats at Schools and in the Community 
The Modern School Threat Reporting Act is a new and modern approach to make schools safer. My bill creates federal grants that will be available to states to create mobile applications (apps) that alert law enforcement officials if students, teachers, or parents believe there is a threat to the community. Andrew Pollack, a school safety advocate who lost his daughter, Meadow, on that tragic day in Parkland, championed the similar Florida state law. Andrew has turned unimaginable tragedy into a desire to effectuate change and I am grateful for his support and work on the issue. 
  
Raising Awareness of Criminal Activities in Communities 
Another bill I am working on with Andrew will expand the Clery Act to high schools receiving federal funds. Under current law, colleges and universities are required to maintain records of criminal activity on and around campuses and make that information available to the community. This is an additional way to keep the community informed, instill accountability, and protect our kids. 
  
I won’t ever be blinded by partisanship and I refuse to take part in the partisan dysfunction that prevents progress. The nonpartisan Lugar Center at Georgetown University recently named me again among the most bipartisan members of Congress, because I work against Washington dysfunction and stand up for Burlington and Ocean Counties. If I can ever be of any assistance, please visit my website or contact my office: http://macarthur.house.gov. 
  
Sincerely, 
￼

Dear Friend, 
As your Representative in Congress for New Jersey’s Ninth Congressional District, I always want to keep you informed about my work in Washington and in New Jersey. 
Ribbon Cutting at Overlook Park in the Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park 
Work has continued to progress at the Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park. The completed work at Overlook Park marks another milestone in the continued success to implement our vision for this landmark. This $3.2 million improvement project was made possible by both corporate contributions and funding from federal, state, county and local officials. 
The improvements at the Great Falls included landscape redesign, which now offers visitors the opportunity to view the Great Falls from an amphitheater at the most picturesque vantage points. This view is reminiscent of the one Alexander Hamilton had when he conceived and implemented his plan to harness the force of water at the Great Falls to power new industries to secure our economic independence. 
 ￼
 Representative Bill Pascrell Jr. speaking about the newly renovated Overlook Park
 
This critical moment in our nation’s historic quest for freedom and prosperity is foundational to American industry and the story of our State. It is why I sought to preserve and protect the Great Falls by bringing it into the National Park system. I hope you will take time to visit and enjoy the newly renovated space at Overlook Park.
You can read more about the new renovations at Overlook Park here. 
Cleanup in the Hackensack River and Berry’s Creek
After several decades of study, work will finally begin on a $332 million plan to clean-up Berry’s Creek in the Hackensack River. Earlier this month, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) selected a path forward to address the highest levels of mercury ever recorded in a freshwater ecosystem in the United States. We have known for years about this issue and I have urged EPA to act on the elevated pollution levels in the Hackensack River. 
 ￼
From left, Representative Bill Pascrell, Jr., EPA Region 2 Administrator Peter Lopez, NJDEP Acting Associate Commissioner for Policy Katrina Angarone, Captain Bill Sheehan announce support for EPAs cleanup efforts at Berry’s Creek
Thankfully, the EPA heard my call and added Berry’s Creek Study Area to their Emphasis List of Superfund sites. EPA published the interim plan to address the contamination after an in-depth investigation of the extent of the contamination which took water and fish sampling data and assessed how the tidal action in the creek moves sediment through the watershed. This would not have been possible without support and extensive input from the public, all levels of government, and more than 100 potentially responsible parties. 
Making progress at the heavily-contaminated Berry’s Creek Study Area can allow us to start addressing the broader problems throughout the Meadowlands and Hackensack River. Cleaning up Superfund sites to protect natural resources and public health must be a top priority. And we know that it is only right polluters, not the taxpayers, should be expected to bear the financial responsibility for cleaning up the mess they created. Thankfully, the responsible parties in this case look to be cooperating with EPA. But that is not always the case. That is why I have long supported legislation, like the Superfund Polluter Pays Act, to reinstate the excise tax on polluting industries to pay for the cleanup of Superfund sites to relieve taxpayers of the expense. We can and must act on this to ensure taxpayers should not get stuck with the tab for reckless corporate polluters. 
You can learn more about the cleanup efforts at Berry’s Creek here. 
House Republican Tax Scam 2.0 
As New Jersey’s only member on the House Ways and Means Committee, I strongly opposed the Republican’s latest tax scam that will pummel New Jerseyans and millions of other middle-class Americans to give more money to millionaires and big corporations. 
Among the most egregious offenses, this new bill would make permanent the harmful caps on the federal State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction. According to 2016 Internal Revenue Service data, middle-class New Jerseyans enjoyed SALT deductions on average of at least $10,000 in 20 of 21 counties in our state. In our region, the average SALT deduction in Hudson County was $14,491, $14,714 in Passaic County, and $24,783 in Bergen County. For decades, our neighbors have used this deduction for medical bills, school tuition, home repairs, and other life necessities. This misguided cap may lead to communities cutting local funds for schools, roads and public safety. In their tax scam, Republicans voted to steal it and then convert it into tax cuts for corporations.
I have offered amendments to restore the full SALT deduction to give relief to taxpayers in my district. Republicans voted these amendments down on strictly party lines. 
Despite the overwhelming unpopularity of the Republican’s first tax scam, they are ‘full steam ahead’ to another tax bill that would further hurt New Jersey. I will continue to oppose Republican’s shortsighted effort to raise taxes on New Jersey families. 
You can read more about my efforts to oppose the latest Republican tax scam here. 
Be assured that I will continue working to assist you with any federal issues. My first priority in Congress is representing the people of Northern New Jersey, so please continue to contact me to express your views and ideas. I encourage you to stay updated on my work in Congress by visiting my website, and Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram pages.

Poll: Saudi Arabia
Hoosiers,

On Tuesday, October 2nd, Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist for the Washington Post, disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. During the subsequent investigation, lawmakers across the world called for answers and action over his disappearance, including President Trump, who sent Secretary of State Pompeo to Saudi Arabia to further understand their role in these events. 

On October 22, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister called the death of Jamal Khashoggi ""a tremendous mistake"" while Turkey described the killing as a ""violently planned, very complicated murder, which was being covered up.""

President Trump called for ""severe punishment"" if, after investigation, it is confirmed that Saudi Arabia extrajudicially and maliciously assassinated a journalist. Yesterday, the president called it the ""worst cover-up ever.""

Question of the Week: Do you support enforcing sanctions against Saudi Arabia after a full investigation into the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi?

[_] Yes.
[_] No.
[_] I don't know.
[_] Other (share your thoughts).

Take the poll here.

Loudoun County Library Joins GPO Program That Keeps America Informed On The Federal Government 
Washington, D.C. - The U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO) welcomes Loudoun County Public Library (LCPL) in Northern Virginia to the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). Congresswoman Barbara Comstock designated the library as a Federal depository. As a member of the FDLP, LCPL will provide its customers with free digital access to Federal Government information. LCPL has been named one of America’s best public libraries by Library Journal two years in a row. It is made up of nine branches and is the only library in Virginia’s 10th Congressional district to have joined the FDLP. 
“I was honored to designate Loudoun County Library as a Federal Depository Library,” said Congresswoman Barbara Comstock (R-VA). “Through this designation, the Loudoun County Library will now be able to distribute materials from the federal government, the largest publisher in the world. As a part of this program, Loudoun County Library will better serve the Northern Virginia community, and it will be a tremendous asset to researchers in the region.”

10/23/18 21:21,Hurricane Michael Recovery Continues,"News from Martha Roby
Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window          Click here to open a plain text version of this email
￼
Friends, 
As Hurricane Michael recovery efforts continue, we are gradually learning the full scale of damages portions of our district are facing. The setback for the agriculture industry is severe, to say the least. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, I traveled to the Wiregrass to see firsthand what some of our farmers are experiencing. The devastation is heartbreaking.
Agricultural damage from Hurricane Michael across Alabama, Florida, and Georgia is projected to top $1.3 billion in total losses, with cotton, pecans, and poultry commodities hit the hardest. An expert with the Alabama Cooperative Extension System estimates the loss to our state’s cotton crop alone could eclipse $100 million. That sum does not include the impact the storm had on livestock, peanuts, and timber. When I was on the ground in the Wiregrass, I even saw 1,500 acres of cucumbers that might not make it to harvest. Our farmers are in the midst of a very real crisis.
In the wake of this disaster, Governor Kay Ivey requested that Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue declare our hurricane-damaged counties in Alabama as agriculture disaster areas. She also requested the maximum assistance be made available to our state through existing Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Farm Service Agency (FSA) programs.
￼
I, too, have been actively engaged with Secretary Perdue, and recently penned a letter to him voicing my support for the Governor’s request. It is imperative that our farmers receive the most fitting and best available assistance from USDA during this time, and I am confident Secretary Perdue understands the severity of the devastation that occurred to agriculture in our state. I will remain in close contact with USDA to address any further needs the Department may require in getting our farmers the help they need in the weeks and months to come.
Read more about our Hurricane Michael recovery efforts in my weekly column here. 
FEMA DAMAGE ASSESSMENTS BEGIN IN THE WIREGRASS 
FEMA teams have begun damage assessment to determine whether the Wiregrass will qualify for a major disaster declaration. Local officials have urged homeowners to document damage with photographs and email the information to ema@houstoncounty.org as soon as possible. You can read more about the process through the Dothan Eagle here.  
COFFEE COUNTY RANKED A PAYCHECK FRIENDLY COUNTY 
￼ 
Coffee County was recently ranked the 2nd most paycheck friendly county in Alabama! The study found that Coffee County had an income growth rate of 2.6% over the last five years. Covington County was ranked 5th with an income growth rate of 2.2%. Read more about the study here. 
THE WEEK AHEAD 
Congress is out of session for an October district work period, and this week I will be traveling throughout Alabama's Second District visiting with constituents, local leaders, and businesses. Yesterday, I spent time in the Wiregrass to continue damage assessments with some local farmers. I am looking forward to a week full of valuable time with the people I represent. Stay up-to-date via Facebook and Twitter. 
It is an honor to serve you in Congress. Please never hesitate to let me know if there is a way my office can be of assistance.   Sincerely,

10/23/18 18:29,profits over patients,"￼ 
For almost two years now, I've been digging into the role opioid manufacturers and distributors have played in the opioid epidemic. We've published a series of investigative reports, and last week released the latest one -- and what it shows is shocking.
As NBC News has reported, one physician's assistant prescribed a patient Subsys -- a powerful fentanyl drug -- for her chronic back pain and called it a miracle drug, upping her dosage to SIX TIMES the original amount over only 8 months.   Later, she found out he had received more than $41,000 from the drug's distributor, Insys Therapeutics, to push high doses of Subsys to his patients.   And the report I released suggests that patient wasn't the only one. My staff reviewed 1.6 million pages of internal documents from Insys Therapeutics. And those pages show a jarring pattern -- a corporate strategy -- to boost prescriptions of Subsys in the midst of a massive opioid addiction crisis.   The company took an anything-goes approach to push sales of Subsys higher, funneling money to doctors for speaking events and distorting the doctor-patient relationship by paying sales representatives more for getting physicians to prescribe the highest dose possible (one executive emailed sales reps: ""the bigger the script, the more money you make""). 
I talked to NBC Nightly News about this, and I wanted to make sure you saw the clip: 
￼ 
Insys paid doctors to talk about the company's drug with their colleagues in an effort to increase prescribing.   They gave bonuses to sales reps who pushed the highest strengths of Subsys, and penalized those who failed to generate enough prescriptions.   They leveraged personal relationships between doctors and sales reps.  What united these strategies? As one Insys national sales director wrote in October 2013, ""What drives us all? COMPENSATION.""   This company put profits above all else to line the pockets of their executives -- and that could have cost people their lives. It's disgusting, unethical, and immoral, and it should be illegal. 
Here's the report:
￼ 
The conclusion of my latest report? ""As long as both sales representatives and prescribers have strong financial incentives to boost prescriptions, greed will continue to distort the patient-physician relationship."" 
I won't stop fighting to fix this, Claire

10/23/18 18:06,You’re Invited – Townhall on Disrupting Barriers in Our Community,"  
￼ 
  

Dear Lindsey, 
The East Bay has always been home to an incredibly diverse, vibrant community. 
But inequality is on the rise in our own backyard. A recent UC Berkeley study showed that barriers in our community are making it harder for our Black, Latino, and AAPI neighbors to get by -- to pay rent, access quality, affordable health care services, and stay in their communities. 
And we’re not alone. Across our country, communities are grappling with systemic barriers that hold back communities of color. 
We must work together and face these issues head on. 
I hope you’ll join me this Thursday for a town hall on disrupting barriers within our community. I’ll be hosting a discussion with Alameda County Supervisor Keith Carson on how to tackle these pressing issues in the East Bay. 
Our conversation will start at 5:30 pm on Thursday, October 25th at Oakland Technical High School, and we welcome your thoughtful participation. 
I hope to see you there, and as always, my office is happy to assist you and your family. If you need help with a federal issue, please call my Oakland office at (510) 763-0370. You can also connect with me via email, facebook, twitter, and instagram. 
In Solidarity, 
￼ 
  
P.S. Space for the town hall is limited. Please follow this link to register for the event.

Service Academy Nomination Selection Board Announced 
  
Earlier this week, a four-member panel interviewed prospective candidates who are vying for a nomination to the four military service academies:  the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and the U.S. Air Force Academy.
  
It is an honor to nominate our hardworking and dedicated West Virginia Students to the U.S. Service Academies each year and to highlight the many ways West Virginia students can enter the military while also getting a college education. Every member of the panel brings something to the table and I look forward to reviewing the results of the interviews when I make my nominations. I commend all of the students who interviewed with the board, and who are willing to step forward to serve our country. Their sense of patriotism shows the true spirit of West Virginia and the strength of the next generation.
  
The interview panel includes: 
  
CSM (Retired) Kevin Harry, former West Virginia National Guard State Enlisted Leader
  
Major Jason Lambert – Headquarters, Marine Corps, Legislative Liaison 
  
Rebecca Tucker– Professor of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, West Virginia University Parkersburg 
  
Zahava Urecki—Legislative Correspondent, US Senator Joe Manchin 
  
￼ 
  
The interview process was conducted this week. The Senator's nominations will be announced in November. 
  
  
How May We Help You?
I truly appreciate the opportunity to hear from my fellow West Virginians. As your U.S. Senator, I am proud to be your voice with government agencies during your time of need. My goal is to provide top-notch customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me, or who may need help.  I have a team of caseworkers in each of my four offices to help you with matters of concern. While I have no direct jurisdiction in the administrative matters of any federal, state, or local agency, I welcome the opportunity to assist you with whatever problem you may be experiencing and ask that full consideration is given to your case.
Recently, Angie Walsh a caseworker in my Martinsburg office, assisted Mr. Thomas Holcomb, owner of Mumsey's Iron Skillet in Fenwick, West Virginia.  After Mr. Holcomb’s business was severely damaged in the 2016 flood, he had secured a loan from the SBA to rebuild.  Unfortunately, the rebuild ran into unforeseen expenses and Mr. Holcomb was having difficulty navigating the loan process with the Small Business Administration, Disaster Loan program.  Angie assisted Mr. Holcomb in communicating with the SBA about his property, the damages and the amount of the assistance needed, and was successful in obtaining the full amount to reopen the restaurant.  Mumsey's Iron Skillet is scheduled to reopen in 2019!

And today, the President officially authorized funding for a new lock. This is a great day for northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula.”
In a major win for the First District of Michigan, the America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018: 
	•	Authorizes the building of a new Soo Lock;
	•	Advances research on eradicating invasive species such as Asian Carp and Zebra Muscles;
	•	Takes aim at resolving toxic algal blooms in the Great Lakes; and
	•	Requires EPA to help public water systems monitor for unregulated contaminates, such as PFAS.

Congressional Report

Dear Friends, 
This week I attended various meetings and events with different individuals and organizations, including the McMullen Community Health Center grand opening, the Atascosa Health Center Hurricane response grant announcement and the grand opening of the Webb County Gene Simeon Walker Los Botines Fire Station where I presented a U.S. flag and announced federal funding for the station.  

In the district, my staff attended several meetings and events including the Border Patrol Youth of the Month Ceremony and the ALFA Outstanding Commitment Awards in Laredo. 
Lastly, I have included a video from The Texas Department of Public Safety regarding their new Impact Texas Teen Driver (ITTD) program in honor of Teen Driving Safety Awareness Week.
As always, please contact one of my offices if you need assistance with any federal agency.

10/23/18 17:10,BREAKING: Southern Storage Reservoir Signed Into Law,"News from Congressman Brian Mast
￼ 
EAA SOUTHERN STORAGE RESERVOIR SIGNED INTO LAW
Lindsey - 
With the President's signature, our southern storage reservoir legislation is officially law! 
Today he signed the Water Resources Development Act. In total, our bill contains 9 provisions that I wrote, including a section authorizing the reservoir co-written with Senators Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson, as well as a provision forcing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to re-do the Lake Okeechobee Regulation Schedule (LORS) that determines when the Army Corps is authorized to discharge water from Lake Okeechobee. 
Together, the provisions are expected to substantially reduce discharges to the east and west coasts. 
This is a video from just a few days after I was sworn in as a Member of Congress where I made a promise on the Floor of the United States House of Representatives: that fixing our water quality would be my top priority.... 
￼ 
Since then, we've secured hundreds of millions of dollars toward that goal and fully funded the rehabilitation of the Herbert Hoover Dike, but authorizing the EAA Southern Storage Reservoir and forcing a redo of the Lake Okeechobee Regulation Schedule are the biggest accomplishments yet in our fight. 
This was a community effort, and together, I am confident we will keep up the momentum to ensure the funding we need for this infrastructure and make health and human safety the top priority once and for all.

10/23/18 16:09,Wanted you to see this:,"￼ 
Lindsey – As a doctor, I know a lot of families in Sacramento County continue worry about health care. 

You shouldn’t have to worry that an unexpected medical bill could drive your family into bankruptcy. It’s time for President Trump to stop trying to gut the Affordable Care Act. 

It’s time to focus on solutions – not kick millions off their health care and drive up costs.

That’s why I wanted to share information about Open Enrollment for Covered California – the state’s health insurance marketplace. Now through January 15, 2019, you can sign up and get covered if you don’t receive health insurance through your employer. Covered California is the only place where you can claim federal financial help that might lower your premiums or out of pocket costs. 

Please click here to visit Covered California now to learn more!

￼

If you’re uninsured or would like a plan that works better for you, Covered California may be able to help. You can shop for different insurance plans, explore your options, and possibly find a better plan. Many folks are also eligible for tax credits that makes coverage more affordable each month.

If you or someone you know needs health insurance, please visit Covered California now to learn more. You can also visit www.coveredca.com/get-help or call (800) 300-1506 if you’re interested in receiving free, in-person assistance.

I know many folks have a lot of concerns about their health care these days. That’s why I supported the first bipartisan plan to fix the Affordable Care Act and have also introduced legislation to lower costs and expand access to health care. 

If we start working together as Americans – not as a Republicans or Democrats – I know we can make a positive impact in people’s lives. That’s what Making Government Work for Sacramento County is all about.

Please always feel free to contact me to ask a question or to share your views.

Be well,
￼
Ami Bera, M.D.
Member of Congress

Congressman Cook Co-Sponsors Bill to Fund Border Wall
Congressman Cook signed on as a co-sponsor for HR 7059, the Build the Wall, Enforce the Law Act of 2018. 

The bill, which was introduced by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield), contains several provisions to combat illegal immigration and includes $23.4 billion in new funding to provide border security and fully fund a border wall between the US and Mexico.

In addition to providing border wall funding, the bill also includes a provision which would rein in municipalities that fail to comply with federal immigration laws and provide sanctuary for dangerous criminals who are here illegally. Under this bill, those jurisdictions would lose eligibility for certain federal grants.

HR 7059 also raises the maximum sentences for criminal aliens who illegally reenter the United States to between 10 years and 25 years in federal prison, depending on the alien’s criminal history. In addition, it ensures that alien gang members are kept off our streets by barring them from coming to the United States and detaining and removing them if they are criminal gang members or participate in gang activity. The bill makes it clear that criminal alien gang members are not eligible for immigration benefits, such as asylum, special immigrant juvenile status, and temporary protected status.

Congressman Cook said, “This legislation provides comprehensive border security by fully funding a border wall and ensuring that we’re not only stopping dangerous criminals from coming here illegally, but we’re also bringing to justice the ones who are already here. As the founder of the Stop Sanctuary Laws Caucus, I’m especially happy to see that this bill sends a clear message to local jurisdictions that they can’t thumb their nose at federal immigration laws. I thank Leader McCarthy for introducing this legislation and am pleased to be a co-sponsor.”

The full text of the bill can be found here. 

Cook, Sires Call for Release of Political Prisoners in Nicaragua and Venezuela
Congressman Cook, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, and Rep. Albio Sires (NJ-08), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, issued the following statement on recent events involving political prisoners in Nicaragua and Venezuela:

Chairman Cook and Ranking Member Sires: “We are deeply troubled by continued oppression by the Nicaraguan and Venezuelan regimes against peaceful demonstrators. Arbitrary detention, disappearances, and torture tactics routinely used by the Castro regime in Cuba are also happening at alarming rates in Nicaragua and Venezuela. This past weekend, Nicaraguan National Police beat and arrested at least 26 demonstrators who were peacefully calling for the Ortega-Murillo regime to step down. In Venezuela, the Maduro regime is holding at least 250 political prisoners, including opposition deputy Juan Requesens, and opposition activist Fernando Albán was murdered by Maduro’s henchmen in the SEBIN. We vehemently condemn these actions and call for Nicaraguan and Venezuelan regimes to cease all arbitrary arrests, acts of violence, and torture against dissenting voices, immediately release all political prisoners, and restore democracy through free and fair elections.""

Dear Friends, 
Over 250,000 individuals will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year and 11% of those cases will be in women younger than 45. October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month and I invite you to join me for a panel discussion on the emotional and mental health related to breast cancer. Many women report feelings of shock, distress, anxiety and depression during and after treatment. Especially for underserved communities, access to affordable care is often out of reach. It's important to remember that you are not alone.   
￼
We will hear a first-hand account from a survivor in addition to the expertise from Dr. Dianne Shumay, the Associate Director of Psycho-Oncology at UCSF, Dr. Amie Lee, Director of Clinical Operations at ZSFG Avon Breast Imaging, Sasha Merritt, a tattoo artist who specializes in reconstructive work, and others.

We are strengthened when we discuss our mental well-being and support one another during difficult times. In addition to the panel, information on support groups, healthcare services, and community resources will be readily available. Please make sure you don’t miss out on this opportunity to learn about local programs. 
I look forward to seeing you October 29th.

The new office, located at 1243 Cardinal Ln., Seguin, Texas, 78155, is the fifth office for residents in the 15th District of Texas and will serve constituents in the northernmost areas. 
It is an honor to open an office for residents in the northernmost region of the 15th District of Texas. I am humbled to bring on veteran, Bobby Herrera, to better assist Central Texans. This new location will offer help to educators, senior citizens, veterans, and any constituent facing issues with federal agencies. Whether it be the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Social Security Administration – Mr. Herrera can now offer direct assistance with these agencies on my behalf.
Furthermore, it is an honor to have a diverse staff with every employee having a connection to the district. I believe that ‘diversity’ should be synonymous with ‘America.’ Every organization, including a congressional office, should reflect this idea. I have been blessed with the opportunity to work with a diverse staff.
Additionally, our Chief of Staff, District Director, and Northern District Director are all Hispanic. Women account for 41.18 percent of staff and every employee – every single one – has a direct tie to the 15th District of Texas. The residents of the 15th District of Texas are more than constituents – they are our families, friends, and neighbors.  Every letter, vote recommendation, statement, and decision is grounded in an innate sense of authenticity, compassion, and understanding.
I was elected to represent Central and South Texas, and my offices strive to do the same. It would be my hope that every Member of Congress could implement these hiring strategies and let their offices mirror the make up our country. To the people of Seguin, Texas, and surrounding areas – we are here, able, and ready to help.
Robert ‘Bobby’ Herrera served in U.S. Naval Construction Battalions (Seabee). He is retired from federal government civil service and a service connected disabled veteran. Congressman Gonzalez looks forward to Mr. Herrera’s assistance in helping with constituent services for teachers, doctors, and the 34,000 veterans that call the 15th District of Texas home.

10/23/18 12:49,Driving the economy forward,"News from Representative Tom Emmer
￼

Dear Friend, 
Republicans in Congress and this administration have prioritized deregulation, tax reform and pro-growth policies to unleash America’s true economic potential. 
It’s (literally) paying off. 
According to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the administration issued 176 deregulatory actions last year, eliminating 12 regulations for every new one. 
Congress overrode late Obama-era rules no fewer than 16 times (the most in history) with the Congressional Review Act. This frees businesses to invest in new opportunities rather than paying to meet new federal regulation, saving American families and business owners $23 billion dollars and achieving $33 billion in regulatory savings.
Now, for the first time in over a decade, the United States earned the top spot for the world’s most competitive economy. The Labor Department announced its survey of job openings reached a new high of 7.1 million in August and our economy is growing at a rate of 4% a year. 
Our pro-growth policies are working to drive the economy forward. I am committed to continue this good work.  
To keep up with my upcoming travels around the district, follow me on Twitter or Facebook!  
Sincerely,

￼

￼  
Since I last emailed you, much has happened - both in Washington and here at home. 
Congratulations to newly sworn in Justice Brett Kavanaugh and his family. Despite one of the ugliest political smear campaigns that I've ever seen, Justice Kavanaugh now sits on the United States Supreme Court. 
President Trump has now nominated, and had confirmed, two Supreme Court Justices who are committed to the United States Constitution and the American rule of law. And, don't forget, many District and Circuit Court judges are also being confirmed. This will have a positive impact well into the future. 
Additionally, below, is information on two pieces of legislation the House recently passed, and descriptions of some of my latest stops around Eastern and Southeastern Ohio. 
￼ 
Legislative Update 
Tax Reform 2.0  
As you know, in December of last year, President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law. Following up on that success, the House recently passed what is known as ""Tax Reform 2.0,"" with my support. 
Specifically, Tax Reform 2.0 would: 
	•	make the December 2017 tax cuts permanent for middle-class families and small businesses
	•	enhance several provisions designed to help working families and employees save for retirement, such as: expanding 529 education accounts to pay for apprenticeship programs; cover the cost of homeschooling; or, to help pay off student debt
	•	allow start-up companies to bring in new investors without triggering limits on their access to tax benefits, and provides additional resources to help entrepreneurs start a new business with more capital
	•	enable families to access their retirement accounts on a no-penalty basis when welcoming a new child into the family 
	•	permit small businesses to join together to create 401K retirement plans more affordably while simplifying the rules for participation in employer plans  
Jobless claims are at a 50-year low. Consumer confidence is at its highest level in 18 years. Unemployment remains at or below 4%. This is tangible evidence that comprehensive tax reform has positively impacted hard-working Ohioans and those across the country. I will continue to support policies that benefit taxpayers, and put more of your money back in your pocket. After all, it's your money, not the federal government's! 
TEACH Act Included in Sweeping Opioid Legislative Agreement 
After months of work, the House and Senate sent sweeping, bipartisan legislation to the President's desk. There is no doubt there is more to do, but to date, this is the single largest legislative response to the opioid crisis that claims the lives of an average of 115 Americans every day. It makes important policy changes and investments that will save lives in Eastern and Southeastern Ohio and around the country. 
I'm especially proud that my legislation, the ""Training, Education, and Community Help (TEACH) to Combat Addiction Act,"" was included in this comprehensive bill. Institutions that educate the next generation of health care professionals play a vital role in preparing the workforce to combat substance use disorder, and they can play a leading role in communities seeking to address the crisis. My legislation advances an all-hands-on-deck approach by recognizing and leveraging the expertise of these institutions to more fully integrate Substance Use Disorder (SUD) prevention, treatment, and recovery into health professional education, as well as partner with their communities on scalable strategies to combat SUD. 
The opioid legislation also included another three bills addressing my priorities, including: legislation to expand access to telehealth for SUD treatment; additional resources and technical assistance to peer support recovery organizations; and, streamlining the prior authorization for Medicare patients. 
When signed into law on Wednesday, it will mark the 9th piece of legislation I authored that will have been signed into law by the President. 
￼ 
Around Eastern and Southeastern Ohio 
Columbiana Water Treatment Plant  
Earlier this month, I spoke at the Columbiana Water Treatment Plant ribbon cutting ceremony. Columbiana Mayor Bryan Blakeman, USDA Ohio Rural Development State Director David Hall, and several other local officials and community leaders also spoke.
In 2006, Columbiana County recognized their existing water treatment plant was well beyond its useful life and could not be effectively modified or expanded to meet current standards and regulations. In 2012, shortly after I came into office, I wrote a letter of support in an effort to move this project forward. It was great to be there to witness this new and improved plant come to life. Fresh water is now flowing directly into homes, and the Columbiana region is better suited to meet the demands of its residents and businesses for fresh water.
This project is a prime example of what can happen when all levels of government come together to help solve a problem. Congratulations to Mayor Blakeman and City Manager Lance Willard for their determination to get this project done.

Leetonia Sportsman Club 
Every year, The Leetonia Sportsman Charities awards a wheelchair to a disabled veteran. This year, Leetonia chose one of its own, Sgt. Gerald Timmann, in honor of his bravery and selflessness displayed during the Vietnam War. He served from 1967-1969, and has deservingly received a number of awards, including the Purple Heart, Infantry Combat Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal.
A few weeks ago, I spoke on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives and recounted his story - I encourage you to listen to what I said. And, on October 6, it was my privilege to present Sgt. Timmann with an American flag flown over the U.S. Capitol in his honor. 
Like so many others that served in the Vietnam War, Sgt. Timmann willingly answered the call to serve our country. He exemplifies the very best of our nation, and the selfless courage of those who serve in our Armed Forces. May God continue to bless Sgt. Gerald Timmann and his family. 
￼

Student Leadership Seminar Series Continues 
This month, I spoke with students representing America’s next generation of leaders at both John Glenn High School in New Concord (Muskingum Co.) and Chesapeake High School (Lawrence Co.) as part of my continuing Leadership Seminar series. As always, I thoroughly enjoyed talking to these young people, and I want to thank the officials at these two schools for hosting me. 
￼ 
With student leaders at John Glenn High School in New Concord on October 9. 
I began these seminars as a way to engage with our nation’s future leaders, encouraging them to develop strong leadership skills that can be used in all aspects of their life. Throughout the year, students hear from various guest speakers and notable community and business leaders about the importance of developing leadership skills that will serve them well in life. 
I was fortunate to have many strong role models in my life, strong men and women who helped mold my character. In America, every generation has the humbling challenge of writing the next great chapter of America's journey. And, I am encouraged that these student leaders will take this opportunity to develop their own leadership skills, so that they are ready to take up the reins of leadership and fulfill their generational responsibility to guide America's path forward. 
Ohio Tree Farm of the Year 
￼ 
Presenting a proclamation at the Whispering Pines Tree Farm in Woodsfield on October 20. 
Congratulations to the Whispering Pines Tree Farm in Woodsfield - it was named the 2018 Ohio Tree Farm of the Year by the Ohio Tree Farm Committee. The 135-acre farm has been owned and maintained by John and Bess Lusk for the past 23 years. During that time, they’ve coordinated with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources to ensure good stewardship of the land. 
The Lusk’s held an open “field day” this past weekend, and I was pleased to stop by and present them a congressional proclamation honoring their achievement right here in Monroe County...what a beautiful farm! 
Western Reserve Building Trades
￼ 
Speaking with members of the Western Reserve Building Trades on October 19 in Mahoning County. 
Last week, I stopped at the Western Reserve Building Trades in Mahoning County…their members are extremely busy and hard at work on projects all over the Mahoning Valley and surrounding area. We talked about multi-employer pension issues, the potential cracker plant in Belmont County, working across party lines to get important things done, and other topics that are in the news. 
We had a great meeting, and I appreciate the close working relationship I have with many labor groups. We don’t necessarily agree on every single issue, but we do work well together for the people of Eastern and Southeastern Ohio - especially when it comes to jobs and putting folks to work.

Come and Read It Report
Dear Texans, 
Last week, our community experienced devastating flooding that wrecked homes, businesses, and infrastructure. I visited the folks in Kingsland and Marble Falls to evaluate and get briefed on the damage, as well as provide any assistance to local officials that I can. It came as no surprise that those of you in Central Texas were already working hard and coming together to make the best of this horrible situation. It's important to remember that Texans are tough, we will get through this, and we will rebuild.

Honoring our First Responders 
In September, I had the opportunity to recognize the Bee Cave Police Department and the Lake Travis Fire Rescue on the House floor to honor them for completing the 9/11 Memorial Stair Climb. It was humbling to meet these men and women and present them with a flag flown over the United States Capitol, as well as the Congressional Record of the speech last month. All first responders are vital to the safety of Americans and we must never forget to thank them for all that they do.

President Trump's 'Nickel Plan' 
The federal government’s senseless spending habits have gone unchecked at the American taxpayer’s expense. I am glad to hear President Trump is taking strides to rein in the out-of-control expenses by calling for Cabinet secretaries to each cut their budget by 5 percent. This is a step in the right direction and I look forward to continuing to cut unnecessary, cost-laden programs that will leave our future generations to deal with burdensome, ancestral debt.

About
 
In today’s day and age, American politics is rife with distractions. 
Scandalous headlines and salacious allegations dominate the news cycle, while substantive discussions of public policy take a backseat. Drama-driven political debate is not concerned with economic growth or small business expansion or job creation, when in fact they’re all intimately connected to our financial well-being.
It’s up to Congress to keep our eyes on the ball. That’s why House Republicans are focused on issues that not only resonate with the overwhelming majority of working Americans, but also impact their everyday lives. 
Last month, we passed a second round of tax relief, making many of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’s reforms permanent. As it stands now, last year’s individual and small-business tax cuts would expire in 2025, but our efforts would keep after-tax income gains in place for decades. 
Another Republican proposal—which now awaits Senate approval—would create a “universal savings account” for working families, who could more easily withdraw tax-free earnings for everyday use. Whether it’s paying off student debt or investing in future education, American workers need more financial flexibility—and we are determined to provide it. 
The status quo is untenable. Well over 60 percent of Americans simply cannot afford to pay off an unexpected $1,000 expense. 
That’s part of the reason why I voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act last year. Since the 1980s, American taxpayers had been faced with excessively high rates and a tax code that was more complicated than convenient. We changed that, by decreasing rates across the board, increasing deductions for individuals and business alike, and simplifying the tax system for more straightforward filing.
We’ve seen positive results since then. To date, more than 730 U.S. employers—from large corporations to sole proprietorships—have taken advantage of their savings to reward employers and job-seekers. These job creators are dishing out pay raises and bonuses in record numbers, while making long-overdue investments in business expansion—investments that could not be made under the previous tax code.
This doesn’t just help the one percent, as Democrats love to claim. The overwhelming majority of working Americans (90 percent) have been rewarded with greater take-home pay because of federal tax cuts. When you have more money in your pocket, the possibilities are endless. 
And we’re not stopping there. Tax relief should not be a fleeting phenomenon, but rather a staple of American life. Permanent tax cuts are the solution.
For decades, the Republican Party has dedicated itself to free-market economics, unleashing the private enterprise that creates millions of jobs and powers the U.S. economy. We strive to make it easier for working Americans to get a leg up, to climb the career ladder and find success in professional life.
That mission is more important now than ever. Only by helping employers can we truly help employees—and the families who depend on them. 
That means cutting taxes, slashing regulations, and making the United States the best place in the world to do business.

Sincerely,

10/23/18 11:32,Fighting the Opioid Crisis in Bexar County,"￼



October 23, 2018    
   
  
10849 E. Walking Stick Way
San Antonio, Texas 78205 
  
Dear Lindsey: 
  
I write regarding the ongoing opioid epidemic and its effects on our communities here in San Antonio. Recently, I announced $3 million in grants for the Bexar County Opioid Prevention and Intervention Program alongside Judge Nelson Wolff. These funds will focus on treatment and development of a community wide strategic plan. 
  
The opioid crisis has hit San Antonio especially hard. Bexar County leads the state in infants born addicted to opioids, and San Antonio also has the third highest per capita rate of overdose deaths. This grant funding will bolster many of the efforts that are already underway here in Bexar County to address this crisis.   
  
I will continue working together to access additional federal dollars to back up our local response to the opioid crisis. And in a new, better Congress we can seek more adequate resources for treatment, redress from the pharmaceutical companies that contributed to this crisis, and action on prescription price gouging for Naloxone, a lifesaving drug to reverse overdoses, whose cost has spiked almost 700%.
  
With opioid overdose deaths continuing to rise, it is critical that we advance comprehensive and bold solutions to this crisis. Please keep me advised of any federal matters on which I may be of assistance.

  

Sincerely, 
￼  Lloyd Doggett   ￼￼￼

Check out my new criminal justice bill!

Dear Lindsey,
Over the past two years in Congress, I have proudly worked across the aisle on multiple initiatives to reform the criminal and juvenile justice systems as well as career and technical education. It is my belief that these issues transcend partisanship and are simply good policy.
Most recently, I introduced the Workforce Reentry Act, H.R. 7069, in the House as part of my criminal justice reform efforts. This legislation combines my passion for criminal justice reform with my passion for career and technical education (CTE) to help encourage workforce rehabilitation and decrease recidivism for ex-offenders.
The Workforce Reentry Act reforms the existing Reentry Employment Opportunities (REO) program to promote innovation and improvement in the reentry of ex-offenders into the workforce through competitive start-up grants, rigorous evaluation, and dissemination of best practices. 
My bill also enhances accountability to ensure individuals gain the skills they need to sustain meaningful employment and become productive members of society, while also expanding awareness of ‘what works’ about these programs, to hopefully encourage states, localities, and non-profits to pursue evidence-based approaches to ex-offender reentry into the workforce.
Helping these men and woman get back on the right track so they can contribute to our economy, our communities, and their families is critical to building a safer and stronger nation.
I’m proud to be working on behalf of the Second District to help improve our current criminal justice system. As I work on this and other issues, I always like to hear directly from you.  Please share any thoughts you may have through my website, and sign up for my e-mail newsletter for the latest updates from Washington, D.C. and around the district. You can also stay on top of my work by following my Facebook and Twitter pages. Please feel free to call my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-2271 or my local Burnsville office at 651-846-2120 with any comments or for assistance with a federal agency.

Dear Friends, 
I joined Bill Hemmer on FOX News' ""America's Newsroom"" to discuss the latest on Saudi Arabia, immigration, and border security.  
Saudi Arabia 
The key question is what the role was of Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman. We should not just rely on a Saudi investigation, but have our intelligence community and the FBI look into this. The death of Jamal Khashoggi is deeply disturbing and troubling.
The Caravan 
The caravan of migrants from Honduras is progressing towards our southern border.  This highlights the increasing importance of enforcing our current immigration laws and securing our border. I hope when we return to Washington, we can take the politics out of things and move legislation to secure our border once and for all.
Border Security 
Chairman Goodlatte and I introduced a very strong border security bill this year. We closed the legal loopholes, which would prevent this migrant caravan from happening in the first place, we reformed our immigration system to a merit-based system, and we provided a legislative fix to DACA. Sadly, every democrat voted against that bill.

Traveling through Texas-10 
Taking Care of our Veterans 
I was honored to speak at the 5th anniversary celebration of the Tomball VA Clinic. About ten years ago, I fought hard, cutting through red tape, to gain the approval of the VA Secretary for this community-based outpatient facility for our veterans here in Tomball. The thousands of veterans in northwest Harris County and many in Austin, Waller, and Washington counties have since had a much shorter drive to see their doctor, rather than driving all the way to the Medical Center in Houston. These brave men and women fought for our freedom and the least we can do is provide them care close to home.

Today, I visited with constituents in our district to hear their concerns and update them on what I am doing in the nation's capital to represent them.  We discussed how we are better off now, touching on topics from our economy to our national security.

Double Dose of #TaxCutsandJobsAct Update  
As you may know, last year I voted for the first comprehensive reform of our broken tax code in over thirty years. Since, the American economy has been thriving. Middle-class Americans are seeing more money in their pockets. The average Texan in our district will see over 10% reduction in their tax burden and will save more than $25,000 over the next ten years. You can follow me on Twitter to stay up-to-date on the latest good news surrounding the economy. Below is some great news you might have missed from last week.

October 22, 2018
Hello again, 
You’ve got to love this time of year. The leaves are turning. Pumpkin spice latte is back! Both the Huskies and the Cougars got wins this weekend! Life is good!  Perhaps the only cloud on the horizon is the daily toxicity we see on our televisions these days.   With that in mind, I want to focus this newsletter on a simple concept - civility.   This past year, I joined a group called the Congressional Civility and Respect Caucus. The group formed as a response to some of the incivility our country has experienced in recent years. From a shooting at a Congressional baseball practice to the events in Charlottesville to the erosion of respectful discourse, it’s clear our country has a lot of work to do as we work to form a “more perfect union.”  I joined the group because, despite what’s on cable news every night, I believe it is possible to disagree without being disagreeable. Rather than seeing Congress continue to be overcome by dysfunction and partisan bickering, I think there’s value in trying to find some common ground so that Congress can actually make progress on behalf of the American people.     This past week, I participated in a “Civility Exchange” with my colleague (and fellow participant in the Civility and Respect Caucus) Representative Dan Newhouse from Eastern Washington. I visited Dan’s district on Monday, and he came to our neck of the woods on Friday.   So, why did we do that?  Well - first off, part of the way you get a better understanding of where someone is coming from is to actually get an understanding of where someone is coming from.  Beyond that, though, we both think it is important to start a conversation with folks in our state about what we all have in common. And even where we have our differences (and Dan and I certainly have some disagreements on policy), we both agree that it’s important to engage each other in a respectful and civil way.  Here’s a recap of our tour: 
Making New Friends   Hanford Site   Our first stop was at the Hanford Site along the Columbia River. As many folks know, this is the site of one of the largest nuclear materials cleanups in the world. The scale of the project is pretty hard to imagine - but it framed the rest of our week well. Communities across the country are counting on Washington, DC to fund, supervise and support all kinds of high stakes projects that matter in people’s lives. When the conversation is more focused on finger pointing than results, it has consequences for people across the country. 
￼ 
Tri-Cities Chamber of Commerce   Our next stop on the tour was the Tri-Cities Chamber of Commerce. Dan and I sat down with local business leaders and had a great conversation about how finding common ground can create more economic opportunities for more people in more places. 
￼ 
Washington State University Tri-Cities Campus   Our last stop of the day was at WSU’s Tri-City campus in Richland, where we had a townhall-style meeting with students and talked about the three building blocks of civil discourse:  
	•	Confidence - The goal of political conversations isn’t always about changing minds. Be confident in your beliefs.
	•	Courage - Have the courage to respect someone who thinks differently than you.
	•	Collaboration - Seek to build a relationship with someone who disagrees. You may not agree now, but there is bound to be something that both of you can work on together.
The students asked some great questions, and we had a great time. WSU Tri-Cities streamed the event on FacebookLive, which is available here.
Touring our Region   On Friday, I hosted Dan for a busy day in our region.   Tool Gauge and Tacoma-Pierce County Chamber Business Forum   For our first stop, we visited Tool Gauge, a local manufacturer of high-quality plastic and metal parts for the aerospace industry. The facility was state of the art, and it was great to hear about the company’s tremendous growth in Tacoma.    In addition to touring this innovative business, we had a roundtable meeting with members of the Tacoma-Pierce County Chamber of Commerce where we talked about the value of working to find common ground and encouraging more civil discussions. 
￼
University of Washington Tacoma   Next, we went to the UW-Tacoma for the second student forum of our tour. We had a great time talking about the need for Congress to change some of its rules so there’s more debate and more gets done. We also chatted with the students about some of their concerns, including student debt and criminal justice reform. We agreed with the students that there ought to be an opportunity to make some bipartisan progress on these important issues. You can watch the Facebook Live of this visit here.  
￼ 
Naval Base Kitsap Bangor   We then met with a diverse group that included submariners, employees of the shipyard and the Naval Hospital and others associated with Naval Base Kitsap. One of the submariners pointed out that, when their crew gets on a sub - even though they have different perspectives and different backgrounds - they’ve got to figure out how to work together. Seems like a good message for Congress!  We talked about the legislation that Rep. Newhouse and I have worked on together. For example, we both pushed for a recent measure in Congress that gave sailors and all of the members of our armed forces a pay raise. We also tag-teamed on a bill to improve the services that the VA offers called the VA Management Alignment Act. 
￼ 
Puget Sound Naval Shipyard   Finally, we ended our day at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. I like to bring visitors to the shipyard because I think it shows the important role our community plays in keeping the Navy afloat and the important role the Navy plays in our community.    Beyond that, PSNS shows what’s on the line when Congress fails to work together and pass a budget. When Congress fails to do its job, people at the shipyard and tens of thousands of workers across the region could receive furlough notices. I think our public servants deserve better from Congress. And the current system that relies on kicking the can every couple of months makes it really hard for the shipyard to plan its operations. 
Overall, we had a great time. And hopefully, we started an important conversation with folks across the region.   Our Founders expected that there would be disagreements in our political system. Debate and disagreement are parts of a healthy democracy. But the vitriol and dysfunction that we’ve seen out of DC in recent years isn’t healthy. And it sets a bad example for our kids.    To find common ground, we have to seek it together. And I’m thankful that Dan and his team worked with me to start that conversation.  Working For You   Here’s what else I’ve been up to as I’ve traveled around our region these last couple of weeks:   Protecting Our Workers   I was honored to receive a leadership award from LiUNA’s African American Caucus, a group that fights for equality and worker’s rights across the country. I look forward to our continued work together. 
￼
Saving Our Orcas   Last week, I spoke to the Governor’s Orca Task Force about the work I’m doing in Congress to protect Puget Sound. With Rep. Denny Heck, I’m the co-chair of the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus. We recently introduced legislation called the Preventing Pollution through Partnership Act. The bill would help state and local governments team up with developers to build new green infrastructure projects that trap stormwater runoff, the leading source of pollution in Puget Sound. Last week I toured the green infrastructure projects at the Center for Urban Waters in Tacoma and spoke with local leaders and experts about how we can tackle this problem. We streamed it on FacebookLive, which you can check out here.   
￼ 
Honoring our Veterans   Too many of the 7.2 million living veterans who served our nation in Vietnam have not been recognized for their services and sacrifices. I hosted two more pinning ceremonies as part of the 50th Anniversary Commemoration of the Vietnam War. We had awesome turnout in Ocean Shores and Port Angeles, and it was my honor to be able to present more than 150 pins to veterans at the two events. To everyone in Port Angeles and Ocean Shores who came out for the pinning ceremonies - thank you. 
￼
￼ 
Connecting Our Tribal Communities   I had a bunch of interesting meetings over the last two weeks, including the opportunity to meet with the leaders of the Hoh Tribe. We discussed my Broadband for All Act which would help communities build the infrastructure they need to get connected.  
￼   I also met with leaders of the Quileute Tribe. We celebrated the news that the Tribe has received a $44.1 million grant that will help relocate the tribe’s school to higher ground. I’ve been pushing hard for these funds as a member of the Appropriations committee, at hearings with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and with letters of support. I’m thrilled it finally came through. 
￼That’s it for this week. Remember - you’re the boss. Don’t hesitate to reach out if I can ever be of assistance.   As always, it’s an honor to represent you.  Derek

Dear Friend, 
Honoring our commitment to Arizona veterans is my highest priority. When our veterans return home, we should ensure they can successfully transition to civilian life by providing access to career training and educational opportunities. I recently met with University of Arizona student veterans for a roundtable discussion to share our work and hear directly from veterans about how we can best support them and their families.
￼   ￼
We discussed our work to help veterans achieve success in the classroom and listened to student veterans describe what they need to be successful
Here’s what we heard from Mitch Hegerle, a U of A student and Navy veteran: “Many of us student veterans here at U of A are juggling school with family, work, and other obligations. In meeting with her today, it’s clear Congresswoman Sinema understands the challenges we deal with on a daily basis. We sat down with her and discussed ways we can make education benefits work better for veterans, improve timely access to health care, and how to make the VA more responsive and accountable to veterans’ needs.”  Hearing from veterans like Mitch is why I worked to expand GI Bill benefits for Arizona veterans and helped pass the Forever GI Bill, which allows veterans to use their earned benefits at any point in their lives. I also helped introduce and pass a new law, the BATTLE for Servicemembers Act, earlier this year. Our new law better prepares departing servicemembers to attend college, learn a technical trade, or start a small business.  We’re also working across the aisle to improve the care veterans receive through the VA. Earlier this year, I helped pass the VA MISSION Act, which decreases wait times for Arizona veterans and allows them better access to care in their own communities. The president signed our bill into law in June.  I am honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Arizona families like yours. We always appreciate hearing from you on current topics and issues that are important to you. If there is an issue that concerns you, please let us know by clicking this link or by calling our Phoenix office: 602-956-2285. Be sure to stay connected through our Facebook and Twitter accounts, and let us know how we can be of service.
Sincerely,
￼
Kyrsten

Last week I had the profound honor to welcome many West Texas veterans to the Capitol during the South Plains Honor Flight – an opportunity for World War II, Korean War, and Vietnam War veterans to visit our nation’s capital and the memorials dedicated in their honor. Their service and commitment to country and fellow man will be remembered for centuries to come, and I am thrilled they were able to visit the capital city to see monuments constructed for their recognition and to be cherished as true American heroes. See here for some of my thoughts after spending time with them. 
￼ 
The Thin Blue Line 
Our communities are safe and secure because of the daily commitment to service and protection by our brothers and sisters in blue. Thank you to all our officers for keeping the peace and safeguarding the American people. 
￼
Destination: Dimmitt 
It was great to be back in Castro County for a meet and greet with a group of true West Texans. It is safe to say we are making a difference by bringing a bit of our West Texas common sense to Washington. This Congress has been the most productive Congress in recent history, and many of the policies we’ve passed are ensuring that Americans are better off now and better off for years to come.
￼ 
Shallowater’s Finest 
Last week we celebrated a Texas Tech Raider, Lieutenant Colonel Kris Hulse, at Shallowater ISD as he assumed command of the 2nd Battalion, 142nd Infantry Regiment – part of Armed Forces Reserve Center in Lubbock. His experience in the Army National Guard both here in the homeland and abroad in Iraq and Afghanistan makes him all the more deserving of this position and responsibility. The people of West Texas are proud to have him fill this role as commander.
￼ 
Haskell Navy Pilot 
While still so many Vietnam service members remain unaccounted for, one of our pilots who fought for freedom’s sake was laid to rest back home in West Texas. Lieutenant Commander Charles Bernard Goodwin of Haskell was honored by his fellow man for giving all for the sake of all. As the program from the ceremony stated: “You may be gone, no longer living on this earth, but you will live on – in the memories of your family and friends. There will always be a part of you living in those who knew you.” Read Abilene Reporter-News write up here on his funeral. 
￼ 

Research Deregulation 
Our regions cotton farmers have been clothing the world for decades. Now, they may have the technology to feed the world too with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) announcement to deregulate cotton research - good news!
Throughout the 115th Congress, I have supported measures to increase federal investment in research and development as well as introduced an amendment to the House-passed Farm Bill to expand research opportunities for universities like Texas Tech University. It is great to see the USDA take this move. Read more about the announcement here. 
Please know, it is an honor to be your representative. Feel free to reach out to my office and let me know how I can best serve you.

Kansas Common Sense  October 22, 2018
Hello,
 
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
 
Announcing New Fort Riley Battalion
New EOD Battalion Headquarters at Fort Riley
I was pleased that Fort Riley announced this week it will be the home of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) battalion headquarters in the near future. The headquarters expands the EOD mission on Fort Riley and highlights the contributions that 1st Infantry Division units will make to the future of U.S. Army readiness. I know the Flint Hills region is ready to welcome and support the over 50 military men, women and families that the EOD will bring. This kind of growth of mission reflects the Big Red One’s standing as the longest serving division in the U.S. Army. I am proud of the Army’s confidence in and commitment to the Big Red One and I will continue to work to make certain our soldiers are fully equipped and ready to face any mission. 
Fort Riley continues to live up to its motto as the ‘best place to live, train, deploy from and come home to’ and it’s always good to see that recognized by the Army. I was glad to hear General Mark Milley, Chief of Staff of the Army, recognize that “this move will improve the overall EOD readiness of the U.S. Army. We know the soldiers and families will be in good hands as they transition to Kansas.” For more on this announcement, click here. 
￼ 
Planned Deployment of Fort Riley Soldiers Last week, Secretary of the Army Mark Esper announced the planned deployment of units from three Fort Riley 1st Infantry Division brigades. The upcoming deployments of thousands of Big Red One soldiers exemplifies the critical role of the First Infantry Division in the U.S. Army's engagements in Afghanistan and Europe. While news of deployments will always bring about mixed emotions for the soldiers, families and communities involved, the greater Big Red One community can take pride in the First Infantry soldiers who will be carrying out vital missions, and the country stands behind them. Deployments are a time when Kansans can reach out to soldiers and their families to express our gratitude for their sacrifice. The soldiers serving at Fort Riley have trained hard to be manned, equipped and ready to deploy, and I am confident they will serve the Army well around the globe. 
Update on My Investigation Regarding Abuse in the Olympic Movement
On Wednesday, former USA Gymnastics CEO Steve Penny was arrested and indicted for tampering with evidence in the investigation of abuse at the hands of Olympic team doctor Larry Nassar. During my subcommittee hearing on June 5, 2018, Penny invoked his 5th Amendment right to not answer questions from the subcommittee. During the same hearing, former USAG official Rhonda Faehn provided new information that Penny had instructed another USAG employee to remove gymnasts’ medical records from the Karolyi Ranch – a well-known USAG training facility in Texas – including information relevant to the abuse perpetuated by Nassar. This information helped lead authorities to the arrest of Penny.
Steve Penny’s indictment and arrest further illustrate what we already knew to be true — under Penny’s leadership, USA Gymnastics went to great lengths to alleviate its institutional liability in response to sexual misconduct by Larry Nassar, when that effort should have been spent protecting young athletes. This indictment, coupled with Penny’s unwillingness to cooperate in our subcommittee’s investigation, highlights the systemic leadership issues within USAG that survivors have been sharing with us for months. It is imperative USAG secures leadership that first and foremost supports the well-being of its athletes. To all adults or coaches tasked with caring for our young athletes: when a child entrusts you with reports of sexual abuse, you report immediately. For more information on my investigation, click here. 
Touring Fort Scott Airport and Meeting with Local Officials Regarding Mercy Hospital On Monday, I was in southeast Kansas to tour the Fort Scott Municipal Airport. City officials and business leaders were on hand to share with me the need for a longer and wider runway to allow for safer aircraft landings and to attract new stakeholders to the community. Airports are an important part of many local economies and act as an invaluable entry point for large industry in rural areas: we utilize them to connect businesses to customers, transport supplies and increase the reach of businesses. Local airports also play a critical role in healthcare delivery, and at Fort Scott, the airport is utilized by several medical helicopter services. I’m pleased Congress continues to provide support through the Airport Improvement Program for small rural airports to make necessary improvements to encourage businesses to stay and grow in places like Fort Scott.  
While I was in town, I also met with city, county and community college personnel to discuss the recent announcement by Mercy to close the hospital in Fort Scott. I am encouraged to hear that this opportunity is being looked at as a chance to restructure the area’s healthcare model to better reflect the region’s needs – I look forward to seeing what partnerships come together to sustain healthcare services for the city. The conversations I had with local officials provided me with a better understanding of the community’s options, and I’ll continue working with local leaders to support these efforts. I appreciate what civic leaders are doing to make certain area residents have access to quality, affordable healthcare. 
￼ 
Kansas Delegation Letter to FCC Chairman Pai On Monday, I led the Kansas congressional delegation in a letter calling on Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai to restore sufficiency and predictability to the Universal Service Fund (USF) High Cost program’s budget. The letter was signed by every member of the delegation, including Senator Pat Roberts and U.S. Representatives Roger Marshall (KS-01), Lynn Jenkins (KS-02), Kevin Yoder (KS-03) and Ron Estes (KS-04). 
Full funding of the program, as designed, helps ensure that rural Kansans have access to high-quality, affordable broadband and voice services comparable to those available in urban areas as mandated by current law. In Kansas, insufficient funding to the program is estimated to eliminate support that broadband carriers would otherwise have received for deployment of broadband by nearly $13 million over the 2018-2019 twelve-month period. As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee with jurisdiction over the FCC, I will continue to advocate on behalf of rural Kansans seeking high-speed broadband for a reasonable price while enabling them to participate in the global internet economy. To view the letter, click here. 
Urging Secretary Mnuchin to Protect Community Banks The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) has stimulated economic growth and job creation in our communities. This week, I led an effort to call on the U.S. Department of Treasury to improve TCJA regulations by allowing Subchapter S community banks to fully take advantage of the pass-through business deduction contained in the law. This deduction will help community banks remain competitive, maintain their independence, and continue to offer a wide range of financial services to their communities. I will continue to support tax policies that will produce better economic outcomes for all of Kansas. To view my letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, click here.  
Recognizing World Food Day On Tuesday, I joined people around the globe in recognizing World Food Day. On this occasion and every day, we must reinvigorate our commitment to ending hunger in the United States and around the globe. World Food Day is an opportunity to raise awareness and promote action for the one in every nine people who suffer from hunger. Hunger is an issue that transcends politics, and together we must remain committed to finding new and innovative ways to bolster food security and combat hunger. As the co-chair of the Senate Hunger Caucus, I’m proud to carry on Sen. Dole’s legacy and represent the compassionate spirit of Kansans and the farmers who help feed the world.
￼  
Hosting General Perna at Fort Riley to Visit ATEAM I hosted the Commander of the Army Materiel Command, General Gustave Perna, while he visited the Advanced Turbine Engine Army Maintenance Team at Fort Riley alongside 1st Infantry Division Commander, Major General John Kolasheski, and Kansas Adjutant General Lee Tafanelli on Friday. 
The Advanced Turbine Engine Army Maintenance (ATEAM) of the Kansas National Guard provides the Army, particularly Army National Guard tank units, with a cost-efficient sustainment capability offering the highest quality repair work and customer service to commanders. The ATEAM also provides second-to-none services to foreign partners who specifically seek to increase the readiness of their tank units utilizing ATEAM expertise. The repair work for foreign partners will translate into growth for the ATEAM from the existing 58 personnel to approximately 240 in fiscal year 2019. I invited General Perna to Fort Riley to witness firsthand the unique and cost-effective capabilities of the ATEAM and I am proud they were able to demonstrate their value to the total force of the U.S. Army. 
Visiting Junction City High School and Announcing West Point Nomination
On Tuesday, I toured Junction City High School and visited with various students, administrators and faculty. During my tour, I was able to learn more about the school’s learning pilot program that personalizes students’ education to improve outcomes. I also visited Spanish, JROTC, journalism, and autoshop classrooms. It was clear to me that Junction City High School takes great pride in preparing students with career and technical skills so that they can succeed after high school in whatever path they may pursue. 
During my visit, student leaders gave me a tour of the school. I was happy to surprise one of those student leaders, Corbin Sanner, with the news that he will be my principal nomination to the United States Military Academy at West Point. Every year, I have the distinct privilege of nominating students to the U.S. Service Academies. Corbin recently underwent the application and interview process, and as my principal nomination, he will now be considered for acceptance to the Academy. Thank you to Corbin, and fellow student leaders Joel Nieves and Sierra Garner, for the tour. Thanks also to Principal Melissa Sharp and Athletic Director Matt Westerhaus for arranging my visit and joining us on the tour.
 ￼ 
Visiting with Kansans in Rozel I enjoyed being in Rozel on Wednesday morning where I visited with Pawnee Heights High School students and faculty, as well as patrons of the local café, The Gathering Place. Opportunities to visit local schools and businesses allow me to hear first-hand from Kansans, students, business owners and community leaders about the issues most important to them. At Pawnee Heights High School, I was able to tour classrooms and visit with the seniors during their history class. Thank you to Superintendent Dan Binder and Principal Mark Pywell for the tour, and to the many teachers and staff members for allowing me to visit with their students. Thanks also to the many folks at The Gathering Place for taking time to visit with me and for their thoughtful discussion. I enjoyed visiting with the women’s coffee group and sampling their homemade cookies and brownies!
 ￼ 
Visiting Liberal High School On Wednesday, I toured Liberal High School, one of just a few schools in the state who are participating in redesign. The redesign allows administrators, faculty and staff to take an innovative approach to curriculum and instruction. Students and teachers at LHS told me that this has allowed more hands-on learning and a more individualized approach to education. Thank you to student leaders Josh Diazdeleon, Merrick Dodge, Sandy Vo and Brady Kappelmann for leading my tour. Thanks also to USD 480 Superintendent Renae Hickert, Director of Secondary Education Sheri King and Lisa Stowe for arranging my visit to LHS and for joining us on the tour.
 ￼ 
Keynoting the Garden City Rotary Club’s Meeting After touring Liberal High, I was in Garden City where I gave remarks during the Rotary Club’s regular meeting. Following my remarks, we discussed a variety of issues including K-12 and career and technical education, Amtrak, the Garden City airport, tariffs and ongoing trade tensions, veterans’ affairs, immigration, DACA and the potential return of a Drug Enforcement Agency office to Southwest Kansas. It is always a pleasure to be Rotarians who, across the state, are dedicated to their communities and serve tirelessly on behalf of others. Thank you to local Rotary Chapter President Marc Cottrell for arranging my visit. Thanks also to Garden City Manager Matt Allen, Police Chief Michael Utz, School Board member Jean Clifford, and Chamber President Myca Bunch for attending the meeting.
￼ 
Continuing my Kansas Listening Tour in Hamilton and Kearny Counties On Thursday, I continued my Kansas Listening Tour with stops in Syracuse and Lakin. These stops took me to various locations in both counties where I was able to visit with residents, business owners and community leaders. Our discussions included a number of issues ranging from tariffs and recent news surrounding trade, to veterans’ healthcare, rural broadband and economic development. I appreciate the many residents of both Hamilton and Kearny counties who took time to visit with me and for their thoughtful conversation. 
Now Accepting Spring Internship Applications My own interest in public service was sparked by an internship for Kansas First District Congressman Keith Sebelius in 1974. As an intern, I had the chance to learn firsthand how a Congressional office operates and how the legislative process works. I am proud to be able to offer this same opportunity in my Senate office today, where I have interns year-round working closely with my staff on behalf of Kansans.  Applications for internships in my Washington, D.C. and Kansas offices for Spring 2018 are due this Saturday, October 27. Congressional internships are open to qualified undergraduate and graduate students who have an interest in public service and have achieved academic excellence. Click here for more information. 
Honored to Serve You in Washington
It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard. 
Please let me know how I can be of assistance. You can contact me by email by clicking here. You can also click here to contact me through one of my Kansas offices or my Washington, D.C., office.

Dear Lindsey,

Leland, who served in WWII, loved Betty for many years. Today, that love continues to shine through as Betty shares the memories of her husband.

I was deeply honored to recently meet with Betty and her adult children, and felt so privileged to have helped Betty finally get her long-overdue VA survivor benefits. One of the most fulfilling things I do as your Representative is cut through bureaucracy and red tape to help people.

You can also watch some of my visit with Betty on Facebook.

￼

Betty contacted my congressional office after many years of trying to obtain help from the VA. Typically, the VA expedites cases of claimants over 85 years old, but Betty kept getting delayed and denied. Soon after she contacted us, we were able to resolve her case, and she was awarded a monthly benefit of $1,289.11, a one-time burial benefit of $1,050, and a retroactive payment of more than $116,000!

I’m sure Leland wouldn’t have wanted it any other way.

Read more about Betty and my visit with her in the Loveland Reporter-Herald.
￼
My congressional office has been able to return more than $1,000,000 in federal benefits to constituents in the past 22 months alone, and since starting in Congress, we’ve directly helped more than 5,000 constituents navigate the federal government.

It’s stories like Betty’s and so many others that keep me going. They are truly what it’s all about.

If you’re having trouble navigating the federal government or would like to weigh in on a national policy, please contact my office - the sooner the better. You can call (303) 484-9596 or visit polis.house.gov.

I greatly look forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely,
￼
Jared Polis,
Representative

The Webster Wire
Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends: 
Great news! The United States is back on top as the most competitive country in the world, according to the World Economic Forum! This is the first time since 2008 that the U.S. has been number 1. 
￼  source: Wall Street Journal 
_______________
More good news came from the Office of Management and Budget last week as they announced that in the last year, President Trump’s regulatory reform efforts have saved taxpayers $23 billion.  President Obama weaponized the federal government, using rules and regulations to impose his political philosophy, empower government to pick the winners and losers and circumvent Congress.  This stifled job growth and greatly expanded the federal government, beyond its constitutional boundaries. In contrast, under President Trump, the American economy has been revived by getting rid of unnecessary, outdated, and duplicative regulatory burdens. 
￼ 
_______________ 
Recovery continues for our fellow Floridians in the panhandle who were devastated by Hurricane Michael. The State Emergency Operations Center continues to function at level-one activation, which is full scale 24-hours-per-day activation. Many churches, nonprofit organizations and government entities such as Volunteer Florida are coordinating and organizing volunteer relief efforts to provide aid and assistance.  For more information on ways to get involved or donate, visit www.VolunteerFlorida.org. If you have friends and loved ones in the declared disaster areas in need of aid such as transitional sheltering assistance, have them visit https://www.disasterassistance.gov/ for more information and to apply for aid. 
￼ 
_______________ 
It was a pleasure to recognize Groveland City Councilman John Griffin for his 17 years of service to our county and community. I stopped by his home recently and presented him with a flag I flew over the Capitol in his honor. Thank you John, we are grateful for your service! 
￼ 
_______________ 
Thank you to the Home Circle of Hernando County for allowing me to join your homeschool group meeting last week. We know that a quality education is the key that opens the door to achieving the American Dream.  I believe every parent should be able to pick the educational opportunity that best fits their child.  I have fought against a bureaucratic approach to education and for more local and parental control, I will continue to work supporting and empowering parents with educational choice. 
_______________ 
Wednesday, I attended the Tavares Monthly Healthcare Professionals marketing meeting. I shared actions the House has taken this year to improve Healthcare policy, answered questions from attendees and listened to their feedback and ideas. 
￼
_______________ 
Saturday, I joined the Alzheimer’s Family Organization and others from across my district at the annual Walk Aware for Alzheimer’s in Floral City. The walk commemorates the lives of those who live on in our hearts and memories, and raises awareness for Alzheimer’s care, support, and research. 
I am dedicated to ensuring critical Alzheimer’s research funding is protected.  While in Congress, I have requested full funding and to prioritize NIH funding for medical research and innovation.  This year, Congress authorized funding for NIH at $37 billion, a $3 billion increase from Fiscal Year 2017. 
 ￼ 
_______________ 
Last week, I also attended a small business listening session at the Commercial Contractors Association of Lake-Sumter’s monthly meeting.  It was great to hear from small business owners across these counties on how actions we’ve taken to date cutting taxes and reducing red-tape are empowering them to keep more of their hard-earned dollars and expand their businesses.  These individuals are on the front lines creating jobs in our community.   
­­_______________ 
Meeting and talking with students is one of my favorite – and most encouraging - things to do.  Thursday, I joined the Clermont Middle School Student Body for a Q&A time with the entire school and their teachers. 
￼ ￼ 
_______________ 
Thanks to all who came out for the Citrus County Chamber of Commerce Business Appreciation BBQ and to M&B Dairy for hosting the event. It was a great time together as a community, discuss shared interests and important community issues while enjoying delicious BBQ and ice cream!

Constituent Corner
My office recently announced that as a result of working diligently with VA county services and liaison offices, nearly $4.5 million has been returned to veterans in my district in compensation, pension or retroactive payments since January 2017.  One of those veterans we were able to help is from Inverness and contacted our office regarding his form 9 appeal with the VA. We provided him with the current dates that video conferences were being scheduled, which gave him an idea of a possible timeline. Several months later, his hearing was held. A call was also made to the Board of Veterans Appeals office to confirm that the transcript of the hearing had been attached to his file. Shortly after, we learned his request to reopen his claim for service connection was granted and awarded, allowing for a larger monthly benefit and his nearly $200,000 retroactive benefits payment had been received.  
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.  
District Update
Making reading a priority and ensuring students are gaining this critical skill has been one of my focuses throughout my time in public service.  My Community Relations Representative, Cindy, attended the Early Learning Coalition of Marion County Fall in Love with Reading event.

Legislative Update 
Hurricane Michael has reminded us once again of the importance of disaster preparedness.  It is critical for protecting lives and being a good steward of disaster relief dollars.  Before recess, Congress passed my bipartisan bill to strengthen ‘Worst-Case Scenario’ preparedness for hospitals, and long-term care facilities. My bill, sponsored with Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Michigan), requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, with the National Academy of Medicine, to conduct a comprehensive study into the future natural disaster threats impacting emergency preparedness procedures for hospitals, long term care facilities, and other health care facilities. 
The study will provide Congress with new recommendations and expert analysis on: current emergency preparedness policies and regulations. It will also identify new policies that better address all future threats, provide updated guidelines for alternative power systems and access to clean water and recommendations to improve Federal grant programs to assist health care facilities.

Fallen Heroes
Dear Friends,

This weekend was difficult for many of us following the news that Gwinnett County Police Officer Antwan Toney was shot and killed on Saturday afternoon, while responding to a call. This terrible crime clearly demonstrates the danger our law enforcement officers face daily in our own backyards, and I hope you will join me in remembering Officer Toney’s service and sacrifice and keep his family in your prayers. 

To all those who are working around the clock – and risking your lives – to keep Georgians and our Nation as a whole safe: thank you. I encourage you to read the message below from the Gwinnett County Sheriff's Office.
￼

”This is Gwinnett County Police Officer Antwan Toney. 

If you don't already know him, you'll never have the chance to meet him because he gave his life in service of our community today.

He's a hero, but that may not mean much to his grieving family right now. They're likely still in shock.

This man died today because he was committed to making our community a safer place. For us. He died for us. We owe him a debt that we can never repay.

Never forget the sacrifice that law enforcement officers are willing to make for you. Never forget the tears of their families when they do. The streets of America are stained with the blood of countless officers across this great nation. Be thankful for them.”

My Time on the Ground
With recovery efforts from Hurricane Michael in full swing, I started last week by joining men, women, and children from across the country in offering my time, support, and resources to help storm-battered communities rebuild and recuperate. While crisscrossing the district, I visited cotton and poultry farms to assess the damage and spoke with local farmers to discuss next steps to ensure a quick and full recovery.

 
I was proud of the resilience and kindness of neighbors helping friends and strangers. In the days and weeks ahead, people in our communities will need all the resources they can get. I will continue to work with FEMA to ensure folks have the aid they need for disaster relief. Thank you to the hundreds of first responders, law enforcement officers, and volunteers who provided shelter for evacuees, a meal, and a friendly face. 
￼

On Tuesday morning, I popped into a series of classrooms at Brentwood School in Sandersville to talk with students and administrators. Incorporated in 1969 as part of the Washington County Independent Schools, Brentwood has focused its mission on providing students from Washington County and the surrounding area with an independent, well-rounded educational experience in a nurturing and safe environment. Thank you to Headmaster Anne Brantley for an awesome tour. Y’all have a bright future ahead of you!

At lunch, I joined folks from the Tenille Rotary and the Lions Club to provide a legislative update and hear about what’s happening in the community. I appreciated all of your questions and thoughts and look forward to seeing many of you again soon.

Continuing my day in Hancock County, I visited Sparta Mushrooms to get a firsthand look at its greenhouses, which recently won an award for historic preservation. As an old furniture factory with a new purpose, Sparta Mushrooms currently produces shiitake, lion's mane, and oyster mushrooms. What a unique trip!

Thursday was another full day in the District. First, I started in Greene County for another unveiling ceremony of the Foundations of American Law and Government display in the county courthouse. This collection – which incorporates nine historic documents – is designed to educate the public about the history and background of American law. These important documents are now prominently exhibited in almost 50 Georgia county courthouses, including many in the 10th Congressional District, like Baldwin, Gwinnett, Walton, Barrow, Newton, Henry, McDuffie, Lincoln, Taliaferro, Warren, and Columbia counties.

After the roundtable, I walked through the fields with some local farmers to take a look at the harvest of soybeans and cotton.

I closed out the day by speaking with a group of young people at Oglethorpe County Middle School.

Thanks so much for letting me be a part of your engagement and learning process.

Historic Sites Here At Home
The United States is filled with stunning landscapes, iconic battlefields, and cultural treasures. As a member of the House Natural Resources Committee, I am proud to support and safeguard the preservation of hallowed lands like Kettle Creek Battlefield – right here in Wilkes County – before they are lost to time. Last week, I introduced H.R. 7077, the Kettle Creek Battlefield Study Act, to direct the Secretary of the Interior to evaluate the Kettle Creek battlefield site and determine its suitability as a designated unit of the National Park System.

Considered to be one of the most significant Patriot victories in all of Georgia during the Revolutionary War, the Battle of Kettle Creek is a keystone of not only our state’s history, but our Nation’s. Thanks to the incredible support of the Civil War Trust and community members, earlier this year, nearly 180 acres of this crucial battlefield park were preserved. Protecting sites important to our shared national heritage is fundamental to maintaining our history for years to come, and I am glad to offer whatever support I can for the protection of significant sites like this one.

Serving You
Committed to providing superior constituent services, my staff regularly comes to you to host Mobile Office Hours across our district. Team Hice will be on-site this week in Oglethorpe and Wilkes counties to help hardworking folks learn more about the federal resources available to them, cut through red tape, and get the timely replies they deserve.
￼

Considering a Career in Public Safety?
As we build on the success of the 2018 Regional Job Fair from a few weeks ago, I wanted to announce another outstanding event for folks who are looking for work. On Monday, November 5th from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., the Georgia Piedmont Technical College will be holding a Public Safety Opportunities Career Fair. If you or someone you know is interested in a rewarding career as a police officer, firefighter, EMT, or another job in the public safety sphere, I encourage you to stop by and learn more! A commitment to public safety is a high honor and responsibility, and I’ve been incredibly proud and impressed by GPTC’s commitment to these honorable professions, in addition to broadcasting the many, many other job opportunities across our community.
￼


Helping Our Heroes
I hope veterans in the area will join Team Hice this Saturday, October 27th from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. for my second annual Helping Our Heroes event. In appreciation of all our local veterans, I invite 10th District heroes to come by the Jefferson County Leisure Center, where you will enjoy a complimentary continental breakfast and learn more about the benefits available to you. At the event, guests will be entered into a drawing for a free turkey.  Working in coordination with the Forces United (formerly the Augusta Warrior Project), the Augusta Vet Center, the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center, the Georgia Department of Veterans Service, and the Jefferson County Vets in Action, we are bringing help and resources to you. If you or someone you know is a veteran and interested in attending, I encourage you to click here or call (478) 457-0007 for further details on this exciting event. 
￼

The Week Ahead
With more time in the District, I look forward to spending time in Athens, talking with folks in Eatonton and Covington, and helping our heroes in Jefferson County. 

As always, I’m here to serve you. Please contact my office with any questions, comments, or concerns. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to keep track of upcoming legislation and events!

Sincerely, 
￼

Dear Lindsey,   
Expanding Access to Substance Misuse Treatment  
Last week, I joined Senators Shaheen and Hassan, local elected officials, healthcare professionals and area residents to give remarks at the Ribbon Cutting Ceremony and Open House for the recently completed Friendship House treatment facility in Bethlehem. I was proud to write in support of funding through the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC) for the construction of the new 32-bed facility to help expand services at Friendship House, the North Country’s only short-term residential and outpatient treatment program. I will continue my work to help ensure everyone struggling with addiction can get the care they need. 
￼
At the Friendship House Ribbon Cutting 
Investing in Our Rural Communities  
I also heard from staff, board members, and officials from White Mountain Science Institute, Littleton Industrial Development Corporation, and White Mountain Community College about their respective work and their plans to utilize the NBRC funds they received this year, which I fought to secure. Since it was enacted in 2008, the NBRC has promoted economic development, created jobs, and supported rural communities in New Hampshire and across the Northern Border region. Granite Staters deserve to know NBRC will be around in the years to come, and that’s why I am committed to fighting for and securing the funds this critical partnership needs to continue helping North Country communities grow and thrive.  
￼
At the White Mountain Science Institute 
Keeping Students Safe   
I joined Congresswomen Lois Frankel, Brenda Lawrence, and Jackie Speier in calling on Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to swiftly arrange meetings and fully engage with survivors of campus sexual violence before formally proposing new regulations governing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. I’ve heard firsthand from survivors about the devastation and isolation they felt after experiencing campus sexual violence, and I am deeply concerned by the fact that many survivors have yet to be consulted about new regulations that will directly impact survivors’ ability to pursue an education free from sexual violence. Everyone deserves to feel safe at school, and it is imperative that the Department of Education actively seek feedback from those who know what it is like to feel unsafe. 
Protecting Loan Forgiveness for Public Servants  
Senators Shaheen and Hassan, along with Congresswoman Shea-Porter and I, wrote to Secretary DeVos, urging her to turn over more information and swiftly act to fix the Department of Education’s flawed handling of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. In addition to ignoring the mounting warning signs about the Department’s handling of PSLF, the Trump administration has also actively reduced oversight of student loan servicers, thereby contributing to the current problems in student loan servicing. It is imperative that the Department act quickly to correct these implementation issues so that millions of dedicated public servants can obtain the loan forgiveness they deserve.
Looking Out for the Health of Granite State Kids  
I also joined the New Hampshire Congressional Delegation in sending a letter to the National Institute of Environmental Health Services (NIEHS), calling on the agency to focus research efforts on the potential connection between per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure and pediatric cancer. New Hampshire parents are extremely concerned about what exposure to PFAS chemicals means for the health and safety of their children, and NIEHS must work to determine whether environmental contamination from this family of chemicals is a contributing factor to incidences of pediatric cancer found in the Granite State and across the nation.
I Want to Hear From You  
As always, please do not hesitate to reach out to my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-5206 or my Concord office at 603-226-1002 with any questions, concerns or ideas you have—I love hearing from you!

The president signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 10 months ago. The full benefits haven't been fully realized yet, but the initial results are promising. The economy is expanding at its second-fastest pace in 13 years, and 1.7 million jobs have been added since Congress passed the historic tax reform legislation. Workers saw their disposable incomes grow 3.5 percent over the last year, helping families keep more of their hard-earned money. And, importantly, it has helped to provide certainty for the small business community and lowered employers’ tax burden so they can expand their businesses, create jobs and keep money in their pockets. I am happy to see these positive effects, and I will continue to work hard for the folks in Wyoming and around the country.

Enzi statement on Justice Kavanaugh's confirmation

In early October, the Senate voted to confirm the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be an associated justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. 
""I have read the FBI’s supplemental background investigation on Justice Kavanaugh,"" Enzi said. ""I found no new facts were revealed and no corroboration of the accusations were presented. Sexual assault allegations deserve to be taken seriously and career agents at the FBI compiled this background information independent of political considerations. Throughout this process I have believed that it is important to fairly examine the evidence presented without prejudice. I continue to believe Judge Brett Kavanaugh is well qualified and I voted for him to be an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.""

Enzi hosted the 15th Inventors Conference this month in Casper. ""This conference is near and dear to my heart and has grown to be one of my favorite events of the year,"" Enzi said. ""I am continually amazed by the ideas and the ingenuity from those living in Wyoming."" See more

PHOTO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich joins the International Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Foundation in Thoreau for the Community Plumbing Challenge to install water and sanitation services in homes on the Navajo Nation, October 22, 2018.
October 22, 2018
Dear Friend,
I was in Thoreau this morning with plumbers and pipefitters from New Mexico and all around the world who have gathered this week to help install plumbing and water sanitation services in homes on the Navajo Nation. It continues to be the stark truth that too many New Mexicans lack access to basic infrastructure that many of us take for granted. 
It's estimated that 40 percent of households on the Navajo Nation lack running water. Which is why I was pleased to join with Navajo Nation leaders, the International Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Foundation, labor groups, plumbing manufacturers and other government officials today who are working hard to find solutions on this critical issue and make a real difference in people's lives. 
I am a strong supporter of the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project, which will build 280 miles of new pipeline, new pumping plants, and water treatment plants to deliver water from the San Juan River to communities on the Navajo Nation, the Jicarilla Apache Nation, and Gallup. I helped secure more than $20 million for the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project in the latest government funding bill, and I am committed to seeing this project through to completion.
I will continue to defend and protect tribal sovereignty, and stand up for New Mexico's tribal communities on issues such as education, water access, housing, infrastructure, public safety, and cultural preservation. I will keep doing everything I can to uphold our commitments to all of our tribes and fight for the funding, resources, and policies they need to thrive.
This is not only the right thing to do. It is our moral obligation and our treaty obligation to meet the federal government's trust relationship with our tribes. 
Sincerely,

Panel Discussion in Indy to Mark ‘National Retirement Security Week’ 
As I travel throughout Indiana, I see Hoosiers benefiting from our growing economy. Still, many people I meet are concerned they are not financially prepared for retirement. In addition to working on legislation to help people save more, I cosponsored a resolution to designate this week as National Retirement Security Week.
Today I joined the National Federation of Independent Business to host a panel discussion in Indianapolis on the importance of retirement security. We hope to continue raising awareness about retirement security issues, financial literacy, and the important role employers play in helping their employees plan for their retirement. 
Statistics show that just under half of all private-sector workers aren’t participating in a retirement savings plan through their employer. Twenty-eight percent of all non-retired adults lack any retirement savings, while nearly half of those aged 18-to-29 report no retirement savings at all. That’s why I introduced the Retirement Security Flexibility Act and the Federal Retirement Commission Act to help strengthen private retirement programs and ensure Americans have the tools necessary to plan for retirement.

Indy’s Brookside Neighborhood 
As part of my Fair Shot Agenda, I visited the Brookside neighborhood in Indianapolis last week to get a firsthand look at the community’s Five Pillars of a Healthy Community initiative and efforts to transform the neighborhood.
From providing ministry and education to our young people at Oaks Academy Brookside, to offering job opportunities for people who have struggled with substance abuse at Purposeful Design – Brookside should serve as a model for neighborhoods across the country to replicate. I commend Pastor Dale Shaw, Oaks Academy Brookside Head of School Kelly Altman, Cindy Palmer with Heart Change Ministries, Purposeful Design Founder and Director David Palmer, and all of the Brookside community heroes who are working together to strengthen their community.
The goal of my Fair Shot Agenda is to ensure all Hoosiers, from all neighborhoods, have an opportunity to succeed. To achieve this we must foster an environment where people are engaging in their communities and caring for one another. That is exactly what we are seeing here in Brookside.

October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month 
During Breast Cancer Awareness Month, I visited Indiana University’s Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center to tour one of their breast cancer research laboratories and see the outstanding world-class research being done there. I met with IU Simon Cancer Center Director Dr. Patrick J. Loehrer Sr. and other IU School of Medicine and Simon Cancer Center researchers to learn more about the importance of National Institutes of Health research investments, and their positive health and economic outcomes. It’s important that we ensure this center has the requisite resources to continue its good work and perhaps even expand into other areas that can help save lives and ensure Hoosiers have access to outstanding medical care.

Saudi Arabia and the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen 
Last Monday night, I discussed the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and the humanitarian crisis in Yemen with CNN's Jake Tapper. The murder of Khashoggi is absolutely outrageous. The American people will not stand by idly as journalists are murdered. 
We have seen a pattern of reckless behavior by the Saudi Crown Prince, including in Yemen where Saudi Arabia has engaged in gross violations of human rights and helped cause the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. America’s basic and fundamental values demand a suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Watch my interview with CNN below.

Innovation in Higher Education 
I joined a bipartisan group of Senators last week to introduce legislation that would replace the experimental sites initiative within the Higher Education Act to promote effective, evidence-based innovation in higher education. With this needed reform we can better understand the lessons learned from experiments and use them to ensure students are prepared for the jobs of today and tomorrow. Click here to learn more on how this bill will result in greater access to opportunity for our students.

RUTHERFORD ROUNDUP 
Salute the Troops Edition 

Welcome to a special edition of the Rutherford Roundup dedicated to our men and women in uniform. The First Coast is one of the most military-friendly communities in the country, and we are incredibly proud to be home to so many outstanding servicemembers, veterans and mission-critical installations. From reinvesting in our forces to funding the DoD on time, this Congress has taken seriously its responsibility to make sure our troops are ready for the fight. This newsletter recaps recent actions we in Congress have taken to fulfill our obligation to provide for the common defense.

￼ 

￼ 
Each year, thousands of brave men and women selflessly volunteer to serve our nation. They are the embodiment of our nation’s fundamental shared belief that freedom is worth defending, and we owe our military members and their families our unwavering support. 
Yet, for several years, our military was underfunded and unable to properly train, support, and equip our troops. Congress let DoD funding fall into uncertain, short-term funding cycles, failing to complete the agency’s budget on time for ten straight years. I have heard from so many military leaders about the ways these cuts have harmed readiness and directly endangered our troops. Consider the following:
	•	Less than half of the Navy’s aircraft are mission capable. Ships are staying in port due to lack of maintenance rather than sailing to perform missions.
	•	Eighty servicemembers died last year from training exercises.
	•	The average age of Air Force aircraft is over 27 years old.
	•	Half of Marine Corps aviation units lack the minimum number of ready basic aircraft.
	•	Only one third of the Army’s 58 total brigade combat teams is “ready to fight tonight.""
	•	The number of military facilities deemed by the Pentagon as “failing” have doubled in recent years due to deferred maintenance.
	•	Barracks are crumbling, hangars are being condemned, and air traffic control facilities and runways are in disrepair.
This is simply unacceptable and must end for good. We cannot continue to allow ships to be stuck in port, planes to fall from the sky, and troops to live and serve in unsafe facilities and housing.  
￼
  
￼ 
My colleagues and I in this Congress recognize that the most important job of the government is to provide for the national defense. We have worked tirelessly to find ways to responsibly invest taxpayer funds to protect our troops and fight our adversaries. Congress recently passed, with my proud support, a $674 billion DoD funding bill for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 that builds on our progress to rebuild our military and turns the tide on the current challenges DoD is facing. As General Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, “What the troops have seen is a commitment from the executive and legislative branches of government to give them the wherewithal to do their jobs.”   
The FY 2019 funding bill provides the resources needed to rebuild infrastructure, repair equipment, upgrade vehicles, and scale up recruiting and training. We also gave our servicemembers a 2.6% pay increase - the largest in nine years - which is incredibly well-deserved. 
Important for Northeast Florida’s installations, the legislation also provides funds to procure three Littoral Combat Ships and three MQ-4C Triton unmanned aerial vehicles supporting missions at NS Mayport, plus ten P-8A Poseidon aircraft supporting missions at NAS Jax. It also supports the sustainment of the F-15C aircraft used by the 125th Fighter Wing. And the bill funds maintenance, repair, and upgrade work on the ships, planes, vehicles, and facilities at our installations, making them more efficient and effective.  
￼ 
￼ 
Supporting the DoD also means supporting the industries they rely on, and the First Coast is home to many of the defense industrial base manufacturers, suppliers, and service contractors that provide our warfighters with the tools they need to succeed. This bill provides for six E-2D Advanced Hawkeyes, manufactured by hundreds of employees in St. Augustine, and advances the procurement of our Light Attack Aircraft program, which is key for the potential procurement of the A-29 Super Tucano aircraft manufactured in Jacksonville. 
The effort to build our military to meet the current global threat will take a sustained commitment in the coming years, and as the proud representative of this district, I will continue to fight for our servicemembers, our installations, our veterans, and our nation.

Dear Friend,  Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to read about some of last week’s highlights here in Texas.   Learning About Technology Solutions From A Stafford Business  On a recent tour of Wilson Amplifiers in Stafford, I saw their team of 37 employees who are working hard to develop solutions to help improve telecommunications networks. Their efforts will improve public safety through better connections for first responders and emergency personnel.  As a member of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee, I can help emergency response efforts by reducing barriers to technology improvements. Hearing directly from local job creators is an important way for me to advocate for our business community in Congress. ￼  Rep. Pete Olson with members of the Wilson Amplifier/Silk Worldwide team   Welcoming Costco to Webster  With our economy booming, it was great to attend the grand opening of the new Costco in Webster. This Costco is expected to have one million shoppers each year. In Congress, I’m working hard on behalf of Texas to ensure we maintain a strong environment for job growth. One important accomplishment was passing tax reforms to ensure job creators like Costco can keep doing what they do best – creating jobs and stimulating our economy.  ￼  Rep. Pete Olson with local officials and Costco team members at the Webster Costco ribbon cutting   Talking Public Service With Harby Junior High Students  On Friday, I met with students in the Humanities program at Harby Junior High School in Alvin. We discussed the legislative process and what it’s like to serve in Congress. Students asked great questions about their government and how it works. Our kids are our future leaders and it was a pleasure to discuss the importance of public service with them. ￼  Rep.

10/22/18 16:37,How are you celebrating National Down Syndrome Month?,"
 
￼

￼ 
Hello,
For those of you who don't know our family's story, my oldest, Cole, is 11 years old. Like many boys his age, he plays basketball and other sports. He's also in the Cub Scouts. Cole finds joy in learning, loves school, and is great at math. He is a wonderful big brother to his two younger sisters, Grace and Brynn. 
Cole has Down syndrome, and like everyone else, he has dreams and aspirations. I love how excited he gets when we talk about his passions and the future. He wants to go to college and find a career. He often says he wants to be ""...just like Dad and go into the Navy.""
Because of Cole, I've connected with a whole new purpose in my life, and today I am a proud ability advocate. I say ability advocate because I believe it is so important to focus on what every person has to offer--not their limitations.  For me, ensuring those who are part of the disability community have every possible opportunity to live happy, healthy, and productive lives is not just good policy, it's personal. 
This month I've been celebrating Down Syndrome Awareness Month and National Disability Employment Awareness Month, to honor the many people, like Cole, who bring so much joy and happiness to the world. 
I'm marking this important month by reflecting on all the big wins for the disabilities community this past year. For example, I led the effort to include provisions important to those with disabilities in tax reform, and today I'm proud to say we're knocking down barriers that often trap people with disabilities in poverty. Thanks to months of hard work, I'm pleased to report that the employment rate for people with disabilities has jumped sharply over the last two months. 
Tax reform is also building on the success of my Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act that created tax-free savings accounts for job training, education, and disability-related expenses. By increasing annual contribution limits and allowing rollovers from 529 savings accounts, ABLE accounts are now more flexible and accessible to those who need them. 
My ABLE to Work Act, which was signed into law in tax reform, makes it easier for people with disabilities to explore the workforce and save more of what they earn. More specifically, thanks to my legislation, an ABLE beneficiary who works and receives an income can save up to the Federal Poverty Level in addition to their annual contribution limit of $14,000. As a result, ABLE accounts are helping people with disabilities find an internship, start a new job, or even run their own businesses!  The inclusion of my ABLE to Work Act in tax reform marks an exciting new chapter for the disabilities community.
A job means so much more than a paycheck, it's a foundation for a better life. That's why it's so important to keep working to unleash the full potential of people living with disabilities and continue building on the progress we have already made. That's why I made sure tax reform was written with people with disabilities in mind.
That's not all. My ABLE Financial Planning Act was also signed into law last year and allows rollovers from a 529 account. This means that individuals who may have been saving for their child's college tuition can now roll over up to the maximum contribution each year until the 529 account has been depleted. This adjustment empowers people with disabilities at every stage of their life, and it helps them invest in their futures, pay for medical expenses, and look for a job. It can even help them cover the cost of getting to work when they find a job, which is a game changer for so many.
This month also marks the first anniversary of the bipartisan Disability Employment Working Group I started with a number of my Democrat and Republican colleagues. Our goal is to find real solutions that help individuals with disabilities find meaningful work in our community and escape the cycle of poverty. We meet on a regular basis to identify regulations that act as barriers to entry for those with disabilities, and identify legislative changes that can encourage them to enter the workforce and unleash their full potential.
These are just a few of the many ways I'm celebrating Down Syndrome Awareness Month and National Disability Employment Month. I know there's much work to be done in the future.  However, when we provide opportunities for people--no matter their walk of life--and unleash their full potential, there's no telling what we can accomplish together. 
Thanks, ￼ Cathy McMorris Rodgers Member of Congress

Executive Action Will Bring More Water to Central Valley
Over recent years, California has experienced its worst drought in recorded history. Since coming to Congress, I have dedicated myself to fighting for water for the Central Valley. However, our California Senators have refused to help - putting the needs of a tiny fish over the needs of Central Valley families. 

After years of fighting, at our request, the President signed an Executive Action promoting the reliable supply and delivery of water in California and the entire western United States. 

I am proud our efforts have effectuated such substantial progress. With a reliable water supply, we can restore fallowed fields into fertile farmland, put Californian’s back to work, and give all Central Valley families the opportunity they deserve.

This Executive Action puts in place a strict timetable for rewriting the biological opinions that lie at the root of the water crisis. The Executive Action also prioritizes building critical projects to expand water storage in our state so that we can store more water during wet years for use in dry years.

As a life-long Central Valley resident and farmer, I know firsthand the challenges faced by Valley families and farmers when water becomes scarce. Access to safe, clean, and reliable water is the lifeblood of the Central Valley’s booming agricultural economy, and ensuring access to water is imperative to the everyday lives of all Valley families. 

Now, California families can rest assured that help is on the way.

Sincerely, ￼ David G. Valadao Member of Congress

Dear Lindsey, 
As members of the greater St. Louis community, we must always be watchful and aware of our surroundings. This week we were reminded that trafficking can happen anywhere, including right here in St. Louis. That is why fighting human trafficking remains one of my top priorities in Congress and why I was so honored to receive the 2018 Wilberforce Award from Rescue:Freedom International for writing and passing the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA). There is still much more work to be done. Recently, I introduced the Empowering Financial Institutions to Fight Human Trafficking Act to promote information sharing between non-profit organizations and financial institutions. With this legislation, we can put a stop to the money laundering that allows traffickers to keep their illicit networks afloat. 
￼
￼

I’m also honored to work alongside the St. Louis Business Travel Association (STLBTA) in fighting human trafficking in our region. As a transportation crossroads, St. Louis is unfortunately one of the country’s leading hotspots of trafficking. Travel pros are on the front lines of this fight and deal directly with victims, buyers, and pimps. I am grateful the STLBTA was one of the first travel organizations to sign ECPAT’s Code of Conduct, signaling their commitment to end the commercial sexual exploitation of children. We have made tremendous strides in the fight against trafficking, and that’s a testament to our travel industry, community organizations, academic institutions, law enforcement, prosecutors, and service providers. It was wonderful to see so many attend the STLBTA’s presentation on how best to make St. Louis safer for everyone.

Throughout this Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we remember all the strong survivors and their families, as well as those we have lost. So many of us have loved ones affected by cancer. Together, we can fight against this disease with research, education, and awareness. In Congress, I will continue cutting red tape to promote innovation for new life-saving cures.
 
￼

The nomination application deadline for the United States Service Academies’ Class of 2023 was last week. We received 41 applications from across Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District. My dedicated Nominations Panel is preparing to review each candidate’s file and conduct interviews later this year. It’s an honor to nominate talented students to the U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, U.S. Military Academy, and the U.S. Naval Academy each year!

Dear Friends, 
Before talking about last week, I want to flag some important dates looking forward. 
First, early voting begins today, October 22, for the November 6 general election. Some key facts to know about early voting: 
	•	You can vote at any early voting location in the county where you live,
	•	You do not need to provide an excuse or reason why you cannot vote on Election Day, 
	•	Government-issued photo ID is not required, and
	•	Grace Registration is available for unregistered voters at any early voting site.
You can find an early voting site near you on the websites for Cook County and Lake County. Voting is among our most important rights as citizens in a democracy, and early voting is an excellent and convenient way to make your voice heard.
Second, on November 9, I am excited to host our second annual Veteran’s Breakfast to kick off the Veteran’s Day weekend.  This is another opportunity to honor those in our communities who served, and share some of the ways my office and local veteran organizations can be of assistance. The breakfast is at Crist’s Rey St. Martin College Prep in Waukegan, and is free and open to all veterans in Illinois’s Tenth Congressional District. More details are listed below. 
As for the week that was, it was another very busy week throughout the district, including visits to Round Lake Beach, Mundelein, Waukegan, Glenview, Gurnee, Wadsworth, North Chicago, Grayslake and Northbrook.  One of the highlights was running into students I met during school visits earlier this month at various event around the district.  It’s inspiring to see these young people engaged in our community and I really enjoy the opportunity to hear from them, and their parents, every chance I get.
Please read on for updates from my week working at home in our district. Additionally, we’re still accepting RSVPs for our Medicare Part D Help Sessions this November– sign-up today! 
  
CONSTITUENT SERVICE SPOTLIGHT: HELP RECOVERING MEDALS 
￼                                                                       
Our office worked with John Wensch of Winthrop Harbor to acquire medals that his late father, a World War II veteran, earned in the Pacific Theater. I'm grateful for the service of John's father, and glad we could help honor his memory in this way. 
If you need help with a federal agency – from Medicare and Social Security to immigration and the VA – please contact our office in Lincolnshire at (847) 383-4870.
  
100 PERCENT SCORE ON LGBTQ EQUALITY ISSUES 
￼ 
  
Last week, I was proud to announce that my legislative record on LGBTQ equality issues has earned a 100 percent score from Human Rights Campaign. The Fair and Equal Housing Act, bipartisan legislation that I helped introduce to prevent housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, was one of the bills featured in the scorecard. I will continue to stand up to efforts to undermine these hard fought rights or to discriminate against our fellow Americans because of who they are or who they love. 
Learn more on HRC’s website.

￼ 
  
The Medicare annual enrollment period starts TODAY and lasts until December 7. This is the yearly time when seniors can make changes to their Medicare coverage for the following year.

Climate Change is Altering Our National Parks - Not the President's Resolve to Ignore Facts and Science
￼  If climate change continues unabated, studies predict indicated that many native trees like these along Echo Bay Trail in Voyageurs National Park will eventually be replaced by less desirable species that can better live in hot weather. 
Dear Friend, 
Ignoring the overwhelming evidence of man-made climate change based on facts and science, the President told CBS News correspondent Leslie Stahl last week he thinks the Earth’s rapid warming “will change back again.” Too bad the President’s wishful thinking won’t save our 417 national parks.    According to a new study by the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Wisconsin, failure to address global warming by radically reducing fossil fuel-based carbon emissions is already altering these national treasurers forever.   Over time, for example, scrub trees that can live more easily in hotter weather could replace the tall pines covering much of the land in Northern Minnesota’s Voyageurs National Park - which I was proud to support when it was established in 1975 during my first term of Congressional service. Some species of fish and wildlife will disappear – including our iconic Minnesota loons, which are likely to move north into the colder regions of Canada.   Out West, the study predicts that California’s Joshua Tree National Park will eventually lose its Joshua trees, while wildfires transform the forests of Yellowstone National Park into grasslands. And if current trends continue, Glacier National Park will lose its glaciers as they melt into rivers.    Dire predictions like these still fail to move the President and GOP leaders to take even modest steps to address climate change. Their concern, as the President indicated in the CBS interview, is to keep the fossil fuel industry fabulously profitable and wealthy– regardless of the cost and permanent loss to future generations.  
We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email. 
Sincerely,  ￼ 

Real Immigration Reform is the Only Solution to the Chaos and Tragedy on our Southern Border
￼  The President’s new plan would reportedly give parents two heartbreaking choices: stay behind bars with their children for months or years until their cases are decided – or allow their children to be placed in separate federal detention centers in hopes of being picked up by a relative or guardian.
Last summer, political pressure from a shocked and angry public forced the President to abandon his policy of forcibly separating immigrant children from their parents at our southern border. But last week, the Washington Post reported that he’s actively considering reinstituting this terrible practice, hoping to intimidate more families from seeking asylum in the United States. And he may, in fact, shut down the government in December if Congress doesn’t approve funds for his wall.  
Let’s be clear. We must have strong border protection. A nation without borders is not a nation. But it is simply preposterous to suggest that it be done with an $18 billion dollar wall, or by deporting some 11 million people. 
Real immigration reform would include a path to citizenship for immigrants who have been living in the U.S. for some time, and who do not have a criminal record. And real reform would include respect for international accords that protect those who come here legally seeking asylum. 
It’s been more than five years since the Senate sent a bipartisan immigration reform bill to the House. Since then, Republican leaders have refused to allow consideration of the plan, which might have avoided much of the terrible chaos and cruelty on our southern border. 
Republican leaders need to get serious about passing real, comprehensive immigration reform – and stop trying to fix the immigration mess with bad legislation concocted from behind closed doors, with every Democrat and a good share of their own caucus left out of consideration. There is plenty of rank and file support on both sides of the aisle to find commonsense, bipartisan solutions to put a stop to the needless human tragedies that continue to occur on our southern border.  

Under Pressure, Administration Agrees to Implement Year-Round Sale of E-15 Ethanol
￼  According to the Congressional Budget Office, biofuel is responsible for a 35% increase in every bushel of corn used to make it.   
Under strong pressure from farm state Democrats and Republicans alike, the Administration has finally agreed to direct the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to get moving on rules and regulations allowing year-round sales of E-15 fuel that is 15 percent ethanol by July 2019.   This is good news for Minnesota corn and soybean farmers – and for the 47 Democrats and Republicans, including me, cosponsoring the Consumer & Fuel Retail Choice Act (H.R. 1311) to allow for year-round sale of E-15 fuels. Passing the bill would go beyond EPA regulations to put the force of law behind year-round E-15 sales.  As I have pointed out before, ethanol adds 63 cents in value to every bushel of soybeans used to make it - and adds about 35% to the value of every bushel of corn used in production. With farm income at a 12-year low, that’s a real boost to our farmers and rural communities. According to the Minnesota Bio-Fuels Association, Minnesota ranks fourth among states in ethanol production. By the end of May 2018, Minnesotans had already used a record 29.9 million gallons of ethanol – a 57 percent increase in sales over the 19 million gallons sold during all of 2017. 

GOP Tax Cuts for Millionaires, Billionaires and Wealthy Corporations Drive the 2018 Federal Deficit to Record Heights 
Republicans promised their tax cuts for the rich would ""pay for themselves."" That hasn't happened, so they're targeting cuts to Social Security and Medicare instead. 
￼  We cannot and will not allow the President and GOP leaders to carry through with their plans to cut Social Security and Medicare in order to make up for record high deficits brought on by their $1.5 trillion tax cut for millionaires, billionaires and wealthy corporations. 
The simple fact is that the massive, $1.5 trillion tax cut - 80% of which the President and Republican leaders handed to millionaires, billionaires and wealthy corporations last year - is not “paying for itself” as they promised it would. Last week, the Treasury Department admitted that the federal deficit ballooned to $779 billion in fiscal year 2018 – a 17% increase over 2017, due directly to the fact that big corporations and the richest one percent of Americans are paying far less in taxes.   Now guess how the President and GOP leaders plan to deal with this ballooning deficit, now predicted to reach$1 trillion a year by 2020? That’s right. They’re targeting big cuts in Social Security and Medicare – the hard earned benefits Americans begin paying for from their very first day on the job. GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell admitted as much last week when he called Social Security and Medicare “the real drivers” of the federal deficit.   What nonsense! The real truth is that neither Social Security nor Medicare is in debt. Quite the opposite – the Social Security Trust Fund is carrying a surplus of roughly $2.8 trillion according to the official actuary audit. And Medicare will remain solvent well into the 2030’s. So there is plenty of time to fix whatever needs fixing in both programs – without cuts to benefits and without risky Republican privatization schemes to turn Social Security over to Wall Street and Medicare over to the for-profit health care industry.   Meanwhile, as I have said many times before, it’s time for real tax reform that targets the middle class and requires the rich to pay their fair share for a change. That must be our goal going forward.

Our Week in Duluth 
￼  It is important for Congressional offices and federal agencies to have good communication to better serve our constituents. This week, the U.S. Forest Service invited Congressional staff members to Duluth to speak with leadership teams from the Superior, Chippewa, and Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forests. Jeff Anderson, my District Director, joined representatives from Senator Tina Smith and Senator Tammy Baldwin’s offices, and staff from the House Committee on Agriculture to discuss congressional relations between the Forest Service and congressional offices.  
￼  USS Duluth Crewmembers Association representatives (left to right) Don Rowe (Mentor, Ohio), James Shepard (Burleson, Texas), and Dan Streu (Duluth, MN) stopped by my Duluth office for a visit and an update on our efforts to request that the Secretary of the Navy name a new LPD amphibious U.S. Navy ship for the city of Duluth and in honor of the USS Duluth LPD-6, commissioned in 1966 and later decommissioned in 2005. I have worked with the association on a number of projects over the past 6 years including our successful efforts to bring an anchor from the decommissioned USS Duluth to its new home on the Lakewalk on the shores of Lake Superior.  
￼  My District Director Jeff Anderson joined area housing stakeholders in a housing issue roundtable hosted by my colleague, U.S. Senator Tina Smith. The roundtable was hosted by Ecolibrium 3 in Duluth’s Lincoln Park neighborhood. Representatives from the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, City of Duluth, Duluth Housing & Redevelopment Authority, Center City Housing, CHUM, Lifehouse, and area realtors shared housing needs in the Twin Ports. Senator Smith and I are committed to making sure the federal government is a partner in building quality, affordable housing here in Minnesota. 
Our Week in Two Harbors
￼  The Two Harbors Area Chamber of Commerce held their annual membership meeting at the Castle Danger Brewery in Two Harbors. Members heard from MNDOT officials about North Shore road construction projects. Attendees also received an update from a panel of local leaders including Mayor Chris Swanson, Lake County Administrator Matt Huddleston, Lake View Hospital’s Greg Ruberg, the DNR’s Kevin Johnson and Jay Belcastro from Lake Superior School District. My District Director Jeff Anderson attended this meeting on my behalf.
Our Week in Pine City 
￼  Locals gathered at the Pine City Senior Center where they received an update from Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen about the announcement from Social Security Administration last week that benefits for more than 67 million Americans will increase 2.8 percent in 2019. 
Our Week in Eveleth 
￼  The Alcohol and Mental Health Community Solutions public forum was hosted by the Opioid Abuse Response Strategies North Workgroup (OARS) in Eveleth last week. Presenters discussed how alcohol and methamphetamines top the list as the major substance abuse issues in northern Minnesota, even in light of the national opioid crisis. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tom Whiteside attended the event.

Finally...
On This Day in History - October 22, 1962  President John F. Kennedy Announces Blockade of Cuba as Missile Crisis Threatens to Ignite Nuclear War with the Soviet Union
￼  Like virtually every other major newspaper around the world, the New York Times front page announced the U.S. blockade of Cuba with bold headlines. 
Fifty-six years ago today, President Kennedy spoke to the world from the Oval Office, announcing that the U.S. had imposed a quarantine on Cuba in an effort to force the Soviet Union to withdraw offensive nuclear missiles they had secretly installed on the island. In the end, the Soviets removed the missiles, moving the world away from the brink of nuclear war.   Some 15 years later, as a young Congressman, I met in Havana with then Cuban President Fidel Castro in what became a successful effort to free the last U.S. prisoners from the ill-fated 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. Castro predicted it would be many decades before diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba would be normalized. At the time, I thought him overly pessimistic, but in the end, his assessment proved to me true.

Congressman Bruce Westerman’s eNewsletter Monday, October 22, 2018
￼
￼
Last week, I embarked on a 980 mile road trip of the region for the annual Fourth District Agriculture Tour. During my travels, I visited communities from Moscow in Jefferson County to Alabam in Madison County and finished in Foreman in Little River County.
This tour focused on the importance of agriculture to the Arkansas economy – it contributes more than $16 billion to the state economy each year – but also the struggles facing farmers, ranchers, and others who depend on agriculture. The feedback I received will be invaluable in my work representing Arkansas.
To catch up on my visits during the 2018 Ag Tour, visit Facebook.com/RepWesterman or follow the hashtag #AR04AgTour on Instagram and Twitter.

10/22/18 14:22,We All Know Someone with a Preexisting Condition," ￼    ￼   ￼

￼
We all have loved ones who live with high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes, and even cancer.
These illnesses are just a few of the ""pre-existing conditions"" that over 150,000 Montanans fight through on a daily basis. 10 years ago, our health care system allowed insurance companies to deny coverage to folks with these pre-existing conditions.
￼
That is one of the many reasons why I fought hard to change our health care system and pass laws that ensure all Montanans who have pre-existing health conditions can access health insurance and seek the treatment they need.
 
￼
But today that progress is under attack. There are politicians in Helena and Washington, D.C. who are fighting to roll back these protections and give insurance companies the power once again to deny you coverage if you have a pre-existing health care condition.
Their actions not only harm thousands of Montana families, including your own, but they are also driving up health care costs for everyone. Their attacks on our health care are unacceptable, and that is why I will continue to defend all Montanans with pre-existing conditions.
 
I am fighting to stop the expansion of ""junk"" insurance plans that don't cover pre-existing conditions. I'm holding the U.S. Justice Department accountable so it defends our strong health care laws in court, and I'll keep passing bills that will lower health care costs for Montana families.
￼
You can learn more about my efforts to lower health care costs HERE.

As always, it is an honor to serve you in the Senate, especially those of you with pre-existing conditions.

If you or a family member are on Medicare, I wanted to remind you that open enrollment is now underway.   This is the 7-week window when seniors can change their prescription drug plan or switch from original Medicare to Medicare Advantage or vice versa.     This once-a-year window gives Medicare recipients the opportunity to select a new plan for 2019 based on annual changes in cost, coverage options and available providers or pharmacies. 
The enrollment period ends on Dec. 7.    Everyone with Medicare is eligible for prescription drug coverage, regardless of income and resources, health status or current drug expenses. Seniors who are happy with their current coverage do not need to do anything.   Seniors may sign up or update their plans in two ways:   1) Phone: Call 1-800-MEDICARE. Seniors should have their Medicare card, a list of drugs they use and the name of their pharmacy on hand to get immediate help in choosing a plan.   2) Online: Go to Medicare.gov to review prescription drug coverage options.   The Medicare program can often be confusing, so please do not hesitate to call my Sarasota office at 941-951-6643 or my Bradenton office at 941-747-9081 for assistance with open enrollment.   More details on Medicare Open Enrollment are available online in the U.S. Government Medicare handbook.     Vern

Dear Neighbor, 
In late 2017 when Republicans passed a massive $1.5 trillion tax cut for millionaires, billionaires, and big corporations, their bill went to President Trump’s desk without the vote of a single Democrat. This was profoundly irresponsible legislation that I could not support. 
At the time, Republicans promised that economic growth would replace the lost government revenue and even reduce the budget deficit. Now we know the truth, or at least the price tag for the snake oil they were selling to the American people. 
On September 30th, 2018 the federal budget year ended with a $779 billion deficit – a 17% increase over fiscal year 2017. Government revenue in 2018 from corporations alone was down more than 30%, a direct result of the permanent tax cut they received. Even more revealing, $164 billion of the 2018 budget deficit is directly attributable to lost revenues as a result of the Republican tax cut.    That’s right, the Republicans are now borrowing $164 billion from China and other countries to give tax breaks that benefit the wealthiest Americans.  
And it gets worse. Next year’s deficit is projected to be $981 billion and then over $1 trillion in 2020. 
This week, the Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blamed the deficit on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The Republican plan is clear: explode the deficit, drive up the national debt, and then achieve their longtime goal of cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to pay for their fiscally irresponsible tax cuts. 
It is impossible to operate the much needed day to day functions of the federal government when Congress refuses to collect sufficient revenues. 
I want to reassure my constituents, especially seniors, people with disabilities, children receiving survivor benefits, families with loved ones in nursing homes, and low-income families – I will fight to protect your earned benefit programs! We need to strengthen these programs and I support lifting the caps on payroll deduction so every dollar of earned income by every millionaire is being paid into the system.  
Our nation faces an inevitable fiscal crisis and the Republicans in Congress don’t care. President Trump’s own record of multiple business bankruptcies should be considered a foreshadowing of the mess he will leave the American people, especially our children. 
To keep America moving forward we need to make smart investments, help provide the tools the American people need to keep them productive, and make everyone pay their fair share for the freedom, blessings, and opportunity this country provides us all. 
The choice is clear – we can pay taxes to our government and support the services necessary to keep America strong, or we can continue to borrow money from China to give tax cuts to the rich. 
Middle class families are already paying their fair share of taxes, it’s long past time that big corporations and the wealthiest among us pay their fair share too. 
  
Sincerely,  ￼  Betty McCollum Member of Congress

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 10.22.18
Monday, October 22, 2018 –                                 
Prescription Drug Costs
Previously, I reported in this column that two bills meant to combat high drug prices had passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate. I am happy to say that President Trump has since signed them into law.
The Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018 and the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act ban “gag clauses,” which are sometimes imposed by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) on pharmacists and can lead to customers paying higher prices for prescription drugs.
These bills easily passed the House and the Senate, and President Trump voiced strong support for them as he signed them into law. These were the Senate versions of legislation I worked on in the Energy and Commerce Committee with a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Buddy Carter (R-GA), Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Michael Burgess (R-TX), Peter Welch (D-VT), Gene Green (D-TX), and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA). They are bipartisan wins for transparency in drug pricing.
Good News for Manufacturing
America’s economic strength is often associated with manufacturing, and manufacturing jobs are often associated with well-paid, steady work.
Right now, manufacturing is enjoying a resurgence nationally and in the Ninth District.
At the national level, U.S. manufacturing capacity increased for the sixteenth straight month in September. Crucial policy changes, such as the rollback of excessive regulations both by Congress and by the Trump Administration and enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, are fueling this boom.
Prudent regulation and the cutting of excessive red tape allow those companies to devote more attention and resources to their businesses rather than complying with overly-prescriptive governmental dictates.
By making America’s tax code more competitive with the rest of the developed world, companies have more reasons to open or expand manufacturing operations in the United States.
Further, we changed the tax code to make it easier for American companies who profit overseas to bring those profits back to the United States for investment, wage increases, etc.
Wages are up. The American people are confident about their economy, and they are buying more goods, manufactured goods.
Better policies at the federal level encourage this manufacturing boom. We can share in this national manufacturing renaissance. Good economic news from the past months shows that we are in fact sharing in the growth.
The Roanoke Times highlighted that the Volvo plant in Dublin has added 300 new workers since the beginning of September and 900 new workers overall since the beginning of the year. As manufacturing swings upward, more trucks are needed to move goods, therefore increasing sales of big rigs like the ones produced in Dublin.
Other companies with established operations in the Ninth District are expanding, too. I have participated in these announcements. The paper and packaging company WestRock announced in September that it will be investing $248 million to upgrade its manufacturing operations in Covington and Alleghany County. WestRock’s choice to invest millions indicates a long-term commitment to its manufacturing operations in our area.
In Henry County, Monogram Foods also announced in September a $30 million expansion, which will lead to the creation of 300 new jobs. This is Monogram’s latest expansion in Henry County.
Not only are manufacturers with an existing presence here investing in and expanding their operations; companies have found our area ideal for establishing new operations. This happened in Henry County, where Press Glass, a flat glass manufacturer headquartered in Poland, will invest $43.55 million and create 212 jobs.
Press Glass saw what the other companies knew from their operations here. We have the workforce and the infrastructure a manufacturer needs to succeed.
As I visit businesses across the district, investments are being made and jobs are being created.
We also are working together at the local, state, and federal level to build on these assets for further growth. One example where this is occurring is Project Intersection in the City of Norton, a site being developed for future manufacturing operations. It is a product of regional cooperation through Norton and the Counties of Lee, Scott, Wise, and Dickenson. Federal contributions have included a $3.5 million grant through funding I secured in the Abandoned Mine Land reclamation program and $917,315 from the Appalachian Regional Commission.
Thanks to the individuals who took risks to start manufacturing goods in the United States, manufacturing helped build this country into a great economic power, and it provided many families with stable, well-paying jobs. Recent months show that by implementing better policies and leveraging the right assets, manufacturing can thrive once again, in Virginia and across the nation.

10/22/18 11:29,Baldwin Announces Over $14 Million for HIV/AIDS Care and Support Services,"Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email


￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
As a strong supporter of increased funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs, Senator Baldwin is pleased to announce that more than $14 million in federal grant funds have been awarded from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to improve the quality of health care and support services for Wisconsinites living with HIV/AIDS.  
These federal grants, which are part of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, will support Wisconsin organizations and clinics including the AIDS Resource Center of Wisconsin, the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee Health Services, Inc., Sixteenth Street Community Health Centers in Milwaukee, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
“HIV/AIDS remains a public health crisis in our country and despite medical advances, people living with HIV still face significant physical, emotional, and financial burdens to quality health care,” said Senator Baldwin. “I am proud to have helped secure this funding for HIV/AIDS prevention programs and other efforts aimed at building healthier families and saving lives throughout Wisconsin.”
The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program provides support for people living with HIV/AIDS who do not have adequate health coverage or resources to cope with the disease. Grants were awarded by Parts B, C and D of the Ryan White Program and funding will be directed to the following areas:  
	•	Part B provides funding to states to improve the quality and availability of HIV health care and for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP)
	•	Part C directly funds community clinics and health centers that deliver quality, comprehensive HIV care to over 275,000 Americans per year
	•	Part D funds local organizations’ efforts to provide family-centered comprehensive HIV care and treatment for women, infants, children and youth
Senator Baldwin has long supported increased funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programs to improve prevention and education efforts and to help save lives. In addition to helping secure over $14 million in federal grant funds for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program this year, Senator Baldwin introduced the HIV Clinical Services Improvement Act to ensure that our community providers have the capacity and support to deliver high-quality care to those living with HIV/AIDS. Senators Baldwin and Kirstin Gillibrand have also repeatedly lead calls for strengthening federal investments in our domestic programs to address the serious public health threat of HIV/AIDS in America.

Wicker Praises the Return of Pastor Brunson to the United States
American Had Been Unjustly Detained in Turkey for Two Years
Prayers were answered on October 12 when American pastor Andrew Brunson was released by the Turkish government.  For two years, the Christian missionary had either been jailed in a maximum security prison or placed under house arrest.  Detained on false charges, he was denied due process or legal counsel.  Like thousands of Americans, I was thrilled to see President Trump welcome him to the White House merely a day after he could return home.
Unfortunately, Pastor Brunson’s story is just one example of the rampant persecution that followed a failed military attempt to overthrow Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan two years ago.  In the aftermath, the government conducted a widespread purge of military leaders, civil servants, and others – both Turkish citizens and foreign nationals – thought to be supportive of the coup.  NASA scientist Serkan Gölge, a dual Turkish-U.S. citizen, is still imprisoned in Turkey on charges similar to those levied against Pastor Brunson, and two Turkish employees of our State Department remain jailed simply for doing their jobs to assist U.S. diplomats.
Wicker Resolution Condemns Turkey’s Religious Freedom Violations
I have followed all of these cases closely, urging President Trump to use his meetings with President Erdogan to demand justice.  My role as chairman of the U.S. Helsinki Commission involves working at an international level to promote the rule of law and human rights.  Turkey has rejected those principles with the unfounded detention of Pastor Brunson, other innocent Americans, and Turkish nationals who worked for our diplomatic mission. 
Congress, the Trump Administration, and the international community should continue to put pressure on Turkey.  It is unacceptable for Americans or other foreign nationals to be used as political hostages.
In June of this year, I introduced a bipartisan Senate resolution to support the efforts taken by the Trump Administration to protect religious liberty in Europe and Central Asia.  The resolution names Turkey as a “Special Watch List” country because of its serious violations of religious freedom.  The resolution also specifically mentions the treatment of Pastor Brunson, calling on those who are responsible for his imprisonment to be denied entry into the United States.
‘Global Magnitsky Act’ Holds Human Rights Offenders Accountable
Banning the travel of human rights violators to the United States is one of the ways the “Global Magnitsky Act” has sought to curb the abuse of human rights around the world.  The law began as an effort to hold Russian officials accountable for the imprisonment and ultimate death of Sergei Magnitsky.  The lawyer had uncovered a major tax corruption scheme involving Russian government officials.  In 2016, the “Magnitsky Act” was expanded, allowing travel bans and economic sanctions to be placed on officials in any country for human rights offenses.
I am proud to be one of the principal authors of this landmark law, and I believe in the enduring message it sends: The United States will always stand up to injustice and attacks on human dignity.  Pastor Brunson’s case illustrates the persecution that has been felt by religious minorities around the world.  His release is an encouraging development, but our work is not done.

Here are a few things I thought you'd like to see: 
  
1. Hurricane Michael 
  
￼ 
  
President Trump and Vice President Pence visited Middle and South Georgia this week to tour Hurricane Michael devastation and meet with farmers and producers whose crops were impacted. I joined Vice President Pence on Tuesday, and we appreciate the Trump Administration's support as we work to get our communities up and running again.

2. Georgians Coming Together 
  
￼ 
  
Many of our communities have a long road ahead after Hurricane Michael, but it's so encouraging to see Georgians coming together during this challenging time. Georgians from across the state have donated supplies, served meals to those in need, and assisted first responders with recovery efforts.

This Week In Review
 The United States economy hit a record breaking high. As reported, the U.S. is now the world's most competitive economy. This is great news for businesses and workers!  
 ￼  As the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act soon marks it's first year as law, we can reflect on each month since it was passed, and the positive climb our economy has taken. This news shows our economy is at an all time high. Most recently the House passed a Tax Reform 2.0 package that will continue to put our economy ahead of others as it will lock in the middle-class and small business tax cuts.   Let's take a moment to celebrate the good news!   
Pima Medical Institute Site Visit
￼  My team and I spent time touring Pima Medical Institute (PMI) in Phoenix. During the visit we discussed students’ medical education and training in the allied health field, along with discussing the benefits of being an employee-owned company.
Thank you to Pima’s staff for giving us a tour of the Phoenix campus. We thoroughly enjoyed visiting and learning more about the training and skills you are teaching to students.   
Constituent Spotlight
 
 ￼  My team had a very special visit with Mr. Elson and his wife. Mr. Elson is a Navy SEAL Veteran who came to us after a long process of asking the VA to provide his disability benefits, and my team aided him across the finish line! It was an honor to meet Mr. Elson and his wife and thank him for his service to our country.  If you have a Federal Agency issue that our office can help with, reach out to us!    
￼  Legislation Highlight:    The JOBS for Success Act, H.R. 5861, helps to support a partnership between the local workforce and the families who are eager to move from welfare into jobs. This bill will focus on four key changes:   - Renames the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to Jobs and Opportunity with Benefits and Services (JOBS).   - Ensures no one gets ignored or is left on the sidelines, there are no ""lost causes"" or families that are ""too difficult"".   - Focuses on real outcomes - getting and keeping a job.  - Helps poor families, those that need these funds the most.   - Uses funds to help individuals find work by requiring at least 25% of funds go towards core activities to support individuals and families.

Newtown Resident Saves Man from Drowning
￼ 
Kristian F. Falkenstein of Newtown prevented a 32-year-old man from drowning last year in Belmar, New Jersey. After seeing a man being swept out to sea, Kristian immediately swam out to save him. When Kristian reached him, he was barely above water. 
Despite the waves and strong rip current, Kristian was able to keep him afloat for several minutes until two lifeguards and a responding police officer were able to swim out to them with flotation devices to assist until the Coast Guard arrived on the scene. Falkenstein and the victim were taken to a hospital. The man was not injured, but Falkenstein was treated for effects of near-drowning; he recovered. 
Kristian Falkenstein is nothing short of a hero. His valiant actions saved a life that day. I proudly presented him with the Carnegie Medal for his bravery. I applaud Kristian for his heroism and willingness to take on significant risk in assistance of a fellow citizen.

One year after hurricanes Irma and María devastated Puerto Rico, FEMA, its federal partners and the Government of Puerto Rico are undertaking one of the largest post-disaster reconstruction and humanitarian efforts in U.S. history. Major infrastructure projects are being undertaken as federal agencies support Puerto Rican officials to restore the island’s lifeline systems and enable Puerto Rico to withstand future weather events.

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend,  Over a week ago, the western part of the Second District was ravaged by Hurricane Michael. As we work to pick up the pieces and rebuild, I am continually amazed by the kind and giving spirit that defines Northwest Florida communities.  ￼    Since Hurricane Michael left a path of destruction, I have traveled to the counties and people who were hit the hardest. I’ve met with local leaders, law enforcement, first responders, and members of the military in counties across the district and surveyed much of the damage.  As we work to rebuild our communities, we must work together. Thank you to all who are dedicating their time to helping the Panhandle, including our law enforcement, first responders, military members, National Guard, utility workers, and volunteers.   ￼ ￼  President Trump came down to survey damage from Hurricane Michael and promote our relief efforts. He has assured me that he has our back. The Panhandle will rebuild and with the help of President Trump we will come back better than ever.  ￼  Thank you to Governor Rick Scott for working with us to advocate for Northwest Florida. Governor Scott has been on the ground with me in the affected areas and has met with hundreds of survivors in the Second District. He has worked tirelessly to ensure state resources are ready and available to the counties devastated by the hurricane.   ￼  My good friend Majority Whip Steve Scalise came down to Port St. Joe to hear from local leaders and survey damage. We helped serve hot meals to hardworking folks in the area courtesy of Drago’s Seafood. Drago’s is a Louisiana-based restaurant that traveled down to Gulf County to provide 1,000 meals to victims of Hurricane Michael. Thank you to all who have donated time and efforts to helping out those who need it most.   ￼  Another area that was hit hard by Hurricane Michael was Tyndall Air Force Base. I have spoken to President Trump, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson, and leadership in Congress about the importance of rebuilding Tyndall Air Force Base. Tyndall is an important part of the economy in NW Florida and our national security. I am working with the Air Force and my colleagues in Congress to ensure that Tyndall is rebuilt.   It will take some time, but we will come back from this. We are hurting, but we will rebuild. My office is here to help. If you are having issues with disaster assistance or have a question about resources that are available please do not hesitate to reach out. Please call 202-225-5235 or email me through our website www.dunn.house.gov.   Below are Hurricane Michael resources available to many in the Panhandle. It is extremely important you start by applying for assistance through FEMA:   To apply for federal assistance through FEMA, visit DisasterAssistance.gov or call 1-800-621-3362.  If you’ve been displaced from your job through Hurricane Michael, there is help. The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity has created jobs that help rebuild our communities. Click here to learn more.  FEMA will also provide Disaster Unemployment Insurance to help with lost wages due to Hurricane Michael. To apply, call 1-800-621-3362 or visit www.fema.gov/disaster/4399   Operation Blue Roof is a program offered by FEMA that makes temporary repairs to homes affected by the hurricane. It is available in all counties approved for FEMA Individual Assistance. To learn more call 1-888-ROOF-BLU or visit www.usace.army.mil/BlueRoof/    Beware of fraud and scams.  ￼    Sincerely, ￼  Neal Dunn Member of Congress

￼ 
   
     As children of God, we are called to protect the most innocent, the unborn. Over the last 22 months, my office has supported and fought for pro-life legislation that includes:

	•	H.R. 490, the Heartbeat Protection Act
	•	H.R. 4712, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act
     No American should ever worry that their tax dollars are being used to fund organizations that perform abortions, which is why I have also supported every effort to defund Planned Parenthood and advance pro-life protections. I will continue to support legislative efforts like this in the U.S. House of Representatives.

From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:
Good Afternoon,
It was a pleasure to meet with the Juniata Farm Bureau this morning and I had the honor to receive the Friend of Farm Bureau Award.
￼
A Friend of Our Farmers
The Friend of Farm Bureau Award is presented to members of Congress who have a strong record of support for a variety of key issues facing the agriculture industry. In the 115th Congress, I have fought to bring back whole milk into public schools, adequately insure our farmers, and incentivize companies to invest in broadband infrastructure on a larger scale. I appreciated hearing from the Juniata Farm Bureau about the issues that are important in our region. Pennsylvania farmers contribute so much to the Commonwealth and I am proud to stand with them. Thank you for having me!
Labor Market Sees Record Growth
The U.S. has 7.1 million job openings, a record high and another sign that the labor market is booming. Available jobs have surpassed the number of unemployed workers, making it clear that pro-growth economic policies are putting American workers first.These bold policy initiatives are not just rhetoric; their benefits are spreading throughout the country and are creating significant opportunities for Pennsylvanians.
Hearing From Our Rural Mail Carriers
I had the opportunity to sit down with our mail carriers about the future of the USPS, an iconic institution that has long been a valuable part of American life.
￼
As the son of a part-time seasonal postal worker, I know how important the USPS is for rural communities who rely on these services. That is why I proudly co-sponsored House Resolution 993, to ensure the USPS is not subject to privatization. Congress must do everything possible to ensure that the USPS can continue to provide quality service to rural areas that cannot be served by private commercial mail.
Supporting Vocational Education
On Thursday, it was great to visit the Mifflin County Academy of Science and Technology to learn more about the programs that are preparing students who are interested in pursuing a trade. Having a skilled workforce in areas such as auto repair, woodworking, welding, machining, and mechatronics is vital for running Pennsylvania’s economy. Spending decades in small business, I worked alongside many skilled workers who I believe to be the backbone of America’s producing and manufacturing power. PA-10 is defined by its hardworking families and it’s important to have institutions like Mifflin Academy to offer alternative job training to a four-year degree. Thank you for allowing me to tour your facility!
Putting Patient Care First 
I had the pleasure of attending Geisinger Health System’s open forum where members of the community exchanged views and learned what is being done to improve patient services in PA-10. Events like this highlight Geisinger’s commitment to patients and the communities they serve. As a three-time cancer survivor and the father of a daughter living with cystic fibrosis, I understand the importance of good, quality, and inexpensive health care. I will continue to support policies that increase medical development in the private industry and investments in new treatments, instruments, and procedures that can truly improve the wellbeing of patients.
New Medicare Card Mailing Update- Wave 7 Begins, Wave 5 Ends
The Center for Medicare and Medicaid has finished mailing Medicare cards to people who live in Wave 1 through 5. If you have Medicare and did not receive a new card, you can:
	•	Sign into MyMedicare.gov to see if we mailed their card. If so, they can print an official card. They will need to create an account if they do not already have one. 
	•	Call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) where we can verify their identity, check their address, and help them get their new card. 
You can also print out and give them a copy of Still Waiting for Your New Card?, or you can order copies to hand out. 
To ensure that people with Medicare continue to get care, you can use either the former Social Security number-based Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) or the new alpha-numeric Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) for all Medicare transactions through December 31, 2019. 
People with Medicare should continue to protect their new number to prevent medical identity theft and health care fraud, especially during Medicare Open Enrollment. View and share our new Guard your Medicare card video, which reminds people with Medicare to beware of scams.

I’m pleased to hear that TransAlta Renewables and Microsoft have teamed up to invest in renewable energy in Pennsylvania.United States’ energy policy should strive assure a secure supply of energy, keep the costs low for consumers, and ensure the adequate protection of the environment.This partnership will bring direct investment to our state, promote job growth, and support efforts to develop a more diverse energy economy.

October 21, 2018 
Visit to Benedictine College’s American Government Class:
Thank you to Benedictine College for inviting me to speak to Dr. Raymond’s American Government class! I enjoyed the chance to share my experiences in Congress with these aspiring leaders and answering their great questions. I have been blessed to have others pass on their knowledge to me, so I am grateful for the opportunity to pass on what I’ve learned to a new generation of leaders.
￼
 
Bilateral Trade Update:
On Tuesday, the United States Trade Representative officially notified Congress in letters to the House and Senate of the Administration’s intent to enter into three different trade negotiations with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom. These announcements are welcomed developments that, following further consultation with Congress, can greatly expand new markets and unlock these massive economies in which to sell Kansas-grown and Kansas-made products.
Following an agreement last month with Canada and Mexico on a new NAFTA, I am pleased the Administration has progressed to this stage to deepen our international trading partnerships with these key allies across the Atlantic and the Pacific.
 
ICYMI: NAFTA Agreement:
The United States, Mexico, and Canada have recently announced that an agreement has been reached to update NAFTA. News of an agreement is welcomed as NAFTA has been an overwhelming success for Kansas agriculture. As Congress and the public analyze the full agreement text, I look forward to fully reviewing the details and hearing from farm, ranch, and working families across my district about their thoughts on the agreement.
 
Ways and Means Investigation on Maternal Mortality Rates in the U.S.:
Recent investigations have revealed that an alarming number of mothers in the United States are dying during and after childbirth. Every year in the United States more than 50,000 mothers are severely injured during or after childbirth. In fact, maternal mortality review committees from nine states found that approximately 63 percent of pregnancy-related deaths were preventable. Bringing a new baby into this world should be one of the most exciting and rewarding times in a woman’s life. It is absolutely unacceptable to sit idly by when we can prevent these tragic deaths.
As Chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight, I sent letters to 15 major hospital systems around the country to explain why the mother mortality rate during childbirth is on the rise. The letters ask these hospital systems to detail the steps they are taking to identify risks and complications in pregnancies and to answer questions on their childbirth safety protocols. I hope we can find out why these deaths are happening and how Congress can act to stem this tragic loss of life.

￼
ABOUT BRADLEY | HOW CAN I HELP | CONTACT BRADLEY | WANT TO RECEIVE MY UPDATES?
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
If you had any doubt about why border security is important, just look at the caravan of illegal immigrants heading toward the United States. We must secure our borders! 
Border security is national security. Having a secure border is absolutely necessary if we want to cut down on crime and keep potential terrorists and bad actors out of our country. 
I’ve got a solution that would allow us to overcome Democrat obstruction in the Senate to secure funding for the border wall. We should use budget reconciliation, the same process we used to pass tax reform.  
That is why I am introducing the 50 Votes for the Wall Act. I explain the process in this op-ed for The Hill. Securing our border is securing the integrity of the United States for future generations, and I am committed to the fight.
ICYMI: Upcoming Town Hall Meetings 
￼ 
In case you missed it, I will be holding town hall meetings across Southwest Alabama over the next few weeks. I would love to see you out at the meetings in Lillian, Saraland, and Bayou La Batre. I look forward to hearing what issues matter most to you. Details on all the town hall meetings can be found by clicking here. 
An Update from Washington 
￼ 
October is a busy time here in Alabama. With college football, Homecomings, and visiting the citizens of Alabama to hear about the issues that matter most to you. On Tuesday, I traveled up to Montgomery to speak to the Montgomery Chamber of Commerce’s “Eggs and Issues” breakfast. I shared an update on the House agenda and our efforts to ensure all Americans are ""Better Off Now."" 
This past Friday, I had the opportunity to discuss how Alabamians are better off now with members of the Fairhope Kiwanis Club. I’m always happy to provide an update on how the People’s House has been working for those of us right here along the Gulf Coast.
In such divisive times, it is important to be optimistic about the course of our country and of Alabama. Southwest Alabama is growing and thriving like never before, and our pro-growth policies are a big reason behind that. 
It is an honor to be at the helm of rebuilding our military, free-trade issues, tax reform, and an endless list of vitally important topics. And, it is an honor to serve Alabama in Washington.
Recovery Reminders 
Hurricane Michael was truly a devastating storm. Folks in the Wiregrass region and the Florida Panhandle have been impacted financially, physically, and emotionally.
I wanted to remind you of the recovery options and available to you through the federal and state governments.  
For general information on how to receive assistance, please visit MichaelRecoveryInfo.com. Click here to apply online for federal disaster assistance, here for information from the Alabama Emergency Management Agency, and here for disaster relief and recovery services from the American Red Cross including information on contacting missing loved ones.  
I send my deepest sympathies to all those impacted, and continue to pray for a speedy recovery for all those impacted by the storm. 
Republican Policies Work 
￼ 
Too often the media focuses on the negative side of politics in Washington and on the partisan fighting that dominates the news cycle. Rarely do they celebrate the major accomplishments or acts of bipartisan cooperation that goes on every day in our nation’s capital. 
In the past two years, the House of Representatives has passed over 1,000 bills, roughly 80% of them through bipartisan cooperation. We have strengthened our military, worked to prepare our workforce for the future, and provided funding for vital infrastructure projects.  
Our unemployment rate is at the lowest levels in nearly fifty years, job openings are at an all-time high, and our nation’s economy is once again the most competitive in the world. There is still work to be done, though. We must find a way to overcome obstruction and advance solutions that work best for all Americans. The American people want results, not resistance.
Thanks to conservative policies, our nation truly is better off now and stronger for the future.  
In Case You Missed It!   
Here are a few articles from this past week that are worth a read:  
“Another great sign for the economy: Job openings hit an all-time high in August.” –  CNBC 
“U.S. Is World’s Most Competitive Economy for First Time in a Decade.” – Wall Street Journal  
“Budget reconciliation is the key to building the border wall.” – The Hill   
“Water infrastructure is vital for state.” - Atmore Advance

What’s Ahead  
As we continue to move through the month of October, I always enjoy getting out to catch up with folks in Southwest Alabama and update them on what we are doing in Washington. Again, I will be holding several town halls throughout the rest of this month, starting with Lillian on Monday, October 22nd, at 11:30 AM.
I will also be hosting my annual Ag Matters tour this week. This tour allows me to visit farms and family forests in all six counties that make up the First Congressional District. I look forward to making stops this year in Jackson, Chatom, Grand Bay, Fairhope,  Monroeville, and Atmore.

I also invite you to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to get up-to-the-minute updates on my travel in Southwest Alabama. At the end of the day, my staff and I are here to serve you!

￼
Dear Friends, 
These past ten months have been filled with productive visits with Arkansas families, farmers, teachers, students, veterans, community leaders, and so much more. I'm grateful to represent you in Congress and to be your voice. Here are some of this year's highlights so far. 
January 
￼
It was National School Choice Week, January 20-26, 2018, when I toured Maumelle's Academics Plus Charter School. I had recently returned from Egypt and was glad to share my experiences there with the sixth graders who were studying Ancient Egypt. We discussed strategies for concurrent credit and how to best prepare students for college. I was impressed by the students and their eagerness to learn. 

February
￼
In February, I held the third meeting of the 2017-18 Class of my Future Leaders Council. They were an inspiring group of young Arkansas leaders. I enjoyed talking with them about how a bill is formed and how it goes through the committee process. Our future is in good hands! 

March
￼
In March, Senator John Boozman and I showed U.S. Air Force (USAF) Secretary Heather Wilson around Little Rock Air Force Base (LRAFB). We met with the airwomen and airmen serving our nation and several sites around the airbase, including the Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Facility (SCIF) building. There, we discussed their current training mission and how we can assist the National Guard and the USAF in obtaining more missions. We are grateful for Secretary Wilson’s sustained interest in LRAFB.

April
￼
In April, I visited Del Rio, Texas, where I met with border patrol agents, and state and local officials, including the Val Verde County judge and sheriff, Joe Martinez (pictured above). This was my fourth visit to our southern border with Mexico, and I continue to build my understanding of the strategic challenges we face and what the House can do to deliver on our promise to better secure our borders and protect our families. 

May
￼

In May, I had the privilege of visiting the Syria exhibit at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. This exhibit is dedicated to highlighting the vicious attacks against the people of Syria by its leader, Bashar al-Assad. By regaining control of the land occupied by real or perceived threats to the tyranny perpetrated by the Syrian government and sowing seeds of discord amongst the rebels to encourage more violence and bloodshed, he has become the embodiment of everything in opposition to democracy. I want to thank a Syrian-American and Arkansan, Mouaz Moustafa, for personally showing me this exhibit and for his leadership at the Syrian Emergency Task Force.

June
￼
In June. I hosted Dr. Carla Hayden, the Librarian of Congress and America’s Librarian, to central Arkansas. Dr. Hayden was joined by her mother, Colleen, who was born in Helena. We kicked off her time in Arkansas by visiting with Governor Asa Hutchinson. We visited educational and historic sites together, such as our stops at the William F. Laman Public Library in Little Rock and the Historic Arkansas Museum. We also hosted more than 100 librarians and educators from across the state for lunch at the Clinton Library. National and local libraries play such an important role in our communities, helping to educate the next generation of leaders, and I am glad that Dr. Hayden got to see Arkansas’s terrific work in action.  

July 
￼
On the Fourth of July, it was an honor to read the Declaration of Independence at the Historic Arkansas Museum. It's always a pleasure to visit with old friends and to make new ones.

August
￼
In August, I had the opportunity to serve our homeless community breakfast in Little Rock at the Salvation Army of central Arkansas and Jericho Way. So far this year, my team has conducted 35 visits to six centers to hear directly from central Arkansans on how we can better assist and best provide services to the homeless. 

September
￼

Harvest season is a special time in our state, and I appreciated Bearskin Farm and Isbell Farms for the ring-side view of their rice harvests, which is crucial to our economy. I'm thankful to the Arkansas Rice Federation for coordinating these visits. Our Arkansas farmers continue to utilize innovative technologies and produce the best rice in the world as they maintain a competitive advantage as the nation's largest rice producing state. 

October
￼
With my good friend, UK Member of Parliament Rehman Chishti visiting, I held the 20th meeting of my Veterans Advisory Council in Beebe earlier this month. It was an honor to visit with the men and women of White County who have served our country and talk with them about their needs and how my office can help them access the benefits they've rightfully earned. I value the experiences our Arkansas veterans share with me as I continue fighting for them in Congress. 

Thank you for taking time to keep up with the work I'm doing on your behalf. If I can be any assistance to you or your family, please reach out to my office at (501) 324-5941 or Hill.House.Gov. 

Sincerely,
￼ 
Representative French Hill

Dear Friend, 
This past week was a big week for Georgia as President Trump, Vice President Pence, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, and countless other local, state, and federal officials were in Middle and South Georgia to show their support and reaffirm their commitment to those in our rural communities impacted by Hurricane Michael.
I must say, it was very disappointing how the press treated the President’s visit this past Monday. Farmers have lost orchards that families have owned for generations, cotton growers are not sure what tomorrow brings, and all the press asks about is a U.S. Senator's DNA and global warming. I want to thank President Trump for rising above and keeping the focus of the day on what matters: those impacted by this catastrophic storm.

On Wednesday this past week, Vice President Pence stopped in Moultrie to speak to farmers to affirm the Administration's support of our rural communities. Click here to watch Vice President Mike Pence’s remarks at the Sunbelt Ag Expo in Moultrie. 
￼ 
Vice President Pence speaks at the Sunbelt Ag Expo. 
As we assess damages, I am continuing to meet with farmers, families, and business owners throughout the Eighth District to see how we on the federal level can better provide resources to help recover and rebuild. In the meantime, I wanted to share some additional resources that may be helpful for those impacted: 
	•	For information on USDA disaster assistance programs, CLICK HERE.
	•	Residents and business owners in designated counties can begin applying for federal assistance online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA.

Welcome Home Pastor Brunson



On Saturday, I was honored to join President Trump in the Oval Office of the White House to welcome Pastor Andrew Brunson home. Pastor Brunson, who is originally from Black Mountain, North Carolina, was imprisoned in Turkey on October 7, 2016. On Friday, over two years later, Pastor Brunson was released and finally reunited with his family here in the United States.

You can also read my full statement on the release of Pastor Brunson here.






Cutting Bureaucratic Red Tape



Since President Trump took office, his Administration’s regulatory reform efforts have helped save our country $23 billion. I am proud to have supported President Trump’s efforts so we can fulfill our promise to reduce bureaucratic red tape that wastes taxpayer dollars and negatively impacts the lives of hardworking Americans. You can learn more about these efforts in the graphic below courtesy of the White House. 

     ￼





Hurricane Florence



It has been one month since Hurricane Florence caused so much damage and suffering to our neighbors in eastern North Carolina. I am thankful for all of our emergency responders and their tireless effort to save lives last month and those working hard to help rebuild and support those impacted by this deadly storm. Check out this graphic for a great by-the-numbers look at the federal response in NC thus far courtesy of FEMA. I’m proud to have played a part in ensuring this federal aid is provided through my votes to provide the Carolinas with over $10 billion in aid. You can learn more about those efforts here.

My prayers are with Trooper Kevin Conner's family and his fellow North Carolina State Highway Patrol troopers as they mourn his passing. This is a tragic reminder of the sacrifices our law enforcement officers make to keep our communities safe. I am thankful each day for everything they do.


US regains title of world's most competitive economy

Fox Business 

We've heard nothing but good news about our economy this month. This week, the World Economic Forum announced that, for the first time in ten years, the United States has regained the title of the world's most competitive economy. Earlier this month, the Department of Labor announced U.S. unemployment had hit its lowest level in almost fifty years. The Department of Labor also announced that job openings hit an all time high in August so it is no surprise consumers and small businesses are more and more optimistic about the future of our country.

Friends, 
 
As part of the Great Commission in the Bible, Jesus tells us in Matthew 28:19-20, “Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”
 
These powerful verses remind me of Pastor Andrew Brunson, a North Carolina native who was wrongfully arrested and imprisoned in Turkey. Pastor Brunson was living in Turkey with his family for more than two decades and led a small congregation with his wife, Norine. They made it their mission to share the gospel of Jesus Christ.
 
Unfortunately in 2016, Pastor Brunson was falsely accused of terror-related crimes and arrested, where he faced up to 35 years in prison. After two years of imprisonment and a stressful trial, Pastor Brunson was convicted and sentenced to time served. The world watched as Pastor Brunson languished in a Turkish prison for two years.
 
As I prayed for the safety and release of Pastor Brunson, time and again I came back to the verse, “And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” Pastor Brunson said he was always sure God had a plan to end his suffering, and his recent release was truly an answer to so many prayers. 
 
It was also the result of a lot of people, including myself and Senator Thom Tillis, other North Carolina members of Congress, and President Donald Trump, who were working hard to get his release.
 
As your Congressman and someone who always tries to stand up for religious liberty, I made sure I did everything in my power to ensure Pastor Brunson’s safe release back to the United States. In July at an international summit of leaders from 57 nations, I represented the United States and put forward a human rights resolution urging the release of Pastor Brunson. I was proud to see my amendment adopted and to send a strong message to Turkey: the world will not tolerate these human rights violations – especially by a NATO ally and partner – and Pastor Brunson must be set free.
 
This was significant progress, but I know Pastor Brunson would not have been released without the hard work of President Trump. He went above and beyond to put economic and political pressure on Turkey in an effort to secure Pastor Brunson’s release.
 
With that said, I still have concerns about the troubling pattern of human rights abuses and ongoing religious persecution by Turkish authorities. The current regime led by President Erdogan is continuing to consolidate power at the cost of human rights. While President Trump has done an outstanding job projecting American leadership on the world stage, we must continue to demand better from our NATO partners.
 
One of the most inspiring moments of this ordeal was seeing Pastor Brunson kneel in prayer with President Trump in the Oval Office. There you had a humble preacher from North Carolina praying with the leader of the free world – it was a remarkable moment and one I will never forget. 
 
 
Until next week,
￼

Law Enforcement Appreciation
 
 
It was an honor to attend the Marion County and Dillon County law enforcement appreciation dinner. We had a moment of silence in memory of Sergeant Carraway and prayed for the entire Florence Police Department together. I also thanked them for their life saving work during Hurricane Florence- it was a testament to what they wake up ready to do for us every single day. This was just a small way to say thank you and show our support for our brave men and women in uniform.

Creating Opportunity Through Infrastructure Investment 
 
 
Improving and expanding infrastructure in South Carolina is one of my top priorities, which is why I helped create the National Advisory Committee on Travel and Tourism Infrastructure (NACTTI). The purpose of this committee is to provide information and recommendations to the Secretary of Transportation on critical infrastructure projects that will facilitate expedient travel, increase tourism, and create opportunity and economic development. We held a NACTII meeting this week to discuss how I-73 will meet all three of these requirements! I showed them the awful traffic congestion on Highway 501 and explained how I-73 will create unprecedented opportunity in the Pee Dee. I look forward to continued work with NACTII to create opportunity through infrastructure investment in South Carolina and throughout the country.

Beach Renourishment Progress
 
 
Ensuring the prosperity of our beaches is critical to growing our tourism economy and I am proud that my office was able to secure over $80 million dollars for this vital project. This week, I met with members of the Army Corps of Engineers to check on the progress of beachfront renourishment and learn more about the process. 
 

￼
 
 
Preparing our Workforce 
 
 
I had a productive meeting with Florence Darlington Technical College President Ed Bethea this week. FDTC offers specialized training that enables people to get high-paying, skills-based jobs upon graduating. Getting people off of the sidelines of the economy and into the workforce is one of my top priorities and I look forward to working with President Bethea to bridge the skills gap and prepare the Seventh District workforce for new opportunity!

Rep. Babin and Judge Sylvia Announce De-obligation of Chambers County Hurricane Ike Cleanup Debt

WASHINGTON — U.S. Rep. Brian Babin (TX-36) and the Honorable Judge Jimmy Sylvia, Chambers County Judge, released the following joint statement announcing millions of dollars of Hurricane Ike cleanup debt erroneously charged to Chambers County will be de-obligated. An amendment introduced and passed by Babin to this year’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill, now signed into law by President Trump, holds FEMA responsible for assurances offered and later rescinded to county governments after expenditures had taken place. The debt Chambers County acquired during Ike cleanup efforts based on faulty information by FEMA falls under the definition stipulated by the Babin amendment, and therefore essentially will be canceled out.

￼
“This is a great day for residents of Chambers County,” said Rep. Babin. “The process initiated by today’s letter is the culmination of years of hard work that will ensure FEMA takes responsibility for their assurances made to county officials in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Ike and the federally-declared disaster left in its wake. With this debt de-obligated, Chambers County can once again operate in service of its citizens without the fear of imminent financial calamity. Thank you to my colleagues Senators Cruz and Cornyn, Judge Sylvia, and so many others whose efforts have ensured the county can put this behind them and continue focusing on prosperity for the county.”

“I'm extremely happy to announce that the $9 million in de-obligated FEMA funds looming over Chambers County since Hurricane Ike have been eliminated,” said Judge Sylvia. “Thanks to the diligence of Congressman Babin and assistance from Senators Cornyn and Cruz, H.R. 302 (specifically section 1237 pertaining to de-obligated funds by FEMA) was signed by President Trump on October 5, 2018.

Visiting Cleveland's SkillsUSA Class
 A couple of months ago, a group of students from Cleveland ISD visited Washington, D.C. with SkillsUSA. Unfortunately, we did not get the opportunity to visit while they were on Capitol Hill due to scheduling conflicts. At the end of the week, my wife and I were boarding a plane back to Texas, when a woman sitting with a group of high school-aged teens recognized me. It was Ms. Andi Pope and her SkillsUSA class from Cleveland. We were all on the same flight! 

After we landed in Houston, I had the opportunity to speak with all of the students about what they had been learning, plus give them an update on what being a Member of Congress encompasses. At that time, they invited me to have lunch at Tonkawa Bistro, the on-campus student-run restaurant by their Culinary Arts Department. If you are unaware about SkillsUSA, it is an organization that partners with students, teachers, and industry to ensure that each student has the skills to go into the American workforce. They offer different career and technical educational programs, events, and competitions in high schools across the country. (Pictured below from L to R: Tarik Barnes, Andi Pope (teacher), Jose Arguelles (student General Manager of Tonkawa Bistro), and Makina Walden).
￼
On Monday, I was able to visit Tonkawa Bistro and enjoy a delicious lunch prepared by some of the most ambitious and intelligent students.

Babin: Trump Correct to Use American Leverage to Halt Migrant Caravans
President Trump is absolutely correct to call for Central American governments to cooperate in halting migrant caravans or else risk losing their generous financial aid from the United States. These nations must secure their own borders and stop allowing – and even encouraging – their citizens to illegally cross our sovereign borders. I applaud President Trump for his boldness in acting to protect the interests of American citizens by using our extensive leverage on the international stage.

County Judges' Lunch
￼

It was a very informative lunch as I had the opportunity to meet with many of the county judges' across TX-36. It's important for me to know the issues each of our counties are facing as well as figuring out what we can all work together on - federally and locally.

Trinity Valley Exposition
￼
The fairgrounds in Liberty were busy this week as students unloaded their heifers, steers, pigs, goats, and lambs to show and sell at the Trinity Valley Exposition (TVE) Fair and Rodeo. It was great getting to see the hard work these students have put into their animals.
￼
 It seemed like the whole community of Liberty County gathered together to take part in such a fun time of the year. 
Appreciating Our Law Enforcement
 On Tuesday evening, I attended the annual Tyler County Law Enforcement Appreciation Banquet in Warren, where I was able to visit with many of our local law enforcement officers. It’s a privilege getting a chance to thank these brave men and women for always being the first on the scene of a crime or accident and keeping our communities safe and protected. We should never forget that they are members of our community too and thank them for their service.

JSW Steel Breaks New Ground
 JSW Steel in Baytown has officially broken ground on the only melt and manufacture plate mill with a contiguous pipe mill in North America. It was a pleasure to be able to speak at such an awesome occasion. 
￼
JSW Steel USA is also working to hire 1,000 new employees while investing up to $1 billion to modernize and expand its U.S. operations. That's more jobs for Texans and the country as well as more money being invested into America's economy!
 Texas Emergency Hospital
 On Monday, I was given a tour of the newly opened and remodeled Texas Emergency Hospital in Cleveland. I am proud of this facility and the emergency care it gives to the community.

La Porte Roundtable
I was able to meet with several of the local business owners in La Porte this week. Small businesses are one of the primary reasons why Texas is at the top of the list of the most economically sound states in the country. Making sure these businesses have the resources they need to grow and succeed is one of my top priorities.

Friend: 
It's been another very productive work session in Southern Illinois this week. This week I want to focus on Tuesday night, where I continued my long-standing tradition of greeting Honor Flight veterans either in Washington or right here in Southern Illinois. Americans owe a debt of gratitude to our nation's bravest individuals, those who have served in defense of freedom and liberty. My wife Tracy and I welcomed these fine men and women home and had the opportunity to chat with them about their brave journey's and what we can do to help ensure their needs are being met in Washington. We were joined by over 3,000 family and friends of our Southern Illinois veterans. If you know a veteran in Southern Illinois who would be interested in the Honor Flight program, please share this info: https://www.veteranshonorflight.org/

Friends,
In case you missed it, according to the World Economic Forum's Competitiveness Report, the U.S. is the most competitive economy in the world for the first time since 2008. We all know our economy is continuing to get stronger and stronger, thanks in part to the pro-growth policies my colleagues and I have passed in Congress. 
￼
Type 1 Diabetes Research 
It was great to see my friend Tyler from Mayfield Heights, a young advocate for JDRF, the leading global funder of type 1 diabetes research. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I have strongly supported funding for the National Institutes of Health's Special Diabetes Program to award grants for research into the prevention and cure for type 1 diabetes. 
In support of people with type 1 diabetes, I also recently signed a letter calling on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to continue to find pathways for type 1 diabetes patients to access new diabetes technologies. These technologies would help people with type 1 diabetes better manage their disease and avoid costly complications. 
￼
Brecksville-Broadview Heights Middle School 
Congratulations to Brecksville-Broadview Heights Middle School for being recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School for 2018! I'm proud to have such an example of academic excellence in Northeast Ohio. The students, teachers, and staff are doing a fantastic job!
This week, I presented a congressional proclamation and a flag that was flown over the U.S. Capitol celebrating this achievement to the Brecksville-Broadview Heights school board. 
Feel free to check out my remarks in the Congressional Record. 
￼
Akron-Canton Airport 
I was happy to meet Ren Camacho, the new President of Akron-Canton Airport (CAK). He's got some big shoes to fill with Rick McQueen's departure after more than 36 years at CAK. However, after serving as the chief of planning and engineering for Cleveland's Department of Port Control, and overseeing the Cleveland Hopkins-International Airport, Burke Lakefront Airport and the Lakefront Harbors, I'm certain Ren is the man for the job.
My colleagues and I recently passed legislation to reform and reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA employs about 46,000 people and is responsible for the safety and efficiency of our nation's aerospace system, including air traffic control operations. This 5-year reauthorization of FAA programs invests in airport infrastructure, promotes safety and American leadership in aviation, and strengthens consumer service. I was happy to share this great news with both Ren and Rick at CAK. 
￼
Brecksville Chamber Networking Lunch
On Tuesday, I was honored to attend the Brecksville Chamber of Commerce's October Networking Lunch with community leaders from the area. I spoke about the recently passed opioid package, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, and how I work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Thank you to the Brecksville Chamber for all the hard work you do for our district. I hope to see you all again soon!
￼
Convenience Store Visit
I had a great time Monday morning at the Sheetz in Mentor. I was happy to discuss menu labeling, data security, the Renewable Fuel Standard and other issues impacting the hard-working folks at this family owned and operated company that's been serving Northeast Ohio for decades. Thank you to Adam Sheetz for the invitation!

￼
Bryant & Stratton College 
Also on Monday, I enjoyed spending time with the Solon Chamber of Commerce, Solon Mayor Ed Kraus, Solon City Council members and others at the Bryant & Stratton College campus in Solon. 
￼
It was a wonderful and busy week in Northeast Ohio. I enjoyed spending time with talented educators, officials, and business men and women who work hard for our communities every day.

Tenney Receives Friend of Farm Bureau Award Recognized as Advocate for Family Farmers
Farms are the lifeblood of our local economy and a vital part of our upstate heritage. In New York, our dairy farmers have experienced severe hardships. Since my first day as a member of Congress, it’s been my top priority to fix this serious problem jeopardizing the survival of the great tradition of family farming. I’ve fought and helped enact real solutions to ensure our agricultural community can grow and prosper once again. I’ve listened to the problems facing our farmers and been their voice in Washington, fighting for real change and delivering on our promises. It is a distinct honor to be recognized by the Farm Bureau for our office’s work and strong advocacy for upstate farmers in Congress.
In Congress, our office has delivered on promises made to our farmers in the 22nd District. 
I led the charge against the negative impact of the Canadian Class 7 milk pricing scheme which was eliminated as part of the new United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement (USMCA). I also was a co-sponsor of the School Milk Nutrition Act which allows schools to offer low-fat (1%) milk to students rather than just fat-free and the WHOLE MILK Act which would allow schools to offer whole milk as an option to students. 
In addition, I have held round tables with local farmers in five counties through the district and brought the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue to NY-22 to listen to the needs of local farmers.

It was great to stop by New Hartford Senior Center to celebrate the 32nd anniversary of the center’s incredible service to our senior citizens. Our senior‘s experience many unique challenges, and I will continue my work in Congress to ensure their voices are heard and Medicare and Social Security are protected.

On Thursday, I visited Utica National Insurance Group. We toured the facility and spoke with employees about the future of federal insurance, workforce development and tariffs. The work Utica National does for people throughout NY-22 and our country is outstanding, and I look forward to continue advocating for them in Congress.
￼ 
It was a privilege to attend the annual Boy Scouts Leadership Dinner. For more than 100 years, the Boy Scouts of America have molded young boys into men of character, compassion, and commitment. It is because of these young men that I am confident in our nation’s bright future.

Unifying Trade & Environmental Policy... 
Dear Friend:
I appreciate you taking the time to read this week’s brief update—it is an honor to represent you in the U.S. House of Representatives!  This week, I introduced H.R. 7064, the ‘Fair Environmental Trade Agreements Act.’ This act seeks to integrate environmental and labor policies in with U.S. trade policy.   While the United States has consistently raised its environmental regulations and labor standards, other countries have been exporting products, once made in America, to us while we have been exporting our manufacturing jobs to them because of their competitive advantage in not bearing the mitigation cost of industrial pollution and employing forced and child labor at little cost.  Under current law, the office of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) can negotiate ‘fast-track’ trade agreements through 2021. Although TPA calls for the inclusion of environmental or labor standard in such agreements, they are not required provisions. My bill, if enacted, will require the U.S. Trade Representative to certify to the U.S. House Ways & Means Committee and to the Senate Finance committee, that any trade agreement with the United States enters into will require that other nations meet minimum environmental and labor stands.   Our trade with China, for example, is subject to both these issues. Its outdated and inefficient factory technology only focuses on increased output. The result is that Beijing is reported to have some of the worst air quality and factories have been known to use child labor to keep production costs low. China also is said to use forced prison labor. When a country only focuses on reducing manufacturing costs at the expense of its workers and the environment, it can easily drive down the production costs below having the same goods made in the U.S.  Following up on another concern of mine, I want to let you know that after my September op-ed titled, “The U.S. Air Force Needs a Light Attack Aircraft”, received a response from Dr. Heather Wilson, Secretary of the Air Force. In her response, the Secretary stated that she “fully agrees with your [coffman] view that it [light attack platform] should be an affordable and lethal alternative for the U.S. and its allies and partners to use in permissive environments.” The Secretary went on to say that “our focus is on delivering a high quality, exportable, and affordable combat aircraft…and to provide this capability quickly and a reasonable cost.” As a Member of the House Armed Services Committee, a Marine Corps combat veteran who has personally relied on close air support in combat, and I consider the prompt procurement of the light attack aircraft essential to our national security. I will continue to update you as the procurement process progresses.   As always, I invite you to stay in contact with me via my website, facebook or twitter account. See you around the district! 
Sincerely, 
￼

My Bill is Heading to the President's Desk
 

Last week, the Senate passed the Gulf Islands National Seashore Land Exchange Act, which means my bill is now on its way to President Trump's desk to be signed into law.   I've worked closely with leadership at the Mark Seymour VFW post and the Gulf Islands National Seashore who have supported our efforts in getting this bill to the finish line.   This legislation would make permanent a 30-year easement that has provided an access road and driveway for The Mark Seymour Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 5699, which is located within the National Park Service’s (NPS) Gulf Islands National Seashore in Ocean Springs. In exchange for the easement, the VFW will transfer a portion of its acreage to the park, which includes valuable wetlands.  The National Seashore is a staple of the Mississippi Gulf Coast that holds historic sites, wildlife sanctuaries, and natural beaches. I am pleased to see my bill advance its way to President Trump's desk for the final sign off. This is a huge victory for the Gulf Islands National Seashore that draws in millions of visitors every year.

80 years of Shipbuiling October of 2018 marks 80 years of Ingalls Shipbuilding producing world-class military ships from Pascagoula. Shipbuilding is an important piece in south Mississippi's economy and provides thousands of jobs for hardworking Mississippians.   Ingalls Shipbuildling has constructed nearly 70 percent of the Navy's warship fleet and also exclusively builds the United States Coast Guard's National Security Cutters that are used for drug interdiction in U.S. waters. Since 1938, Ingalls continues strengthening our national defense by ensuring our military personnel has the most lethal arsenal to keep our country safe.    I am grateful to represent the world's greatest shipbuilders in D.C. and look forward to 80 more years of continued success from Ingalls Shipbuilding!
￼
Salute to the Military Tuesday night I had the pleasure of attending the 40th Annual Salute to the Military on Tuesday evening. The annual Salute to the Military celebration has become engraved as a Mississippi Gulf Coast tradition to honor our Armed Forces.   This year we were privileged to welcome the Vice Commandant of the United States Coast Guard, Admiral Charles Ray as the keynote speaker. I was also honored to have Purple Heart recipient Ken Duncan and his grandson join me for the evening as my special guest.   It's no secret that Mississippi has a continued history of supporting our men and women in uniform every step of the way.  My position in Congress allows me a unique opportunity to provide support for our military and ensure our men and women in uniform have the tools and resources they need to do their job. Just this year, we voted to give our troops their largest pay raise in nine years and have fully funded our military on time for the second year in a row. I am so thankful that south Mississippi takes the time to honor the world's greatest military force.

This week I, along with over 40 other Members of Congress, sent a letter to President Trump urging him to impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia over the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. 
It was a pleasure to participate in the 2018 USC George Washington Leadership Lecture on political gerrymandering this week in Mount Vernon, Virginia. 
I am honored to have received a 100% rating on the Human Right's Campaign's Congressional Scorecard for my voting record on LGBTQ issues. 
This week I joined with House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Raul Grijalva in submitting comments to the US Forest Service. The agency has proposed two rules which I believe would place the interests of the mining and oil and gas drilling industries over environmental protection. 
In this edition of Alan’s Inbox, see my response to constituents who have contacted me to express their opinions on the 2018 Farm Bill, which authorizes a number of federal programs related to agriculture and food policy.

Finding an End to Partisan Gerrymandering 
It was a pleasure to participate in the 2018 USC George Washington Leadership Lecture on political gerrymandering this week at Mount Vernon in Virginia. I had an interesting and engaging conversation with Professor David Sloane of the USC Price School of Public Policy, which was followed by a discussion with a panel of experts on gerrymandering issues and solutions.   
Throughout my time in public office, I have been working to find solutions to the problem of extreme partisan gerrymandering. As a California State Senator, I was proud to play a significant role in the establishment of the California Citizens Redistricting commission, which gave responsibility for the drawing of districts to the residents of the state, rather than politicians. In Congress, I authored the “Let the People Draw the Lines Act,” which, like the independent redistricting commission I helped to establish in California, would ensure that congressional districts accurately represent local communities instead of favoring the interests of incumbents and political parties. Most recently, I led a bipartisan amicus brief of House members in the Gil v. Whitford case to establish barriers to extreme partisan gerrymandering.

Calling for Sanctions Against Saudi Arabia 
This week I, along with over 40 other Members of Congress, sent a letter to President Trump urging him to impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia over the death of activist and journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The letter calls for sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which requires presidents to decide within 120 days whether to impose sanctions requested by Congress. The letter also requests an end to U.S. support for Saudi Arabia’s military action in Yemen.  
More than two weeks after Khashoggi disappeared while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Trump has remained unwilling to call out the Saudi government. It took the president until Thursday to say he believes Khashoggi is dead, even as Turkish officials say they have recordings of his torture and murder. President Trump’s reluctance to take a strong stand on this issue is unacceptable, and I hope that he will recognize the gravity of this situation and heed Congress’ requests. 
A 100% Rating from the Human Rights Campaign 
I am honored to have received a 100% rating on the Human Rights Campaign’s Congressional Scorecard for my fight on Capitol Hill for LGBTQ equality. As the first Congress Member to permanently fly the Pride flag outside their Congressional office and a Vice Chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, I am a proud ally of the LGBTQ community both here at home and abroad. We have come so far in such a short amount of time, but we still have so far to go. I will continue to fight for the equality of all American, because no one should be discriminated against because of who they are, or who they love.
￼ 
Opposing the US Forest Services’ Proposal to Weaken Environmental Standards 
This week I joined with House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Raul Grijalva in submitting formal comments to the US Forest Service regarding two of the agency’s proposed rules, which I believe would place the interests of the mining and oil and gas drilling industries over environmental protection. The proposals are consistent with many previous Trump Administration policies, claiming that environmental standards are a “burden” to these extractive industries. In the letter we point out that our national forests have been managed for nearly 60 years under the principle of “multiple use and sustained yield,” a philosophy that allows for a mixture of sustainable activities within our forests. That philosophy is threatened by the Trump Administration’s constant push for more drilling and mining on America’s public lands.

Each week hundreds of constituents contact my office to share their views on a variety of topics. I have recently received many messages from constituents expressing their opinions on the 2018 Farm Bill. Below is a portion of my response to those messages: 
  
“The Farm Bill authorizes a number of federal programs related to agriculture and food policy.  The programs affected by the Farm Bill are widespread, reaching beyond American farms, impacting land conservation, rural economic development, and nutrition programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). 
I am committed to making these programs work better for all Americans.  However, I am troubled by proposals in the House Farm Bill that would cut more than $24.6 billion from SNAP over the next ten years.  SNAP has proven to help struggling families overcome food insecurity and poverty, and 85% of food-insecure families with children have working parents.  According to the Center for Budget and Policies, 740,000 households with children would lose SNAP benefits under the new Farm Bill. 
The Farm Bill proposal also includes a work requirement for SNAP recipients that could threaten essential benefits for millions of people, especially older Americans or those with chronic conditions.  These proposals could also lead to some children becoming ineligible for free and reduced-price school meals. 
In California, the SNAP program is also known as CalFresh.  In the 47th Congressional District, 1 in 3 CalFresh households include seniors (60+) and 67% include children.  Further, these cuts would also hurt 490 retailers in our district, including supermarkets, grocery stores, and farmers markets.  
Beyond SNAP cuts, the bill strips away important conservation programs, such as a requirement that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) review agricultural pesticides to ensure they do not harm endangered species, as well as local and regional agriculture grants that support struggling farmers. 
For these reasons, among others, I voted against the Farm Bill in June 2018.  The legislation is currently held in conference to resolve the difference between the House and Senate versions.”  
  
If you have written in to me, please continue to do so. If you have not, I encourage you to share your views and concerns with me, as it is the best way for me to find out which issues you care most about.   You can find out how to contact me on my website by clicking here.

Representative Jeannette Rankin  Over the past several weeks Congress U has been looking at some notable legislation to come out of Congress in the recent past. I thought we might change gears over the next few weeks and look at a few notable, but perhaps less known, Members of both the House and Senate. 
I feel I have to start with Jeannette Rankin. She was an amazing and courageous American, who was not only the first woman to be elected and serve in Congress, but also the first woman to hold federal office in any capacity. 
Born in Montana Territory in 1880, Rankin graduated from the University of Montana in 1902 and then headed to the West Coast where during graduate studies she became involved in the woman's suffrage movement. By 1914, she had successfully led a movement which saw Montana grant equal and unrestricted voting rights to women. She later turned this movement's infrastructure into her Congressional campaign, and in 1916 became the first woman elected to the House of Representatives. 
Just three months into her tenure, she was called on to vote for the U.S. entering WWI. She famously said, ""I wish to stand by my country, but I cannot vote for war."" She was one of only 49 Representatives and two Senators who voted against going to war. 
Dur to redistricting in Montana, she wound up losing her race in 1918, and returned to her activist roots, this time focused on pacifism and non-participation in war. 
She was again elected to the House in 1940, and less than a year into her second tenure in Congress, she was asked again to vote on American entry into war--this time against Japan following the Pearl Harbor attack. Rankin, as she did in 1917, again voted no. This time, she was the only Member of Congress to do so. Days later, she abstained during the vote to declare war on Germany and Italy. Later in life, when asked if she regretted her votes, she said, ""Never. If you're against war, you're against war regardless of what happens. It's a wrong method of trying to settle a dispute."" 
 The outcry against Rankin’s votes -- from her colleagues, the press, and her constituents -- was overwhelming. She chose not to run for reelection, and in 1942 retired from public service.   She continued her peace and pacifist activism throughout the rest of her life, becoming an icon in the peace movement of the 1960s and until her death in 1973.   In 1985, a statue of Rankin was placed in the U.S. Capitol's Statuary Hall. It is inscribed, ""I Cannot Vote For War."" A copy of the statue also stands in the Montana capitol building in Helena.

October 21, 2018
Dear Friend,  
I enjoyed the opportunity to spend time with many constituents as I traveled around the district and attended events in our community last week.  My constituents are my best source of information, and I like hearing directly from you about the issues that matter most. Your input guides my decision-making and legislative agenda. 
Continue reading for a brief recap of my work on your behalf and a summary of some of the legislation I’ve recently supported! 
Facilitating Economic Success 
Our economy is now booming, and everyday Americans are feeling the positive effects of:
✔Higher wages 
✔Lower taxes 
✔Increased bonuses and benefits  
CNBC reported last week that job openings have reached an all-time high.  This is further proof that the economy is doing very well.  This doesn’t happen by accident.  Tax reform and deregulation have been vital to our nation’s economic success. Last week, a report by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs stated that we’ve issued 176 deregulatory actions since January of 2017.  That is 12 regulations eliminated for every new regulation adopted.  The same report estimates that this action has saved American families and businesses over $23 billion.   Additionally, there’s a mountain of evidence that proves wages and income are strong in this booming economy. Get the facts.    
When the economy is working, small businesses grow.  Last week, I was able to visit a local small business in Central Pasco, Tru Simulation, which has recently invested more than $40 million dollars in expansion since 2015.  It is also helping boost local tourism, with over 1,000 clients visiting the facility each year.  During my visit we discussed regulatory improvements that could be helpful in aiding the company as it seeks to expand even further.  
￼ 
We want to ensure all Americans have the skills they need to prosper in this booming economy.  That is why we just provided $12.1 billion in federal funding for critical Department of Labor programs designed to develop a 21st century workforce in the most recent budget we’ve adopted.  We also want to invest in the future by ensuring that all children have the chance to achieve their highest potential, which is why I was pleased to support $10.1 billion in the Head Start program, $250 million for early childhood education, $5.3 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, $250 million for Preschool Development Grants and $12.4 billion for education programs to help students with special needs in the FY 2019 budget, which we just recently passed. 
￼ 
Fighting for Our Nation’s Heroes 
The most recently adopted budget also honors those who have bravely answered the call to serve while protecting our national security.  I’m proud of the work we’ve done to ensure our military remains the strongest in the world.  
￼ 
Improving the level of support our nation’s heroes receive as they integrate back into civilian life has been a priority for me.  That is why I was excited to support over $300 million in federal funding in the most recent budget to help Veterans transition back into the workforce.  
￼ 
Supporting the Fight Against Opioids and other Healthcare Priorities 
Did you know that the budget bill we just passed for FY 2019 contains an additional $6.6 billion to fight opioids? As these funds are distributed to states and local governments through federal agencies, I will fight to make sure our community receives its fair share.  
Community health centers offer the uninsured and underinsured the opportunity to receive quality primary care, dental treatment, mental health services and substance abuse treatment on a sliding fee basis.  I am pleased to announce that the Community Health Center of Pinellas County has just been awarded more than $1.29 million dollars.  I was proud to help ensure these federal dollars were able to be returned to our community.  Community Health Centers have a proven track record of providing high quality, cost-efficient health care to approximately 25 million Americans, including over 7 million children and 300,000 Veterans. Community Health Centers have long enjoyed bi-partisan support because they are a prime example of what is working in our health care system, and I am proud to have helped secure funding to expand their work in our community.   
￼ 
In honor of Breast Cancer Awareness month, I was honored to participate in last week’s Breast Cancer Survivor luncheon in Tarpon Springs.  The bravery and persistence that these women display is inspiring.  We have to continue the fight to find a cure.  
￼ 
Supporting and Protecting our Future Leaders 
October is also National Bullying Prevention Month.  We have to make sure all children have a safe, harassment-free learning environment.  As adults, we must remain mindful of the importance of always treating one another with civility and respect.  Our children are watching and take cues from us about acceptable standards of conduct. 
￼ 
Did you know the most recent budget bill we passed for FY 2019 includes over $1.5 billion in funding to increase access to mental health providers and improve student safety in schools? 
￼ 
It was refreshing to visit Southerland Elementary School last week to speak with students about the importance of civic engagement and the role of Congress.  These bright young children had great questions and were enthusiastic about getting involved in public service.   
 ￼ 
Protecting our Infrastructure 
Protecting our water and infrastructure is essential to our state.  I recently voted to help pass the Water Resources Development Act, which has just been signed into law.  It authorizes locally driven infrastructure enhancements which are critical to our economy and to protecting our communities – improvements to harbors, ports, locks, dams, inland waterways, flood protection, and other water infrastructure.  It also addresses stormwater and wastewater infrastructure improvements and strengthens the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program. Click here to learn more about this important legislation.   
  
Thank you for reading this week’s update. Feel free to share this e-newsletter with friends and encourage them to sign up! Remember, you can always stay in touch with me via email, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 

Sincerely,

BUILD THE WALL, ENFORCE THE LAW

This week I signed onto the Build the Wall, Enforce the Law Act. 

This legislation fully funds President Trump's southern border wall. It also includes important provisions to make communities safer by stopping the flow of federal grant money to sanctuary cities, making alien gang membership grounds for deportation, and requiring that ICE directly addresses undocumented immigrants who are charged with a violent crime resulting in serious injury or death.

I have been to the Southwest border and I have seen the threats we face firsthand. There is much more than just illegal aliens coming across our borders. 

It is critical to our national security that we secure our border while addressing the threats already in our country like dangerous sanctuary cities and violent gangs. 

This legislation works to combat these threats and accomplish our most important duty to provide for the common defense. I will be working to bring this bill to a vote as soon as possible to support the safety of our communities.

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CLXXXIV

Monday, October 15, 2018:  This weekend, I did an interview with NBC Nightly News regarding my “gag clause” legislation that was recently signed into law by President Trump.  A link to the segment can be found here.  This morning I travel to Charleston, SC, to visit the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center and meet with my good friend CEO Scott Isaacks.  As the CEO of this 152-bed Level 1A tertiary care medical center, Scott also oversees six outpatient clinics in South Carolina and Georgia including those in Savannah and Hinesville. 
￼
Rep. Carter visiting the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center
After an overview presentation of the facility, I receive an opioid presentation to learn more of the work they are doing to address the opioid epidemic followed by presentations on telemedicine and mental health services offered at the center.  Next, I am treated to a tour of the center including visits to the community living center, GI clinic, Hall of Heroes and research building.  My final stop is a visit to the Fisher House located a few blocks from the hospital in beautiful downtown Charleston where families of veterans receiving care at the medical center are provided with temporary lodging.  To learn more about the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center and the services they offer visit www.charleston.va.gov.  After making the 2 & ½ hour drive back to downtown Savannah, I meet with constituents before heading to Richmond Hill in Bryan County to meet with constituents.

Tuesday, October 16, 2018:  I graduated from Groves High School in Garden City in 1975.  Another member of that graduating class was Clyde Campbell, a star basketball player who I first met in the 8th grade at Mercer Junior High School and who I had lost touch with until a few years ago when he came to my Savannah district office to share with me the wonderful work he is doing with Clyde Campbell Ministries, Inc. in the Savannah area. 
￼
Rep. Carter at the “Development of a Man Tackling the Hard Issues” Graduation
This morning, I am honored that he has invited me to be the keynote speaker at the “Development of a Man Tackling the Hard Issues” graduation at the Chatham County Jail.  This jail ministry that Clyde started helps individuals look at life through a different lens and motivates them to focus on building a team of positive players to help them transition back into society with a positive mindset.  Afterwards, I head to Brunswick in Glynn County where I am the keynote speaker at the Brunswick Exchange Club’s weekly meeting.  After bringing this great group up to date on the happenings in Washington, DC, I head to Ocean Petroleum in downtown Brunswick and meet with Ashley Davis who runs this family owned and operated wholesale distributor of petroleum products.  Next, I head back up to Savannah and during the drive back I have a phone interview with The District, the student run news source for the Savannah College of Art and Design.  Once back in Savannah, I meet with the Savannah Board of Realtors.

Wednesday, October 17, 2018:  This morning I’m at the offices of Altrus Assisted Living Services in Savannah for an Alzheimer’s Coffee with Congress meeting hosted by the Alzheimer’s Association.  The purpose of these meetings is to give caregivers the opportunity to meet Members of Congress and share their stories as caregivers.  The stories that I hear today from these brave men and women are amazing and encouraging. 
￼
Rep. Carter visiting the Girls on the Run Program at South Effingham Elementary School
Afterwards, I head to the Savannah Police Training Center where I have the opportunity to address the Chatham Area Traffic Incident Management Team, and bring them up to date on infrastructure improvements in our area, including an update on the progress of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP).  A link to a news clip on this meeting can be found here.  Next, I head to the Savannah Treatment Center for a tour of this rehabilitation center that specializes in the treatment of opioid addiction.  As the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress as well as being a member of the Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee that has passed legislation on this subject, I have a special interest in this area and am impressed with the fine work being done here with medication assisted treatment.  A link to a clip of my visit can be found here.  Next, I head to South Effingham Elementary School in Guyton for a visit with participants in the Girls on the Run program.  This great program helps to combat the unfortunate rise in unhealthy behaviors from the young people in our communities by positively influencing their social, physical, emotional and psychological development.  Along with community service and the Girls on the Run 5K, these girls are building both character and the confidence they will need to succeed.  My last stop of the day is to downtown Savannah where I meet with a group of young professionals.

Thursday, October 18, 2018:  I’m at St. Joseph’s/Candler Hospital on Reynolds Street in Savannah this morning meeting with hospital personnel to discuss maternal mortality and what we can do to address the issue in Georgia.  At a recent E&C Health Subcommittee meeting I learned that Georgia has the worst maternal mortality rate in the U.S. and that the pregnancy-related mortality ratio in the U.S. is one of the highest in the world.  The purpose of this meeting is to gain insight into the problem from health care professionals dealing directly with the situation. 
￼
Rep. Carter at the designation ceremony of Chatham County as an Official Coast Guard Community
A link to a news clip of the roundtable can be found here.  Next, I head to West Chatham County for a visit with Pond & Company, an engineering firm that has recently located here from Atlanta, to discuss infrastructure in our district.  Afterwards, I head to the Savannah International Trade Center where I am honored to participate in the designation ceremony of Chatham County as an Official Coast Guard Community.  Along with the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, Admiral Karl L. Schultz, and elected officials from Chatham County, the City of Savannah and Tybee Island, I help to celebrate this well-deserved rare honor that our community is so proud of.  Afterwards, I head to Park Place in Savannah and meet with directors and representatives from the fine congregate care/group homes for teens and older youth in the First District to learn of the great work they do and discuss concerns they have.  My final visit of the day is to Blue Force Gear in Pooler as I tour their new facility and learn about the great work they do in making equipment that will lighten the load of the U.S. and allied warfighter by using advanced materials and proprietary manufacturing methods.

Friday, October 20, 2018:  I’m at Savannah State University early this morning as I have the honor of participating in the Step Up Savannah, Bridge the Gap to Prosperity meeting where the Creating Opportunity Awards are presented.  These awards are a distinction conferred by Step Up Savannah to community champions that have worked to help realize Step Up’s vision.  Afterwards, I head to Ellis Square in downtown Savannah for the “Red, White & Blues BBQ” sponsored by the 200 Club of the Coastal Empire. 
￼
Rep. Carter visiting McAllister Elementary School in Richmond Hill
The 200 Club is another example of what makes our community so great as their mission is to provide financial assistance to the surviving spouse and children of local law enforcement officers and firefighters who lose their lives in the line-of-duty while protecting our community.  Next, I head to McAllister Elementary School in Richmond Hill where I have the great joy of reading Pete the Cat to a kindergarten class and participating in the pep rally as members of the Richmond Hill High School football team and band march through the halls.  Afterwards, I head to my Savannah district office to meet with a veteran before heading to the federal courthouse in Savannah for the Southern District of Georgia’s Investiture Ceremony for Judge Stan Baker.  Judge Willie Moore will be moving to senior status and replaced by Judge Baker, who is an outstanding choice and I’m sure will do an exceptional job of serving this court for many years to come.  My final stop of a very busy week is in Richmond Hill in Bryan County as I have the honor of giving welcoming remarks at the Great Ogeechee Seafood Festival, an event started in 1985 that has grown to be one of the most anticipated in the State.

How important is it to you that political discourse in America be toned down in favor of greater civility and recognition of opposing viewpoints?


VERY important - The partisan tone has become too hateful and inflamed to the point where serious issues cannot be addressed.

SOMEWHAT important - I don't always like the coarseness and disrespect, but that's a part of democracy.

NOT important - There is a lot to be outraged about and that anger needs to be expressed even if some people get offended.

October 20, 2018
Greetings,
This week is Texas Chambers of Commerce Week. Chambers across the Lone Star State play a crucial role as advocates for small businesses, job creators, and the hardworking men and women in their communities. I have been proud to meet with and work alongside these men and women to roll back job-killing federal regulations, lower taxes, and create more economic opportunity and good paying jobs for Texans.
Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Throughout my time in the Senate, my top priority has been and continues to be jobs and economic growth. This week, I was honored to receive the National Federation of Independent Business’ Guardian of Small Business award. America’s economy is booming. In Texas, people are investing new capital, opening new facilities, hiring new workers, and raising wages. We’re seeing record low unemployment. That’s the power of getting the government off the backs of job creators, and allowing folks to prosper.
Central Texas is hurting as floodwaters ravaged communities all across the area this week. On Wednesday, I surveyed the storm damage in Burnet and Llano County and received a briefing from local officials in the area. In the last year, Texas has faced a number of powerful storms that have left entire communities devastated. However, I have every confidence that Texans will stand united, and rebuild stronger than ever. One of the great strengths of our state is the number of churches, charities, organizations, and people who have helped in the recovery, relief, and rebuilding process. This weekend, Texans should heed warnings from local officials, know their evacuation route, and avoid high water areas.
Our prayers continue to be with those Americans recovering in Central Texas, and from Hurricanes Matthew and Florence. These devastating natural disasters are a stark reminder of the importance of taking all steps necessary to prepare our homes and families for any future weather event. For those seeking preparedness information and resources, please refer to the federal and state resources listed here.
Please read below for an update from this last week.
Keep Texas Strong,

Congressman Smith's E-news: October 20, 2018   ￼  I was honored to be inducted as an honorary member of Alpha Gamma Rho agricultural fraternity at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln on Friday evening.    
Medicare Enrollment Is Open Now  During Medicare open enrollment, current and prospective beneficiaries are able to update or initiate Part D coverage as needed. This year’s open enrollment will take place from October 15th to December 7th, allowing seniors to make decisions regarding their 2019 Medicare coverage.  While no action is required if current beneficiaries are happy with their coverage, formularies can change from year to year and it is highly recommended every beneficiary review their coverage annually. In order to guide Nebraska’s seniors through this sometimes difficult process, my office will conduct our annual Senior Services Fairs in Scottsbluff and Grand Island.  The Scottsbluff Senior Services Fair will take place at the Lied Scottsbluff Public Library located at 1809 3rd Avenue from 9:30 a.m. to noon (MT) on November 14th. The Grand Island Senior Services Fair will be held on November 15th from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. (CT) at the Grand Generation Center located at 304 E 3rd Street.  Representatives from Social Security, the VA, the Nebraska Senior Health Insurance Information Program (SHIIP,) and my office will be on-site to answer any questions or concerns regarding these agencies and programs. We recommend Nebraskans seeking assistance with Medicare Part D at the Grand Island event make appointments by calling Nebraska SHIIP at 1-800-234-7119.  In addition, if you plan to seek assistance with choosing a Part D plan at either of these events, please be sure to bring a full list of your prescriptions and dosages to ensure representatives can help you choose the best plan to cover your recurring prescriptions.  For those who may not be able to travel to one of these events, I also hold an annual Medicare teleconference through which a representative from Medicare can answer your questions about open enrollment. Residents of the Third District who would like to be included in this annual teleconference are encouraged to call my Grand Island office at 308-384-3900 prior to November 13th.  For additional information, seniors may visit Medicare.gov to learn more about available options, check current enrollment, and apply for new coverage. Nebraskans can also speak with experts by calling Nebraska SHIIP at 1-800-234-7119 or Medicare at 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227.)  I sincerely hope seniors needing advice or assistance will utilize one or more of these resources to receive coverage through this vital program. Medicare Part D was designed to improve coverage and keep costs down by requiring insurers to compete. Taking an active role in reviewing your coverage improves your ability to benefit from this competition.  As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee which has jurisdiction over Medicare, I will continue to ensure its benefits remain available for future generations of Americans.   Meet with Me This Week 
I'll be holding mobile offices in South Sioux City and Bloomfield this week to meet with constituents and discuss important issues such as the Farm Bill, trade, and tax reform. I hope you'll join me.

Dear Friend,
Missourians work hard day in and day out for their money, and they should have a government that watches over their dollars as carefully and responsibly as they do at home. We don’t mind paying our fair share to live in a safe nation, to have a judicial system that maintains law and order, or for public infrastructure improvements. But in Missouri we don’t have the appetite for a massive government that wants to use our hard-earned tax dollars on inefficient government programs and handouts. Your money belongs in your pocket, not in Washington’s coffers...KEEP READING HERE 


WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH

Hultgren Hunger Forum a Hit
I had the honor and privilege of hosting a public forum in St. Charles on Wednesday called “Confronting the Scourge of Hunger”. The forum highlighted global hunger and ways to address hunger needs locally in our northern Illinois communities ahead of the holidays.
For many in our community, region, and world, getting enough to eat is a daily struggle. It’s not just a matter of sufficient access to food, but also getting enough calories and essential nutrients on a daily basis. Like many of you, I remain grateful for the blessings of basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter. However, nearly 600,000 people in northern Illinois rely on food pantries to feed themselves and their families.
Distinguished special guests from international and regional food relief and assistance organizations joined us Wednesday, including Ambassador Tony Hall of the Alliance to End Hunger, Zach Schmidt of Bread for the World, Teresa Schryver of the Northern Illinois Food Bank, Jodie Clow of Faith Acres Foundation in Island Lake, Erin Wise of the Shepherd’s Heart Benevolence Ministry at Chapelstreet Church in Geneva, and Abby Deatherage of Local Compassion and Justice at Willow Creek Community Church.
Together they described what is happening with hunger globally and in our own region, as well as the substantial progress being made and the successes achieved in helping our “neighbors” get enough to eat and overcome the obstacles associated with hunger.  
As we head into the holidays, I will remain mindful of those in our local communities and around the world who confront hunger on a daily basis. I will be thinking of ways I can be of help to those in need, whether its volunteering at a local food bank or cosponsoring legislation such as the Global Food Security Act in Congress 
￼ 
￼ 
Wrapping Up the Year
With the President recently signing the Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act into law, the work we have done at the Science Committee will continue to spur discovery and economic growth in Illinois. I was humbled to have large parts of H.R. 5120, my bipartisan legislation the House passed back in 2014, included in this package. A primary focus of mine with the labs has been getting unnecessary bureaucracy out of the way so researchers can develop business ideas out of their research and get it to the market more quickly.  
As Congress continues our work for the rest of the year, I was thrilled to see the Department of Energy Office of Science funded for the second year at its highest level. The Office of Science is the United States largest funder of research in the physical science and the primary funding source for Fermilab and Argonne.
As Congress finished out our appropriations process, there are still key programs I will continue advocating for in a long-term Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Bill. I have long supported robust funding at the National Science Foundation and expect to see this in any final package.
I have also co-led the bipartisan letters of support for the Regional Innovation Program, funded in this bill, which make it easier for businesses in Illinois to share best practices, advocate on their behalf, and get new ideas to market quicker. Perhaps most important is keeping these jobs in Illinois! 

U.S. Economy Doing Extremely Well
Following Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell's description of the U.S. economic outlook as ""remarkably positive"", Chicago Fed President Charles Evans says ""U.S. economy is doing extremely well. Fundamentals are strong, the labor market is doing terrific."" 
Read more here about the future of our roaring economy! 

Turkey Releases Pastor Brunson
I am so very thankful for Pastor Brunson’s long-awaited release, which will mark the end of an avoidable and distressing episode in U.S.-Turkish relations.
My hope is that with Andrew Brunson’s release we can begin the process of healing between our two nations and ultimately strengthening relationships with a crucial regional ally. 
For now, we can take a moment to reflect on the successful efforts that resulted in his freedom and rejoice with his family, while bearing in mind that there are still others in similar circumstances who remain incarcerated.

Randy On The Issues - Advancing Science & Technology
As a senior member of the Science Committee, I believe maintaining America’s leadership role in scientific research and development is critical for our future. We need a renewed focus on STEM education. The House passed my Accelerating American Leadership in Science Act that provides important funding for Fermi Lab, as well as the DOE Labs Modernization and Technology Transfer Act that helps educational institutions in the 14th District innovate.

The Trump Tax Scam, Phase II
Deficits are up? Cut Medicare and Social Security!
By Paul Krugman, The New York Times Opinion
                                    
￼
When the Trump tax cut was on the verge of being enacted, I called it “the biggest tax scam in history,” and made a prediction: deficits would soar, and when they did, Republicans would once again pretend to care about debt and demand cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.

Sure enough, the deficit is soaring. And this week Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, after declaring the surge in red ink “very disturbing,” called for, you guessed it, cuts in “Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid.” He also suggested that Republicans might repeal the Affordable Care Act — taking away health care from tens of millions — if they do well in the midterm elections.
Any political analyst who didn’t see this coming should find a different profession. After all, “starve the beast” — cut taxes on the rich, then use the resulting deficits as an excuse to hack away at the safety net — has been G.O.P. strategy for decades.

The Rigging of American Politics
￼
Political systems depend on legitimacy. In America, that legitimacy is failing.
By Ezra Klein, Vox
Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court by an unpopular president who won 3 million fewer votes than the runner-up. He was confirmed by a Senate majority that represents a minority of the country. He was confirmed despite most Americans telling pollster after pollster they did not want him seated on the Supreme Court. 
Nothing about Kavanaugh’s ascension breaks the rules of American government. Donald Trump is the duly elected president of the United States. Republicans hold a majority in the US Senate. Elected officials bear no responsibility to follow public opinion. Yet the left sees Kavanaugh’s confirmation as illegitimate, and they’re turning their ire on the composition of the US Senate and their focus to the possibilities for future court-packing and judicial impeachment. 
American politics is edging into an era of crisis. A constitutional system built to calm the tensions of America’s founding era is distorting the political competition between parties, making the country both less democratic and less Democratic.

I Fell For Facebook Fake News. Here’s Why Millions of You Did, Too.
By Geoffrey A. Fowler, Technology Columnist, The Washington Post
The Facebook video is nuts, but I can’t tear my eyes away. A plane, struggling in a huge storm, does a 360-degree flip before safely landing and letting out terrified passengers. 
It turns out the video is totally bunk, spliced together from a computer-generated clip and unrelated real news footage. But that didn’t stop the Facebook post from arriving in my News Feed via a friend last month. I watched it. Maybe you did, too: It has nearly 14 million views. 
Everyone now knows the Web is filled with lies. So then how do fake Facebook posts, YouTube videos and tweets keep making suckers of us? 
To find out, I conducted a forensic investigation of the fake that fooled my social network. I found the original creator of that CG plane clip. I spoke to the Facebook executive charged with curbing misinformation. And I confronted my friend who shared it.

Weekly Update: I'm Here to Serve You By Congressman Wittman October 20, 2018  Without question, the most important part of my job as a member of Congress is to serve you, my constituents. It is my passion to serve that drives me to wake up each morning and fight for you in Washington. Every day votes are held, I commute from my hometown of Montross, and I drive past the homes of friends I’ve known all my life; that keeps me grounded as I start each day.  From cutting through the bureaucracy to arranging Capitol Tours, I want to do everything I can to provide the best service possible to my constituents. As your member of Congress, I serve as a liaison between you and federal agencies. My staff and I frequently help people navigate issues they're having with federal agencies. Although I cannot override the decisions made by a federal agency, I can often advocate on a person's behalf to get answers to questions, find solutions, or just cut through the red tape. Just this Congress, my amazing district staff completed over 1,500 cases.  Last week, I had the great pleasure of meeting with some folks to hear their casework success stories.  Cheryl reached out to my office for assistance in securing the necessary paperwork for her VA home loan. We assisted her in navigating the Navy bureaucracy and Cheryl was able to purchase her home. 
￼

Saeed requested assistance in securing visas for his young children, who faced the prospect of being left behind in Pakistan and separated from their parents while their visas were being processed. My office was able to cut thru the red-tape at USCIS and the State Department and obtain visas for Hassan and Hania.

￼
If you ever have a problem with a federal agency or need assistance, please check out my website or call one of my local offices in Stafford, Tappahannock, or Hanover. In order to provide assistance to residents who do not live near my district offices, I want to invite you to visit one of my satellite offices. Click here to view the locations and schedule.  I always put the First District First. My top priority will always be serving you and it is an honor to serve you and Virginia's First District in the People's House.

SENIOR CITIZENS INFORMATION FAIR I’m hosting a Senior Citizens Information Fair next week in McAlester to allow constituents who have questions or issues with the Social Security Administration to visit with me and members of my staff and get assistance.  Additional resource organizations will also be in attendance to offer assistance, such as KI BOIS, and others. Hope you’ll join us!
 
Senior Citizens Information Fair Friday, October 26
10:00 – 11:30am CT J.I. Stipe Center
801 N. 9th St.
McAlester, OK  74501 
LIVE ON FOX AND FRIENDS On Tuesday, I joined Fox and Friends to discuss Elizabeth Warren’s DNA test results. As a member of the Cherokee Nation, I am disappointed by Senator Warren’s attempt to prove any kind of Native American heritage in order to advance her political career. What she did is get a liberal university to provide information to convey that her lie is not a lie.  The lie has gone far enough and it’s time for her to apologize to the American people and the Cherokee Nation. Watch the interview at this link.  
￼
MEETING WITH OKLAHOMANS One of my favorite things I get to do as a member of Congress is visit with students of all ages. I stopped by Whittier Elementary this week to talk with students about Congress and how a bill becomes a law.  
￼

I also spoke to a history class at Warner High School about current issues in the news.
￼

It was great to be with students at Connors State College, where we discussed how best to reach elected officials on issues of importance. 
￼

Thanks to representatives from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society for stopping by our Claremore office to meet about their legislative priorities.
￼
Enjoyed visiting with Barbara Chance!  
￼
I had the chance to attend the monthly farm auction at the Brinkley Auction in Idabel and meet with Larry Brinkley. This auction is one of the largest in the nation, and brings in people from all over the United States.  
￼
I toured the new Fred’s Pharmacy location in Idabel. It was great to speak with Wes Maddox and learn more about this new establishment and the opportunities it will bring to the community.  
￼
 MOBILE OFFICE STOPS FOR VETERANS  
￼
In the Second District, I have offices located in Claremore, Muskogee, and McAlester. However, I understand that many constituents don’t live near one of my offices, or don’t have the time to travel to one. Our veterans deserve first-class service no matter where they live. That’s why I’m sending my veterans caseworker to you so that a member of my team can assist you in your own town.
Members of my staff will stop in five southeastern counties in OK-2 this month. The stop below is coming up next week. Visit my website to see the full list of dates and locations. Stop by if my team can help you! 
Choctaw County Mobile Office Stop
Thursday, October 25, 2018

Dear Lindsey, 
The past couple of weeks have proven to be very busy, but I wanted to take the time to update you on our recent work in Washington, D.C. and the 15th District of Texas. 
It is an honor to serve as your congressman. 
The District Office in Seguin, Texas is officially open! It is an honor to open an office for residents in the northernmost region of the 15th District of Texas. I am humbled to bring on veteran, Robert 'Bobby' Herrera, to better assist Central Texans. This new location will offer educators, senior citizens, veterans, and any constituent facing issues with federal agencies the ability for us to engage on their behalf on any federal issue — whether it be the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Social Security Administration. Mr. Herrera is ready to offer direct assistance with these agencies on my behalf. To the people of Seguin, Texas, and surrounding areas – we are here, able, and ready to help.
The new District Office is located at 1243 Cardinal Ln., Seguin, Texas 78155. 
￼
￼
On Monday, I joined community leaders from Brooks County to discuss solutions for water and drainage issues in Jim Hogg, Duval, and Brooks Counties. It is my hope that this conversation is the first of many as we develop short term and long term solutions to these pressing issues. I will continue to work with local, state, and federal officials to ensure South Texas is safe, open for business, and not hindered by future severe storms and flooding. Find out more by clicking the picture below.
￼ 
On Tuesday, I met with Texas Farm Bureau members from across the 15th District in George West, Texas to hear about what matters most to our producers. From U.S. foreign policy to trade, immigration, bipartisanship and everything in between, what we do in Washington and around the world affects our farmers and ranchers.
￼ 
On Wednesday, I met with City of Seguin Mayor Don Keil; City Manager, Doug Faseler; Grants Coordinator, Dana Losey; and Assistant General Manager of Schertz-Seguin Local Government Corporation, Amber Beard to discuss strategies that improve the overall well-being of Seguin, Texas and surrounding communities. 
￼ 
Recently, I visited the Karnes County Courthouse to discuss methods to strengthen energy development and strategies to promote investments for local infrastructure improvements. I pledge to continue working to build economies and communities in Karnes County and keeping an open dialogue with county officials.
￼ 
I thank my friend, Homer Lott Jr., Mayor of Runge, Texas, for taking the time to chat about ways we can work together to help the residents of the 15th District of Texas.
￼ 
Recently, I visited with Seguin ISD Superintendent, Dr. Matthew Gutierrez, and the fantastic people serving the youth of Seguin, Texas. I extend my gratitude to all of you for ensuring that the children of Seguin have full, adequate resources that strengthen their educational fortitude.
￼ 
As always, please let me know if there is anything I can do to better serve you. To contact any of my offices in South Texas or in Washington, D.C. click the ""contact me"" icon above.

Bruce Buchanan, a 4th District corn farmer, is grateful to President Trump for his recent decision to allow E15 fuel cells.

Thank you to Mark and Abhi and my entire district staff for their help.  They gathered supplies that were needed by those impacted by Hurricane Michael in Florida.
￼
Israel is a crucial ally of the United States.  I recently spoke on the House Floor in support of President Trump's efforts to strengthen our friendship.

Town Hall in Frankfort on Sunday
Public meetings are a chance for me to get my marching orders to discuss issues directly with my fellow Hoosiers.  To provide an opportunity to do so, I will be holding a Town Hall on October 21st.  I look forward to hearing from you at the Frankfort Neighborhood Center.
￼
When: Sunday, October 21st starting at 2 PM ET
Where: Frankfort Neighborhood Center
259 South 3rd Street, Frankfort
Helping After Hurricane Michael
On Monday, Team Rokita was honored to participate in Hoosier Hospitality by donating supplies for those affected by Hurricane Michael.  My staff collected needed supplies, such as diapers, food, water, tarp, and bleach, to help those in need.  I personally flew the supplies to Florida where they could be put to immediate use.  I would like to thank my staff and everyone who has been helping Floridians recover from this storm.
￼
The plane was loaded with supplies and ready to go to Florida.
American Spirit Award for Aviation Support
This week, I was honored to receive the American Spirit Award by the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) for my work with general aviation.  The NBAA American Spirit Award is presented in recognition of an individual within business aviation who exemplifies courage, and is in the pursuit of excellence and service to others that characterize the men and women who created and nurtured the American aviation community.  Some past recipients include Captain ‘Sully’ Sullenberger, the passengers and crew of United flight 93, and former president of the NBAA, Jack Olcott.  You can find a list of past recipients here.
America has the largest, safest, and most effective aviation system in the world, and general aviation plays a key role in that.  In Indiana alone, general aviation has an economic impact of $5.8 billion.  My team and I have been able to protect and grow general aviation in Indiana and across the nation by rolling back red-tape and introducing bills like my Securing and Revitalizing Aviation (SARA) Act, that adds protections for the aviation community.  I will continue to push for system modernization and to protect general aviation.
In the 114th Congress, I introduced H.R. 1086, the General Aviation Pilot Protection Act, a bipartisan effort to reform third-class medical certification.  Third-class medical reforms were signed into law and went into effect on May, 1 2017.  This Congress, Congressman Rokita introduced H.R. 6957, the Securing and Revitalizing Aviation (SARA) Act, which would improve protections for the aviation community.
Lowest Unemployment Since 1969
The U.S. unemployment rate reached its lowest levels since 1969 after the economy added 134,000 jobs in September.  This is the latest sign that the pro-growth policies promoted by House Republicans and President Donald Trump are working.  We have been committed to removing the roadblocks put in place by the previous administration.
The American economy excels when Americans take charge.  High taxes and excess regulations were crippling the economy.  Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the American tax code is competitive.  Our businesses are no longer burdened by one of the world's highest tax rates and Americans are saving money.  According to the Tax Foundation, the average Hoosier in the Fourth District saves $1,425 in taxes.  Hoosiers, not Washington, know how to spend their own money.
Under President Trump, for every new regulation enacted a record twenty-two have been repealed.  Proposed regulations have been withdrawn.  One of the regulations was overturned by a bill that I wrote and which was signed into law by President Trump.  My bill repealed onerous proposed requirements that would have grown the Department of Education's role in determining local education accountability standards.  As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, I believe that parents, states, and our communities should be deciding the education of children, not Washington bureaucrats.
The results of these efforts are clear, the American economy is booming.

Weekly Review
 



October 16

Rising Annual Deficits: I know that at times I sound like a broken record on the debt and deficit, but it will prove to be the issue of our times. Accordingly, I give you a brief update based on the fact that yesterday, the Treasury Department reported that the deficit for fiscal year 2018 was $779 billion. This is a 17 percent and 113 billion dollar increase over last year.
More significantly, this was the largest deficit that our country’s seen since 2012 when it was over $1 trillion and tapering down from the deficits that exploded with the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009. In fact, the annual deficit peaked in 2009 at $1.4 trillion. It gradually dropped to $439 billion by 2015, and since then, it has risen steadily. It was $585 billion in 2016 and $666 billion in 2017.
The whole 666 thing in 2017 freaks me out…but that’s another story for another day on God’s warning signs for us on the debt and deficit…. Click here to read more.

Government Waste - MOX Closure: You know the two things that drive me crazy about government?
One, that the left hand never seems to know what the right arm is doing. A whole host of governmental promises are either not remembered or soon forgotten by the complexity of government and its commitments or simply by the passage of time.
Two, it doesn’t mind burning money. You think about how hard each of us work to earn a dollar’s pay…and then government goes out and literally burns money that we spent days, weeks, months, or even years to accumulate and send off (by law and edict) for their care and stewardship.
So the bottom line is that we have a giant entity that we all pump money into that oftentimes doesn’t live up to its commitments and burns money as it does so.
There’s not a more relevant example out there than what just happened last week with the MOX facility up at the Savannah River site in Aiken. Click here to read more.

Updates on the Two New Trade Agreements: George Will said it perfectly when he recently observed, “protectionism - laws and administrative rulings by which government determines the prices and quantities of imported goods and services - is government regulation.”
What the administration can’t do, and what we can’t do as Republicans, is to say that we’re for less regulation and then stand quietly as massive amounts of new regulation are put on us in the form of tariffs. On this point, it’s interesting that observers have noted that the deregulatory efforts by the administration to date have saved about $1.3 billion this year. That’s good. What’s not so good is that this is a fraction of the amount of money that is now going to go to farmers from the taxpayers, as the administration tries to protect farmers from the effects of the NEW tariffs.
In this light, let me offer a few thoughts on the two recent trade agreements by the administration….
As I’m sure you know, one was with Korea (KORUS), and there was a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) - and it will now be called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Click here to read more.

Foreign Military Sales: Time out of session in preparation for the midterm elections is dangerous on my part, given I don’t have a campaign to run but instead have time to look at different wastes in government that should drive all of us crazy.
In this regard, I thought you might find interesting a recent report by the Government Accountability Office that found in the last 6 years the Department of Defense has given foreign countries discounts on the purchase of military weapons and equipment to the tune of $16 billion.
Here’s the kicker: over half of that was to oil-wealthy countries in the Middle East (Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia) who rank as some of the richest in the world - and are fully capable of paying full-price.
This is particularly true, given the fact that these countries run massive trade surpluses given their oil sales. Saudi Arabia has created a $697 billion sovereign wealth fund, Kuwait a $524 billion fund, and Qatar has a $320 billion fund. Click here to read more.

Dear Friend,  This week our nation lost a truly great leader, philanthropist, and visionary.  As co-founder of Microsoft; owner of the Seahawks and Trailblazers; co-owner of the Sounders; and founder of Vulcan Inc., the Allen Institute for Brain Science, and the Museum of Pop Culture, Paul Allen was an institution here in Washington State. He will be dearly missed, but his legacy lives on in the lives he touched through his work redefining modern technology and his kind heart and extensive philanthropy in our community and around the world.  Welcoming Home Our Nation’s Heroes  This week, I was honored to welcome home World War II veterans who traveled to Washington, DC with the Puget Sound Honor Flight. The Honor Flight Network is a non-profit organization dedicated to honoring America’s veterans for all their sacrifices. They transport our heroes to Washington, DC to visit and reflect at our nation’s memorials built in their honor, with the top priority given to the senior veterans of World War II.  
￼
Encouraging News for Washington’s Economy  Earlier this week, United States Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer, pursuant to the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) Act, sent letters to Congress expressing the Administration’s intent to enter into three different trade negotiations with the European Union, Japan, and the United Kingdom.  I welcomed this announcement demonstrating a formal intent to begin negotiations with some of our greatest trading partners. It is my hope the Administration will consult extensively with Congress as the scope and objectives for these negotiations are set.  With 40 percent of jobs tied to trade in Washington State, strong and ambitious trade agreements with these allies would be beneficial for our workers, businesses, and farmers.  Addressing Flood Risk in the Puyallup River Basin  This week, I sent a bipartisan, bicameral letter with Sens. Murray, Cantwell, Reps Heck, and Kilmer to the Army Corps of Engineers to ask them to complete the Puyallup River General Investigation study to identify flood protections that are needed for the Puyallup River Basin. It is my hope that the Army Corps will complete this study so we can find ways to reduce flood risk in the Puyallup River Basin.  Pierce County Zero Emissions Buses  On October 17, Pierce County for the first time ever will be running all-electric, zero-emissions buses in the South Sound. Recently, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) awarded Pierce Transit a $2.55 million “Low or No Emissions” grant to purchase the agency’s first-ever, all-electric, zero-emission buses and related infrastructure. The “Low-No” grant program aims to put a new generation of advanced, non-polluting transit buses on roadways across the nation. Earlier this year, I sent a bipartisan, bicameral letter with Sens. Murray, Cantwell, Reps Heck, and Kilmer to the FTA in support of federal funding for these electric, zero-emissions buses for Pierce County. This will help improve our public transportation in the South Sound while reducing pollution to help keep our air clean.   District Happenings   Saturday: Issaquah Goes Apples & Farm Fresh Market  Hosted in Downtown Issquah, Issaquah Goes Apples celebrates harvest season with a pop-up market, walking tours, art experiences and more!  Highlights include a cider press, live music, pumpkin patch, and scarecrow-making contest. Participants of all ages are welcome!  EVENT DETAILS:  When: Saturday, October 20, 9:00am-2:00pm Where: Historic Shell Station, 232 Front St. N, Issaquah, WA 98027  Saturday: Junk-tiquen in the Burg  Hunt for unique upcycled, repurposed, and vintage goods at the 5th Annual Junk-tiquen in the Burg Fall Show. There will be vendors from across the Pacific Northwest  EVENT DETAILS:  When: Saturday, October 20, 9:00am – 4:00pm Where: Kittitas County Event Center, 901 E. 7th Avenue, Ellensburg, WA  Wishing you all a wonderful weekend!  Sincerely,
Dave

Dear Friend,

October is a busy month for all of us. Friday Night Lights are back; the weather can’t decide what to do; and classes are in full gear. For me, this month is filled with events and road trips across our GREAT district.

Earlier this month, I spoke at the AIPAC Southwest Region Veterans Dinner. The brave men and women we honored sacrificed much for our country. My deepest thanks to them for their service. 

Without a doubt, Israel is our closest ally in the Middle East. Two of her greatest strengths are that she stands up for herself and she stands up for her friends. Israel’s strength proves that all 8,019 square miles of her is mighty.

Our two nations work closely together to keep each other safe and secure. Our scientists and our military value the input of each other. Together, we’ve achieved many great things. I look forward to our continued alliance.

￼
""T-Bone by Brooke Langston is on display in the Capitol.

Each year, our office hosts the Congressional Art Competition. I had the pleasure of speaking to the audience at the Brazoria County Fair, and my…I must tell you, we have some talented young artists in our district. Congrats to Chisom Akunne for taking home the top prize at the fair. Her piece, “The Sheriff,” is remarkable! To all our young artists out there: Looking forward to seeing y’all participate in next year’s art competition! Contact Janet Brown in our Beaumont Office (409-835-0108) for more details. I’ll be sure to post details on my Facebook in the spring, too!

Lecturing students and taking questions at LIT.

I also visited the Lamar Institute of Technology. They graciously invited me to teach a class. For about 50 minutes, the students and I talked trade, reducing regulations on business and industry, Harvey recovery, and the day-to-day life of a Congressman. Let me tell you, there are some bright, young minds at LIT. Many thanks to Dr. Lonnie L. Howard, LIT, and the students!

￼
At the Beaumont Rotary Club.

Right after class, I met with the Beaumont Rotary Club. Southeast Texas is rich with energy, trade, and ports. We will not soon forget that, and we are doing everything possible to continue advancing the gains these industries bring to families, the community, and our economy. 

At the end of the day, all we can do is work hard and do our best to help others. “Service Above Self” isn’t simply a motto for Rotary Club, it’s a way of life. Southeast Texas leads by example, and the example you set is a gift to our community, our state, and our nation.

A great morning with Olin employees.

Across our great district, we are concerned with safety – the safety of our families, neighbors, coworkers, and community. Olin recently received the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program Star Site award. This distinct award is given to the few who shine in their prevention and control of occupation health and safety hazards. The care employees put into making sure their workplace is a safe environment is outstanding. Olin is no exception. It was a pleasure to stop by, say hello, and walk through their gallery showcasing products and projects that will lead Olin into the future. Chemical manufacturing is an important industry that plays a role in our daily lives.

￼
Touring our ports by sea...

Our Coast Guard works around the clock to protect our nation and be prepared for whatever may come our way. We will never forget the Coast Guard's heroism and lifesaving rescue missions during Hurricane Harvey. My deepest thanks and gratitude to them. 

One of my priorities in Congress is reauthorizing Coast Guard programs. Our Coast Guard is tasked with search and rescue missions, illegal drug and migrant interdiction, oil spill prevention and response, and more. While visiting with Rear Admiral Thomas, we discussed these missions, the state of equipment, and Harvey, while touring the facility and port. 

￼
and by air!

We need people who understand liberty and freedom, our Declaration of Independence and Constitution are clear on these matters. We need people – no, make that Patriots – who understand freedom is not for sale and should never be taken for granted. Texas 14 , y'all get it. I am BLESSED to represent you.


Sincerely,
￼
Randy K. Weber

FIGHTING FOR MAIN STREET
￼
Small businesses are not only the lifeblood of our economy, but they create good jobs for Hoosiers and make our communities stronger.
This week, I visited one of these family-owned small businesses – Stephenson’s of Elkhart – to see up close how they help make northern Indiana a great place to live.
￼
It was an honor to receive the National Retail Federation’s “Hero of Main Street” award, which was presented by Stephenson’s owner Danny Reynolds and Indiana Retail Council president Grant Monahan.
I am committed to making sure our Main Street job creators have every opportunity to succeed.
Building on our economic momentum driven by tax cuts and regulatory reforms will allow small businesses and local retailers like Stephenson’s to continue investing in our communities, and it will help more Hoosiers achieve the American Dream.
PROTECTING HOOSIER JOBS
￼
We need to hold China accountable for unfair trade practices, but we need to do it in a way that doesn’t harm American manufacturers, farmers, workers, and consumers. 
I am committed to fighting for Hoosier businesses and workers, so this week I led a bipartisan group of 169 members of Congress in calling for a process that allows U.S. companies to request an exclusion from the recent tariffs imposed on $200 billion of Chinese imports. You can read our letter here.
This process would help U.S. companies retain global competitiveness, and it would help target the effects of the tariffs on China, rather than on U.S. companies and consumers. 
The administration should heed our bipartisan call to establish a strong exclusion process and ensure we stay focused on the real target, which is China’s unfair trade practices.
UPDATING LOCAL SERVICE CLUBS
￼
Our local service clubs play a vital role in making our communities stronger and making a real difference in Hoosiers’ lives.
This week, I had the honor of speaking with members of the Elkhart Rotary and the Kiwanis Club of South Bend about how we can work together to build a brighter future.
￼
I’m grateful for all these local leaders do to make northern Indiana a better place for Hoosiers to live, work, and thrive.
As always, it is a privilege to represent 2nd District Hoosiers in Congress.

Taking Action Against the Opioid Crisis
One of the great tragedies our nation is experiencing right now, particularly in East Tennessee, is the ongoing crisis involving opioid abuse. Opioids include legal prescription painkillers, such as OxyContin; illegal drugs, like heroin; and synthetic drugs, such as fentanyl. It is still shocking to me that just last year more Tennesseans died from a drug overdose than in car accidents. Chances are you know someone – a friend, a family member, a coworker – who has been affected by this crisis. This epidemic is decades in the making and affects everyone – Republicans and Democrats, young and old, urban and rural, and all classes of society. There is no single cause for how we got here, and there is no silver bullet for how we solve it either. What is most clear is that we cannot sit idly by and let this epidemic continue to ravage our country and our region.  
The good news is Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working together to make significant reforms and to provide the necessary resources to address this crisis. Two years ago, I voted to support the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act to expand education and improve treatment for individuals with substance abuse disorders. Earlier this year, I supported legislation that provided $4 billion to programs designed to prevent and treat opioid abuse, and I was grateful to see $1.2 million of this funding go to East Tennessee facilities to improve treatment and education on opioid abuse. At the end of September, I was also proud to vote for an additional $6.7 billion in funding to boost our substance abuse programs and expand access to mental health services.  
While a lot of attention was being paid last month to the Supreme Court nomination, I was proud to support a significant piece of legislation that flew under the radar, but will further impact our fight against this epidemic. H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, promotes treatment and recovery; improves prevention practices; gives law enforcement the resources they need to protect our communities; and boosts our efforts to crack down on synthetic drugs like fentanyl. This bill also ensures access to mental health and substance use disorder services for children and pregnant women under the Children’s Health Insurance Program; modifies the a previous exclusion so that women in institutions for mental disease can receive other treatments they need covered under Medicaid, such as prenatal services; and requires our country to develop best practices and guidance in an effort to improve care for infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome. I was extremely pleased to see this vital bill pass the both the House and the Senate with substantial bipartisan support, and I look forward to President Trump signing it into law.  
As a physician, I know doctors are one of the most important pieces of the solution. As we’ve learned a great deal about these drugs’ potency and their potential for addiction, prescribing guidelines must now change to help ensure fewer people get addicted in the first place. That’s why I introduced legislation to limit the number of days for an initial opioid prescription fill. Opioid addiction can start in as few as three days, and to address this issue I introduced H.R. 3964, the Opioid Addiction Prevention Act of 2017, which would create a 10-day limit on initial opioid prescriptions, with chronic pain, cancer, hospice and end-of-life and palliative care patients exempted.  
Additionally, illicit drugs like fentanyl are still coming into the United States from China and causing overdose deaths across the country. These synthetic opioids are dangerous, and I believe we need to make it easier for our law enforcement agencies to target suppliers of these dangerous narcotics. For this reason, I introduced H.R. 5298, the Modernizing Drug Enforcement Act, which will give the Drug Enforcement Administration the tools they need to combat any synthetic opioid compound, like fentanyl.  
I am proud Congress has come together on a bipartisan basis to address this serious issue. There is no question more work needs to be done, but I’m hopeful the steps we’ve taken will begin to reverse this devastating crisis that has impacted so many across the First District.  

My door is always open to East Tennesseans. Feel free to contact my office if I can be of assistance to you or your family.

Lowest Unemployment Rate Since 1969
The economy is growing at historic rates. The unemployment rate is 3.7%, which is the lowest in my lifetime. There are 7.1 million open jobs in our country and 90% of workers are seeing bigger paychecks. The U.S. also has the world's most competitive economy for the first time in a decade.
Tax reform and our pro-growth agenda are working. More than 4 million workers have seen the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and over $4 billion has been paid in bonuses. Click here for a list of companies who have given bonuses, increased wages, and/or expanded benefits as a result of tax reform.  We have kept our promises to the American people. These are results, not rhetoric.  Get the facts here. 
Making the Tax Cuts Permanent
     ￼

Budget rules required Congress to sunset in 2025 the improvements to our tax code enacted in the tax reform package last December.   That's why I introduced H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018. This bill would make the tax benefits for individuals and small businesses enacted last year permanent so that families can continue to reap the benefits of tax reform for years to come.  
 
    ￼
Click here to watch the video of Davis speaking on his bill to make the tax cuts permanent. 
I am proud to say that the House of Representatives passed my bill to make the tax cuts permanent. This legislation represents my continued commitment to the millions of hardworking middle-class Americans.   
Growing the Middle Class
Tax reform is helping the middle class get ahead. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is putting more money in the pockets of the families I serve. In fact, the average family in the 13th district will save almost $2,000 in taxes this year.   We doubled the standard deduction, so it is now valued at $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples. We also improved the tax brackets which have lowered rates for all taxpayers. This helps nearly every middle class family in my district.   Taxpayers with children under the age of 17 can claim the Child Tax Credit to decrease the amount they owe the government each year in taxes. Under H.R. 1 Congress doubled the value of the credit from $1,000 to $2,000 for each qualified child. Additionally, even if a taxpayer has no tax liability for the year, up to $1,400 of the credit is refundable, meaning the government will send a check to the taxpayer up to that amount.   Make no mistake, tax reform is good for the middle class and I will continue to stand up for middle class families across my district.

Social Security announces 2.8% increase



Dear Friend: 
Welcome to your weekly update. As always, you can learn more about these and other legislative issue at my website: upton.house.gov. 
Social Security announces 2.8% increase
I am pleased to announce a 2.8% Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) increase for more than 67 million Americans in 2019. 
The COLA is one of the Social Security’s most important protections, which ensures benefits keep up with inflation. 
Social Security also recently expanded their Compassionate Allowance List, which has enables them to identify and fast-track cases where individuals have diseases that are most likely to be approved for disability benefits. 
Social Security is an earned benefit that Americans have paid into throughout their entire lives and I am committed to preserving and strengthening this vital program for today’s and tomorrow’s seniors. 
Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization signed into law
The President recently signed the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act into law. 
This five-year reauthorization provides long-term stability for the Nation’s aviation community, continues investment in airports across the country, improves America’s competitiveness in the global aviation sector, strengthens passenger protections, and ensures the safety of the system for the traveling public.  
Also tucked in the FAA reauthorization is a PFAS provision which removes federal requirements that airports use firefighting foam containing the chemicals.
Back in Southwest Michigan
With no votes in the House this week, I am hard at work in Southwest Michigan. 
Just this morning, I celebrated National Breast Cancer Awareness Month at the Making Strides against Breast Cancer Walk in Portage. 
I spoke with students at Portage Northern Middle School about government and civility in politics, presented the Parchment football team with flags for their part in helping those affected by the water crisis, and shared my love of reading with students at Brown Elementary in St. Joseph – just to name a few!

10/20/18 9:00,CVS Merger,"News from Representative Crawford 
￼ 
￼   ￼   ￼   ￼   ￼   ￼   
￼
 CVS Merger
What happens when major corporations that participate huge facets of our healthcare industry merge into one entity? The Department of Justice’s (DOJ) October 10 approval of the merger between CVS Health Corporation (CVS) and Aetna Inc. (Aetna) ensures we will find out. As you likely know, CVS is comprised of two sides – retail pharmacy and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). PBMs manage the price negotiations between pharmacies and insurance companies. Aetna is one of the country’s largest health insurers, covering 22 million people. Both companies say the merger will allow them to better coordinate care and keep costs down for consumers. While this is a worthy goal, Arkansas’ history with CVS’s PBM does not instill much confidence in me that this merger will benefit Arkansans. 
In March, I sent a letter to the DOJ expressing my strong opposition to this merger, specifically asking them to consider how CVS has continued undercutting reimbursements to independent pharmacies, while reimbursing its own pharmacies at a higher rate. I am still concerned that this type of vertical integration could destroy competition, hitting our community pharmacists and leaving them the option to either constantly lose money or close business in rural, underserved areas, like the First District of Arkansas. CVS even had the gall to send letters to our pharmacists offering to buy them out during the times they were receiving poor reimbursements.
To me, not much good can come from this consolidation. I truly fear that consumer choice will be endangered and costs will increase for prescription medications. Community pharmacists are critical healthcare providers to folks in rural areas. They know their customers by name, ask about their families, and come in on weekends. Rural America stands to lose the most when monopolistic consolidation occurs and I will continue engaging with our pharmacists and other healthcare providers to inform and advocate for policies that facilitate fair competition resulting in access to quality, affordable healthcare. 
FAQ (What folks have been calling/texting my office about this week)
Q: I keep hearing that there is a caravan of 3,000 migrants headed for the US border, what is being done to stop them?  A: I have long been a supporter of funding a wall along our southern border. True immigration reform can not begin until we have secured our borders, if we don't we will continue to face these problems down the line. Last week, Rep. McCarthy introduced a border funding bill that I plan on supporting when it comes to the Floor for a vote.

McKinley Talks Workforce Needs, Tax Reform, Diversifying WV's Economy 
This past week, we traveled across the district to discuss workforce needs, tax reform, and diversifying West Virginia's economy. We had a busy week visiting Wood, Hancock, Doddridge, and Monongalia County.  We were pleased to host a roundtable with veterans from the American Legion Post 15 in Parkersburg, and to discuss WV's economic resurgence at the monthly legislative breakfast in Wood County. As always, we had lively discussions, and it was nice to catch up with old friends. Although there is more work to be done, there is a lot of optimism about things turning around for our state.   Click on the following to read more about our meetings:   McKinley Tours Former Johns-Manville Plant McKinley Hosts Roundtable with Local Manufacturers

WV Economy Benefits From Vital Federal Facilities 
It is vital that our local economy supports and expands the federal presence in NCWV. Federal agencies such as the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) in Morgantown and the Criminal Just Information Services (CJIS) in Clarksburg employ thousands of people each year, attract private investment, and help diversify our economy.

Thank you for subscribing to my E-Newsletter! This week I want to update you on my work on behalf of our veterans and their families, share some stellar economic news, and make sure you know where I am visiting in the district.  
I enjoy hearing from you and responding to your questions via email, phone calls, and letters. If you'd like to share your concerns or opinions with me, or if you have questions about legislation or specific votes, you can send me an email here. To stay up-to-date on my work in Pennsylvania and Washington, be sure to follow me on Facebook and Twitter. You can also check out my YouTube page here where there are 100+ videos, many of which are direct responses to your questions. 
I'm also extraordinarily proud of the casework my office has been able to complete for constituents. More than 1,800 cases have been completed, and more than $650,000 has been returned to constituents. The top four federal agencies with which you've requested help are the Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of State, and Department of Treasury.
If you need help with a federal agency, my office can often help cut through some of Washington's red tape. I'd encourage you to contact my district office at (717) 393-0667 if I can help in any way. 
 
￼ 
Our veterans, servicemembers, and their families have endured tremendous hardships and made significant sacrifices in their fight to preserve the freedom of the United States. We owe each of them a debt of gratitude we'll never be able to fully repay. But we can, and should, do everything we can to ensure their well-being.
You can read about all my efforts on behalf of our veterans, servicemembers, and their families here, and see some highlights below. 
Warrior Wellness Act 
I introduced the bipartisan Warrior Wellness Act in September to improve the mental health services provided to servicemembers by the Department of Defense. Some of the greatest wounds inflicted upon our brave service men and women are unseen. We should be treating these wounds as we would any other. Ensuring our troops have access to high-quality mental health services and are properly treated is critical to their safety, the safety of their fellow soldiers, and the effectiveness of our national defense.
Learn more about this legislation here. 
Home for the Brave Act 
I introduced the bipartisan Home for the Brave act to assist in the fight against veteran homelessness. Our veterans have put their lives at great risk to keep all of us safe back home. Our district has made great strides to eliminate veteran homelessness, and I am proud to stand with my constituents in this noble effort. 
Specifically, this legislation would exempt disability benefits from counting as income when determining eligibility for federal housing assistance program. To return home and be priced out of housing assistance simply because a veteran receives service-related disability benefits is just plain wrong, and my legislation would correct this problem.
Learn more about this legislation here. 
Expanding Military Apprenticeship Opportunities 
America's military is made up of hardworking men and women who wake up every day to serve others. We should be making it easier for them to transition to civilian life with a steady job, and infuse our workforce with leadership skills only the military can provide.
That's why I introduced, and President Trump signed into law, an amendment that expands opportunities for active-duty servicemembers to learn career skills and occupational training. Previously, less than half of our nation's military personnel had access to apprenticeship opportunities, but my legislation ensures every single member of our armed services has access. 
Learn more about this legislation here. 
If you are a veteran, or if you know a veteran, and you need help with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, I may be able to help. Please contact my district office at (717) 393-0667 if I can help you or someone you know. 
 
American Regains Rank as World's Most Competitive Economy 
￼ 
I recently visited Pennsy Supply Inc. in Manheim (pictured above) where I was shown around their facility and held a town hall with employees. Among many other topics, we discussed America's booming economy and how it is helping lift American businesses to new heights. 
A recent article in the Wall Street Journal reported that the United States has regained the top spot in World Economic Forum rankings ""thanks to strong economic growth.""
Here's a short excerpt from the article: 
""The report scores countries on how closely they match up to the competitive ideal. The U.S. scored 85.6 out of a possible 100. America's vibrant entrepreneurial culture and its dominance in producing a competitive labor market and nimble financial system 'are among the several factors that contribute to making the U.S. innovation ecosystem one of the best in the world,' the report said."" 
This stellar economic news would not possible without the determination and optimistic spirit of American workers. You can read the full article here. 
Additionally, you can invite me to visit your business, volunteer organization, or simply set up a meeting with me in one of my offices by emailing me here. 
 
Here's Lloyd! 
￼ 
You can use the interactive map above to see the many different schools, volunteer organizations, manufacturers, and small businesses I've visited since taking office. If you'd like to invite me to visit you or an organization, you can invite me here. You can also schedule a meeting with me in one of my offices here. 
You can use the map here or by clicking on the image above. 
Since taking office, my staff and I have traveled more than 18,000 miles to meet with constituents. Between all my offices, I've hosted more than 500 meetings with constituents to hear about what's on their mind, and I've participated in more than 160 events with local businesses, schools, civic organizations, forums with constituents, or community resource centers. You can see all of these events using the map. In fact, I've supported more than 65 bills in the House of Representatives directly because of these important meetings -- that's about 1/3 of all the legislation I've cosponsored since taking office.

I'm inviting Iowa's veterans to attend a Library of Congress “Veterans History Project” event in honor of Veterans Day. The event will take place on November 9, 2018, from 8 a.m. – 4 p.m. at the Iowa Gold Star Military Museum in Johnston. The Veterans History Project collects and makes accessible firsthand interviews and narratives of United States military veterans from World War I through the present. Iowa's veterans are invited to contribute by participating in a 30-minute to an hour-long taped interview about their service in the military. If you are a veteran, or know a veteran, who is interested in participating, you can find more information here.  
  
President Trump’s decision to allow the year-round sale of E15 is a promise made and kept to farmers throughout rural America. Biofuels are a part of everyday life in Iowa, the top corn- and ethanol-producing state in the United States. In an op-ed I wrote with Senator Joni Ernst, we discuss the importance of ethanol and the Renewable Fuel Standard not only to Iowa and rural America, but also the nation’s economy and national security. 
  
No one buys a gallon of milk without knowing the price. Why should prescription drugs be any different? I applaud Health and Human Services Secretary Azar’s announcement to provide patients and their doctors with more information on prescription drug prices. This announcement follows my bipartisan work with Senator Durbin to support the Administration in advancing such a policy in recent legislation. Pharmaceutical companies must do more to provide transparency about prescription drug prices.
  
Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and I led a bipartisan group of senators in sending a letter to Assistant Secretary for Family Support Lynn Johnson, urging her to implement recommendations from a recent Health and Human Services report that would help foster children who have been prescribed psychotropic medications. It is critical that the Administration for Children and Families immediately take steps to ensure that states are providing treatment planning and monitoring to ensure that children are being prescribed psychotropic medications safely and appropriately.

October 19, 2018 
Dear friend,  This afternoon I was honored to join President Donald Trump, where he signed a Presidential Memorandum to improve storage and delivery of water in the Central Valley. My number one priority has always been to deliver more water to the Central Valley. This order will reduce regulatory burden to and promote more efficient environmental reviews of California water storage projects, ensuring that Valley farmers and residents have a supply of water for generations to come. I truly believe that bringing White House officials to the Valley to see firsthand the challenges we face was the catalyst for today’s announcement. This is the first time the administration has ever gotten personally involved in the California water crisis.  Last month I sent a letter to the White House asking the president to take immediate action to stop Sacramento’s radical water grab and address the future of Don Pedro Reservoir. This order directly addresses hydroelectric relicensing like what is currently happening at Don Pedro and requires agencies to consider local plans like the Tuolumne River Management Plan developed by Modesto and Turlock Irrigation Districts. This process has been held up by Sacramento Bureaucrats who are using the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to shut down hydropower generation and drastically increase flows on the Tuolumne River by essentially holding the Department of Energy, Department of Interior and Department of Agriculture hostage through the hydropower relicensing process as they try to flush large amounts of our usable water into the ocean. Earlier this year, I released an animated video on NMFS Sacramento’s dangerous power grab, which can be viewed here.   The president’s order also establishes timeliness for environmental reviews of infrastructure projects by creating a single federal authority to approve new water projects in support of the Central Valley Project. This will supplement my New WATER Act (H.R. 434), which will be signed into law as early as next week as part of  America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 and supports innovative financing opportunities for water projects throughout the western United States. Eligible projects include new reservoirs, below ground storage projects, recycling and desalination projects. This legislation supports large projects like enlargement of Shasta Dam, construction of Sites Reservoir and Temperance Flat Dam, and expanding Los Vaqueros Reservoir.  For more information about what I’m doing to fight for Valley water, visit Denham.house.gov/water.  Top Army Corps official visit addresses flood protection, Sacramento water grab Before I joined the president this morning, I met with Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Rickey “R.D.” James, who came out at my invitation to tour our federal levees and to discuss impacts of Sacramento’s water grab, the Waters of the United States definition, the recently passed Water Resources Development Act, regulations and permitting. The last time I visited this levee was in February 2017, when it breached. Now, federal funding has been secured and dirt is being moved to harden this life safety infrastructure.
￼ 
Stanislaus County pilot program looks to improve healthcare access Following 18 months of coordination with the California Medical Association (CMA) and the Stanislaus Medical Society, I’ve developed a pilot program through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to significantly improve access to healthcare for Medi-Cal patients in Stanislaus County. CMA’s executive board recently voted to proceed with the project. Nearly 45 percent of Stanislaus County residents are currently enrolled in Medi-Cal but face major barriers to timely care; low reimbursement rates in the state of California have made it difficult for Valley physicians to see more Medi-Cal patients. My pilot program will field-test the best Medicaid reimbursement strategies to incentivize more physicians to operate in areas with a high population of Medicaid enrollees, like California’s Central Valley. This is the only model of its kind and is structured to be scalable for other communities with similar challenges across the Valley and the nation. Access is the biggest healthcare problem we have in the Central Valley. This project will improve physician reimbursement rates and bring more doctors and better care to our community.  To read my full press release on this announcement, click here, and to review the full proposal, click here.   Human trafficking roundtable seeks to end Yesterday I hosted a roundtable on human trafficking prevention in Modesto. Attendees included Rescue:Freedom, the CA Travel Association and Hilton Hotels. In addition, an official from the Department of Homeland Security briefed the group on the department’s anti-trafficking campaigns (the Blue Campaign) and what federal resources are available to local organizations.  This event was a follow-up to my August roundtable, from which attendees left with better knowledge about how they can help combat human trafficking. One example of resulting action came from the ride-share company Uber, which, as a result of discussions with other attendees, implemented new best practices with their 1,400 active driver partners in the 10th congressional district. Drivers now have a more prominent feature within the help section of their driver app to access resources such as the National Human Trafficking Hotline, and victims can now get out of a dangerous situation and to a safe place nearby by connecting with local organizations to arrange and dispatch rides, in real time, regardless of whether the rider has a smartphone.  More human traffickers are caught in California than any other state. We must turn this tide. I’m proud to be able to bring together leaders from across our community to find solutions and deliver results. 
￼
Local vets honored by Library of Congress, 21 new Veterans History Project videos submitted On Tuesday, I hosted a reception at the Manteca VFW Hall to honor the 32 veterans who shared their stories of service as part of the Library of Congress Veterans History Project. Karen Lloyd, director of the Veterans History Project for the Library of Congress, was present to accept the most recent installment of 21 videos and meet the Central Valley veterans featured in them. As a veteran myself, it’s been an honor sitting down to hear these stories from local men and women who have worn the cloth of this nation. This event was about saying “thank you.” To view all of my #TVT tributes, click here. For photos from the event, click here.

Dear Lindsey, 

October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month and last week I had the honor ‪to join fighters and survivors of breast cancer at the 7th Annual Compton Walk for a Cure. Many thanks to Compton City Councilwoman Janna Zurita and Compton Unified School District Vice President Satra D. Zurita for uniting our community and ensuring that those with this disease, never have to walk alone.

Together, we can defeat breast cancer. 

In Community,

Join Congresswoman Barragán at CalEITC4Me's 2018 Women’s Economic Empowerment Summit on October 25th!
￼ 
How can we reverse these trends and break down the barriers that keep women off the path to stability, upward mobility, and long-term prosperity in our Golden State? CalEITC4Me, a statewide campaign initiated by Golden State Opportunity Foundation, began as a leader in the effort to bring awareness to the California Earned Income Tax Credit (Cal EITC) and other benefits that put more money in the pockets of working families throughout California.
 
I'm honored to be a featured speaker at CalEITC4Me's 2018 Women's Economic Empowerment Summit on Thursday, October 25th from 8:30AM - 2:30PM at the South Gate Municipal Auditorium (4900 Southern Ave, South Gate, CA 90280). I'll be joining more than 150 leaders in the fight against poverty to discuss smart policy solutions like my legislation to expand the earned income tax credit that can lift women out of poverty and break open the doors of opportunity.

The event is free and open to the public. To register for the event, click here.

                                                  Dear Friends,  President Trump today signed a presidential memorandum that will significantly improve California's water supply, particularly in the San Joaquin Valley. The president's action will remove bureaucratic obstacles to improving the water supply and speed up the completion of new biological opinions that will enable more water to be directed toward Valley farmers, families, and communities. Having watched the Valley's water crisis deepen for many years, I can say this is the most meaningful presidential action on the issue in decades.   Along with other Republican congressmen, I joined President Trump for the signing ceremony. To watch video of the signing, click on the image below.   ￼     To watch video of my remarks at the signing, click on the image below.    ￼    Sincerely,  ￼   Devin Nunes Member of Congress  Pleases note that this account does not accept incoming messages.

This Week in GA-6  
This week was spent meeting with constituents across the district, getting feedback about how Washington can work better for you, and how the revved up economy is impacting hard-working families. 
Second Lady Karen Pence also visited the 6th District, and we stopped by Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. We met several remarkable children and learned how art and music therapies are making a difference for these courageous young fighters. Check out a few pictures from our visit and from other events across the district this week.

Central American Caravan Headed towards the US
Several thousand potential illegal immigrants have traveled through Central America hoping to cross into Mexico and eventually into the United States. While the Administration has taken swift action to thwart this event, we can't rely on help from other countries to protect our borders. I’m encouraged by the actions of our Administration in coordination with Mexico. We must keep the immigrants from illegally entering our country and abusing resources that are meant for our citizens and those here legally. 

￼
 

Packages Overseas Subsidy Termination Act

This week the Administration announced it is withdrawing the United States from the Universal Postal Union, ending postal subsidies that cost Americans millions of dollars and lost jobs. Currently, it's cheaper to ship a package from China to Dallas, than from Dallas to Ft. Worth. Under the new system, Americans will no longer pay higher shipping rates to subsidize inbound international packages. Americans should never have shouldered this expensive burden so foreign suppliers can inexpensively ship their goods, hurting American businesses. Additionally, the United States Postal Service (USPS) is a major gateway for the import of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids from China. Eliminating these subsidies will restore fair pricing for foreign suppliers, decreasing the number of packages and providing less opportunity for importing narcotics. This announcement achieves the same goals as my bill, H.R. 5524, the POST Act, and I look forward to working with the administration to implement this new system.

Coppell High School named Best Student Newscast in the Country

Coppell High School was named the best student run newscast in the nation yesterday by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS).  As part of a country wide student awards production, Coppell High School's newscast bested 200 other students from 19 regional chapters that advanced to the national competition. Coppell was representing the Lone Star Emmy Chapter, which includes the entire state of Texas. I'm honored to represent Coppell High School in Congress and commend the hard work by our exemplary students.

National Breast Cancer Awareness Month
October is National Breast Cancer Awareness month. Providing an opportunity to raise awareness and bring attention to the most common cancer among women worldwide. Breast cancer has been steadily declining since 1990, with early detection and improved treatment options playing a major role, but more can be done. On average, every 2 minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer and over 3.3 million breast cancer survivors are living in the United States today. I'm encouraged to see institutions in our community providing potential life saving cost free services, click the link below to read more:  Local hospital provides no cost health education events and mammograms

Deregulation Drives Growth and Cuts Costs
In fiscal year 2018 alone, the Administration saved American businesses and families $23 billion by cutting costly and unnecessary bureaucratic red tape. Eliminating 12 regulations for every one created, deregulation has cut costs for small businesses, freeing up resources to create more jobs and raise wages and benefits. Investing in our workforce and stifling big government intervention has allowed companies to provide better products and services, giving new life to all aspects of business operations. We need to continue cutting expensive and draconian regulations that stifle growth and expansion for our small businesses.

Honoring National Civil Rights Museum Freedom Award Winners 
￼ 
On Wednesday, I attended the National Civil Rights Museum’s Freedom Award Student Forum and helped honor “Keeper of the Dream” student winners Sarah Rosenthal of Germantown Middle School, Timmy Becton Jr. of Douglass High School, Xinya (Cindy) Tan of White Station High School and Cameron Jones of Marion High School in Arkansas as well as the Bridge Builders cohort of Caitlin Robinson from the Hutchison School, Lakia Coakley from Middle College High School, Aaliyah James from Overton High School, Elena Matadefrom Bellevue Middle School and Aniya Mull from Soulsville Charter School. They are keeping the dream alive. 
That night, I attended the NCRM’s Freedom Awards and saw former Vice President Joe Biden, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and Memphis entrepreneur and philanthropist J.R. “Pitt” Hyde honored for their lives of public service. Biden told the crowd at The Orpheum Theater that we are living through “a battle for the soul of this nation.” The 27th awards ceremony was infused with the music of the late, great Memphis native Aretha Franklin, who passed awayin August, and whose grandchildren were in the audience. Fifty years after the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and of Senator Robert Kennedy, on whose staff Biden was working in 1968, it was an especially moving and memorable evening.  
Demanding Answers from Big PHARMA on Drug Prices 
On Monday, I joined 15 colleagues in sending letters to the CEOs of five large pharmaceutical companies that benefit from corporate tax breaks and publicly funded research, demanding answers to the problem of soaring prescription drug prices. The five corporations to which we wrote – Amgen, AbbVie, Eli Lilly, Merck and Pfizer – each benefitted from last year’s GOP tax bill with windfall tax cuts. We want to know why, despite receiving massive amounts of U.S. taxpayer support, the companies are charging prices that place life-saving medications out of the reach of many Americans. We also asked if they had discontinued any drugs in development and, for those companies scaling back employment in their research divisions, what business factors affected those decisions. We concluded the letters by asking how much their top executives are getting paid. I will continue to press this issue and get answers on these important public policy issues. 
Pressing Shelby County Elections Officials for Answers 
Today, when I went to vote I was disturbed to learn that the voting booth large screen format that I chose does not follow the law in terms of how the candidates’ names are placed on the ballot.  Tennessee law requires that the names of the major parties’ candidates be listed first and second and then independent (non-party affiliated) candidates listed after. When I chose the large screen format, I discovered that the second major party candidate’s name doesn’t even appear on the first page of the large format.  I have contacted the Shelby County Election Commission as well as Secretary of State Tre Hargett to express my concern.   It is the duty of election officials to ensure that ballots are in order as required by law before the first voter steps into the booth, and that federal voting rights are protected.   
Earlier in the week,  Iwas disappointedwhen it became clear that 24,000 pending voter registration applications in Shelby County still had not been processed even as Early Voting for the Midterms got under way. That, combined with the Shelby County Election Commission’s assertion last week that 55 percent of the voter applications it had received were invalid, raise critical questions. As a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, whose jurisdiction includes oversight compliance with theVoting Rights Act, I believe this matter is serious. We have an ugly history in this country of voter suppression, especially against prospective African American voters. We need to ensure that all who have the right to vote have that right upheld in this election. I havewritten to the commission and am continuing to press for answers.  
Noting the Local Impact of DNA Evidence in Solving Crime 
This week, welearned about the recent use of DNA evidence to win a conviction against the perpetrator of an 18-year-old rape that occurred in southwest Memphis. That evidence was finally tested 12 years after the crime occurred. DNA analysis is a powerful tool to bring about justice, but that doesn’t happen when rape kit evidence sits on shelves untested. I have amended multiple House bills to increase funding to for rape kit analysis to address a shameful nationwide backlog. Since 2014, my amendments have increased funding for the Department of Justice’s Sexual Assault Kit Initiative (SAKI) by 36 percent. Congress must continue to provide funding to ensure that all rape kits get tested and all perpetrators are brought to justice. I commend the prosecutors in Memphis for their persistence. 
Attending Swearing In of Juvenile Court Magistrate Alycia Carter Chism 
￼ 
On Wednesday, I attended the swearing in of Alycia Carter Chism as a Magistrate for the Memphis and Shelby County Juvenile Court. Alycia Carter was my first associate district director and counselin my Congressional office and I was proud to recommend her to Judge Dan Michael. The Magistrate said her black robe is not just black garment but a symbol of responsibility, and she pledged to handle every child who appears before her with care, dignity and respect. She will do us proud. 
Visiting Crosstown High School Students 
￼  
On Monday, I visited with the 9th grade students of Crosstown High School and came away impressed with their zeal for learning and their knowledgeable questions.These bright young people are our future, and I look forward to watchingtheir progress. 
Talking with Students at Memphis Business Academy 
￼ 
Also Monday, I visited teacher Justin Cole’s class in the auditorium of the Memphis Business Academy and talked with students about the importance of their roles as U.S. citizens, the need for criminal justice reform, public investment in college education and immigration reform. The students asked smart questions. They are a dedicated group and should go far. 
Reading about Visit with 9th Congressional District Midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy  
My visit with 9th Congressional District midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy, which I mentioned in last week’s newsletter, was the subject of a story last Saturday in The Daily Memphian. See it here.  
Holding “Congress On Your Corner” Next Friday 
As your representative in Congress, part of my job is making sure your concerns and issues with federal agencies and federal benefits are dealt with fairly and expeditiously. My office will be on hand Friday to help you with Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits and military service issues, Small Business Administration (SBA) loans and services, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) home loans, federal grant applications, visa and passports, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issues and more. When: Friday, October 26, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.. Where: The Parkway Village Branch Library, 4655 Knight Arnold Roadin Memphis.    
Inviting Vets to My Annual Veterans Day Event 

￼ 
Words cannot adequately express the gratitude a grateful nation owes its military veterans for their dedication to our country and the sacrifices they have made. My annual Veterans Day gatheringis a time to thank them and their families and enjoy some barbecue while we discuss veterans issues. My 10th Annual Veterans Day Meeting and BarbecueLuncheon will be held on Monday, November 12, from noon to 2 p.m. at the Kroc Center of Memphis – Hardin Hall, 800 East Parkway South. Vets please RSVP by Thursday, November 8 at (901) 544-4131.

Weekly Health Tip 
￼ 
District staffer Patti Marsh participates in earthquake drill 
Each week, I share a health tip in the hope of promoting a healthy lifestyle for residents of the 9th Congressional District. As always, it is best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine or lifestyle. 
More than 3 million people across the Central U.S., including the staff in my Memphis office, participated in Thursday’s “Great Central U.S. Shakeout” earthquake disaster drill. Our region is particularly susceptible to serious earthquakes like the ones that shook the New Madrid Fault Line running from Marked Tree, Arkansas, to Cairo, Illinois, in 1811 and 1812, and created Reelfoot Lake when the Mississippi River ran backwards for a while. Those quakes rang church bells in Boston and collapsed chimneys for hundreds of miles in all directions. There are very useful resources from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s “Earthquake Safety Checklist” (tips: update emergency contacts and learn how to shut off gas lines and purify water) and from the web page of the drill this week to help you prepare for an earthquake and plan ahead to make sure your shelter will be resilient. It’s always time to prepare  for “the Big One.” 
Quotes of the Week  
￼ 
“America’s ability to lead the world depends not just on the example of our power, but on the power of our example.” – Former Vice President Joe Biden, “Reclaiming America’s Values,” The New York Times, September 14, 2017. 
“Forces we thought we had buried, fights we thought we had won -- they're lashing back once again, testing our humanity, our decency, with the same old tactics that represent one of the oldest most insidious forces in America.” – Former Vice President Joe Biden after receiving this year’s National Civil Rights Museum Freedom Award Wednesday.  
Two Tigers teams meet in Memphis-Missouri game Saturday. Go Memphis!

Discussing the Importance of NY Waterways 
We are fortunate to have many dedicated community members who work tirelessly to preserve our waterways for communities upstream and the millions of downstream residents, small businesses, and habitats impacted by our actions on a daily basis. I had the ability to participate in the Choose Clean Water Coalition Upper Susquehanna Forum at SUNY Oneonta yesterday and speak to many local advocates about the importance of a healthy watershed to our local economies and to our environment.
In Congress, I have made protecting our outdoor spaces and local waterways a top priority. I recently supported an appropriations bill that provided over $70 million for the Chesapeake Bay Program. This program seeks to protect the bay and its watershed, which extends all the way up to our district in Upstate New York. As I reaffirmed yesterday, I will continue to reach across the aisle to coordinate on bipartisan initiatives and policies that safeguard our environment.

Celebrating CRMC's New Generator
I visited Catskill Regional Medical Center earlier this week to celebrate the installation of their new, state-of-the-art, fuel efficient generator. Through my efforts working with hospital officials and FEMA, I was able to help CRMC secure a grant to cover 75% of the generator’s purchase and installation costs. CRMC had been seeking this funding since Hurricane Sandy hit in 2012. The generator will allow the hospital to continue to provide life-saving care to the community through flooding and other emergencies.
￼


Benefiting the Arkell Museum through Farm-Fresh Food
I attended the Harvest Feast to benefit the Arkell Museum in Canajoharie, which featured some great locally grown, farm-fresh food. The museum is dedicated to preserving the rich history, culture, and art of the Mohawk Valley. Given their unwavering commitment to the community, I have formally nominated the Arkell Museum for the Institute of Museum and Library Services National Medal for Museum and Library Service.  Thank you to the museum's Executive Director Suzan Friedlander and Library Director Hannah Stahl for showing pieces from the Portraits and Landscapes Collection – they were magnificent. 
You can learn more about the Arkell Museum here: http://www.arkellmuseum.org/
￼


Joining Seniors at Columbia Co. Golden Gathering
I joined area seniors at New York State Senator Kathy Marchione’s Golden Gathering in Columbia County. This event was open to local seniors and allowed them to connect with programs, organizations, and benefits that are available to them. I had the privilege of co-hosting a table for attendees to sign Christmas cards for our troops.
Our Upstate seniors have spent years building and contributing to our communities – it was great meeting and speaking with many of them. If you, or a senior you know, is experiencing difficulties with a federal agency, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Social Security Administration, my office may be able to help. Feel free to call my Kinderhook District Office at (518) 610-8133 to speak with a caseworker.

Antiquated Scaffold Law Continues to Drive Up Costs
New York's outdated Scaffold Law added between $200 and $400 million to the cost of the new Gov. Mario Cuomo Bridge. It is estimated that each year we spend an extra $785 million to cover increased insurance premiums on construction projects in our state. This money that could be going toward building roads or bridges is instead going to artificially high insurance costs. Reform is needed now, and that is why I have introduced legislation that requires projects that use federal taxpayer dollars to have the exact same liability standards used by 49 other states.
You can read more about the impact this wasteful law has on the costs associated with construction in New York State here: https://bit.ly/2NT7dz2

More information on my bill to change the federal liability standard, H.R. 3808, can be found here: https://bit.ly/2xN4DXB

Honoring Eagle Scout Christopher
Attaining the rank of Eagle Scout is no easy feat – it takes time, dedication, and a commitment to one’s community. I had the privilege of joining Christopher at his Eagle Scout Court of Honor on Sunday. His Eagle Scout project consisted of making a sign for the Town of Kingston and the Sawkill Fire Department as well as constructing a stone wall and flower beds. Congratulations, Christopher!  
￼

Touring Cricket Valley Energy Center
Thank you to the team at Cricket Valley Energy Center (CVEC) in Dover for showing me around. It was great talking with many of the workers and being able to witness the significant construction progress of the facility. CVEC is a 1,100 MW natural gas power plant on a 193-acre site. 
CVEC will provide countless economic benefits to our region, from offering low-cost electricity to creating good-paying jobs and generating valuable tax revenue for the Town of Dover and the surrounding areas.

Supporting Increased Mental Health Funding 
Mental health has been a top priority for me during my time in Congress. I have supported over $1.5 billion in funding for various programs to help support the mental health of our veterans and children and to assist communities more effectively identify and treat mental illness.  The $120,000 grant awarded to HealthAlliance Hospital to increase awareness of mental health in the Kingston area is only one of many steps the government has taken to put more emphasis on treating mental illness and to better equip our local schools, hospitals, and local officials to support the overall mental health of our communities.   Read more about the funding HealthAlliance recently received from the federal government here: https://bit.ly/2J3Bo5w

Helping our Seniors
Last year, I met with Greene County Senior Corps RSVP volunteers and participated in their Meals on Wheels program. Meals on Wheels is an invaluable program that helps our senior neighbors. I assisted on a bipartisan effort this year to increase funding for the Older Americans Act to Provide Access to In-Home and Nutrition Services, including Meals on Wheels. As a result of our advocacy we were able to obtain an increase to the program that funds Meals on Wheels in the appropriations bill my colleagues and I recently voted on in the House.  In 2017, Meals on Wheels served over 22 million meals to New York seniors alone. Balanced and healthy eating keeps seniors secure in their own homes and in their communities. I will continue to support this great program, and thank you to all the dedicated volunteers who help deliver nutritious meals throughout our Upstate communities.  Read the bipartisan letter my colleagues and I sent advocating for robust funding for the Older Americans Act, including the Meals on Wheels program: https://bit.ly/2J6BKsh

Taking Action to Stop International Drug Trafficking through the U.S. Postal Service
According to the Postal Service Office of Inspector General, “Online drug traffickers typically send packages via a shipping provider, including the Postal Service, and have become familiar enough with the postal network to exploit it.”
The Postal Service Office of Inspector General recently released a report on illicit drug distribution through the postal network. This report underscores the serious loopholes in the U.S. Postal Service that are being used by nefarious drug traffickers to push deadly drugs through our borders and into our communities.   The STOP Act, a bill I advocated for in the House that is soon to become law, would thwart this practice by requiring advanced electronic tracking data on international packages being relayed through the U.S. Postal Service. This way, law enforcement will know where packages are coming from, where they are going, and what their contents are. The STOP Act will have a real impact in stemming the ongoing opioid crisis in communities throughout New York and across the country.

News from Representative Bustos 
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
Grants Resource Fair 
￼
Congresswoman Bustos greeting attendees at her Grants Resource Fair 
Yesterday, I held my second Grants Resource Fair with special guest State Representative Mike Halpin. It was great to meet all of the local non-profits and government agencies who came out to learn more about the application process for state and federal grants. I’m pleased so many folks joined us and took advantage of the tools and resources our state and federal agencies have to offer. If you are interested in learning more or would like to apply for a grant, please do not hesitate to contact my office for support along the way. Click here to see more. 
Protecting Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid 
￼
Congresswoman Bustos visiting with residents of Langman Apartments this morning 
Today, I visited Langman Apartments in Milan to meet with residents and listen to their concerns regarding Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. It was a pleasure to meet so many folks and listen to all the experiences and stories they had to share. It’s clear just how important these programs are to so many people, which is why I’ll continue to fight to protect them. Especially after Washington Republicans once again expressed their desire to cut them this week to offset budget deficits created by the GOP Tax Scam. Instead, I’ve helped Democrats develop a plan that would lower healthcare costs and tackle the rising price of prescription drugs. See more from my visit here. 
To keep up on the work that I am doing to fight for the hardworking families of Illinois, make sure to stay connected with me @RepCheri!

Opening Close Up Summit. About 80 students took part in the three-day Close Up Youth Summit this week, identifying issues of concern to our community and brainstorming policy responses. In Congress we budgeted $900,000 for Close Up this year, to pay for the summit and for students to spend two weeks on the mainland learning about their power and responsibility as citizens. I opened the summit on Tuesday thanking the students for recognizing their new, adult role in determining how to make life better for all of us.

GDP up 25.1 percent. Gross Domestic Product in the Northern Marianas increased 25.1 percent in 2017, the sixth straight year of growth.

GDP: a worthwhile investment

Gross Domestic Product in the Northern Marianas increased 25.1 percent in 2017, the sixth straight year of growth. The Director of the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Dr. Brian C. Moyer (pictured above), briefed me shortly before the public release on Thursday. Congress provides $750,000 to pay for production of the annual economic data. The funding covers American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Marianas. GDP is the sum of goods and services produced in a territory, state, or nation over a given period of time and is a primary means of gauging economic health. GDP is also invaluable in policy decision-making. To pass the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act, for instance, one of my key talking points was the conclusion by the Government Accountability Office that ending the CW program would cut GDP by 26 to 62 percent. That was language that everyone understood. Director Moyer and I also discussed where to take the program next. Quarterly reports may be a development to consider in future.
￼
￼

Let’s Read! Rota. As part of my on-going “Let’s Read!” initiative, I delivered a total of 50 boxes of books to Sinapalo Elementary School, Dr. Rita H. Inos Junior-Senior High School, Eskuelan San Francisco de Borja, and Antonio Camacho Atalig Memorial Library. Your congressional office has hand-selected over 50,000 books and I will continue to deliver them to eager readers. Thanks to the students, teachers, librarians, and principals for their warm welcome. 
￼

Emergency food aid for Rota

Up to 643 Rota households may be eligible for emergency food assistance and up to 103 existing food stamp recipients may get supplemental aid under the federal Disaster Nutrition Assistance Program. In a letter dated October 16, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service informed Governor Torres that the agency has approved D-NAP for Rota families affected by Typhoon Mangkhut. Only people who lived or worked in Rota on September 9 are eligible. Benefits will be based on household size. The CNMI Department of Community and Cultural Affairs will accept applications from October 22 to 26, between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. at the Rota Youth Center in Sinapalo. Rota residents who were displaced by the typhoon can apply during the same five-day window at the CNMI NAP office in Saipan or at the DCCA office at the San Jose Public Gymnasium in Tinian.
￼

￼

National Principal Shadowing Week. Principal Leila Staffler led me on a “power walk-through” of Kagman High School on Thursday, visiting classrooms, observing teachers, talking to students, and generally assessing the quality of learning taking place in her school -- all while taking notes with an app on her smartphone. I am impressed! Principals across the nation hosted elected officials in their schools this week to give us a firsthand look at the challenges and opportunities school leaders face, and the impact of education policy on students. For instance, I got to see how students are using laptops purchased with funding I included for Marianas schools in Section 1014 of the Every Student Succeeds Act, P.L. 114-95. Thank you, Ms. Staffler, for the warm welcome and the eye-opening visit. 
￼

Unforgiven: righting student loans

Along with 116 Democratic colleagues in the House and 36 in the Senate, I demanded answers from Education Secretary Betsy DeVos this week and a quick resolution to her Department’s mishandling of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. For graduates, who work full-time for a government or not-for-profit organization, the PSLF program is supposed to write off the balance of their federal direct student loans after 120 qualifying monthly payments. Public servants with student debt first became eligible for the loan forgiveness in September 2017, and over 28,000 individuals have applied. But Department data released in September 2018 show that only 96 borrowers were approved—a denial rate of 99.6 percent. And a report by the Government Accountability Office sharply criticized the department for mismanagement. The Trump administration must act quickly to ensure that all qualified teachers, first responders, and other public servants, who have worked for ten years expecting loan forgiveness, get what the law requires.
￼
￼

If you served, register! Our Veterans Registration Drive continues this weekend and next at Joeten Superstore in Susupe. The more veterans we get registered, the better our chances that the feasibility study I included in the VA MISSION Act will recommend a VA-staffed Community-Based Outpatient Clinic, or CBOC, for Marianas veterans. Your congressional staff and the CNMI Office of Military and Veterans Affairs office will be there at the registration table from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. to answer any questions you may have about benefits.

$131k for outdoor recreation plan

The Commonwealth Department of Land and Natural Resources has been awarded a $131,162 Land and Water Conservation Fund grant to update the State Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan, the National Park Service announced on Tuesday. DLNR will use the grant to pay for technical assistance refresh the plan for the Northern Marianas from 2019 to 2024.

Dear  , 
I would like to provide you with the following updates from this past week.   
￼
Congressman Courtney touring CNC Software INC with CEO Meghan West
Visiting Submarine Suppliers in Northcentral Connecticut  
This week I had a chance to visit two great Eastern Connecticut companies that supply the Virginia-class program at Electric Boat. They are just two of the more than 400 Connecticut companies that participate in the supply chain, fueling work at the shipyard in Groton.   
First, I visited Willington Nampleate is a family owned business in Stafford Springs, and their plating products provide a non-corrosive method of identification for submarine systems that ensure safe operation. Thanks to the CEO at Willington Nameplate Mike Goepfert for showing me around. Next, I headed over to CNC Software INC in Tolland, a company with nearly 200 employees, that sells software programs to hundreds of customers including defense firms such as General Dynamics Electric Boat and Lockheed Martin. I took a tour of their enormous facility with CEO Meghan West. Their products are essential of the Virginia-class program. They serve a necessary function for our national security by securing the onboard computer systems of one of the most complex platforms in the U.S. Navy.   
These companies are just two examples of the hundreds of exciting and innovative companies in our district and across the state that are growing alongside the increase in submarine production at Electric Boat. As Ranking Member of the Seapower subcommittee, I will continue to continue to fight for shipbuilding right here in Eastern Connecticut.  
￼
Courtney and Larson Announce Major Development for Crumbling Foundations  
On Tuesday, Congressman John Larson and I announced a brand-new tax clarification from the IRS which will provide relief for middle-class homeowners with crumbling foundations. The IRS clarification will allow homeowners to “carry forward” or “carry back” a net operating loss should their casualty loss exceed their income. This clarification means that even if the net loss suffered by a homeowner exceeds their annual federal tax liability, they can carry forward that loss for up to 20 years and can carry back for two years. This development is going to have significant implications for middle-class homeowners whose repair costs exceed their annual income.  
This clarification builds on the critical development that Congressman Larson and I announced last year that the IRS would allow homeowners to claim a casualty loss on their 2017 tax returns to recoup the costs of repairing a home foundation. This announcement is the result of more than two years of work we have done with the IRS to secure this critical tax deduction for homeowners in our state. We are grateful for the continued attention of the IRS and Treasury Department to this crisis in Connecticut, and the support they have provided today to homeowners struggling with the damage caused by crumbling foundations. Also, we are grateful to have had the support of the Connecticut Society of Certified Public Accountants and their Executive Director, Bonnie Stewart, in this effort. 
Our work is not done, and we will continue to work with officials at every level of government to solve the crisis of crumbling foundations in our state.

Gemma E. Moran United Way Food Center Celebrates 30 Years of Service 
I joined the 30-year anniversary celebration of the Gemma E. Moran United Way Food Center in New London last week. During that time, the food center has helped prevent thousands of people from going hungry. The festivities included honoring Gemma Moran who has dedicated her life to helping those in need and ending hunger in our community. We were also joined by dozens of volunteers including a group of new hires, from Electric Boat who came out to do their part to contribute to the community. These women represent a new wave of skilled labor joining our local companies big and small as shipbuilding and submarine production continues to expand. All in all, it was a truly magnificent event, and I would like to thank United Way, Gemma Moran, and all the community partners and volunteers who made it possible. 
I hope you enjoyed this snapshot of my work, and as always thank you for taking a moment to read my weekly update. If you have any questions or concerns about the information in this newsletter, you can contact me through my website or by calling my Norwich district office at 860-886-0139.   
Have a great weekend,

NEWS FROM THE FIRST DISTRICT
Dear Friends,                                  
I visited Gilford High School to see all the innovative work teachers and the principal are doing to educate our students. I also enjoyed talking to the students! 
I sent a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Kirsten Nielsen asking her to resign. Her department’s treatment of children has been unconscionable and one of the darkest moments in our history. 
Visiting Gilford High School 
It was a pleasure to visit Gilford High School this morning, and to see all the innovative work being done to enhance the educational experience for Gilford students. School principals and teachers across our state are working hard to help our students succeed and to ensure that they have access to high quality education. Today’s visit was an opportunity to highlight the good work that our principals and teachers are doing, and to recognize Gilford High School for its efforts to innovate in the classroom. Schools in New Hampshire and across the country need more resources to improve school infrastructure and the classroom environment, and it’s important that both the state and federal governments provide more funding for our public schools.
￼ 
Calling for new sanctions on Saudi Arabia and asking what the US knew before the Saudi operation to murder Jamal Khashoggi 
This week, I sent a letter to Office of National Intelligence Director Dan Coats asking him what the US knew about potential Saudi plans to silence Jamal Khashoggi. I am deeply concerned that the Trump Administration has yet to address this egregious violation of human rights by the Saudi Crown Prince with the seriousness that it demands. We must sanction Saudi Arabia in response to this brazen attack, and I support ending arms sales to the Kingdom. 
Calling on DHS Secretary Nielsen to resign 
I signed a letter this week to Secretary Nielsen once again urging her to resign. In our letter, several Members of Congress wrote, “We formally request that you resign as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). You are responsible for the unimaginable trauma of thousands of children across the United States. From the children torn from their parents at the border, to Dreamers facing exile from their home, and to the U.S. citizen children who face losing a parent to deportation; your actions continue to wreak havoc on communities across this nation. In order to restore our values and the public’s trust in the DHS, we demand your resignation and urge the reversal of the policies implemented at DHS and DOJ designed to destroy families.”
Announcing $800K in funding for trauma support services to help children exposed to substance misuse 
On Thursday, the Congressional Delegation announced that the US Department of Justice has awarded the City of Manchester with nearly $800,000 to improve a project that provides services to children exposed to trauma, including substance misuse, domestic violence, and sexual assault. 
Children who are dealing with traumatic experiences deserve all the help we can provide. Our communities need more funding to help vulnerable children when the opioid epidemic or violence at home disrupts their lives. The Manchester Police Department’s Adverse Childhood Experiences Response Team (ACERT) Enhancement Project plays an important role in this effort by offering services that support young victims who have experienced trauma, and I am pleased that it will be getting this significant federal funding. Congress must keep working to ensure our communities have all the tools they need to protect children in the midst of this devastating epidemic.
New funding headed to UNH for Aquaculture Programs 
This week, I announced that UNH has received $747,673 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the NOAA Sea Grant 2018 Aquaculture Initiative. The funding will support a UNH project that seeks to boost U.S. seafood production. The project will specifically include workshops on farming steelhead trout and blue mussels. In August, I had a great time visiting Virgin Oyster Company, which has been working with Sea Grant to sustainably farm oysters in Little Bay. 
From supporting oyster farmers to helping fishermen sustainably harvest their products, New Hampshire’s Sea Grant program continues to bring tremendous benefit to our Seacoast economy. Congratulations to my alma mater UNH, to Dr. Chapman, and to the entire Sea Grant partnership on receiving this funding. It has been a privilege to support the Sea Grant program in Congress, and I look forward to seeing it continue to thrive and help our state’s fishermen and businesses. 
Calling on Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to address her department’s failure to faithfully implement the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program 
A new Government Accountability Office (GAO) report has revealed that an alarming number of public service loan forgiveness (PSLF) borrowers have been denied the loan forgiveness they are entitled to. Under this program, student loan borrowers can have their loans forgiven over many years if they pursue work in public service. 
This week, I joined Democratic Members of Congress in writing to Secretary DeVos. “Consumer advocates, state regulators, Members of Congress, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and GAO have all repeatedly raised alarms about the Department’s handling of the PSLF program,” we wrote in our letter. “Not only has this Administration ignored the mounting warning signs…but it has actively reduced oversight of student loan servicers—thereby contributing to the current problems in student loan servicing.”
“We are deeply troubled that millions of dedicated public servants may not obtain the loan forgiveness that they deserve if the Department does not act quickly to correct program implementation issues.”  
Visiting the New Hampshire Farm Museum 
I had a great time at the New Hampshire Farm Museum in Milton! Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the museum showcases the historic Jones farmhouse and Plummer Homestead. 
Closing thoughts 
I am proud that I just received a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign’s Congressional Scorecard! I will never stop fighting for LGBTQ communities. One of my proudest moments was helping to repeal Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, and it’s been wonderful to see LGBTQ rights move forward the last decade. Now we need to protect the progress made.

10/19/18 18:18,Crucial reminder:,"￼ 
Hi Lindsey – I wanted to send a quick and crucial reminder. Have you had your flu shot yet?

As a doctor and the former Chief Medical Officer of Sacramento County, I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to get your flu shot. It’s the single best way to protect yourself and the ones you love from the flu. The Centers for Disease Control recommend that anyone who is six months old and older should receive a flu shot once a year. 

If you haven’t gotten your flu shot yet, there’s still time. Sacramento County’s Department of Health and Human Services is hosting free, public flu clinics.

Please click here to learn more about upcoming flu clinics near you.

￼
I got my flu shot today. Have you had yours?

You can also call (916) 875-SHOT (7468) to learn more or to ask a question.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, flu symptoms can occur suddenly and may include fever, muscle and body aches, cough, and sore throat. Though most people generally recover in a couple weeks, the flu is a serious disease that leads to thousands of American deaths every year.

If you haven't already gotten your flu shot, please don't delay. And remember - you can help stop the spread of germs by washing your hands and staying home if you're sick.

Be well,
￼
Ami Bera, M.D.

October 19, 2018
 
 
 Dear Friend,   Earlier this week Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blamed our country’s growing deficit on Social Security and Medicare. He refused to acknowledge that the massive tax cut he and fellow Republicans passed for the richest Americans contributed to the financial predicament we now face.  Social Security and Medicare are programs that hard-working Americans earned, and just days after making false claims about these programs, Senator McConnell doubled down by saying Republicans will keep trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. If they succeed, they will take away protections for 130 million people with pre-existing conditions, raise health care costs, impose an age tax on older Americans, and eliminate access to coverage for millions of working people.  Democrats remain committed to fighting for the people by working to protect access to affordable health care, lower prescription drug prices, and ensure retirement security. We will pass a tax cut for the middle class rather than working on behalf of special interests that fund Republican campaigns.  COASTAL STATES  This week I participated in the Annual Fall Coastal States Organization membership meeting. It was great to join leaders and advocates from other states to discuss the importance of working together to protect our coastal communities, resources, and economies.  While coastal counties in the United States make up less than 10% of the total U.S. land area, they are home to a significant portion of our country’s population - 40% or 125 million people.  And coastal counties make up an important part of our economy. In Rhode Island, the coastal economy supports more than 240,000 jobs and generates more than $17 billion annually.   Recognizing the significance of coastal communities, their economic impact, and how important their existence is to such a large portion of our population is incredibly important.   That’s why in Congress I’ve been proud to work on preserving natural resources and waterways, and remain committed to combating the effects of climate change and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.   This year, I lead the New England Delegation in the House in signing on to the New England Coastal Protection Act, which would prohibit the expansion of oil and gas drilling off the coast from Maine to Connecticut.   And I will continue to advocate for strong funding for the Southern New England Estuaries Program.  We have a responsibility to ourselves and future generations to be responsible stewards of the environment.   Too many Republicans in Congress along with the Trump administration are beholden to fossil fuel companies and working in the interest of big corporations and not the American people they represent.   In Congress, I will continue fighting for the values we share as champions of the environment.  RHODE ISLAND SEA GRANT   This week I was proud to announce along with the rest of our state’s congressional delegation an award of $745,815 through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to the Rhode Island Sea Grant program at the University of Rhode Island. This award will support a training curriculum for entry-level aquaculture workers in our state. Federal work-training investments like this help create good-paying jobs and allow potential employees to gain critical skills needed for this industry.  Aquaculture is an important industry in the Ocean State and has grown drastically over the past several years. This federal investment will help close a skills gap and allow more people to get good jobs in this expanding industry.  INVESTING IN OUR CHILDREN  I was glad I got to join so many Rhode Islanders at Children’s Friend’s annual Investing in Our Children luncheon today. Children’s Friend is our state’s oldest child welfare agency and provides extremely caring and effective services to some of the most vulnerable members of our society.   Each year this organization provides services to more than 30,000 Rhode Island children and families.   It is the responsibility for all government officials – federal, state, and local – to work together with our partners in the private and non-profit sectors to support these efforts and ensure that no child falls through the cracks. In Congress, I’m proud to continually fight to strengthen programs that benefit children and families including:  • Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) which ensures 9 million children are provided with low-cost health insurance.  • Child Care Development Block Grant which helps families access quality, affordable child care.  • Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which supports low-income mothers and young children who have or are at risk of developing nutrition-related diseases and disorders.  • Head Start, which offers education, health, and nutrition services to economically disadvantaged children, as well as parenting and employment support to parents.  I promise to continue to advocate for robust funding for these programs to ensure that every child has their basic needs met and the chance to get ahead.   
￼ 
 REFOCUS GALA   On Thursday, I attended ReFocus' 12th Annual Auction and Gala in Providence to raise awareness for members of our community with different physical and developmental needs.   ReFocus is a non-profit human service agency that is dedicated to offering opportunities of growth to adults with developmental disabilities so that they are able to thrive in a loving, trusting, and challenging environment. The organization does incredible work to serve our community.   I was proud to help them raise awareness and recognize their Executive Director, Christine Kavanagh, RSM, for 45 years of dedicated service.   As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns, please call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov.  You can also click here to follow my work on Twitter.   Warm Regards, ￼  David Cicilline Member of Congress

WEEK IN REVIEW
￼
To start off this week's From the Front... I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nation’s capital, including Lani and Grayson Guilmette from Centerton, the Hale family from Fayetteville, the Hecht family from Bentonville, Chris Peterson from Fayetteville, Lindsey Huntsman from Fayetteville, the Farris family from Bentonville, Zachary and Leesha Smith from Bentonville, Mika and Connor McFadden from Fayetteville, the Perry family from Rogers, the Garrett family from Bentonville, the Arnwine family from Bentonville, Jerry and Melissa Chatham from Rogers, the Robinson family from Hartford, Rosemary Fusaro from Eureka Springs, Amalee and Matthew Schwartz from Eureka Springs, and the Swindle family from Bentonville. Safe travels back to the Natural State!
￼
It was another busy week in the Third Congressional District! With October being National Manufacturing Month, I thought it would be the perfect time to visit manufacturing facilities across AR-3. My team headed out to the Pernod Ricard facility in Fort Smith, where I spoke to employees about the importance of career and technical education (CTE) programs. With job opportunities – for a range of industries – booming across the nation, it’s important that workers are trained and have the skills needed to access high-demand, well-paying jobs for the 21st century. 
￼
I then met with local leaders from ABB, Trane, Mars, and the Fort Smith Chamber to discuss projects and workforce development in our community. Workforce training was again a leading topic of discussion, and I gave them an update on the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. This bipartisan bill strengthens the U.S. career and technical education system. It gives states and schools increased flexibility and resources for job training and technical skills programs. These companies discussed how the booming economy has led to an increased demand for skilled employees, but that there aren’t always enough qualified applicants to fill vacant positions. We need to ensure workers are equipped to compete in a 21st century economy. Legislation like this is critical to closing the skills gap and ensuring hardworking Americans have the tools needed to pursue their American dream. I was pleased to let them know that the bill was recently signed into law by President Trump.
￼
My next stop was to the Glatfelter facility, where we watched materials get turned into wet wipes and other household products. It's always interesting to see how things are made! I’m proud of our district’s strong manufacturing sector. My goal is to always keep this opportunity growing.
On Wednesday, I started my day with the Bentonville Rotary Club. I provided them with an update on recent things happening in Washington and policy priorities. We also talked about the importance of uniting our divided country and being engaged and informed citizens. I appreciated their time and look forward to visiting again soon!
￼
Our veterans represent the very best of America. It was a privilege to be with NorthWest Arkansas Community College (NWACC) as its Veteran Resources Center announced the creation of its own challenge coin to honor students who’ve served our country. The coins will be presented to veteran graduates, and I couldn’t be prouder of these hardworking students.  It’s inspiring to see these brave men and women further their education – and I am forever grateful for their service. While at the ceremony, I challenged NWACC President Dr. Evelyn Jorgenson to present her challenge coin. She was caught without it! You know what that meant: push-ups! Thank you to NWACC for allowing me to be with you for such a special event – and as always, thank you to our veterans! 
￼
I ended the day at Childcare Aware of Northwest Arkansas, where I met with employees and learned more about their initiatives to support local families. The organization’s mission is to improve child care and advocate for the safety and development of all children. One aspect they focus on is protecting kids during natural disasters and other emergency situations. It’s crucial to know the steps one should take before, during, and after a disaster strikes – and they are providing the resources to ensure families know how to do just that.  Their work is creating a stronger and more resilient community! 
￼
One of the best parts of my job is seeing the range of companies that operate in Northwest Arkansas. I stopped in Berryville to get a behind the scenes look at the work being done at Ducommun. Their innovative manufacturing supports quality jobs in our district. Importantly, their work also ensures that our military is equipped with the tools and technology they need in the field.
￼
I finished up the week at PAM Transport. I had the opportunity to meet their hardworking employees and learn more about the company. I also took a ride in one of their new tractor-trailers to see the advanced technology they are equipped with. American truckers keep our economy strong!  Products in our homes and stores have all been transported in trucks between cities, states, and across the country. Safe travels to all these dedicated drivers. They keep the U.S. moving!
Just in case you missed it, it was reported that the U.S. was named the world’s most competitive economy for the first time in a decade! America is leading again thanks to strong economic growth and opportunity!
Wishing everyone a great weekend! Remember to keep an eye on my website or check out my Twitter and Instagram pages to stay up-to-date with the latest news from the Third District and Washington.

The Hill Report   A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions Week of October 15 - October 19, 2018
This month, I ask you to join me in recognizing National Disability Employment Awareness Month. Often times, capable individuals with disabilities who want to work still face many obstacles when looking to join or re-join the workforce. For example, while about 40 percent of Social Security Disability Insurance beneficiaries say that they are interested in working, studies show that the share who succeed in returning to work is much lower. 
I have seen firsthand the difficulties a disabled person may face when looking for a job. My son, Alex, is a hardworking and fun-loving young man who also has Down Syndrome. As a father, I was worried that Alex may not find an employer and work place interested in taking advantage of the many wonderful qualities and skills he has to offer. I am proud to say that Alex now works as a greeter at The Home Depot and is thriving. He offers a personal and friendly greeting to every customer he comes in contact with and some folks even come in specifically to see him. It is important for businesses and corporations to see the value of hiring those with special needs and I am proud to say that many of our Dallas area companies have already taken great strides to show that people with disabilities can be productive employees.  
￼ 
Congressman Sessions with his son, Alex Sessions. 
I am also very proud to offer internship opportunities to bright young students with special needs. Morgan is a student at George Mason University, Class of 2019. Every week, Morgan interns in my Washington, D.C. office and is a tremendous help to my staff. She assists with typical intern tasks like folding constituent letters and delivering Dr. Pepper products to our hardworking Capitol Police Officers. I have no doubt that Morgan will go on to do many amazing things professionally. All she needs, and what all disabled people need, is to be given the same opportunity as everyone else. 
￼ 
Congressman Sessions with one of his Washington, D.C. interns, Morgan. 
I encourage all employers and workers to include a person who may have a disability in their workplace. I am sure you will see, just as I have, that their abilities far outnumber their disability.
  
Events in the District  National Physicians’ Council for Healthcare Policy (NPCHP)  Since I was first elected in 1996, I have engaged with physicians from across the country to better understand the issues impacting their patients, and I have met with individuals who cannot afford to pay the costs of soaring healthcare premiums or do not have access to healthcare choices that meet their needs.  
I have also hosted bi-annual meetings for the National Physicians’ Council for Healthcare Policy (NPCHP) in both Washington, D.C. and in Dallas. Established in 2014, the Council aims to provide a national voice for physicians engaged in private practice so that America can restore physician autonomy and create a framework where physicians can do their job better in a competitive, transparent market place. During our fall meeting this week in Dallas, we discussed several issues ranging from drug shortages and drug pricing to new discoveries in Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative diseases. It is always a great pleasure to host this event and I look forward to fostering discussion on the many issues concerning healthcare today.

Dallas Regional Chamber 2018 Congressional Forum This week, I was honored to participate in the Dallas Regional Chamber 2018 Congressional Forum alongside my colleague Congressman Marc Veasey (D-TX) of District 33 to share my views on the issues affecting North Texans. We discussed a wide range of issues including my efforts to promote long-term economic growth and the need to maintain a robust partnership and a strong trade agreement among our neighboring countries. While we may disagree from time to time, I am proud to serve Texas alongside my colleagues in Washington, D.C. and look forward to continuing to work on behalf of the people of North Texas.

10/19/18 17:33,Rep. Grothman Newsletter - The World's Most Competitive Economy,"￼ 
  

Economic News
This week, the U.S. economy regained the title for the most competitive economy on the global stage. It has been a decade since the United States held this title, and thanks to our commitment to pro-growth economic policies, including tax reform, the U.S. economy is back on top. The report, published by the World Economic Forum, cited that the process of bringing company operations back to the United States and the repatriation of manufacturing facilities has drastically helped the economy over the past several months.

While our economy is currently booming, some of the greatest news about this rapid recovery is that it shows few signs of slowing down. JP Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, has expressed his belief that the economy will only continue to get stronger in the foreseeable future, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell described the U.S. economic outlook as remarkably positive.

Evidence to back up those statements includes that wages are finally catching up with the economy. In September, overall hourly wages were up 2.8% from a year earlier and low income earners are seeing more money in their paychecks. With job openings at record highs, it is important that we find constructive solutions to filling job positions across the board so that our economy continues at this pace. 

Impact of Tax Reform 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has provided immense support to many residents throughout Wisconsin and within the 6th district. This year alone, tax reform has helped create nearly 23,000 jobs in Wisconsin, many of which have included employment opportunities in important economic sectors such as manufacturing.

Tax reform has not only helped create new job opportunities, but also is putting more money in the pockets of hard working Wisconsinites. Recently, the Heritage Foundation published a report detailing the impact it would have on districts and communities throughout the county if this important piece of legislation were to be repealed. 

The graphic below indicates that people in the district would be at risk of losing anywhere between $18,000 to $19,999 in take-home pay over the 2020-2029 period if tax reform was repealed. Tax reform is helping people in Wisconsin and its important to know how and why. For more information click here.

Fulbright Awards
I am proud to announce that three individuals from the 6th district received this years Fulbright award. The Fulbright Program, established by Congress in 1946, awards individuals for their outstanding academic work and distinction. 

The program was created in order to foster and strengthen relationships between individuals in the United States and other countries across the globe through international educational exchange. The U.S. participates in this program with approximately 100 foreign partner governments to promote educational diversity and excellence.

Kyle Armstrong of Neenah, Lindsay Jagla of Mequon, and Dr. Marianne Johnson of Oshkosh are all recipients of this years award. Kyle and Lindsay participated in English Teaching Assistantship student programs in Taiwan and Colombia respectively, while Dr. Johnson participated in an Economics scholars program in Albania. An incredible accomplishment, congratulations!    

Weekly Roundup
Continued economic success has manufacturers feeling good about their businesses again. The industry represents the backbone of our economy and its so great to see it thriving once again!

This Week: Meeting with Granite Staters across New Hampshire

This week, I was home in New Hampshire and got to visit many parts of our beautiful state during the state work period. 
On Monday, I visited Hampton Fire/Rescue to present a federal grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to support fire fighters by purchasing new communications equipment. I also commended our brave public safety officials for their selfless service, particularly their leadership on the front lines of the deadly opioid crisis. 
￼  
On Wednesday, I toured Milpower Source in Belmont. This innovative New Hampshire company is helping to develop products that bolster our national security. It was great to hear about the work they do to create jobs and keep our country safe. Job-creating businesses like Milpower Source are struggling to fill positions that require highly skilled workers, so I spoke with them about my efforts to close the skills gap and help more hard-working Granite Staters get the support they need to enter – and remain – in the workforce. 
￼ 
Yesterday, I was in Ossipee, exploring the new accessible trail at the Ossipee Pine Barrens preserve during its grand opening. New Hampshire has both beautiful natural resources and a strong tradition of inclusion, and this new trail is helping to ensure that all people – including those who experience disabilities – can access and explore the beauty of our state. 
￼ 
￼ 
I stopped by the Stafford County Head Start in Rochester. All of New Hampshire’s children deserve the opportunity to learn, to grow, and to lead, which starts with investing in – and expanding access to – early childhood education. 
￼ 
I commend all of the staff at Strafford County Head Start and those across the Granite State for the important work they do to not only shape our children’s futures, but to support families who have been impacted by the devastating opioid epidemic. 
I capped off the week with a visit to the North Country for Friendship House’s ribbon cutting ceremony of its new residential facility. 
Friendship House provides life-saving treatment and recovery services to Granite Staters living with addiction, and I congratulate them on this new facility. 
￼ 
I am also happy to announce the Innovate NH Entrepreneurship Forum on November 13th at Manchester Community College. The Forum will provide an opportunity for entrepreneurs across New Hampshire to hone the skills and knowledge necessary to turn an innovative idea into a thriving business. 
The Forum will provide a day of interactive workshops for entrepreneurs covering critical “how-to” topics to get small businesses off the ground and make them successful. Workshops will focus on learning to fund an idea; seeking out resources and support; creating a business plan; rural entrepreneurship; managing social media as a startup; women business ownership; and more. 
You can RSVP here and learn more here.

Delivering Fiscal Relief to Minnesotans!

￼
Rep. Lewis discusses the benefits of tax reform.

Dear Lindsey,

I wanted to reach out to let you know about the recent Tax Roundtable I hosted at Schadegg Mechanical in South Saint Paul, where I came together with local business members and stakeholders to discuss the many ways our historic tax reform is benefiting their employees and businesses. 
Click here to watch my tax reform video, explaining the ways tax reform is helping families and businesses!
After hosting the Roundtable, it was clear the benefits Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are being seen throughout Minnesota and the Second District. With lowered individual rates, a doubled standard deduction and doubled child tax credit, individuals and families are seeing more money in their paychecks and increased savings.
Small businesses in the Second District are thriving because of the lowered corporate and small businesses tax rate as well as the incentives to reinvest and expand. And as we’ve seen, when businesses thrive, their employees thrive. Wages have been increasing for employees across the country, and companies have given bonuses and provided expanded retirement benefits for their hardworking employees.
Listening to stories of success from business members in the Second District really showed that the benefits are hitting close to home, and local taxpayers are actively noticing the ways in which tax reform has helped them and their families. Working to deliver fiscal relief to Minnesotans has been a top priority of mine, and passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was the first step in achieving this end.
Moving forward, I’m excited to work on getting Tax Reform 2.0, over the finish line. Under this new legislation, the individual rate cuts become permanent, giving families more fiscal stability. Additionally, with expanded education and other life-planning savings accounts, you can build reliable savings for the future. 
It was great to come together with Minnesota businesses and stakeholders to discuss current benefits and other steps we can take to help our small businesses and their employees. I will continue to work for economic growth and personal prosperity for members of the Second District. 
As I work on this and other issues, I always like to hear directly from you.  Please share any thoughts you may have through my website, and sign up for my e-mail newsletter for the latest updates from Washington, D.C. and around the district. You can also stay on top of my work by following my Facebook and Twitter pages. Please feel free to call my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-2271 or my local Burnsville office at 651-846-2120 with any comments or for assistance with a federal agency

Appleton – Swift County
Dear Friends,
 
This week, I met with Minnesotans from Bemidji to Lamberton. I visited Red Rock Central Secondary School in Lamberton to recognize the school’s distinction as a 2018 National Blue Ribbon School. Red Rock Central Secondary is one of four schools in the 7th to receive this honor for outstanding academic performance and their work closing achievement gaps between students. On Monday, I met with ProAg in Mahnomen and Noah Insurance in Callaway to chat about crop insurance and the proposed changes that could come from a new Farm Bill. I met with officials from the city of Tracy on Wednesday to discuss flood mitigation. The city saw damage from flooding in July and is currently working with state and federal officials to find ways to prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future.
 
Sincerely,
￼ Congressman Collin C. Peterson
Minnesota 7th District
 
Blue Ribbon Schools
￼
Class President Noah Pankonin, Principal Phil Goetstouwers, and State Senator Bill Weber
 
This week, I visited Red Rock Central Secondary School in Lamberton to celebrate its selection as a 2018 National Blue Ribbon School. This prestigious distinction recognizes public and private elementary, middle, and high schools for their overall academic performance and progress in closing achievement gaps among students. Red Rock Central Secondary School is one of 349 schools selected by the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program this year, including 8 from Minnesota. Buffalo Lake‐Hector‐Stewart Elementary School, Canby Elementary School, and Fertile-Beltrami Elementary School are the other winners from the 7th District.
 
Flood Mitigation Meeting with Tracy Officials
￼
 
I met with Tracy city officials this week to discuss how they are recovering from the flooding that hit their community in July. The City of Tracy is working with Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop a proactive mitigation plan to prevent wide spread flooding damage in the future. We discussed the different options that the city could pursue and the federal funding sources that could be used to finance the plan.
 
Local Parents Share Their Experience Raising Diabetic Children
￼
 
I had the opportunity to sit down with Gina Stanford and her son Noah, Priscilla Bowman, and Stacy Zimmy with her daughter Addie on Thursday morning. We visited in my Detroit Lakes office where they told me about their experience as parents of children with diabetes. One challenge they mentioned is the lack of food labels in restaurants and not knowing whether to take medication before enjoying a meal. Although many restaurants do offer nutrition labels upon request, many do not have that information. There are laws in effect that require food vendors to display the nutritional content of their products, however they do not apply in some cases. I will continue to work in Congress on this issue that impacts so many families.
 
Highwater Ethanol
￼
 
I had the opportunity to visit Highwater Ethanol in Lamberton this week. As the Co-Chair of the Biofuels Caucus, I have been a constant advocate for year-round sale of E15. While I support the Administration’s attempt to expand access to E15 through rule makings, I am concerned that without a legislative solution this issue will get tied up in the courts. I will support legislation to allow this change to be implemented effectively. Increased E15 sales will provide a needed boost to the ethanol industry and give corn growers access to a broader segment of the domestic fuels market.
 
Local and County Officials in Bemidji
￼

On Tuesday, I met with local and county officials in Bemidji to discuss issues that are important to the area. We spoke at length about the new veterans home that is planned for the city and the importance of involving federal lawmakers as the project moves forward. The State of Minnesota will provide a significant portion of the funding, but there is a good deal of money that still needs to be found. I asked that the community to provide me with regular financial updates so that I can work to find additional funding at the federal level.

I visited ProAg in Mahnomen and Noah Insurance in Callaway on Monday to talk about crop insurance. I have long been a supporter of the crop insurance program as it is a vital risk management tool that farmers use as a backstop against bad weather and market volatility. I am pleased that new federal insurance products are being developed for dairy and livestock producers.
 
New Flyer Bus Company
￼
 
LeRoy Stumpf of my staff visited the New Flyer Bus Company on Wednesday. The tour was hosted by Transportation for America Chairman John Robert Smith. Chairman Smith gave a presentation about the importance of transit systems in communities both large and small. A good transit system allows those who do not drive to be mobile while also reducing the number of vehicles on our roads. New Flyer sells models of their buses to cities across the United States and Canada and can tailor them to fit the needs of nearly any customer. They have designed models to be fueled by diesel, natural gas, electricity, hydrogen and hybrid.
 
AgriTalk with Chip Flory
￼
 
I got the chance to talk on Tuesday with Chip Flory on AgriTalk about a handful of things, including the ongoing negotiations on the farm bill and other issues impacting farmers like the Administration’s announced expansion of E15 ethanol sales year-round. I told Chip that the E15 decision is a promising one for the ethanol industry, but it’s something that farmers won’t see the full benefit of until there is legislation passed that makes progress on renewable fuels more permanent if the rulemaking gets caught up in the courts. I also gave an update on where we are with the farm bill, and the ongoing meetings with Chairman Conaway and our counterparts in the Senate, Chairman Roberts and Ranking Member Stabenow. We have a handful of outstanding disagreements, but we’re close and if we can all stay at the table productively, we can get a bill done and signed before the end of the year.
 
Northwest Minnesota Council of Collaboratives Meeting
￼
 
The Northwest Minnesota Council of Collaboratives (NWMNCC) is comprised of organizations and individuals from Kittson, Marshall, Mahnomen, Norman, Pennington, Polk and Red Lake counties. The primary goal of the NWMNCC is to improve the lives of children and families. This is accomplished by coordinating human and financial resources to address the needs of over 75,000 people. I am glad one of my staff could attend your meeting and learn about the problems our youth face in our schools, at home and in our communities.
 
Groundbreaking for Apex Townhomes in Detroit Lakes
￼
 
On Wednesday, my staff attended the official groundbreaking ceremony for Apex Townhomes in Detroit Lakes. The project is a 30-unit affordable housing project funded by the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit which encourages the investment of private equity in the development of affordable rental housing for low-income households. Detroit Lakes, along with many other communities throughout my district, are in serious need of affordable housing. With a strong job market and many local businesses expanding, it's critical to have enough housing to sustain a growing workforce. I strongly support our rural housing infrastructure and will continue to champion affordable housing in communities throughout my district.
 
Head Start Facility Opens in Thief River Falls
￼
 
The Inter-County Community Council Executive Director Catherine Johnson gave my staff aide a tour of the new Head Start facility in Thief River Falls this week. Catherine told us how the Council partnered with Northland Community and Technical College in Thief River Falls to open the new child care center. The new building has several rooms for learning, exercising, sleeping and eating inside, and a quality playground outside. The Head Start program will start with 40 children at the Northland site and will see 50 others at their homes.
 
Bemidji Area Forestry Affairs Council
￼
 
Jerry Richards, the new Chair of the Bemidji Area Forestry Affairs Council, hosted a meeting with the U.S. Forestry Service on Saturday. The Forestry Service representative explained the Sand Plains Pine Project in the Chippewa National Forest. The U.S. Forestry Service wants local foresters to collaborate with the Nature Conservancy to better manage the forest through a science-based repopulation of certain species of trees. They described the area of the Chippewa National Forest where the project would focus as vital to local tribal communities and businesses reliant on timber.
 
Capitol Police Officer from Alexandria
￼
 
Gretchen Revering serves as a Capitol Police Officer in the United States Capitol Building. The Alexandria native started her position in March and has been doing important work to ensure the security of America’s lawmakers and the Capitol’s many guests. Officer Revering was on her evening patrol Monday when she stopped to check in on the office of her hometown’s congressman. Thank you for your service, Gretchen.
 
World Food Day
￼
 
World Food Day is October 16th. Today, there are more than 815 million hungry people in the world, and for the first time in 15 years that number is on the rise. We are fortunate in the United States to have a strong domestic food supply. Some nations are not so lucky. Feed the Future is an organization that aims to strengthen the agriculture industries of nations around the world through agricultural education initiatives

American Pharmacists Month
￼
 
October is American Pharmacists Month, during which time we recognize the contributions of pharmacies to our communities. Pharmacists are among the most accessible providers in rural healthcare systems and offer a range of critical services including daily prescriptions, guidance on over-the-counter medications, care management, and medical counseling. I am proud to support pharmacies as a co-sponsor of several measures to increase the transparency of drug pricing and secure reimbursement for pharmacies in underserved and often rural areas. 
 
￼Legislative Update
 
Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act
Last August, I introduced the bipartisan Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act with Representative David Young (R-IA-3) to require all group and individual health plans to cover medically necessary services related to congenital anomalies and birth defects. I’m happy to announce that Representatives Anthony Brown (D-MD), Glenn Thompson (R-PA), and Paul Tonko (D-NY) have agreed to co-sponsor the legislation, bringing the total number of co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle to 13. I will continue to work toward ensuring that customers can afford costly reconstructive treatments, particularly when the healthy development of a child is at stake.  
This Week in American History
￼
 
On October 15, 1800, Spain transferred the Louisiana Territory, part of which would eventually become western Minnesota, to France. France sold the 530,000,000-acre territory to the United States three years later for $15 million. Napoleon Bonaparte, France’s First Consul at the time, authorized the sale.
 
What’s the Story?
￼
 
The State of Minnesota adopted its first official seal in 1858. Lawmakers chose to update the seal in 1971. After their first ideas failed to be approved by the state’s lawmakers, the current design was adopted in 1983. The seal features a farmer plowing the land to represent the importance of agriculture to the state’s economy. To represent the Native heritage of the state, a Native Minnesotan is shown on horseback galloping south toward the farmer. Also depicted are the state tree, the Norway pine, and the Falls of St. Anthony to symbolize Minnesota’s northern forests. I display this enlarged version of the Great Seal of the State of Minnesota in my Washington, D.C. office.

Rep. Loudermilk (R-GA) issued the following statement after receiving the Taxpayers’ Friend Award from the National Taxpayers Union (NTU): 

“Hardworking Americans deserve the freedom to determine what they do with their money, not elected bureaucrats. And, this Congress, Republicans have been focused on reducing the tax burden by passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and Tax Reform 2.0, so Americans can invest in their families, their businesses, and their communities. I want to thank the NTU for this award, and for holding all members of Congress accountable.”

Investing in Our Community's Health 
 


Dear Neighbor,
I believe that every American needs and deserves to know if they’re getting the best prices on their prescription drugs. Many of our neighbors in the Seventh District have struggled to afford their lifesaving medications because of needlessly high drug prices. Until recently, pharmacy gag clauses have prevented pharmacists from telling patients when they could pay less for prescription drugs, on both Medicare and private insurance plans. 
The good news is that Congress passed and the president signed the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act and the Know the Lowest Price Act to end these pharmacy gag clauses. I was proud to support this legislation to ensure our neighbors have better control of their health care decisions. I support allowing American consumers to buy their medication overseas by mail to save money.  
￼
Investing in cancer research is one of my top priorities. Recently, I voted to fund the National Institutes of Health $4.1 billion above the president’s request, and I increased funding for the National Cancer Institute by $509 million above the president’s budget request. Unfortunately, breast cancer is the top cancer among women worldwide. This year, more than 17,000 Texas women and over 150 men are expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer, according to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. Prevention is the best way to combat this disease. Regular mammograms are vital to early detection. I encourage all women to consult with their healthcare providers so they can take the necessary steps to catch this disease in its early stages. Let’s fight this disease together. You can learn more about symptoms, diagnosis and treatment here.

Pierce Bush, CEO of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Houston and Congressman John Culberson (TX-07) 
This week I also had the opportunity to visit Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Houston. This organization has been a bright spot in our community for the last 68 years, and it reminds me that one of the greatest joys in life is to help someone else.   As the Appropriator for Southeast Texas and chair of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science on Appropriations, I support significant investments in peer-to-peer mentoring programs. In fact, I have raised funding for youth mentoring programs to $100 million, well above the president’s budget request. It’s a privilege to help support the work they do, and I’m excited to see the impact this program will have on future generations here in Houston.
To let me know your thoughts on these or any other issues, you can email me here. 
It is an honor and privilege to represent you and Texas in the United States House. 
 Sincerely,   ￼  John Culberson

Dear Friend, 
It's been a great week seeing firsthand once again how South and West Texans of all trades are working hard and making a real impact across our state and nation. A few highlights:  
Energy security is national security. My thanks to UTSA for hosting today's South Texas Energy Cybersecurity Forum, and Secretary Perry for your continued efforts to ensure the security of our state's energy infrastructure for years to come.  
￼ 
Through rain or shine, cold and heat, the men and women of our agriculture industry work hard each day to produce goods we rely on for survival, and I'm proud to fight for TX-23's 9,000 working farms and ranches in Congress. My thanks to the Pecos-Reeves Counties Farm Bureau for having me.  
￼ 
The Supercritical Transformational Electric Power (STEP) program allows us to generate more power, spend less money, leave a smaller environmental footprint and create 100+ new jobs over the next 6 years in San Antonio. Proud to have helped get funding for this important project.  
￼ 
Everyone has a role to play in preventing bullying at all levels, and as a community, we must do better. I was glad to get a group of local leaders together to start a continued dialogue about how we can stop bullying. Here's what we discussed.  
￼ 
When someone says the word hygiene, you likely think of brushing your teeth, washing your face or hopping in the shower. But what's just as important in today's digital world is your cyber hygiene. In case you missed it: here are three easy tips you should implement into your daily cyber hygiene routine to make sure you protect yourself online.  
￼ 
Thanks for the shoutout, John! I appreciate your kind words and will continue to do all that I can to help folks across South and West Texas. You can listen here. 
￼ 
As always, please don't hesitate to reach out to my office with any questions or concerns. For further updates on my work for you, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube at @HurdontheHill.  
Have a great weekend!
 
Sincerely,

Dear Friend,  I know it is a bit old-fashioned, but I like stepping into the voting booth and using a pencil to fill in an oval on paper.  There is no Russian hacking or fancy Facebook algorithm interfering with my vote.  It’s my conscience, my pencil, on paper.
Still, many Americans wonder if our election counts are to be trusted.  Sowing seeds of doubt in our democratic processes is the intention of those who intend to do us harm.  Despite ongoing nation-state meddling that long predates the 2016 election, please know that great measures are being undertaken to ensure the integrity of our election systems, from registration to voting to post-election vote certification, this November and beyond.
According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Russian hackers targeted election infrastructure in at least 21 states during the 2016 campaign.  Nebraska was not targeted by outside interference.  Our state has, nevertheless, taken several steps to ensure pre-and-post-election security.  Importantly, our continued use of paper ballots creates a non-digital firewall impervious to hacking.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is, by Congressional mandate, charged with protecting America’s “critical infrastructure.”  In January, 2017, DHS designated our country’s election systems a “critical infrastructure subsector,” placing a far higher priority on protecting election resources than was previously the case.  I recently received an update from the DHS Secretary outlining latest election security measures.  DHS has implemented sophisticated sensors that provide granular real-time monitoring of voter registration databases to detect malicious activity and malware.  Through its Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, DHS can now receive, collate, and communicate attempted interference discovered at any of the more than 10,000 election jurisdictions in the country.  As part of its whole-of-government approach, DHS has also stepped up election day and post-election day monitoring and incident response, and instituted robust counter-measures against foreign manipulation of public discourse.  I invite you to review the correspondence I received from the DHS Secretary here. 
Earlier this year, via the Help America Vote Act, Congress provided $380 million in grants to help the country’s 55 states and territories enhance election security.  According to the United States Election Assistance Commission (EAC)—the federal body created by Congress in 2002 to serve as the liaison to state election officials—Nebraska received about $3.5 million dollars.  This funding has been used to replace and upgrade voting equipment, and enhance ballot authentication, voter list maintenance, and accurate election night reporting.
Even with the ongoing threat of cyber-attacks, it is extremely difficult for foreign actors to hack the vote itself.  There is yet no evidence that they have previously done so.  
Still, five states—Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina, New Jersey, and Delaware—rely exclusively on electronic voting, leaving no permanent paper trail.  These areas of vulnerability were addressed in a proposed bipartisan bill that I support, the Secure Elections Act (SEA).  It mandates that all states perform manual audits on a percentage of digital votes in all precincts in every election.  Without checking paper results against electronic results, there is no guarantee that interference has not occurred.  
Taken together, these actions at the state, executive branch, and legislative branch levels should reassure you that your vote is secure.  The sine qua non of a republic is free and fair elections.  If the voting process and vote tallies cannot be trusted, election results cannot be trusted.  
Earlier in the tech revolution, I recall a TV report done at a trade show about the latest computer gadgetry.  In addition to many high-tech vendors, the reporter interviewed a gentleman who just had a paper and pencil at his simple low-tech booth.  Technology has helped us exceedingly well in data movement and productivity.  But in that solemn space of the voting booth, maybe a paper and pencil works just fine.   Sincerely, ￼  Congressman Jeff Fortenberry

ACA on the chopping block... Again

#ProtectOurCare 
Republicans keep blurting out the truth: if they control Congress next year, they will return to their monstrous campaign to steal health insurance from tens of millions of families, raise health costs, impose an age tax on older Americans, and destroy protections for the 130 million people with pre-existing condition by trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
￼ 
Congresswoman Pelosi sat down with the Harvard Institute of Politics to discuss House Democrat’s agenda, #ForThePeople: lowering health & prescription drug costs, raising wages by rebuilding America, & cleaning up corruption in D.C. 
They have used their control of Washington to wage a bitter war on the health care of families and seniors. At the same time, like clockwork, Republicans in Congress are setting in motion their plan to destroy the Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that seniors and families rely on, just months after they exploded the deficit by $2 trillion with their Tax Scam for the rich.  
In budget after budget, they have exposed their cynical agenda: give massive, unpaid-for handouts to further enrich big corporations shipping jobs overseas and the wealthiest 1 percent, and stick seniors, children and families with the bill. Under their twisted agenda, we can afford tax cuts for billionaires, but not the benefits our seniors have earned. 
The American people deserve a government that fights for them. Democrats are For The People: lowering health costs and the price of prescription drugs, increasing pay and driving strong growth by rebuilding America, and cleaning up corruption to make Washington work for the people.

The technology developing in digital flight control systems for air crafts across the country is stunning. Thank you for taking us behind the scenes Genesys Aerosystems! 

￼


This year’s Permian Basin International Oil Show was truly remarkable. The technology that is being integrated in the field and several thousand feet below the surface, has revolutionized how the oil and gas industry operates. Shout out to Odessa’s Police Department for their outstanding work with the crowd control.

￼

Talking Rural Broadband In Hickman County 
I had the pleasure of spending some time with our rural broadband providers at a meeting in Hickman County this week. I so appreciated the opportunity to join State Representative Curcio, County Mayor Bentley, representatives from the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, and many local stakeholders who are directly engaged in deploying more rural broadband in Tennessee. We discussed the barriers they’re facing and what more we can do at the federal level to support their efforts. While we have made a great deal of progress on the legislative front in Congress, particularly during my tenure as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Communications & Technology on the House Energy & Commerce Committee, there is still more work to do. Tennessee has made great strides in closing the digital divide, and its thanks to the hard work of these individuals and their small companies that we are getting closer every day. Thank you for all you do! I look forward to continuing to work across the state to make sure every Tennessean has 21st century internet for a 21st century economy. 
￼

Creating Jobs in Henderson County 
On Tuesday, I had the wonderful opportunity to visit the newly-expanded Nidec Leroy-Somer facility in Lexington, Tennessee. Nidec is one of the world’s largest motor manufacturers, and recently bought Leroy-Somer from Emerson Electric, which included the Lexington manufacturing plant. At the time of this purchase, employment numbers were rapidly declining at the plant, but with Nidec’s investment of $18 million to upgrade the facility, they are able to hire an additional 300 Tennesseans over the next five years! It was such a pleasure to learn about the company and discuss crucial issues they are facing at the federal level such as workforce development and defense funding. Nidec’s substantial investment in Henderson County and the neighboring communities serves as even more proof that Tennessee is the best place to do business and create new jobs. 
￼

Delta Regional Authority Invests in West Tennessee 
On Wednesday, the Delta Regional Authority (DRA) announced that it will invest nearly $2.8 million in West Tennessee communities to make infrastructure improvements that will attract new industry and support expansion of existing businesses, enabling the creation and retention of about 3,400 jobs. Two communities in the seventh district will receive grants. The city of Savannah’s Industrial Development Corporation will use DRA funding to build new parking and truck transportation areas to support a manufacturing facility in Hardin County, which will create 75 new jobs and help retain 160 workers. The Lexington Industrial Development Board will also use DRA funding to upgrade the Nidec Leroy-Somer facility with new electrical equipment enhancements to the shipping bay, enabling the company to create 300 new jobs. Thank you to the DRA for your dedication to unlocking the economic potential of our rural Tennessee communities. With a top-notch workforce, business-friendly environment, and outstanding local leadership, these communities provide ideal settings for investments in high quality infrastructure and jobs.
 
Championing Reliable, Affordable Energy 
I was delighted to be named an “American Energy Champion” this week by the American Energy Alliance for demonstrating my commitment to pro-growth policies that will lead to more affordable energy for Tennessee families. As a longtime leader and member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, I have stood up for free-market energy policies and fought against overreaching, burdensome government mandates such as the EPA’s Waters of the United States (“WOTUS”) rule. As your representative, I will continue to advocate for affordable, reliable energy and less government intrusion into your energy choices.

New Medicare Card Wave 7 Begins 
Medicare has begun sending new Medicare cards to beneficiaries in Tennessee.  The new cards feature a new Medicare Number, instead of your Social Security Number.

Cards will be sent automatically to current beneficiaries, and you should begin using your new card right away. Remember that Medicare will never call you uninvited and ask you for personal or private information to get your new Medicare Number and card.

You can learn more by visiting medicare.gov/newcard or calling 1-800-MEDICARE with any questions regarding the new Medicare card.

The Most Competitive Economy for First Time in Decade
America is open for business! Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, and the newly passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our economy and our country are stronger than ever. For the first time since 2008, the United States is the most competitive country in the world, according to the World Economic Forum, and I am committed to keeping it that way!

10/19/18 16:13,EPA Public Comment Period on Fuel Standards,"￼
Home       About Mark       Our District       How Can Mark Help You?       Legislation       Newsroom       Contact Mark        
Dear Lindsey:
Earlier this month the United Nations' panel on climate change released a landmark report finding that severe consequences of climate change will hit earlier than we thought. The report, authored by 91 scientists from 40 countries, found that ""absent aggressive action"" the impacts of climate change—like worsening food shortages and intensifying wildfires—will take effect as early as 2040.  Despite this warning, the Trump Administration is continuing to push its agenda of rolling back fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards for motor vehicles and eliminating California's authority to set its own, higher standards, opening the door to more pollution and turning its back on the clear, scientific warnings about climate change.   Before this announcement, the current fuel standards were expected to reduce our oil dependence by over 2 million barrels a day by 2025, save Americans $1.7 trillion in fuel costs, and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 6 billion metric tons—effectively eliminating the impact of 59 million vehicles from the road by 2030.
Simply put, this rollback is a blatant attack on public health, the environment, and America's economic competitiveness. Since the Trump Administration announced this shortsighted decision, I have been fighting back in Congress by:
	•	Calling for a national boycott of any company that does not commit to maintaining current fuel standards;
	•	Urging California's public retirement funds to divest from companies that participate in the rollback, and leading a group of Democratic Members to join this effort;
	•	Calling on automobile manufactures to clarify how they will respond to a rollback;
	•	Sending a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) urging the Administration to maintain and strengthen current standards; and
	•	Leading a group of Democratic Members of Congress in introducing a resolution (H.Con.Res.130) in support of the existing standards and the ability of States to adopt standards that are higher than the federal standards.
Now, I am issuing a public comment calling for an immediate halt to the Trump Administration's rollback, and there is still time left for you to make your voice heard, too.  The EPA is in the process of receiving feedback from the public on this rollback. To share your thoughts with them on the importance of maintaining strong fuel efficiency standards for our environment and economic competitiveness, you can submit your comment to them at https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=EPA-HQ-OAR-2018-0283-0756 through Tuesday, October 26, 2018.  To stay up-to-date on these and other topics before Congress, please follow our Facebook and Twitter pages. As always, please do not hesitate to contact our office with any questions you may have or if we can be of assistance.

Sincerely, ￼  Mark DeSaulnier Member of Congress

Dear Friends –
The Greater Hartford Region is in desperate need of infrastructure improvements. Last month, I hosted a delegation from Seattle, WA to speak about how tunneling is transforming their waterfront and the path forward for Greater Hartford.
We’re continuing that conversation next week with John Reilly, one of the foremost experts in complex infrastructure and megaprojects, and Candace Damon, an industry-leading economic development consultant. John Reilly and Candace Damon both played a critical roles in Seattle’s tunnel project. I invite you to join us for a conversation about the future of our region on October 24th.
If you have any questions, or to RSVP please call Congressman Larson’s Hartford Office at 860-278-8888.
I hope to see you at the forum!
WHAT:
A public conversation about the economic benefits and technology related to tunnel projects and the future of Greater Hartford’s infrastructure.

Saudi Arabia Worth a Read from the Washington Post: Jamal Khashoggi’s final column Appropriations Highlight: Preparing for the Health Emergency NJ 11 Students Preparing for College Help Salute our State’s Role as America Celebrates its 250th Birthday Salute: The VanOrden’s 76 years of Service to the Lincoln Park First Aid Squad
Saudi Arabia 
This past week we continued to see troubling reports detailing the moments that lead to the horrible killing of Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. The United States, the people of Saudi Arabia, and the entire world deserve to know who was responsible for these crimes so they may be brought to justice.
I applaud Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin’s Thursday decision to withdraw from the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh next week. You can read more about this decision in the New York Times report here.
Further, utilizing the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, Congress has already initiated the process to investigate the disappearance of Mr. Khashoggi.  Under the legislation, the President, upon receipt of a letter from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is authorized to impose sanctions on those responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture, or other human rights violations against individuals who seek to obtain, exercise, defend, or promote human rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression. You can read more about Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corkers’s (TN) actions here.
The U.S. – Saudi relationship has lasted for over seven decades tracing back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt meeting King Abdul Aziz ibn Saud aboard the USS Quincy in 1945. Despite differences between our two countries and setbacks that have strained our relationship, each president since Roosevelt has worked to strengthen our alliance with Saudi Arabia. Today, the Saudi’s are a key national security ally in the Middle East, assisting our fight against terrorism and checking Iranian extremism. In addition, they are a critical economic and trading partner.
It is imperative we deliver justice to Mr. Khashoggi while doing our best to rebuild and restore our historic relationship.
 
Worth a Read from the Washington Post: Jamal Khashoggi’s final column, an appeal for free expression in the Arab world, which ran in Thursday’s Washington Post. You can read it here.
Appropriations Highlight: Preparing for the Next Health Emergency
The Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Labor-Health and Human Services (LHHS) Appropriations bill was approved by Congress and signed into law last month – marking the first time in twenty years this legislation was enacted prior to the end of the fiscal year.
The LHHS bill, which was drafted by my House Committee on Appropriations, funds a variety of human service programs and provides robust support for key investments that will save lives in the event of health emergencies.
Contained in the legislation is $50 million to establish an Infectious Disease Rapid Response Reserve Fund. This will allow the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and other health agencies to respond to the next infectious disease outbreak. As we have seen with previous outbreaks, it is imperative our health officials have the resources on hand to respond quickly and effectively. I am pleased Congress was able to have the foresight to approve these new resources so we are better prepared to save lives.
The LHHS bill also includes $171 million for Preparedness and Response activities at the CDC, an increase of $10 million from FY 2018, to support programs that strengthen national readiness to both naturally occurring and intentional public health emergencies. Further, this legislation continues robust funding of $610 million for the Strategic National Stockpile, a national repository of antibiotics, vaccines, antidotes, and other critical medical equipment and supplies available in the event of an emergency.
You can read more about the LHHS bill here and to learn more about the legislation’s impact on New Jersey visit here. 
 
NJ-11 Students Preparing for College 
This time of year many students and families across New Jersey’s 11th Congressional District are busy planning for their collegiate and postsecondary education.  As we have seen over the years, the cost for students attending college has become a heavy burden for many undergraduates and their families. 
It is important to note, there are a number of resources available to students and their families for planning and acquiring funds for postsecondary education.  I would encourage you to review this comprehensive guide of the various resources that may be of assistance to students and their families compiled by the Congressional Research Service.  
 
Help Salute our State’s Role as America Celebrates its 250th Birthday 
Plans are already underway to mark our nation’s 250th Anniversary in 2026. In 2016, Congress unanimously approved the United States Semiquincentennial Commission Act establishing USA250, United States Semiquincentennial Commission to organize, advocate, and promote this critical milestone anniversary of the founding of America and the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
This week, I wrote USA250 requesting an update on their plans to recognize New Jersey’s contributions to the Revolution. New Jersey was at the crossroads of America's Revolutionary War, with nearly 300 sites in our State with direct ties to the American Revolution, it is imperative the Commission honors New Jersey!
To learn more and to share your ideas with the Commission you can visit their website here.
You can read more about “Revolutionary New Jersey” by visiting the Crossroads of the American Revolution website here.
 
Salute: The VanOrden’s 76 years of Service to the Lincoln Park First Aid Squad 
This week I was pleased to pay tribute to Richard and Susan VanOrden who have dedicated over 76 years of service to the Lincoln Park First Aid Squad.  Richard began on the squad in 1978.  Sue began in 1982.  That's 40 and 36 years respectively. They have held many positions between the two of them as well as Sue holding the position of President of the entire New Jersey State First Aid Council. Every year, they have made their required hours, often giving above and beyond.   Thank you Richard and Sue for your dedicated service to Lincoln Park and the surrounding communities!

10/19/18 15:49,Civility and Respect,"News from Congressman Dan Newhouse
￼  
Civility and Respect 
￼
This week, I welcomed my friend and colleague, Rep. Derek Kilmer, to Central Washington where we kicked off our Civility and Respect Tour around the state. Rep. Kilmer is a Democrat who represents Washington's 6th District, and while we disagree on many policy issues, we have fostered and maintained a friendship and positive working relationship.  
We are both members of the House Appropriations Committee and participate in a monthly meeting of a Bipartisan Working Group. We have introduced legislation together, such as the VA Management Alignment Act, and we have worked together on several important issues, such as combating the opioid crisis and putting an end to school violence. 
In the wake of horrific events like the shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise at the congressional baseball practice and the tragic rally in Charlottesville, civility is more important now than ever. Together, Rep. Kilmer and I joined the bipartisan Civility and Respect Caucus, which aims to spread the message of ""disagreeing without being disagreeable.""  
￼ 
The first stop on the tour was to the Hanford Site. I wanted to show Rep. Kilmer the importance of the federal government's obligation to the people in the Mid-Columbia, and there is no better way to understand the work being done at Hanford than to see it first-hand. We saw the progress being made at the Vit Plant, and Rep. Kilmer was able to better understand how important the clean up effort is for Central Washington.  
Click here to watch KEPR's coverage of our visit. 
￼ 
The second stop on the Civility and Respect Tour brought Rep. Kilmer and I to speak with members of the Tri-City Regional Chamber and Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. We discussed the importance of being able to engage with our colleagues - not only in politics but also in business. According to the Harvard Business Review, 48% of workers on the receiving end of uncivil behavior unintentionally decreased their efforts on the job. I am very proud to represent such a robust, diverse, and growing business sector in the Tri-Cities, and I am pleased Rep. Kilmer got to meet and speak with local business owners.  
￼ 
The Central Washington leg of the tour ended at an event hosted by WSU Tri-Cities, where we participated in a discussion with students and staff about how they can be more civil to each other at school and on social media. Civil discourse requires confidence and knowing that standing up for your beliefs isn't always the easy thing to do. The students at WSU Tri-Cities had excellent questions for Rep. Kilmer and I about how we collaborate on important national issues when we disagree with one another. Click here to watch a stream of the student discussion.  
The Civility and Respect Tour continues today in Western Washington, as I join Rep. Kilmer in his district to visit Tool Gauge for a forum with Pierce County business leaders, participate in a student discussion at the University of Washington Tacoma, and tour the Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor and Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.  
See more photos from the Central Washington leg of the Civility and Respect Tour here. 
Walk to End Alzheimer's 
￼ 
Together, we walked last Sunday in the Tri-Cities to end Alzheimer's. Many people in our community have been personally affected by this terrible disease. The Alzheimer's community has long supported research and resources and has come together with one common goal: to end Alzheimer's. Not only is this disease the 6th leading cause of death in the United States, but it is expensive and requires dedication, persistence, and specialized care. As a Member of the House Appropriations Committee, I supported $2.34 billion of funding for Alzheimer's research - a $425 million increase over last year. Research is absolutely critical in finding ways to prevent and - eventually - cure Alzheimer's. I am proud to have delivered the largest amount of research funding ever appropriated, which was recently signed into law by President Trump. In addition to research, we must ensure that patients, families, and caregivers have a strong public health infrastructure to specifically address this disease. I am proud to be a friend of the Alzheimer's community, and I will continue to work alongside you to beat this devastating disease.  
Sharing Resources for Seniors 
￼ 
I stopped by the Senior Times Expo in Kennewick to speak with seniors and learn about some of the local services and resources available. This is the 6th Tri-Cities Senior Times Expo that my staff has participated in, and it is encouraging to see our community come together to provide social, health, retirement, and fitness information in a one-stop shop. Did you know that my office can assist with claims and benefits from Social Security, Medicare, Veterans Affairs, and other federal agencies? Learn more here. 
Right Here at Home 
￼
I visited the Framatome Richland facility to learn how their fuel engineers produce clean, no-waste nuclear fuel. The Richland facility has been in production for over 40 years, and the fuel produced here accounts for 5% of the electricity generated in the United States. Their ""dry conversion"" process generates essentially no liquid waste, and their three conversion lines produce the energy equivalent of 30,000 tons of coal per hour. We should be exploring and promoting alternative, reliable energy resources, and it is great to learn about these energy resources being produced right here in Central Washington.   
Aviation Maintenance and Workforce Education 
￼ 
Aviation plays a key role in the economy in Moses Lake and Grant County, and fostering aviation is important for the future of students at Big Bend Community College. I was able to visit Big Bend and see the workforce education center and aviation maintenance technician program firsthand. I was also pleased to have the opportunity to present Rich Mueller and Richard Hanover from the Port of Moses Lake a signed copy of the legislation I worked to get signed into law that preserves critical FAA facilities at the Grant County International Airport. The airport acts as an important resource for Big Bend, as the school works to provide internships and apprenticeships to students, so they can earn a paycheck as they learn. The FAA Reauthorization also included language to promote these collaborative relationships between education programs and private companies, and Big Bend serves an excellent and successful example of this.  
Positive Effects for Car Dealerships 
￼ 
Thank you to the staff and General Manager, Jose, at Bud Clary Toyota of Moses Lake for welcoming me to their car dealership and giving me a tour of the sales and service departments. While I was on site, I met with several of the Bud Clary employees. I updated them on my work in Congress and heard from them first-hand about how the country's steadily improving economy is positively affecting the Moses Lake Region.  
Friend of Farm Bureau 
￼ 
I was honored to receive the ""Friend of Farm Bureau"" award at the Washington Farm Bureau's Policy Forum in Moses Lake. Agriculture is absolutely vital to the economic well-being of Central Washington and our state, and I will continue to work to ensure the agriculture community's voice is heard by the federal government.  
Hero of Main Street 
￼
The Department of Labor recently announced that there are 7.1 million open jobs in the U.S. Main street businesses are the pillars of our communities because they provide employment and opportunity to our neighbors. I was honored to be named a ""Hero of Main Street"" and presented with the award by local business owners Pat, Linda, and Matthew Gilmore, who own Dunbar Jewelers in Yakima. I will continue to support policies that encourage small businesses to hire more workers. The award is for recipients who have supported policies that recognize the contributions of the retail industries and have worked to encourage a vibrant, sustained, and healthy retail sector.  
Thank you for reading this e-news update. It is an honor and privilege to represent you in Congress. 
Sincerely, ￼  Dan Newhouse Member of Congress

10/19/18 15:46,I'll Work with Anyone and Everyone for Montana's Veterans," ￼    ￼   ￼

￼
 
 
As Ranking Member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I’ve made it clear that I’ll work with anyone and everyone to make sure that the VA does right by Montana's veterans.

It doesn’t matter if that person is a Republican, Democrat, or Independent. If they share my goal of making sure the VA is delivering the very best health care and benefits to veterans in a timely manner, I’ll listen to their ideas and see if we can work together to improve the VA’s ability to deliver for our veterans.

I’ve found a great partner in the Chairman of our Committee, a Republican named Johnny Isakson from Georgia. Johnny is a fierce advocate for veterans and has been a pleasure to work with.

The Veterans' Affairs Committee has had a historic two years. Together, we’ve written major bipartisan VA reforms and with the support of veterans, Republicans, Democrats, the VA, and the White House, we’ve gotten them signed into law.

Now our laws are helping the VA live up to the promises our nation made to those who served.

The VA MISSION Act

Despite its best intentions, the Choice Program hasn’t worked for too many Montana veterans. So we got to work and crafted a bill that scraps the Choice Program, strengthens the VA and uses the private sector to fill in the gaps where the VA falls short. President Trump signed our bill into law June 6, 2018. 

￼

Forever G.I. Bill

On August 16, 2017, President Trump signed my fifth bill of the year into law. Our #ForeverGIBill ensures veterans can use their education benefits when it makes the most sense for them because they no longer expire after an arbitrary deadline and strengthens G.I. Bill benefits for generations of veterans to come.

Veterans Appeals Modernization Act

Before our bill to streamline the disability appeals system was signed into law on August 23, 2017, the system hadn’t been reformed since 1933. Now the VA can tackle the appeals backlog while helping to prevent future delays for veterans.

Our Veterans’ Affairs Committee has passed a historic amount of legislation in the past two years. But I’m not satisfied until all veterans have access to the health care and benefits they've earned. And now, I’ll be holding the VA accountable to use the tools we’ve given them to get the job done right.

If you have any ideas, suggestions, or questions about how the VA can better serve Montanans, please don’t hesitate to contact my office. As always, it’s an honor to serve you in the United States Senate.

Last week, President Trump signed into law the  Music Modernization Act , a bill I introduced that will improve the lives of songwriters, recording artists, producers, sound engineers, and just about everyone who works in the music industry. It helps ensure that songwriters are paid a fair market rate when their songs are played, and that recording artists and producers are fairly compensated for their work.

Click here to watch the bill signing, which included remarks from Sam Moore of Sam & Dave, Kid Rock, Michael Love of the Beach Boys, John Rich of Big & Rich, President Trump, and myself. 
This is the most important copyright legislation in a generation. I’m grateful to have been a part of this effort--and grateful to my colleagues for passing it unanimously in the Senate and the House of Representatives.
I also had the privilege of honoring a wonderful group of Utah veterans this morning at the WWII Memorial this morning. Click here for the video and click here to get to know the veterans.

October 19, 2018 
Dear Friends, 
Violence against women is rampant. Seventy percent of women worldwide will experience physical or sexual abuse by an intimate partner in their lifetime. In the U.S., nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner. One in five women and one in 71 men in the U.S. have been raped in their lifetime. 
￼ 
  
The impact of sexual trauma is severe and very difficult to overcome. In addition to being physically and psychologically scarred, victims are often re-victimized by being discredited and dismissed. This was on blatant display during the Justice Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. His testimony in response to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s reporting of sexual assault was a slap in the face to survivors across the country. This fall, Republicans in Congress failed to reauthorize VAWA, the Violence Against Women Act, beyond a three months extension until after the election. 
Women deserve better. That’s why I am hosting a panel sending a clear message: We believe survivors. I hope you will join me for this important conversation that will focus on healing and recovering from trauma. 
During the event, we will explore the transition from victim to survivor. I will moderate a panel of survivors, service providers, academics, and law enforcement. Look for a list of the panelist soon in this space. 
We Believe Survivors - Domestic Violence Awareness Month Thursday, October 25, 2018 7:00 - 8:30 p.m. San Mateo City Council Chambers 330 West 20th Avenue San Mateo, CA 94403

Tom meets with CAER in Mayville, Chautauqua County


Dear Neighbor,
We recently sat down with Countywide Alliance for Enforcement and Rehabilitation (CAER) in Mayville to discuss the opioid and heroin epidemic ravaging our neighborhood and how we are working to help.
Thousands of New Yorker’s lives have been cut short by prescription drug abuse and heroin. This is why we have made combating this crisis a top priority.
With my support, we recently passed more than 50 bills addressing the opioid crisis and President Trump signed those bills into law.
To help conquer this epidemic, we introduced the Help Ensure Lives are Protected (HELP) Act to allow federal prosecutors access to more severe penalties, including life in prison or the death penalty, when prosecuting certain criminal drug cases.
We are also adamantly opposed to bringing legalized open injection sites as some government officials in our community have proposed.  These sites will bring an influx of violence, crime and homelessness into our backyards as dangerous drug dealers will naturally follow the increased heroin users into our communities.
Our plan provides for safe and effective ways to combat the opioid and heroin epidemic through:
1. Treatment and Recovery
	•	Improve and expand access to treatment and recovery services
	•	Provide incentives for enhanced care, coordination, and innovation
	•	Establish comprehensive opioid recovery centers
2.  Prevention
	•	Encourage non-addictive opioid alternatives to treat pain
	•	Improve data to identify and help at-risk patients and families
	•	Address high prescribing rates while enhancing prescription drug monitoring programs
3.  Protecting Communities
	•	Give law enforcement tools to get dangerous drugs out of our communities
	•	Better intercept illicit opioids at international mail facilities
	•	Improve access to federal resources for local communities
4.  Fighting Fentanyl
	•	Better tackle ever-changing synthetic drugs
	•	Crack down on foreign shipments of illicit drugs
	•	Provide grants for local communities to combat fentanyl
As always, please reach out to any of our offices if you have questions or need assistance.
Until next time,
Tom

Long’s Short Report – A common sense solution to lower drug prices at the counter
By Rep. Billy Long
Earlier this year, President Trump rolled out his American Patients First blueprint to lower drug prices, which have steadily increased over the years. One of his priorities within the plan was to prohibit “gag clauses” within health insurance contracts that prevent pharmacists from letting their patients know that it would be cheaper for them to pay cash for their prescription rather than using their insurance.
In the U.S., nearly 60 percent of Americans take prescriptions drugs. From 2006 to 2015, prescription drug spending increased on average nearly five percent a year, with the highest increase in spending occurring in 2014 at 12.4 percent. In 2016 alone, Americans spent over $325 billion on retail prescription drugs, which was nearly 10 percent of all health care costs.
These alarming numbers got our attention in Congress, and we quickly began working on ways to fix this problem. In September, the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, which I sit on, held a hearing that addressed eliminating “gag clauses.” The legislation discussed would prevent group health care plans, individual health care plans and Medicare Part D plans from barring pharmacists from informing their customers about lower-cost prescription drug options.
Soon after our hearing, similar legislation, S. 2553, Know the Lowest Price Act, and S. 2554, the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, were passed in both the House of Representatives and Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support. On October 10, President Trump signed both bills into law, finally allowing pharmacists to relay common sense information to their customers about prescription drug prices. Now, when a consumer goes to purchase their prescription drugs, they will be given all of their options.
President Trump and Congress will continue to focus on solutions to lower drug prices. Breaking down communication barriers that can prevent lower drug prices is a common-sense approach. The American people deserve a health care system that works for them and not against them. I applaud my colleagues in both chambers for their hard work and I thank the president for his strong leadership on this issue.

ABOUT NITA           CONSTITUENT SERVICES           NEWSROOM           LEGISLATIVE ISSUES           17th DISTRICT           CONTACT ME 
Dear Friend:
Here are some of the ways in which I'm fighting hard this week to keep Lower Hudson Valley communities safe, healthy, and secure: 
	•	Fighting to Protect Medicare & Social Security 
	•	Securing Investments in Critical Cultural and Arts Programs 
	•	Helping a Constituent Secure Overdue Retirement Pay 
Fighting to Protect Medicare & Social Security 
￼ 
Every senior deserves access to a healthy and secure retirement, which is why I am working in Congress to prevent any cuts to Medicare and to strengthen the program for future generations. That's also why I want to make sure you are aware of two important announcements:  
	•	Medicare open enrollment for 2019 is underway. During the enrollment period, which runs from October 15, 2018 to December 7, 2018, beneficiaries can explore their coverage options and make changes to their health and prescription drug plans. Visit www.medicare.gov to learn more.   
	•	The Social Security Administration (SSA) recently announced a 2.8 percent cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) for 2019, the largest increase in seven years. While I am concerned that the COLA increase may not fully cover the rising costs of basic necessities like housing, health care, and transportation, it does provide additional security for Social Security beneficiaries. As costs of living continue to rise, I will continue working to ensure Social Security benefits are protected for current and future generations.
Securing Investments in Critical Cultural and Arts Programs 
￼ 
Rep. Lowey participates in a conversation on the humanities in Pocantico Hills. From left: Waddell Stillman, President of Historic Hudson Valley; Congresswoman Nita Lowey; Jon Parrish Peede, National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) chairman; and Sara Ogger, Executive Director, Humanities New York. 
I participated in a conversation at Historic Hudson Valley in Pocantico Hills with National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Chairman Jon Parrish Peede regarding the importance of the humanities in cultivating local community and broad recognition of the region's historical heritage, and of robust federal investment in the NEH. 
	•	Preserving our shared histories and culture is crucial for future generations.  
	•	As Ranking Member on the House Appropriations Committee, I secured nearly $153 million for the NEH in the Fiscal Year 2018 omnibus spending bill, an increase of $3 million over the previous year's funding level, despite the President's efforts to end the Endowment.   
	•	I will continue working to protect federal investments in critical cultural and arts programs that benefit residents of the Lower Hudson Valley. 
Helping a Constituent Secure Overdue Retirement Pay 
A constituent contacted me after he tried for two years to have the Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) assign his late father's retirement pay to his sister with disabilities, as his father requested. In response to my inquiry, the DFAS apologized for the hardship caused by the delay, sent the retroactive payment of $40,720, and began monthly payments of $1,426.

10/19/18 14:46,Legislative update: Two bills signed into law,"
October 19, 2018

Dear Friends, 

I wanted to take a moment to update you about two of my bills that were recently signed into law. The first is the Sports Medicine Licensure Clarity Act, which was signed into law by President Trump on October 5th. 

I introduced the Sports Medicine Licensure Clarity Act to provide legal protection for sports medicine professionals who cross state lines with their high school, college, or professional teams. These sports medicine professionals - such as physical therapists, physicians, or athletic trainers - are licensed in their home state but previously had to obtain a license in each of the other states in which their teams participate. After passage of the Sports Medicine Licensure Clarity Act, they now only need to carry their home state license in order to provide care for athletes competing across state lines.

If you have a child who plays on a youth or college sports team that travels, the Sports Medicine Licensure Clarity Act could help them receive better care during their games. This bill received broad bipartisan support in the House and Senate, and I was proud to see President Trump sign it into law earlier this month. 

￼
The Sports Medicine Licensure Clarity Act will help physical therapists like those at KORT in Bardstown. I visited them earlier this month to tell them about my bill. 

President Trump also recently signed my bill to reauthorize the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) into law. Sadly, last year NCMEC received more than 27,000 reports of missing children. This legislation updates programming at NCMEC to reflect the latest research and technology, and it ensures continued federal support of efforts by state and local entities to recover missing and exploited children. You can read more about my bill, which President Trump signed into law on October 11th, here. 

Some of you may be interested to learn that I recently cosponsored the Equal Treatment of Public Servants Act. This bill will help certain public servants who also pay into Social Security in addition to a state pension. You can read more about this bill from Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and Texas Senator Ted Cruz here. 

Over the past two weeks, I have enjoyed the chance to meet with Second District residents to get their feedback on a number of issues facing the Commonwealth and our nation. As chairman of the Workforce Development Subcommittee, I have appreciated hearing from both employers and employees about how to best help Kentuckians find jobs. My bill, the APPRENTICE Act, will expand apprenticeship opportunities - one way to help people learn skills for available jobs.  

￼
I visited Ken-Tron Manufacturing in Owensboro on October 5th, National Manufacturing Day. Manufacturing employs over 250,000 Kentuckians, and as chairman of the Workforce Development Subcommittee, I think it is important to help people learn new skills to get these great jobs. 

One of my top priorities as a member of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee is expanding cellular and internet service in rural parts of the Second District. Expanding service will help attract businesses and residents to the Second District. I was grateful that Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Commissioner Mike O'Rielly took the time to visit the Second District with me to hear directly from stakeholders about what more can be done to expand service. 

￼
Commissioner O'Rielly and I had the opportunity to visit Bluegrass Cellular in Elizabethtown. 

As we approach the holiday travel season, know that my office can help sort out any issues you may have with your passport. If you ever need help with a federal agency, please contact my Bowling Green district office at (270) 842-9896 or at guthrie.house.gov.

10/19/18 14:19,Blaine’s Bulletin: Blatant Intimidation and Bias Have No Place in American Government,"￼ 
October 19, 2018

BLAINE'S BULLETIN

As a former community banker, I had the amazing opportunity to work with many members of our community on their journey to the American dream. Whether it’s the first loan to open a small business or credit to hire more workers, financial institutions are critical partners for individuals and businesses as they strive to achieve success through hard work and dedication. 
For the last five years, I have fought to end the Obama Administration’s ideologically driven initiative to kill legitimate businesses, aptly named “Operation Choke Point.” In this unprecedented initiative, unelected bureaucrats at the Department of Justice, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and other agencies set out to kill legal businesses by starving them of access to financial institutions.
Last week, our worst fears were realized, despite the previous administration’s attempts to defend its actions. Newly-unsealed court documents revealed additional compelling evidence exposing the vindictive bureaucrats who crusaded against legitimate businesses such as gun stores and certain lenders.
In one example of blatant intimidation, a bank terminated their relationship with a legal business after threats from the FDIC. The bank eventually surrendered to the pressure, and when the bank notified the FDIC of the decision, they admitted that a risk assessment “pose[d] no significant risk to the financial institution, including financial, reputation, and legal risk,” yet they still terminated the banking relationship.
The evidence is astounding. As a former examiner, I find it appalling that senior government officials would not only allow but encourage this type of irresponsible behavior. The intimidation tactics and implicit bias employed by these unelected bureaucrats stands in direct opposition to the important missions of the agencies. It is also unfathomable that some of the bureaucrats named in these newly-released documents still have their jobs.
Early this week I sent letters to FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams and Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting urging them to investigate this matter and take immediate and firm action against any member of their staff who has abused their power. I hope Chairman McWilliams and Comptroller Otting will restore the integrity of their agencies by removing those who weaponized their authority to attack businesses that have done nothing wrong.
This is not a partisan issue. The House passed my legislation to end Operation Choke Point once and for all by a strongly bipartisan vote of 395-2, and I am hopeful the Senate will act as well.
I am appalled by the blatant intimidation, coercion, and bias employed by unelected government officials to play politics with the livelihood of Americans. No matter your ideological leanings, the government should not be able to destroy all that you have worked for in pursuit of the American dream. We have a duty to ensure American businesses are never again subject to despicable abuses of power like Operation Choke Point.

Dear Lindsey, 
Did you see what Senator Mitch McConnell said this week? 
After passing the biggest tax scam in history -- taking from the poor and lining the pockets of the rich -- Republicans want to pay for it out of YOUR Social Security and Medicare. 
And that’s not all. They’re trying to push 4 million children and seniors off of nutrition assistance. They want to kick 22 million people off Medicaid. 
If you’re poor or elderly in the GOP's America, you’re out of luck. 
We can’t let them get away with this. 
There are tens of millions of Americans who are barely making ends meet. 
Teachers are working second and third jobs. 4 in 5 Americans don’t have enough in their retirement accounts to get by for more than a year. Everyday families are struggling to afford their prescriptions, groceries, and rent. 
But, at the same time, the rich are just getting richer. Wall Street is hauling in record profits. And billionaires are rigging the system even further in their favor. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. Everyone should all be able to live, work, and retire with security and dignity. 
We can and must do better for the people.  
As always, I am here for you. You can reach my East Bay office at (510) 763-0370 or connect with me via email, facebook, twitter, and Instagram. 
In solidarity,

10/19/18 12:51,Bergman Sends Bipartisan Letter requesting $74 Million for New Soo Lock in FY2019 Work Plan," 
  
￼

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  Oct 19, 2018
CONTACT: James Hogge 231-640-9158


Bergman Sends Bipartisan Letter Requesting $74 Million to Begin Construction on Soo Locks

Washington - Following House and Senate authorization to fund a new Poe-sized Lock in Sault Ste. Marie, Congressman Jack Bergman, joined by Congressman John Moolenaar, Congressman Paul Mitchell, and Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, sent a letter to Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney and the Army Corps of Engineers, requesting $74 Million be included in the FY2019 work plan to begin construction of a new Lock. Rep. Bergman issued the following release:

""While we've made great strides since taking office, there is much work ahead to ensure construction of a new Lock in Sault Ste. Marie. Last week I led a bipartisan letter requesting $74 Million be budgeted for the FY2019 work plan, to begin construction on a new Lock. By beginning one shipping season earlier, this measure would save taxpayers nearly $30 Million  in costs. "" said Rep. Bergman. 

The letter in its entirety can be found below:
We write to you regarding the Army Corps of Engineers fiscal year 2019 (FY2019) work plan and urge you to include funding for the construction of a new lock in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. Ensuring the Soo Locks are safe, reliable and efficient, now and into the future, is vital to our economy and national security of the United States. 
As confirmed by the New Soo Lock Economic Validation Study Report released in June 2018, the Soo Locks are the linchpin of the Great Lakes Navigation System. Critical supply chains that support billions of dollars in economic activity and millions of jobs in the agricultural, automotive, manufacturing, and mining sectors rely on a single engineering marvel – the Poe Lock. On average, 80 million tons of cargo transit the Soo Locks annually and last year alone the Poe Lock handled 89-percent of the total tonnage. The need for a second Poe-sized lock was first identified and authorized in 1986. To this day, that need remains – as identified by President Trump in April 2018. 
Construction of a second Poe-sized lock is necessary and prudent to ensure the resiliency and long-term reliability of the Soo Locks thus reducing the risk of a catastrophic failure, which would reverberate throughout the supply chain and affect every state. While we commend the men and women who keep the nearly 50-year old Poe Lock operating, it is critical we reduce the risk associated with a single point of failure. Specifically, we urge you to include $74 million in the FY2019 work plan for the construction of a second Poe-sized lock. According to the Corps, this will allow design efforts to resume and construction to begin one shipping season earlier with a cost savings of approximately $30 million.
The Soo Locks are Nationally Critical Infrastructure due to their economic importance and impact on national security. We urge you to include $74 million in the FY2019 work plan to resume design efforts and begin construction of a second Poe-sized lock. We believe you will understand the critical importance of the Soo Locks. We appreciate your consideration and commitment to this project.

ADDRESSING THE OPIOID CRISIS 
Dear Friend,
The opioid crisis has impacted communities across the country, including here in Washington. In the United States, more than 115 people die every day from opioid misuse. But Washington state has lowered opioid overdoses since last year, due in part to expanded treatment and increasing access to life-saving medicine. This is promising news for Washingtonians. 
Recently, Congress took a major step in addressing the opioid crisis by passing meaningful legislation that expands treatment options and combats illicit drug importation. Included in this legislation were two bills that I introduced, the  Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act and the Combatting Opioid Abuse for Care in Hospitals Act. The Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act (H.R. 5723) requires the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) to evaluate and report on adverse payment incentives that lead to the over prescription of opioids and underutilization of non-opioid alternatives in the hospital setting. The Combatting Opioid Abuse for Care in Hospitals Act (H.R.5774) requires the Department of Health and Human Services to provide hospitals with guidance on strategies for pain management and preventing opioid-use disorder for Medicare patients who receive treatment at the hospital. It also requires the establishment of two technical expert panels to review medical care quality measures and make recommendations on best practices for pain management and reducing opioid use in surgical settings. 
Too many people are suffering from addiction that started from an opioid prescription when an alternative might have been available, including a gentleman I met who became addicted at age 17 simply because he was prescribed opioids when he had his wisdom teeth removed. We know that 80 percent of patients who undergo minor surgery are prescribed opioids at discharge which is an independent risk factor for chronic opioid use. This is problematic because ten percent of patients prescribed opioids for long term use develop an opioid use disorder. I am hopeful that my bills will provide the answers we need to reformulate our payment policies so that hospitals are given the right incentives and alternative strategies for pain management are more available. 
Opioid addiction is a national crisis that requires a comprehensive approach. There is no one fix, but it requires collaboration between law enforcement, public health leaders, and medical professionals. These bills are a step in the right direction, by helping families and strengthening communities.
As always, my office is here to serve you. If you have questions or comments about the topics that matter most to you, I encourage you to contact me through my website. You may also keep up-to-date on what I’m doing by following me on social media or signing up for my eNewsletter.

Dear Friend, 

It has been another great week in the 7th District and I wanted to give you all a brief update on what has been happening.  

Addressing the Opioid Epidemic
On Wednesdsay it was my privilege to take part in a forum with Chesterfield Sheriff Karl Leonard and some of the people he is helping battle opiod addiction. Sheriff Leonard has become one of the leading voices in the district for his efforts combating the opioid epidemic and for the work he has done to help addicts find recovery. As a Member of Congress, one of the best parts of my job is that I get to hear from people who have gone through the worst of the human experience, have come out the other side with hope, and are rebuilding their lives. I was grateful for the opportunity to have a thoughtful and open dialogue with these individuals on overcoming difficult circumstances and how to best find a support system as they continue to get better..
I am doing my part in the fight and have put forward legislation addressing this crisis. I am proud my bill was included in the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act which passed the House and Senate and was sent to the President’s desk to be signed into law. I have also introduced legislation to get more money to recovery programs that are working to help fight this epidemic. Opiod abuse is affecting our loved ones and the communities we live in, but we are even tougher and must continue to fight back.           
             ￼    ￼
    
Other Events Around the District 
Thursday I had the privilege of attending Mission Tomorrow, a career exploration event held for over 12,000 middle schoolers in the 7th district. Mission Tomorrow offers information on various CTE programs, jobs and careers – piquing interest in fields of study early so kids know more about their options.

                         ￼      ￼

                                                   ￼

I enjoyed a luncheon with a group of people who support the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. They hosted Harlem Globetrotter Melvin Adams and discussed how to best unite two passions, faith and athletics.

                          ￼     ￼

I had the privilege of speaking at Powhatan High School and was able to answer questions from the students. After nearly two decades as a professor, I know how important it is that our students are given the space to ask questions and take an active role in our government and society. I am particularly pleased to share with our kids that the economy is booming and producing jobs for them when they graduate. 

    ￼

On Wednesday I attended the Chesterfield Chamber of Commerce ribbon cutting ceremony. Thank you for supporting the business community in the 7th District. I am proud of the work we have done to cut through bureaucratic red tape and help grow our local businesses.

10/19/18 10:12,My op-ed in the Asbury Park Press,"

Dear Neighbors, 
The following op-ed appeared in the Asbury Park Press this week. I thought you'd be interested in my thoughts on the future of our health care system.   Sincerely,  
Congressman Frank Pallone, Jr. 
President Trump’s Disgraceful Health Care Lies
By Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr. 
President Trump has no problem telling a lie. But last week the President wrote a brazen opinion piece for USA Today on health care that took his lies to a new level.  The piece so thoroughly distorted the facts that one has to wonder if there is anyone left in the White House who values the truth.  
For two years, President Trump and Congressional Republicans have worked together to undermine our nation’s health care system. Congressional Republicans have repeatedly attacked Medicare and Medicaid. They tried, unsuccessfully, to strip away health care coverage from more than 24 million Americans, including 500,000 here in New Jersey. 
And now President Trump wants to eliminate protections for 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. 
Understandably, this is not a record that President Trump wants to promote. But rather than changing his ways, he’s once again trying to distort reality.     
President Trump is not being honest when he writes that Democrats want to gut Medicare for America’s seniors.  That could not further from the truth. We want to protect and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid.
If Democrats take back the House, we’ve already committed to strengthening Medicare and making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors.  We would do this by giving the federal government the ability to negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical companies on behalf of seniors on Medicare. This is already being done by the Department of Veterans Affairs and through Tricare, the Military’s health care plan. It’s a commonsense proposal that Congressional Republicans have unfortunately repeatedly opposed. We’re committed to finally getting it done for seniors.   
Congressional Democrats will also continue to fight House Republicans ongoing attacks to slash funding for Medicare and Medicaid. Over the last two years, House Republicans have proposed budgets that would have cut almost $500 billion from Medicare and more than $1 trillion from Medicaid. Today, seniors who need long-term care rely on Medicaid for support, and these Republican proposed cuts would seriously risk that ongoing support.  We should be looking at ways to strengthen long-term care support for seniors not undermine it through these draconian cuts.   
And Republicans are now considering additional cuts to Medicare and Medicaid in order to pay for their $1.5 trillion tax scam that disproportionally benefits the wealthy and corporate interests.  The tax law also dramatically hurts New Jersey families by limiting state and local tax deductions. But now Congressional Republicans and members of the Administration are using the tax law as another reason to target future cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. Congressional Democrats are simply not going to let that happen. 
The President is also lying when he claims he’s protecting people with pre-existing conditions.  In June, his own Administration asked a federal court to strike down key patient protections included in the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  If successful, the Trump Administration’s action would eliminate protections that ensure more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions cannot be denied coverage.
One of the key points of the ACA was that insurance companies could no longer discriminate against anyone who had a pre-existing condition. Before the law, insurers could outright deny or limit insurance coverage to people with pre-existing conditions like cancer, Multiple sclerosis, bipolar disorder or sleep apnea. They could also charge outrageously high premiums that made insurance virtually unaffordable.
Last year, Republicans failed to strip these protections away when they were unsuccessful in repealing and replacing the ACA.  But now, the Trump Administration is trying it again. This time through the courts. 
If Democrats are fortunate to take back the House next month, we will protect coverage for the 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. We will strengthen and improve the ACA by reversing the most egregious efforts by the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans to sabotage our nation’s health care system. We will also take bold action to reduce the costs of health care and prescription drugs, while also protecting and strengthening Medicare and Medicaid.  
It’s time for Washington to work again for the people, and that will happen in a Democratic House.

10/18/18 19:46,rebuilding our military and caring for our veterans,"
 
￼

Hello, 
Yesterday, I was with military families at Fairchild Air Force Base for my 9th annual Military Family Summit.
In case you missed it in the Spokesman-Review:
""With more than 100 years of family members serving in the military, [Secretary of the VA] Wilkie appeared at Fairchild at the invitation of U.S Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who has been organizing the Family Military Summits since 2009.
""I've said before, in order for America to be a diplomatic power, it needs to be a military power,"" McMorris Rodgers said. ""In order to be a military power, it needs to be an economic power. It's all connected. And the military families are the basis behind every part."" 
CLICK HERE to read the full story in the Spokesman.
When someone joins the military, it's not just a job--it's a family commitment to our country. That's why our focus at the Summit yesterday was on families serving at Fairchild and some of the most important issues they face.
More Job Opportunities for Military Spouses: Did you know that the unemployment rate among military spouses is historically higher when compared to the general population? With more than 7 million jobs available in America, more work needs to be done to help military spouses find a good-paying job, especially when they relocate.
Last year, I worked on a provision that is now law for spouses to be reimbursed for new licenses due to a move. For instance, if a military family is reassigned to Fairchild, and a husband or wife of a service member needs a nursing license in Washington state, they can be reimbursed for that cost up to $500. It's just one way I've worked to knock down a barrier to employment that is unique to military families.
Building a Stronger Military: Families deserve every assurance that their loved ones serving in the military are safe and that they have the training and equipment they need to do their jobs. Unfortunately, our armed forces had been overstretched, undertrained and depleted. Our military was forced to do more with less. It created a readiness crisis that has jeopardized our troops' lives and threatened our national security. That's why, in addition to increasing troop pay with the largest increase in nearly a decade, we've kept our promise to rebuild the military. 
	•	I supported legislation to fund the Pentagon for a full year -- on time. 
	•	I supported the largest year-to-year increase in military funding in 15 years, including $34 billion to support military families. 
	•	I also helped secure 12 more tankers for Fairchild and worked to expedite their delivery. This squadron of tankers will make Fairchild the largest tanker base in the country will make our Air Force base a center of excellence. 
Restoring Trust at the VA: In addition to providing our active-duty service members with the tools for success, I am also committed to making sure our nation's heroes are cared for when they return home. That means restoring trust and accountability at the VA. In an effort to accomplish this goal:
	•	I supported legislation funding the VA with its largest dollar amount in history. 
	•	I helped pass the VA MISSION Act, which consolidates the multiple community care programs we have in Eastern Washington, and extends the Choice Program. 
	•	I led in advocating for the reopening of our 24-hour urgent care in Spokane. 
	•	I am leading to make the Spokane VA a teaching hospital so doctors can go to medical school here in Spokane, train at the Spokane VA, and continue to serve our veterans in Eastern Washington.  
Because of these efforts, I am proud to say our military and their families are Better Off Now. If you missed 
the summit and would like to learn more, please visit my Facebook page.
Thanks, ￼ Cathy McMorris Rodgers Member of Congress

Dear Friends,  I hope you're all having a wonderful week. Let's hope the Brewers can have a great weekend and make it to the World Series!  There are a few things I'd like to update you on, so let's dive right in!
 Never Been A Better Time To Find A Job 
I'm not sure if you heard the news, but now there are more than seven million job openings across America- a new record. Thanks to our pro-growth policies that make it easier for businesses to hire workers and grow, there are a heck of a lot more ""help wanted"" signs around than even just a few years ago.  And interestingly enough, there are more than one million more job openings than there are unemployed Americans. Our economy can't afford anyone to sit on the sidelines because now is such a great opportunity to get that new job!  Click HERE or the image below to ""like"" and SHARE the good news on Facebook! 
￼   
Let's Get Our Fiscal House In Order 
I recently chatted with Fox News' Harris Faulkner about the need to reduce government spending. Like my dad always says, ""it's not how much you make, it's how much you spend."" Wisconsin families have to watch what they're spending, and so should the federal government.  Click HERE or the image below to watch part of the interview.

 Great Opportunity For College Students Or Recent Grads 
Attention college students or recent grads: my Washington DC office is now accepting applications for Spring internships. It's a great way to serve your community and learn new skills.   For more information on the internship, click HERE or the photo below. Also be sure to share these opportunities with any interested students!

LEGISLATION
 
Dear Friend: 
President to sign Greg Walden’s Bill to Combat Opioid Crisis into Law 
After months of bipartisan work, more than 60 pieces of legislation, and dozens of hearings in the House and Senate, my comprehensive legislation to combat the opioid crisis will be signed into law in the coming days. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act incorporates the feedback I’ve heard from those on the front lines of the opioid crisis in meeting after meeting across our district.   
At more than 10 roundtables in Oregon, I’ve heard from victims, families, medical providers, treatment advocates, and law enforcement officials about what is working -- and what more needs to be done -- to get our communities on the path to recovery. That input has been crucial as we’ve worked to craft the largest Congressional effort to address a single drug crisis in history. 
￼ 
Hearing from local medical providers, community leaders, and law enforcement officials in Pendleton last week about what more can be done to combat the opioid crisis. 
Over the last week, I held four meetings, from Medford to Bend to Baker City to Pendleton, to talk with medical providers, community leaders, and law enforcement officials about how we can better work together to combat the opioid crisis in Oregon. In each meeting, I heard a similar refrain about the need for more effective treatment options, better preventative measures for our youth, and the ability to stop dangerous synthetic drugs like fentanyl from flowing into our communities. My legislation will help us make important progress on each of these fronts, but there is much more to be done. 
That’s why I’ve supported bringing additional resources into our communities to help combat this crisis. Recently, Oregon received $17 million to combat the opioid crisis. That funding includes key resources for community health centers across our district to help them stem the tide of addiction and save lives. I helped lead the effort in Congress to boost and extend funding for community health centers in Oregon so they can continue to serve our communities, and these resources will provide them with additional tools in this fight. 
￼
Oregon to receive $17 million in federal funds to fight opioid crisis 
Oregon Rep. Greg Walden’s bill to help fight the opioid crisis could become law as soon as next week. 
The Republican from Hood River swung though Eastern Oregon to talk up the bill and hear from folks on the front lines of the drug addiction crisis. Friday morning at the Umatilla County Courthouse, Pendleton, he said the bill would provide about $17 million split between the Oregon Health Plan and local clinics to help treatment, recovery and prevention efforts and fight fentanyl and other illegal drugs. The Columbia River Community Health Services in Boardman is one of the clinics and received $295,000.

Walden Leads Congressional Effort to Bring Greater Transparency to Prescription Drug Costs
￼ 
Michele Belcher, owner of Grants Pass Pharmacy in Grants Pass, first told me about how “gag clauses” prevent pharmacists from disclosing important pricing information to patients. I recently helped pass into law legislation that will ban this troublesome practice by insurance companies.
American consumers should have the right to know how they can save money when they go to pay for their medicines. Unfortunately, so-called “gag clauses” restrict a pharmacist’s ability to inform a patient that their drug would be cheaper if they paid out of pocket than if they paid through their insurance. That is unacceptable, and I recently helped pass into law the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act and the Know the Lowest Price Act that will ban the use of gag clauses and bring patients greater transparency when it comes to their drug costs. 
I first heard about the gag clause issue from Michele Belcher, an independent pharmacist from Grants Pass, who I met with recently to discuss how the new laws will help improve how she communicates with her patients. 
Michele told me that as a pharmacist she was precluded -- under certain insurance contracts -- from telling a patient that their cash price would be cheaper than going through their insurance. Michele told me that she once even received a cease and desist letter for trying to help the parents of a child with a terminal disease access his medication. 
Gag clauses have no place in an open market and I applaud President Trump for signing these common-sense bills into law. I will continue to work alongside my colleagues in Congress and people on the ground in Oregon to increase affordability and patient choice in our health care system. 
￼ 
Walden pushes bill to rid pharmacies of 'gag clauses' 
Apparently there was a dirty little secret between the drug companies and the insurance companies about prescription costs for years. 
Pharmacists could not inform customers, other than Medicare D patients, if their drug was cheaper if they paid out of pocket versus through their insurance, because of so-called ""gag clauses."" 
Pharmacist Michele Belcher, who owns the Grants Pass Pharmacy, brought this to Oregon Rep. Greg Walden's attention.

Walden Hears from Onion Growers About Challenges Facing Oregon’s Ag Industry 
￼ 
Oregon onion growers put food on our tables and play a key role in our eastern Oregon economy. Last week, I met with the Oregon/Idaho Fruit and Vegetable Association to discuss the issues impacting their industry and tour the new Snake River Produce facility in Nyssa. I’ve worked closely over the years with this group to make sure public policy is working for them so they can continue to feed America and the world. 
That includes working with local growers to bring common sense to the Food and Drug Administration’s water quality standard in the Food Safety Modernization Act that ignores the science surrounding onion growing and unnecessarily drives up costs for growers with no benefit to consumers.  I’ve also worked to repeal the troublesome Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) rule. In meetings across rural Oregon, farmers, ranchers, and property owners have repeatedly expressed their concerns about the impact of this heavy-handed rule that threatened jobs and livelihoods across the West.
I also heard their concerns about the need for trade policies that work for them and about imports from Mexico and Peru that flood our markets.  The growers are deeply concerned about foreign growers who don’t adhere to the same food safety standards, labor standards and regulations that American growers do.  We will continue to work together to help find solutions to the regulatory issues and get better trade agreements with other countries.  
￼ 
Staying competitive 
Onion growers in Oregon, Idaho and Washington are for free trade but they want a “level playing field or fair trade.” 
That was the message given to U.S. Congressman Greg Walden, R-Oregon, during a meeting with Malheur County, Idaho and Washington onion industry leaders at Snake River Produce in Nyssa Thursday morning.

Walden Secures Klamath Drought Relief in Water Package Sent to President’s Desk 
Farmers, ranchers, and water users in the Klamath Basin have faced another challenging water year. That’s why I helped secure needed drought relief for Klamath Basin irrigators in a landmark water package that was sent to the President’s desk last week.
I included a provision in the America’s Water Infrastructure Act that authorizes $10 million annually for four years to the Bureau of Reclamation to implement groundwater pumping and other priorities for basin farmers. This will help our farmers get help for their added costs and losses this water year and will help ensure we are prepared if our farmers are hit again with similar conditions in the years ahead. 
Importantly, the underlying legislation also also included provisions to boost hydropower development in Oregon and modernize our drinking water infrastructure to ensure we have safe water to drink when we turn on the faucet. These issues have been priorities for me in Congress, and all these measures will be signed into law through the America’s Water Infrastructure Act.

Walden Applauds Senate Passage of Klamath Drought Relief in Water Package 
Representative Greg Walden (R-Hood River) today applauded the Senate passage of a landmark water package that includes funding he helped secure for drought relief for Klamath Basin irrigators. Walden included a provision in the Water Resources Development Act that authorizes $10 million annually for four years to the Bureau of Reclamation to implement needed drought relief measures for the $181 million dollar agriculture economy in the Klamath Basin. That measure passed the House of Representatives in September with Walden’s support.

Greg Walden Listens to Oregon Veterans in Malheur County
￼ 
Malheur County veterans discuss what’s working and what’s not when it comes to veterans benefits and healthcare.   
The Veteran Advocates of ORE-IDA in Malheur County serves as a resource for veterans in the area for housing, health care, and assistance at the VA. Getting Oregon veterans the care they deserve at the VA continues to be a top priority of mine in Congress, and I appreciated the opportunity to share an update on these efforts in Ontario last week. 
With my support, Congress has passed into law historic funding for the VA to clean up the backlog of claims and ensure the VA has the needed resources to give veterans the care and support they deserve. In addition, we’ve also passed into law the VA Mission Act to bolster the VA, fully fund the VA Choice Program, and give veterans timelier access to quality care through my legislation -- the VA Medical Scribe Pilot Act. 
Thank you to the Veteran Advocates of ORE-IDA for your work to help those who have worn our nation’s uniform, and thank you most of all to the veterans at last week’s meeting for your service to our country. 
￼
In local visit, Walden outlines support for veterans 
U.S. Congressman Greg Walden, R-Oregon, said he and other lawmakers are trying to make the Veterans Administration work for veterans.
Walden was speaking to local veterans and others who packed the Veteran Advocates of Ore-Ida office in Ontario Thursday morning before Walden made stops in Nyssa, Baker and La Grande. 
Click here to read more from the Ontario Argus Observer. 
In 2018 alone, I’ve already helped more than 450 Oregon veterans and their families with health care, benefits, and claims at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). If you or a loved one needs help with the VA or any other federal agency, you can reach out to my office from Oregon at 800-533-3303. I will do everything I can to get results for you. 
But veterans should not have to come to their Congressman to receive the care they deserve. That’s why I’ll continue to support efforts in Congress to make sure the VA is working for our veterans, and make sure veterans have access to the best mental health care, opioid addiction treatment, and suicide prevention programs. 
That’s all for this update. Remember, you can always keep in touch with me via email, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 
It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. Congress. 
Best regards, 
Greg Walden U.S. Representative Oregon's Second District

Dear Friends, 

On the second anniversary of the deaths of Officers Gil Vega and Lesley Zerebny, our community came together to honor the lives of two local heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice to keep us safe. 

The anniversary was a sober reminder of the importance of supporting our law enforcement officers and their families. That’s why in the wake of the deaths of Officers Vega and Zerebny, our community came together to draft and introduce bipartisan legislation to honor our local heroes: the Heroes Lesley Zerebny and Gilbert Vega First Responders Survivors Support Act. 

H.R. 5060, the Heroes Lesley Zerebny and Gilbert Vega First Responders Survivors Support Act, would update the Public Safety Officers’ Benefit (PSOB) Program so that grieving families of fallen heroes will have the support they need to pay off their debts, pursue their education, and get back on their feet. The bill continues to gain momentum with recent key endorsement from the California Police Chiefs Association, California Peace Officers’ Association, and the California Reserve Peace Officers Association. 

You can read the quotes below to learn what law enforcement advocates and organizations are saying about this legislation to provide first responders and their families with the benefits they have earned and deserve. I’d also like to share an op-ed I wrote reflecting on the service and sacrifices made by our law enforcement officers. 

I firmly believe that together, we can get this bill across the finish line and signed into law. 

Best,
￼
Raul Ruiz, M.D.
Member of Congress


“Under the current program, officers and their loved ones are deprived of their full benefits due to structural flaws in the program. H.R. 5060 would address these shortcomings, and would, among other things, double the death and disability benefits and increase the education benefit. With this legislation, our officers will be comforted to know their families will have better financial stability.” 

-David Swing, President, California Police Chiefs Association 

“The California Peace Officers’ Association commends Congressman Ruiz for introducing H.R. 5060, The Heroes Lesley Zerebny and Gilbert Vega First Responders Survivors Support Act, and we are pleased to support it. Not only does the measure serve as a reminder of the sacrifices made by public safety heroes like Officers Zerebny and Vega, but also ensures that the families that the fallen leave behind are not forgotten. CPOA urges Congress to pass this important measure on behalf of the law enforcement family in California.” 

-Sheriff Jay Varney, President, California Peace Officers Association 

“The families of public safety officers who experience the tragedy of a line of duty death or disability rely on the benefits promised to them by the PSOB Program to continue with their lives. Unfortunately, the current PSOB Program death, disability and education benefit amounts are not adequate to meet the financial needs of these families, which is why the Heroes Lesley Zerebny and Gil Vega First Responder Survivors Support Act is so important. We thank Congressman Ruiz for his leadership and commitment to this important issue and hope to see the Heroes Lesley Zerebny and Gil Vega First Responder Survivors Support Act enacted in the 116th Congress.” 

-Bill Johnson, Executive Director, National Association of Police Organizations 

“We strongly support the efforts by Congressman Ruiz to update to the Public Safety Officers’ Benefit Program, which will provide needed resources and support services of police officers and fire fighters killed in the line of duty. The bill, introduced after the line of duty deaths of Palm Springs Police Officers Leslie Zerebny and Gilbert Vega, should be a priority for passage by the next Congress. Officer Zerebny was married to a deputy from the Riverside County Sheriff's Department, and the impact of her death and that of Officer Vega continues to be felt by law enforcement and the community throughout Riverside County. Passage of this bill is an important step in honoring their memories and helping their families to heal.” 

-Bill Young, President, Riverside Sheriffs’ Association 

“I want to thank the Congressman for everything that he has done for me and my family these past two years. He has really been involved since the beginning and he didn't have to be. To push this bill is one of the best things that he can do not only for our family, but all the families across the nation who have gone through what we have been through. As it is there are so many things we are going through and thinking about and having to worry about how certain bills are going to be paid should not be one of them. Especially to those families that were living off the one income and no longer have that coming in. Thank you so much Dr. Ruiz for all that you have done for our family, the Zerebny family and the community. It does not go unnoticed and is very much appreciated.” 

-Gloria Vega, daughter of Officer Gil Vega

CLEAN WATER IS A CIVIL RIGHT
 Today marks the anniversary of the passage of the Clean Water Act, landmark legislation designed to prevent pollution into water, improve sanitation of wastewater, and conserve our nation’s wetlands.
Clean water is crucial for our health, and for sustaining farming and ranching communities. Water scarcity is projected to rise in coming years--particularly for our neighbors in southern Colorado and the western slope--which makes protections for water even more important.    Despite these concerns, the Clean Water Act is under threat. House Republicans recently passed a bill allowing for pesticides to be sprayed directly into rivers, lakes, or wetlands, and the Trump Administration has revoked rules that prevent coal companies from dumping mining debris into local streams. I believe clean water is a civil right and continue to support efforts to ensure clean water in our food and ecosystem, protect wetlands and improve water conservation.  

STANDING UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT

This week the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ civil rights organization, released their annual congressional scorecard. I’m proud to stand on the right side of history when it comes to protecting and advancing the rights of the LGBTQ community. No one should be discriminated against because of who they are, or who they love. Learn more at www.hrc.org/scorecard.

Dear Friend,  
Making Flying Unauthorized Drones Over Wildfires a Felony 
This month, I voted in favor of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act of 2018. This legislation included my provision to make the use of flying unauthorized drones over wildfires a felony. I heard directly from the brave men and women combating the wildfires across Colorado this year and after meeting with them I worked on this provision to deter the idiotic behavior of unauthorized drones being used over wildfires.

Advancing Legislation Important to Colorado's Public Lands
Recently, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, on which I serve, advanced multiple pieces of legislation important to Colorado out of committee. The Land and Water Conservation Authorization and Funding Act aims to fully fund and permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) was one of these bills. Also passed out of committee was the Restore our Parks Act. This legislation focuses on the $12 billion park maintenance backlog that prevents new investment and improvements in infrastructure to parks in Colorado and nationwide. 
Other legislation I have backed that also advanced out of committee are the Amache Study Act, that assesses the historical significance of Amache, and the Wildfire Management Technology Advancement Act of 2017, that increases firefighter safety. It also included the Pike National Historic Trail Study Act, legislation that could designate Zebulon Pike's famous route of exploration through the American Southwest, as well as the Endangered Fish Recovery Programs Extension Act of 2017, which maintains annual funding for the Upper Colorado and San Juan Fish recovery programs through 2023.

ARIA Policy Moves Forward
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has recently advanced the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018 (ARIA) out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously. ARIA serves as a generational policy framework that enhances U.S leadership in the Indo-Pacific region. This legislation demonstrates a commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific and rules-based international order while projecting American values of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Unites States has been, and will remain, a Pacific Power.   
2018 Colorado Principal of the Year
It was great having the opportunity to meet with Joe Simo on his trip to Washington. Joe is from Centennial Middle School in Montrose and is the 2018 Colorado Principal of the Year. I always appreciate meeting with educators from our great state and hearing new ideas on how to improve education in Colorado.
￼
 Improving Artificial Intelligence
I've introduced the bipartisan Artificial Intelligence (AI) Government Act that would improve the utilization of AI throughout the federal government by providing resources and direction to agencies. Better understanding of the opportunities and challenges these technologies present is crucial in bringing agencies and industry to the table to discuss government adoption of AI. 
  Meeting with Coloradans in Washington
I met with many Coloradans to discuss a variety of important, bipartisan issues recently. These discussions revolved around education, school safety, sports in academia, and issues farmers in CO are currently facing. I also was able to meet with the Colorado Bankers Association, Malachi, the Boys and Girls Club of America Youth of the Year, as well as Thomas Walsh, a member of the U.S. Paralympic Ski Team. 
Below are a few pictures from my meetings.

ISSUES 
Dear Friend, 
Last week, I released a Diplomatic Cable episode featuring former U.S. State Department Under Secretary for Political Affairs, former U.S. Ambassador to NATO, and 27 year civil servant Ambassador Nick Burns on immigration, refugee quotas, trade deals, and the overall effects of the budget cuts to U.S. diplomacy and development. You can listen to the episode on iTunes, Spotify, and Google Play. 
￼ 
￼ 
Indefinite Family Detention 
We recently learned that the Administration is shuttling hundreds of migrant children overnight to a tent city in Tornillo, Texas. In response, I wrote Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar requesting more information on these midnight runs, and whether HHS plans to open other temporary shelters for migrant children.  
While we have not heard back on this congressional inquiry yet, I toured the Tornillo shelter this week to see the conditions in which these children were being held. You can read about my visit here.  
We must continue to shed light on the issue of minors held in detention, and reuniting all those children who were separated from their parents as part of the Trump Administration’s zero-tolerance immigration policy. You can read my statement here on press reports that the Administration is mulling over its second iteration of the family separation policy. 
Honoring our Nation's Veterans 
Team Castro attended the Unaccompanied Burial of U.S. Army Veteran, Mr. John Ezba. On behalf of the San Antonio community, we thank Mr. Ezba and all Veterans for their service to our great nation. 
￼ ￼ 
District Updates 
Team Castro attended the SAStands Meeting for an update on the cite and release efforts and a Know Your Rights workshop; the centennial celebration of Woodlawn Lake Park; the Artpace Chalk It Up Festival where local artists came together to showcase their works while encouraging arts education and creativity in the SA community; and the 2018 LGBTQ Film Festival and San Antonio Coming Out Day.
￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ 
Team Castro also joined the San Antonio Charter Amendment Election panel discussion along with other citizens; the Restored by Light: Reinspired art show at Mission San Juan Capistrano; and the San Antonio Opportunity Zone Conference, on potential investment & development in 20 census tracts in San Antonio. 
￼ ￼ 
Bipartisan Avenues 
It was great to speak to the Southwestern Association of Criminal Justice conference in San Antonio about finding areas of bipartisan cooperation on criminal justice reform including body cameras and police brutality.

Dear Friend,  Exercising the right to vote is one of the most fundamental rights in our democracy. It is also one of the most hard-won, as women and people of color fought tirelessly and sacrificed greatly to access this right. 
Throughout our country's history, some have tried to limit access to the polls by conditioning the right to vote on various discriminatory requirements. Despite the progress that has been made to give more Americans a voice in our democracy, states and localities across the country have recently passed sweeping laws that disproportionately suppress the voting rights of minorities. This has been a direct result of the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted core protections from the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA). 

Every eligible voter should be able to participate in our democracy without having to face unnecessary barriers. That is why I am fighting to protect every American’s access to the polls and standing against arbitrary laws that make it more difficult for citizens to exercise this right. In Congress, I continue to support the Voting Rights Advancement Act, which restores critical measures in the VRA and strengthens voter protections for minorities. 
Without restoring many of these protections, our democracy and our country cannot continue to grow and progress. I am a firm believer that when more people participate in the civic process, our elected officials better reflect the diversity of our country.
Please know that I will never stop fighting to ensure equal access to the polls, and full participation in our American democracy.  
Sincerely, ￼  Linda T. Sánchez Member of Congress

Washington Update
Strengthening and Expanding Social Security 
Many retired Americans rely almost exclusively on Social Security for their retirement income, and this earned benefit does not adequately keep up with the rising costs they face. Although the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of 2.8 percent for 2019 represents the largest increase since 2012, there is still more that should be done to improve on Social Security's promise. That is why I recently introduced the Strengthening Social Security Act, which would change the formula used to calculate COLA adjustments to the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E). Using this more accurate reflection of the inflation affecting today's seniors will enhance the lives of millions of Americans. I also joined the recently formed Expand Social Security Caucus because I recognize that our seniors deserve a raise and I am committed to working with my colleagues to preserve this program for years to come.

Highlights from the District
￼  
Recently, I held an Understanding Medicare event with the Center for Health Care Rights to provide some useful information as we begin the period for Medicare open enrollment. Thank you to everyone who took time our their busy day to learn more about the different enrollment options and to discuss how policies at the federal level are impacting our community. Remember that Medicare open enrollment runs from October 15 to December 7. If you or a loved one has Medicare, now is the time to compare the quality of available health and drug plan options and decide if you want to select a new plan for the coming year.

Flu Season is Here 
The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health offers flu vaccines at no charge to people who do not have health insurance or whose healthcare provider does not offer flu vaccines. The following clinics are taking place in our community, so bring a friend with you and do your part to help prevent the spread of the flu.

Congresswoman Encourages More Central Ohioans to Vote 
With less than three weeks (19 days) until the 2018 General Election, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) is urging Central Ohioans and all Americans to go to the polls, vote, and have their voice heard.
On the first day of early voting in Ohio, Beatty implored a crowd gathered in front of the Franklin County Board of Elections to show up, speak out, and cast their ballot on or before November 6th. “Your voice is your vote, and your vote is your voice,” Beatty said. “To paraphrase former President Obama, ‘if you want to see real change and new leadership, don’t boo, vote!’”

Commentary: Veterans Deserve Better Than the VA’s 45,000 Job Vacancies
By Congressman Vicente Gonzalez (TX-15)
￼ 
Since its creation in 1930, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has provided medical care and services to over nine million military veterans - making the VA the largest integrated health care system in the U.S. However, limited staff and resources have restricted veterans’ access to healthcare. In 2014, it was reported that 40 veterans died in Phoenix, Arizona because of unusually long wait times. This is unacceptable.
Currently, there are over 34,000 veterans who reside in the 15th District of Texas; a large number, but small in comparison to the VA’s 45,000 vacant jobs. These 45,000 vacancies represent about ten percent of the VA’s workforce and are emblematic of a larger problem that we have the power to change. Our veterans deserve a VA that works and works for them.
It has been my goal to support members of the U.S. Armed Forces – past, present, and future. My father was a Korean War Veteran and a U.S. Merchant Marine and it has been my mission to craft legislation and enact policies that protect those who have protected this great nation.
This Congress, I have introduced and supported legislation that would allow us to chip away at inefficiencies and outdated practices, build capacity at the VA, and better serve our servicemembers. I proudly supported the VA Mission Act, which overhauls the community care program, and introduced H.R. 6281, the Veterans FAIR Act of 2018, which seeks to provide veterans with sufficient time to transition back to civilian life before committing to binding benefits plans.
If you are a veteran having an issue with the VA, or know of one in need of assistance, please – reach out to my offices at (888) 217-0261. You can also contact Wounded Warrior Fellow and Caseworker, Patrick Roberts, at Patrick.Roberts@mail.house.gov. 
To every veteran that needs assistance, there is assistance available, and I will fight to make sure you receive it.

Dear Friend, 
Since I came to Congress, I have been critical of Obamacare. As I continue to travel throughout the Seventh District, it is the number one issue I hear about. People are concerned about how they will be able to afford the skyrocketing premiums and deductibles they face under this failed policy.  President Obama promised families that Obamacare would cut premiums, but average individual market premiums more than doubled from 2013 to 2017. We were told if ""you like your plan, you can keep it,"" but 4.7 million Americans saw their plans canceled in Obamacare's first year.  Rather than admit wrong and vote to move away from Obamacare, Democrats are suggesting we add even more government to fix the mess they created. In vogue in the Democratic party is a single-payer government run plan they call ""Medicare for All."" It would be more accurate to name it ""Medicare for None."" In short, this plan is a total government takeover of your healthcare and would destroy Medicare as a program for seniors for all 1.5 million plus Virginians who count on it. It would also eliminate nearly 5 million private health insurance plans Virginians currently have. Much like the DMV, you will see long lines, poor quality care, and a decline in innovation if Democrats have their way.  What does a total government takeover of the healthcare industry cost? The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports it will cost $32 trillion and would require Washington to double your taxes to pay for it.  
￼
￼
We need to start over on health care and get it right for Virginia families. The policies from Washington should result in more insurance options at lower costs, not a total government takeover that moves us further down the road to socialism.

Thank you,

￼

Dear Friend, 
President Obama famously said in 2016 that President Trump would need a “magic wand” to get the economy to do what he was promising. It turns out he didn’t need a wand; just sensible economic policies that needed to be put in place. 
I was proud to support common-sense economic policies like the tax cuts which greatly benefitted the middle class and our small businesses. On top of that, we’ve gotten rid of numerous regulations that were crushing our economy with help from the President whose administration is doing the same at the agency level. 
Can you guess what happened as a result of those “magic” economic policies? 
On the national level, we’ve seen over 4 million new jobs created, more Americans than ever are employed, unemployment is incredibly low, poverty rates have fallen and we’re seeing the highest GDP growth rate in 14 years. 
In Missouri alone, it’s estimated that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will lead to the average household receiving a 7.1% increase in their income! Missourians have also seen a utility rate cut for 1.4 million customers and the lowest unemployment level since the year 2000. 
The optimism and confidence ratings are through the roof for small businesses. The bottom line is that things are going very, very well and across the country, the positive effects of a booming economy are being felt on a daily basis. 
So where do we go from here? 
America needs to keep moving forward. The numbers cannot be ignored and the people I talk to in North Missouri back up the statistics every single day. 
Last month, I voted to keep the tax cuts in place permanently. Along with that, all of the important deductions and credits would be permanent as well. And new investment options for families would allow them to save and grow the additional money they are seeing as a result of the tax cuts. Making sure the middle class and our small businesses continue to thrive will only lead to more economic growth. 
I’ve been saying this is what the economy needed for a long time but getting lower taxes and less regulation in place wasn’t easy. Yet, it works. And it turns out it wasn’t magic. Just common sense. It’s that kind of common sense I hope we see more of in the years to come. 

Sincerely,
￼ 
Sam Graves

Tickets for Tours in Washington, D.C. 
￼ 
Dear Lindsey, 

Washington, D.C. is a beautiful city full of history and culture, and it is my honor to help you make the most out of your visit. Touring our nation’s Capital is a remarkable experience that will certainly leave you inspired and amazed. There is no doubt you will always find something to do in D.C.  Whether walking the halls of the Capitol or paying a visit to the White House, my office can assist you in requesting tours and tickets to some of Washington D.C.’s most popular destinations.

                                 Jobs & Economy Report – September  Top Story
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics recently reported that the unemployment rate in September fell to 3.7%, the lowest level since 1969. BLS also found that, on average, 190,000 new jobs have been created in each of the past three months. This report is the latest sign that our nation’s economy is booming. Over 4 million jobs have been created nationwide since November 2016.
Montanans benefiting from surging economy
￼
http://www.tcmemt.com/
Matt and Kris Lane are owners of Tri-County Mechanical whose offices are in Helena, Butte and Great Falls. They employ over 100 people in Montana. Matt recently shared that in 25 years he has never seen their business do so well. He also said they have seen a large profit as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and that 100% of the tax savings has been put into new equipment, vehicles, and bonuses to their employees!
Historic Trade Deal reached
I’m also pleased that President Trump recently reached a new and improved trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. This agreement is a positive step and will help provide certainty for Montana farmers, ranchers, and businesses. Moving forward, I will continue to review the deal and work with the President to ensure Montanans have the right opportunities to succeed.
Further, President Trump has begun negotiating a much-needed trade agreement with Japan. I have long championed the need to level the playing field in Japan and other Asia-Pacific countries so that Montana farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers have greater access to these important markets.
￼
 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act - Did You Know?
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced rates across the board, doubled the standard deduction, doubled the child tax credit, and made American entrepreneurs and businesses more competitive. And contrary to the claims of opponents, it actually increased the share of federal taxes paid by millionaires, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. In short, the tax cuts law was both sweeping and fair.

Lindsey – I wanted to send you some great news.

As of today, my office has officially helped more than 11,000 constituents in Sacramento County, including returning nearly $5.5 million to local taxpayers.

Making Government Work for Sacramento County is about serving our community – it’s about helping veterans cut through red tape, making sure seniors receive their Social Security, and ensuring families get the tax refunds they were promised.

To me, this milestone is more than just a number. These are friends and loved ones right here in Sacramento County.

And we’d be honored to serve you too. Please call my office at (916) 635-0505 or visit bera.house.gov/gethelp to learn more.

￼

We’ve helped constituents like Aaron – an Iraq War veteran – finally receive his GI Bill benefits, so he could pay for school and become a paramedic. 

We helped Jon, a local small business owner, finally receive his green card after waiting for ten years so he could stay focused on his company and employees.

We helped Courtney get her passport approved, so she could attend her grandmother’s funeral.

Congress should be a place for service. And I’m committed to continuing to serve you however we can. That’s why my office can help with everything from stalled passports to veterans’ health care issues. We’re also happy to connect people with whatever resources they may need.

If you need help with the federal government, please feel free to call us at (916) 635-0505 or visit bera.house.gov/gethelp to learn more.

Be well,

10/17/18 16:21,Bipartisan step forward to combat opioid abuse epidemic,"
 
Click here to open this message in your browser    
￼ 

Dear Hoosier, 
The opioid abuse epidemic has taken the lives of too many Hoosiers, harming families and communities across our state and around the country. I’m proud to have helped the Senate take more bipartisan actions to combat this public health crisis with the passage of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which includes several provisions I introduced. President Trump is expected to sign the SUPPORT Act into law soon. To see my speech on the Senate floor about the bill click here or below. 
This bipartisan bill is an example of what we can accomplish when we work together. This bill provides important new tools to combat the epidemic, and works to ensure that those providing prevention, treatment, and recovery services in our communities have the resources necessary to help those in need of assistance. 
￼ 
To watch my recent floor speech on the SUPPORT Act, click the image above or click here.  
Some of the provisions I led that were included in the bill include: 
Substance Use Disorder Workforce Loan Repayment Act 
This provision, based on legislation I introduced with Senators Lisa Murkowski and Maggie Hassan in March, will address the ongoing shortage of professionals needed to provide treatment and recovery services. It incentivizes substance use disorder providers to work in areas that have high overdose rates or a shortage of treatment providers by providing up to $250,000 in student loan relief in exchange for up to six years of service. Investing in these providers could help save the lives of parents, siblings, friends, and neighbors that are struggling with addiction. 
Dr. Todd Graham Pain Management, Treatment and Recovery Act 
This provision, named in honor of Todd A. Graham, M.D. – a doctor in South Bend, Indiana with over three decades of service – who was senselessly murdered in 2017 after refusing to prescribe an opioid to a patient, will expand Medicare beneficiaries’ access to non-opioid alternatives for treating pain. It is based on bipartisan legislation I introduced with Senator Todd Young. 
Provisions to encourage the development of non-addictive pain treatments
As the opioid crisis continues to wreak havoc on families in Indiana, it’s clear there’s a need for new, alternative treatments for those battling chronic or acute pain. Earlier this year, Senator Young and I introduced two bipartisan bills aimed at bringing non-addictive pain medications and treatments to patients more quickly and helping clarify how the FDA approves treatments that reduce the need for opioids. I am proud that both of these important provisions were included in the SUPPORT Act. 
This bill is an important step, but we are not finished. We know it will take all of us, working together, to make more progress combating this epidemic. I am proud to represent all Hoosiers in the Senate and will continue working on bipartisan, commonsense policies to reduce the overdose rate in our state. I’m the hired help for Indiana, so if there is anything I can do, please do not hesitate to contact my office at 317-226-5555 or email me here. 
 
Sincerely, 
￼

10/17/18 15:37,VIDEO UPDATE: no more pharmacy gag clauses,"￼
Okay -- this is really exciting. The President signed my bipartisan legislation to prevent pharmacist ""gag clauses"" into law!




Here's the story: Earlier this year at a healthcare roundtable, I heard from a woman who was shocked to find her mother's prescriptions would actually cost less without her insurance -- and she was even more shocked that her pharmacist couldn't tell her that basic information.
Well, that didn't sound right to me -- so I set out to fix it. And this past week... we did!  WATCH THE VIDEO: ￼  What does this mean for Missourians? Well, now when you're at the pharmacy counter, you'll know the lowest price you can pay for your prescriptions.
I'm committed to making healthcare more affordable for Missourians, from eliminating these pharmacist gag clauses to pushing back on ""junk"" health insurance plans that could raise costs for seniors and bring back discrimination against folks with pre-existing conditions. 
I will always do what's right for Missouri - whether it's pushing for more affordable prescription drugs or protecting health insurance for Missourians with pre-existing conditions. 
Thanks for being with me in this fight.

Dear friend, 
As someone born-and-raised in western Wisconsin, I am proud to work every day on solutions for the issues that matter most to our communities.
Helping Wisconsinites Impacted by Flooding and Severe Storms My staff and I have been on the ground, touring flooded communities in our state and helping Wisconsinites begin the process of rebuilding their homes and businesses. Wisconsinites are strong, but there is no doubt that federal assistance will be needed to help everyone get back on their feet.
I have called on the President to fully support the state of Wisconsin, our communities, and our farmers, and will continue to help those in need navigate federal agencies as they seek disaster relief.  More information about how my office can help flood victims is available by visiting my website: kind.house.gov, or by calling toll-free: 1-888-442-8040. Wisconsinites are also encouraged to report home damage by calling 211, or their county emergency management offices.
Fighting for You This week I sent a letter to Alex Azar and Seema Verma, Secretary of Health and Human Services and Administrator of CMS, demanding that they provide additional Navigator funding in order to assist Wisconsin residents enroll in health insurance coverage for 2019. Only one Wisconsin organization was awarded federal funding for enrollment services this year, and the grant was cut by over 80% from prior years.
Choosing a healthcare plan can be complicated, and I want to ensure we have sufficient resources available to find coverage that works for every Wisconsinite and their family. Nobody should go without the care they need.
It’s Time for Medicare Open Enrollment  From October 15 to December 7, all Wisconsinites with Medicare can change their Medicare health plans and prescription drug coverage for the following year to better meet their needs.  If you have questions about signing up or want to talk through your options with a trained professional, call 1-800-MEDICARE or visit Medicare.gov. My office can also help connect you with the right person to find more information about plans.
Here to Help My office is available to help you work through issues with government agencies and departments. This includes getting copies of service records, receiving benefits, and cutting through government red tape. You can reach the office by calling 1-888-442-8040 or visiting kind.house.gov.
Sincerely,
￼

Friend,  
Today at 1:00 p.m. PT, Ventura County’s own Sergeant Major (Ret.) John Canley will receive the prestigious Medal of Honor – the highest military honor awarded by the U.S. government – for his heroism during the Vietnam War. You can watch a live stream of the ceremony here. Tomorrow at 11:30 a.m. PT, you can also watch a live stream of his induction into the Hall of Heroes at the Pentagon.  
I have had the great privilege to get to know Sergeant Major Canley and his family, and his dedication to his fellow servicemembers and to our country is unparalleled. He is also truly one of the most humble and gracious people I have ever met. It was my great honor to have him attend the State of the Union with me this year, which fell on the 50-year anniversary of the start of the Tet Offensive, where his extraordinary actions saved so many lives.  
In 1968, during the Battle of Hue, Sergeant Major Canley’s commanding officer was gravely wounded, so he took immediate command of his company, directing several counter attacks, saving lives, and advancing the war strategically. For his extraordinary heroism, Sergeant Major Canley received the Navy Cross, as well as two Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart.  
In 2014, one of Sergeant Major Canley’s fellow servicemembers contacted me to request that I recommend that his medal be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. My office requested a review of Sergeant Major Canley’s records, and in December 2017, Secretary of Defense Mattis sent a letter stating that he agreed that Sergeant Major Canley’s actions merit award of the Medal of Honor. However, Secretary Mattis noted that Congress would need to pass legislation to waive the five-year time limit on awarding the Medal of Honor. I authored legislation to make Sergeant Major Canley eligible to receive the medal, and it was signed into law in January. Today – at long last – he will receive the Medal of Honor. You can read more about Sergeant Major Canley’s story in the VC Star.  
We have a sacred duty to all our men and women who have served our country. That is why I will continue to make sure that Sergeant Major Canley, as well as all of Ventura County’s veterans, receive the benefits, recognition, and care that they have earned and deserve.  
If you or someone you know needs help with a federal agency, please call my office at (805) 379-1779. I am here to help.  
Sincerely,
￼

10/17/18 13:39,Poll: Term Limits for Congress,"￼ 

Poll: Term Limits
Hoosiers,

The first bill I introduced after I was sworn into office in 2017 was H.J.Res 23, which would impose term limits on Members of Congress. Specifically, this legislation would limit the number of terms that a Member of Congress may serve to four in the House of Representatives and two in the Senate.

Our government is here to serve you - not the other way around. Establishing term limits for Members of Congress would ensure a change in culture that will get us back to a Washington that serves the great people of this country instead of serving career politicians.

Question of the Week: Do you support establishing term limits for Members of Congress?

[_] Yes.
[_] No.
[_] I don't know.
[_] Other (share your thoughts).

Take the poll here.

￼
During the 2017-18 school year, 142,000 South Dakota students ate meals at school. I am glad to see President Trump recognize this week of October as National School Lunch Week. It’s incredibly important we provide healthy, desirable food to fuel our kids as they learn. 
￼ 
A few years ago, the Obama administration created a failing one-size-fits-all meal program that severely restricted meats, grains, sodium, and more without a good scientific basis for doing so. As written, meat was limited to 3-4 chicken nuggets a day and products like milk and cheese would have been difficult to serve, as they have naturally occurring sodium. I introduced legislation to push back on these guidelines, giving schools more flexibility. I'm thankful my urging resulted in added freedom from rigid nutrition standards, but it’s an issue we continue to work on.  
That’s why I’ve introduced legislation that once and for all transforms the school meal requirements into voluntary guidelines, giving local schools much-needed breathing room and allowing those closest to our kids to make decisions about our kids. 
Have a great day!

10/17/18 12:35,The VA's MISSION Act To Do List," ￼    ￼   ￼

￼
 
 
￼
 
When Montana veterans came to me with issues with the Choice Program, I listened. And I got to work with a Republican Senator out of Georgia named Johnny Isakson to write a bipartisan bill—the VA MISSION Act—that President Trump signed into law this year to deliver a better health care experience for Montana’s veterans. 

Veterans should be able to rely on their local doctors when the VA can’t deliver. That’s why we wrote the VA MISSION Act. This bipartisan law puts veterans in the driver’s seat about where to get their health care services, and it also cuts government red tape that has caused so many difficulties for Montana veterans. 

We worked with veterans, advocates and the VA to craft a bold, bipartisan compromise that scraps the Choice Program, streamlines community care, and puts medical decisions in the hands of doctors and veterans – where they should be.

And on June 6, 2018, the President signed the bill into law, calling it a “historic moment.”  

￼

From that day, the VA has a year to implement our VA MISSION Act. And every step of the way, I’ll be holding the VA accountable to use the tools we’ve given them to get the job done right. 

Now we need Montana veterans and community providers to help make sure that the VA knows what works, and more importantly, what doesn’t work, for Montanans as they craft the Veterans Community Care Program. When the VA wants veterans and community providers to weigh in, I’ll make sure that you know when and where you can tell the VA about your experience with community care.

If you have any questions about the new Veterans Community Care Program, please don’t hesitate to contact my office for answers. As always, it’s an honor to serve you in the United States Senate.

October 17, 2018 
Dear Friend,  
It continues to be a great honor to serve and represent you in the U.S. Senate. Here is a brief update on just some of the issues I’ve been working on.  
￼ 
Working Across the Aisle to Combat the Opioid Crisis 
￼ 
Joining NH leaders confronting the opioid epidemic at Farnum Center in Manchester 
Earlier this month, I joined a bipartisan majority in the Senate to pass opioid response legislation that will provide treatment providers, recovery centers, researchers, first responders, and other stakeholders with access to new tools to help save lives. This legislation is the product of months of hearings and negotiations, and builds on the bipartisan progress Congress has already made to address this crisis. It also includes key provisions that I sponsored to take on the fentanyl crisis in particular, which continues to be the main contributor of overdose deaths in New Hampshire. We still have a long way to go until we provide all those with substance use disorders the treatment and care they need, and I will continue to work across the aisle until we turn the tide of this crisis.  
In the Capitol, Putting Faces on the Opioid Crisis 
￼ 
Too often the conversation in Washington surrounding the opioid epidemic is focused on statistics. The scale of this crisis is staggering but numbers don’t tell the whole story. Anne Marie and Jim Zanfagna lost their daughter, Jacqueline, at 25 years old to an accidental overdose in October 2014. Shortly after Jacqueline’s death, Anne Marie painted a portrait of her and after showing it to a local support group began receiving requests to paint portraits of other loved ones who were lost to an overdose. These Angels of Addictions portraits facilitate grief healing through art, raise awareness of the opioid epidemic and honor those who have been lost. 
￼ 
I was honored to host the Zanfagnas and over 120 Angels of Addictions portraits in the U.S. Capitol last week. Each portrait is a deeply personal reminder of what this country has lost to the opioid crisis. The Angels of Addictions portraits reminds us who we are fighting for, and I appreciate that members on both sides of the aisle, as well as staff and visitors to the Capitol, took the time to come see the Angels of Addictions exhibit. 
￼ 
Welcoming Pastor Andrew Brunson Back to the U.S.  
I have been working across the aisle over the last year to secure the freedom of Pastor Andrew Brunson, an American held hostage in Turkey. In June I visited and met with Pastor Brunson as well as Turkish President Erdogan, whom I pressed for Pastor Brunson's release. On Friday, it was a tremendous relief to see Turkish authorities finally release him and allow him to return to the United States. His detention was an injustice but, ultimately, Turkish authorities did the right thing in releasing him. The effort to secure his release was an excellent example of bipartisan cooperation and coordination across the U.S. government. I hope that, going forward, Turkey will also release the others we have been advocating for who are wrongfully detained, so that we can further repair the relationship between our nations.
Protecting Consumers from Junk Insurance & Exorbitant Health Care Bills 
Last week I voted to reverse the Trump Administration’s new policy on short-term health insurance plans, which are also known as “junk plans.” These junk plans often deny coverage for pre-existing conditions and fail to cover maternity care and substance use treatment. They also drive up health care costs for others and threaten the stability of health insurance markets. I opposed these junk plans because they will further sabotage health care in this country. Republican leadership and the administration should be working to make health care more affordable and accessible rather than continuing to sabotage the health care marketplace for consumers. 
In addition, earlier this month I introduced legislation to combat rising out-of-pocket health costs. Families in New Hampshire and throughout the nation continue to struggle to pay their medical bills and that’s unacceptable. My bill would help fix chronic problems in our health care system by lowering costs for patients and increasing access to health services. This includes putting a cap on what hospitals and physicians can charge uninsured patients and out-of-network patients who have individual market coverage. It’s imperative that Congress take action to reduce these costs and help ensure every American has access to quality, affordable health care. 
Honoring NH Law Enforcement 
￼ 
Every year we honor members of New Hampshire’s law enforcement community for exemplary service at the New Hampshire Congressional Law Enforcement Awards (NH-CLEA) ceremony in Concord. The men and women serving in New Hampshire’s law enforcement are heroes, and it was a privilege to recognize them. I want to extend my sincere appreciation to all of these honorees, as well as their families who support them and also make sacrifices every day. I'm especially grateful for the leadership of our police officers in battling the opioid epidemic. Every day, law enforcement are saving lives and getting lethal drugs off our streets. These law enforcement awards are an opportunity to recognize and honor those lost in the line of duty -- I am eternally grateful for their sacrifice, and they will never be forgotten.

￼ 

 Home | Newsroom | Helping Iowans | Contact 

Good morning– 
Small businesses are the backbone of Iowa’s economy, making up 99% of our businesses. As a member of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, I have made it a priority to pursue pro-growth policies and help small businesses across our great state succeed.
One such effort is my support of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which has provided much needed tax relief in the form of lower tax rates for every income bracket, a new 20 percent deduction for pass-through businesses and increased opportunities for businesses to immediately write off the cost of their investments.  
Included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a piece of legislation that I cosponsored: the Investing in Opportunity Act. This encourages private investment in distressed communities, or Opportunity Zones, by allowing investors to temporarily defer taxes on their capital gains and put these dollars to work in these communities.  
It is critical that we make these tax cuts permanent, and I have cosponsored legislation that would do just that. Recently, in my Small Business Committee hearing, I had the opportunity to question our witnesses about the importance of making the small business tax cuts permanent, as well as the promise of Opportunity Zones for rural communities in Iowa.

As your voice in Washington, D.C., I am focused on creating broad-based opportunities for all, growing our economy, keeping our country strong and forward-looking, and making government work better for everyone. 
Congressman Smith in Our Community 
Growing up the son of a baggage handler at Sea-Tac Airport, I saw how my parents were able to raise a family and offer me opportunities for a bright future; in no small part because my father was a member of the Machinists union. 
The economic stability the union helped to secure for my family enabled me to build a future, just as unions continue to open the door to the American dream for families today. Organized labor is one of the most important means by which working people can push back against economic forces that are increasingly rigged against them. Read my recent op-ed in The Stand: We must restore the freedom to join together, form unions, HERE. 
￼ 
This Labor Day, I had the honor of speaking at the Martin Luther King Jr. Commemoration Committee event to honor the life and legacy of the civil rights icon. I thank the Committee for the invitation and the organizations in attendance for their work towards equality and racial justice.
Protecting Nutrition Assistance 
Thank you to local high school students who visited my office to join in calling for Congress to protect the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. Cuts to SNAP hurt the most vulnerable members of our community, children. Taking food away from children and families hurts the health and wellbeing of our entire community. 
￼ 
Local students visit the Renton, District Office to discuss SNAP 
I had the opportunity to visit Northwest Harvest’s Cherry Street Food Bank where they assist as many as 3,000 people each week. During Hunger Action Month I joined in highlighting the importance of increasing resources for food banks and programs like SNAP to address hunger & food insecurity in our community. 
￼ 
Adam visits the Cherry Street Food Bank 
  
Reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act 
My office recently held a roundtable with local Women’s Organizations such as King County Sexual Assault Resource Center, Planned Parenthood, and The Sophia Way. We discussed the need to protect healthcare for women and their families and increase support for shelters and domestic violence resources. I strongly support reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act to end the epidemic of violence against women and girls. 
￼ 
Women’s Roundtable Attendees Speak in Support of VAWA 
Support for Early Learning 
Early learning is critical to our children’s future – paving the way for their cognitive, social and emotional development. Thank you to the local parents and Puget Sound Educational Service District board members for sharing their stories with me. These personal experiences highlight why programs like Head Start are so important.

Legislative Update 
Supporting Individuals Receiving Education and Workforce Training 
For too many individuals, the barriers to receiving an education or obtaining the skills needed to succeed in this economy are insurmountable. The financial burden often goes beyond just the costs of tuition. Costs related to child care, transportation, or housing can have as much of a burden on individuals looking to gain the skills and education they need to succeed. Career and technical education and workforce training services serve as an onramp for individuals to enter the workforce and are critical to addressing our nation’s skills gap. Reducing the barriers that individuals face to obtain training and education will help ready our workforce for in-demand, good paying jobs. 
Last week, I introduced the Empowering Individuals to Succeed Through Education and Workforce Training Act. This legislation would establish a new grant program under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), dedicated exclusively to providing support services for individuals receiving workforce training and education. 
With persistent inequities in our society and an evolving economy, we must do more to help people obtain the education and skills they need to succeed. The Empowering Individuals to Succeed Through Education and Workforce Training Act will provide wraparound services, such as assistance with child care or transportation, that are needed to help individuals complete education and training programs for in-demand jobs in our economy. Whether it’s a recently unemployed worker obtaining retraining services, an immigrant receiving English language classes, or a single parent looking to attend a technical school, we need to reduce the barriers that make career and technical education and training incredibly difficult or nearly impossible for so many people to achieve. Equal opportunity for all is only possible when every person in our country can access programs leading to high-quality and good-paying jobs. 
Read more about the Empowering Individuals to Succeed Through Education and Workforce Training Act HERE. 
Protecting Social Security 
Social Security is a vital program for seniors, survivors & the disabled. As a member of the Expand Social Security Caucus, I am committed to ensuring Social Security is strong for future generations to come. This program helps give seniors the dignity they deserve. It needs to be strengthened and expanded to make sure it’s there for everyone.
￼ 
Making Social Security More Equitable for Retirees 
Earlier this month, I introduced the Social Security Equity Act, legislation to provide relief to some of those workers and retirees who see their Social Security benefits reduced because of the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP). The WEP reduces payments to many retirees who split their careers between jobs that were covered by Social Security and in positions where they earned even minimal public pension benefits. 
Hard-working Americans should not experience a significant hit to their Social Security benefits because they happened to work for an employer that provided a pension, in addition to facing low wages, inconsistent work opportunities, or the need to take time away from work. By simply changing the WEP formula, Congress can make this aspect of Social Security less regressive and allow more retirees to collect full Social Security payments.

Dignity for Detained Immigrants 
One year ago, I introduced the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act with Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. Now more than ever we need this bill so we can put an end to private contractors profiting off immoral and inhumane immigration policies. The current immigration detention system lacks even basic decency and is a stain on our values. From family separation, to mandatory detention, limited access to legal counsel, and inadequate health care treatment, the list goes on. We must act to fix this moral failure, put due process over profits, and treat all immigrants with the dignity they deserve.
The Trump Administration’s family separation policy resulted in over 10,000 young children being held in detention facilities across the country - the highest number ever recorded. Most of these privately-run facilities lack the resources to properly care for these children. Passing the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act will end private detention and allow Congressional authority to enforce standards and hold facilities accountable for the treatment of individuals in detention.
Building a More Peaceful World 
As the first woman to serve as Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright brings a unique and valuable perspective to international diplomacy and development. I recently spoke with Secretary Albright about how we can collaborate to ensure that the United States has a comprehensive national security strategy and a holistic approach to maintaining our strong partnerships around the world.

BUILD Act Passed into Law 
This month, the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) Act of 2018 was signed into law. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation that I introduced with my colleagues Congressman Ted Yoho, Senator Chris Coons, and Senator Bob Corker, will strength U.S. foreign assistance and development. 
Passage of the BUILD Act is an important step to modernizing U.S. international development finance and showing that the United States is committed to leading the international community in supporting less developed countries. This new institution will focus on sustainable, broad-based development programs supporting critically needed projects in communities across the world. It strengthens our ability to support economic growth that ensures people have the opportunity to live healthy lives and achieve their fullest potential. Make no mistake, this reform is only part of our commitment to providing help to those most in need around the world. We must take an all-in approach to our foreign assistance that includes robust direct assistance from the United States. I will continue to fight for these essential programs promoting health, peace, and stability that are vital to our national security.
The United States has a proud history of leading the international community in helping others during times of conflict, strife, and instability – times when people are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance.  Since World War II, the United States has invested and supported economic growth in countries all around the world to ensure that people have the opportunity to live healthy lives and achieve their fullest potential. Through our partnerships with friends and allies, we work to raise up local communities – strengthening institutions, combating hunger and disease, and ensuring that development projects have sustainable, long lasting impacts.

Ending U.S. Military Involvement in Yemen 
Yemen is facing the worst humanitarian crisis in the world right now that has been significantly exacerbated by the civil war. The impact of the Saudi-coalition’s actions on the dire humanitarian crisis is undeniable. This is why I have joined with Rep. Ro Khanna and Rep. Mark Pocan in introducing a War Powers Resolution to withdraw U.S. Armed Forces from engaging in the Saudi-led coalition’s conflict with the Houthis in Yemen.   
The U.S. should be aggressively pushing a peaceful solution to end this civil war instead of supporting the Saudi-led coalition military campaign that has only destabilized the crisis further. We must make it clear that U.S. should not be choosing sides in this civil war while the people of Yemen continue to suffer. 
Read more about our War Powers Resolution HERE. 
Combating Climate Change
I agree with 97% of scientists and the latest UN report: Earth’s climate is warming. We must take action today to stop the impact of climate change. 
I’m proud to have joined together with voices from around the globe in support of the Global Climate Action Summit goals. We need action at every level to make a difference in the fight to stop Climate Change. 
Constituent Services Community Outreach

Transportation Infrastructure in the Third District
Yoder Hosts Secretary Chao for an Infrastructure Tour and Roundtable Discussion 
￼ ￼ Click here to watch the coverage from KCTV5
It was an honor to have Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao here in the Third District yesterday to discuss some of the critical infrastructure needs in our community. Recently, the unemployment rate hit its lowest level in 49 years, but the continuation of this historic growth is dependent on the further development of our nation’s transportation infrastructure. Secretary Chao is leading efforts to increase federal investment into transportation infrastructure, and I am proud to be working alongside as we work to bring America's infrastructure into the 21st century. Everyone in the Third District is impacted by infrastructure, and the progress we are making will yield real, tangible benefits for the people of our community.
 
￼ Kevin with Bill Ebel, Mary Birch, Mike Hess, Tracey Osborne Oltjen, Secretary Chao, Mayor Carl Gerlach, Richard Backlund, and Moktee Ahmad
We kicked off the Secretary's visit with a bus tour of US-69 Highway. Together, we got a firsthand view of the congestion that is increasing on this crucial artery. We were joined by Overland Park Mayor Carl Gerlach, who briefed the Secretary on US-69's importance to Overland Park and the rest of the Third District. Secretary Chao and I discussed how proposals to widen the highway and build new interchanges will pay major dividends in the local economy. 
 
￼ Kevin and Secretary Chao leading the roundtable discussion
After the tour, we moved into a larger roundtable discussion where we heard from local leaders about infrastructure needs from across the district. Infrastructure across the Third District relies on support from the local, state, and federal level, and I am working to do my part to make sure the federal government upholds its end of that deal. That is why I was proud to support the critical investments made in the Fiscal Year 2019 Transportation and HUD Appropriations bill, which was passed by the House Appropriations Committee earlier this year. I also voted in favor of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act that was signed into law recently. 
We also talked about innovation in infrastructure that can help bring more safety and efficiency to our transportation system. Autonomous vehicles, drones, and alternative fuels are all part of the future of transportation, and some of the cutting-edge work on these technologies is being done right here in Kansas.
 
￼ Kevin with Secretary Chao, Mayor Don Roberts, Mayor David Alvey, and Mayor Carl Gerlach
I was glad to have several mayors from our area join the discussion, including Overland Park Mayor Carl Gerlach, KCK Mayor David Alvey, Olathe Mayor Pro Tem Jim Randall, and Edgerton Mayor Don Roberts. They discussed transportation needs and challenges specific to each of their communities. Mayor Alvey shared about ongoing efforts to improve the Turner Diagonal interchange in KCK, an effort that continues to be one of my top priorities. Mayor Pro Tem Randall outlined congestion challenges at the I-35 and 119th Street interchange in Olathe, which is one of the busiest interchanges in the region and growing busier every day. Edgerton Mayor Roberts discussed how exciting business investment in Edgerton, like the state-of-the-art BNSF intermodal facility, is increasing traffic to the area and posing new traffic issues. I was glad to help connect our local leaders with the Secretary and facilitate future cooperation between the federal and local levels on grants and projects.
I would like to thank Secretary Chao for visiting the Third District and taking the time to hear about our exciting growth, as well as our challenges and obstacles. Thank you to the mayors of our local communities for your participation and your daily hard work to make your cities the best they can be. Finally, thank you to the Overland Park Chamber of Commerce for facilitating this productive discussion. 

Third District Transportation Facts
 
US-69 through Overland Park is one of the busiest highways in the state of Kansas. 
This highway is 50 years old, crash rates are higher than normal, and commute times on US-69 are projected to more than double in coming years.
 
The Transportation Appropriations bill includes:
increase of $2.76 billion in funding for highways and bridges;
strong funding for the BUILD grant program at $750 million, which is 50% than in most past years;
increased funding for highway safety through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
 
The FAA Reauthorization Act extends for five years, representing the longest authorization period for FAA programs since 1982.

Manchin's Mountain Message
The Passing of Delegate Frank Deem and Coach Joe Retton 
This past week our home state lost two outstanding individuals, 48-year legislative veteran, Delegate Frank Deem and legendary Fairmont State Basketball Coach, Joe Retton.
Frank Deem devoted his life to serving the people of West Virginia. As a Navy Veteran, a former senator, a delegate, as a family man, and a friend, he was devoted and compassionate. He leaves behind a legacy of unparalleled leadership and dignity and he is truly missed.
Coach Jo-Jo Retton was well known as a successful coach and a talented athlete in his own right. But I learned more from him about respect, generosity, and strength of character than I ever did about basketball. He was a mentor throughout my life and a staunch advocate for the people of West Virginia. This is a huge loss to Marion County and to our entire home state. Gayle and I join each of you in praying for Retton family as they mourn the loss of this incredible man.
It was an honor and privilege to submit both Frank and Joe's legacies to the Congressional Record as a part of history, forever. 
  
Key Federal Resources
$4.9 Million Announced for Airports in Parkersburg and Beckley 
The Raleigh County Memorial Airport (BKW) in Beckley and the Mid-Ohio Valley Regional Airport (PKB) in Parkersburg will receive $4,962,541in funding through the Department of Transportation (DOT) Alternate Essential Air Service program (AEAS).  The two airports have formed a partnership to enter into a contract with Contour Airlines, which will serve both communities to the same hub, Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT).
Our airports in West Virginia are an important source of economic activity in our state. Air travel is critical for economic growth and our state’s tourism industry. Ensuring that Beckley and Parkersburg have safe, reliable air service will open up the two cities and their surrounding regions to more visitors and new economic opportunities. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Transportation Subcommittee, I always have our West Virginia airports in mind and will continue to ensure they receive the funding they need to grow.
  
$4.4 Billion for Water Infrastructure 
Last week I secured an authorization of $4.4 billion in appropriations for capitalization grants awarded to state drinking water revolving loan funds in the America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018. The appropriations will be distributed over three years: $1.174 billion in the fiscal year 2019, $1.3 billion in the fiscal year 2020, and $1.95 billion in the fiscal year 2021. 
I’m proud the Senate was able to come together to pass this common sense legislation to prioritize water infrastructure across our country. West Virginia has an estimated $1.16 billion in drinking water infrastructure needs that will have to be addressed in the next 20 years. This bipartisan legislation will support rural communities working to improve and repair both their drinking water systems. Every West Virginian deserves access to clean water and I’m proud to have fought for this funding to ensure every community has that access.

10/16/18 16:59,Manufacturing in Mississippi,"￼ 
October 16, 2018

Dear Friend, 

Every day, hardworking Mississippians demonstrate a strong commitment to their employers through the products they manufacture.  Companies come to our state for our workforce which helps them achieve their production goals.  Combine this valuable asset with a fast moving economy and you have a recipe for growth.  As one expansion after another is announced, more people are needed to fill new positions.  Recently, our state and nation recognized National Manufacturing Day to bring awareness to the changing world of manufacturing.  In the First District and across the nation, companies are offering good-paying jobs that require skills which can be easily obtained at your local community college.

￼

On Manufacturing Day, a number of Mississippi companies opened their doors to give students a closer look at their operations.  ABB in Columbus invited East Mississippi Community College students for a tour of the facility and an opportunity to talk with their team members.  They were shown how ABB assembles electric motors from start to finish.  Dr. Jim Huerkamp, EMCC Workforce Director, said the tour is one of many that EMCC organizes to give students insight into career opportunities in manufacturing that are available in the district.  ""EMCC has been working for years to change the perception that many people have about a career in manufacturing,"" Dr. Huerkamp said.  ""We have had a great response from the student participants.""
                                
￼
                                
Ken Lawrence, ABB Human Resources Business Partner, said Manufacturing Day presents a great opportunity to get students interested in modern manufacturing.  ""It is a different world now than it was even ten years ago,"" Ken said.  
                                
IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITIES CAREER EXPO

When you were in the eighth grade, were you aware of the career opportunities that were available in your own backyard?  There are numerous career pathways in Mississippi.  It is just a matter of choosing a career path and obtaining the training and education that employers require.  The Imagine the Possibilities Career Expo gives students an opportunity to talk with people about their professions in a highly-charged atmosphere, filled with demonstrations and real-world information.

￼

The expo, held at the BancorpSouth Arena in Tupelo, featured 18 career pathways including aerospace, agriculture, engineering, health science, information technology, manufacturing, transportation, hospitality, and tourism.  In all, 7,000 eight graders from 17 northeast Mississippi counties attended.
                                            

NATIONAL WOMEN'S SMALL BUSINESS MONTH

October is National Women's Small Business Month.  This is an opportunity to recognize the 11.3 million women-owned businesses across America.  In Mississippi, women business owners have and continue to be valuable contributors to the economy.  Unprecedented tax cuts and regulatory reform will serve to encourage more Mississippians like Angele Mueller to become entrepreneurs.

￼
Angele, Meredith, Pete, and Caroline Mueller

Angele has always enjoyed cooking for family, friends, and her church.  In 2002, Angele decided to take her talent in the kitchen to the next level.  She opened the Tallahatchie Gourmet restaurant in downtown New Albany.  Last year, Angele decided to open a second Tallahatchie Gourmet in Oxford.  She provides jobs to 50 First District residents.  I look forward to seeing her business continue to thrive.  Through my role on the House Small Business Committee, I will continue to push for more policies that will reduce regulations and make it easier to do business in Mississippi and across the nation.
                                            

ACADEMY DAY 2018 

There was a great turnout for Academy Day 2018.  Middle and high school students came to Oxford on Saturday to learn more about serving our nation as an officer in the U.S. Military.

￼

Every year, it is an honor and a privilege to nominate young people from the First District who want to attend one of America's prestigious military academies.  For many of them, their journey began by attending Academy Day where they met with Service Academy and ROTC representatives.  The stories they share with those in attendance are inspiring and provide a great deal of insight into each branch of the U.S. Military.

CADET WILLIAM IKERD

Cadet William Ikerd, a 2015 Tupelo High School graduate, is a senior at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.  Cadet Ikerd said he always envisioned himself serving our nation.  He also loves to play baseball and was a standout player in high school.  Fortunately, military academies are known to have good baseball programs.  ""I went up there and was fortunate enough to play for the Army Baseball Family,""  Cadet Ikerd said.  ""I played for the first half of my time at the Academy and now I focus on Civil Engineering.  I need every minute of my time for that, trust me!  I am so grateful that I have the opportunity to go to West Point and represent Mississippi's First Congressional District.""

￼
 Cadet Ikerd with his parents,
Beth and Will Ikerd, Jr.

Cadet Ikerd enjoys sharing his story with others.  ""The friendships you form here will last a lifetime,"" Cadet Ikerd said.  ""The new brothers and sisters that you will get here are selfless, full of integrity, and are more driven to succeed than you can imagine.  It is going to take commitment.  Every day is a competition, but Mississippians are known to compete with the best of them!""
                                            

CADET JESSICA FREDERICK

Cadet 2nd Class Jessica Frederick is a junior at the United State Air Force Academy.  She reported to USAFA on June 30, 2016.  Cadet Frederick said being at the Air Force Academy is not easy, but the experiences, memories, and friendships she has made during her cadet career have been incomparable with any other experiences that she would have had at a civilian university.  ""Although Basic Cadet Training (BCT) was difficult, the challenges I faced during that time has made me a stronger person and taught me just how important being a team player is,"" Cadet Frederick said.  ""The classes are rigorous, but the professors are fantastic and truly want to see you succeed.""

￼

During her cadet career, Cadet Frederick participated in the Jump Program at USAFA.  This prestigious program involves learning how to jump out of an airplane in just two weeks, and is the only program in the world where the first jump is made completely solo.  She has also traveled to Misawa Air Force Base, Japan, to experience the operational side of the Air Force.  Cadet Frederick is currently pursuing a Behavioral Science degree at USAFA, and plans to pursue a career in the Air Force as an intelligence officer.  She has advice for others who want to attend a Service Academy.  ""If attending the Air Force Academy is your goal, then do everything possible to try to accomplish this dream,"" Cadet Frederick said.  ""As long as you rely on the team members surrounding you, you can accomplish anything. Aim high!""                                             
                                                                                        

MIDSHIPMAN STEADMAN HARRISON

Midshipman Steadman Harrison, a 2018 Tupelo Christian Preparatory School graduate, is a freshman at the United States Naval Academy.  This new environment is both challenging and rewarding for MIDN Harrison.

￼

""My time at USNA has been exhilarating,"" MIDN Harrison said.  ""It is truly unlike any other college out there.  I am pressed to do my best and develop myself daily.  Being at the Academy is exactly as challenging as I expected.  The bar is always a step or two out of reach and I am always one or two hours of sleep behind.  But all the other midshipmen here have your back and are striving towards the mission of moral, mental, and physical development right there beside you.""

CADET BENTON BARBER

Cadet Benton Barber, a 2015 Tupelo High School graduate, is a senior at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.  Cadet Barber said the lessons he has learned during his time at the Academy have been invaluable and unique. 

￼

""I have been granted opportunities that I could only have dreamed of had I attended another institution,"" Cadet Barber said.  ""As a leader and a future officer, I am humbled by my commission to lead soldiers as an officer and excited for the challenges that I am prepared to face.  I highly encourage all high school students interested in military service to apply to the United States Military Academy.""


Upon graduation, Cadet Barber plans to complete the Basic Officer Leadership Course (BOLC) at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.  After completion of the BOLC, he hopes to be stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, with the 101 Airborne Division and serve as a Field Artillery Officer.

Congressman Cook Founds the Stop Sanctuary Laws Caucus
Congressman Cook announced the creation of the Stop Sanctuary Laws Caucus with fellow Representatives Doug LaMalfa (CA-01), Tom McClintock (CA-04), and Mo Brooks (AL-05).  Congressman Cook said, “We’re witnessing a disturbing growth of so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies within districts and states where states and local governments attempt to limit their cooperation with the federal government in enforcing immigration law. These sanctuary policies are ill-conceived and are unconstitutional. They allow dangerous criminals to prey on the innocent, endangering the lives of legal residents and the very immigrant communities they purport to protect. We started this caucus to ensure there is a clear voice in Congress to counter these dangerous policies.”   The foundation of the Stop Sanctuary Laws Caucus is built on the following beliefs:
	•	Immigration is a federal issue not subject to the ideological whims of states or local governments.
	•	Every violent crime against legal residents by illegal immigrants represents a preventable failure of government. We can and should do better.
	•	Congress must protect our communities by preventing municipalities from engaging in sanctuary policies, and it must pass stronger policies to crack down on criminals wanted by ICE/CPB.

Congressman Cook Announces Silver Valley Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) Grant
Congressman Cook announced that the Silver Valley Unified School District (SVUSD) is set to receive a $1.25 million grant from the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA). Cook had previously written a letter advocating for the grant. The Silver Valley Unified School District serves approximately 2,200 children in the High Desert.

DoDEA operates schools for military-connected children on military bases in the US and overseas. DoDEA’s annual grant program helps provide resources to military-connected local educational agencies (LEAs). Specifically, this grant will enhance and integrate technology in core curricular areas, improve educators’ professional development, support the social and emotional needs of military students, and encourage students to participate in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) programs.

Congressman Cook said, “I was pleased to learn that the DoDEA awarded the Silver Valley Unified School District this substantial grant. Many military children face challenges due to family deployments and transitions, and this grant will provide Silver Valley with the means to assist its students with these difficulties. It’s our duty to ensure that our servicemembers’ children receive the highest quality educational opportunities possible, and this grant will help to accomplish that goal.""

Traffic to be Impacted in Three Locations as City of Victorville Continues Road Improvement & Safety Projects
The City of Victorville is alerting drivers to expect impacts to traffic in three heavily-traveled areas starting the week of Oct. 15 as work continues on its $11.5 million in road improvement and safety projects announced in July. 

Prep work is nearing completion on the City’s Safe Route to Schools Project, Village Drive Rehabilitation, and La Mesa Road/US 395 Connection; and as crews begin road rehabilitation efforts next week, motorists can expect to see narrowed lanes, shifted lanes and new traffic patterns in three locations:

7th Avenue from Burwood Avenue to Minnetonka Street 

As part of its Safe Routes to Schools Project to improve pedestrian safety at seven Victorville schools, the City is reconstructing 7th Avenue between Burwood Avenue and Minnetonka Street. Starting the week of Oct. 15, lanes will be shifted throughout the construction zone, which is adjacent to Mojave Vista Elementary School. While one lane will be open in each direction throughout this road rehabilitation project, motorists are advised to use alternate routes if possible. Road work on 7th Avenue is expected to continue through the end of November. In addition to the road improvements, the City is adding sidewalks and installing a mid-block pedestrian signal on 7th Avenue.

Connection of La Mesa Road to US 395

During the week of Oct. 15, the City of Victorville will begin its capital improvement project to connect La Mesa Road with US 395. Motorists can expect narrowed lanes and lane shifts on US 395 throughout this road improvement project, which will be complete in December. For safety, the speed limit in this construction zone will be reduced. In addition to constructing nearly 1,500 feet of new roadway, a new traffic signal will be installed at the intersection of US 395 and La Mesa Road; and US 395 will be widened to create turn pockets at the new intersection.

Village Drive Between Mojave Drive and Air Expressway

The City is reconstructing 3.8 miles of Village Drive between Mojave Drive and Air Expressway. Beginning next week, motorists can expect lane closures and shifted lanes on Village Drive throughout the completion of this project, which is expected to last through December. One lane in each direction will be open at all times, but delays can be expected. In addition to reconstructing the roadway, the City has added sidewalks, concrete ramps and storms drains in the area.

Motorists are asked to use extreme caution when traveling near these road projects and to obey all directional signs and traffic devices. Delays can be expected, so extra time should be factored into travel times.

Questions can be directed to (760) 955-5158. Additionally, road work announcements will be posted to the City of Victorville website at VictorvilleCA.gov.

Come and Read It Report
Dear Texans, 
At the start of this Congress, small business optimism was low. Employers and workers needed relief from burdensome regulations in order to grow their business. Last year, we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which slashed taxes for Main Street and allowed it to breathe again. 
✓ 20 percent small business tax deduction 
✓ Immediate business equipment expensing 
✓ Small business optimism is reaching record highs 
The American people, whether they own a small business or are employed by one, are flourishing due to historical tax cuts, and I am excited to continue watching the economy thrive. 
Touring the District 
This past week, I've been able to travel the great 25th District of Texas to meet with all of you. Below are some of the stops I made along the way: 
￼
Friday was a historic day for Tarleton State University - it marked the midpoint of construction for their Fort Worth building. As the representative for their Stephenville campus, I was honored to speak at the ceremony and share my excitement for this next chapter. Thank you for having me and welcome to your new home! 
￼ 
I visited the Hill College Technical Center in Cleburne where I met with faculty, staff, and students to learn more about the Snap-on Automotive Technology Program, the HVAC Program and the Welding Program. I enjoyed hearing their firsthand experiences and look forward to watching this program succeed.
￼ 
It was great to be in Clifton with the members of the Rotary Club! I am thankful for the time they shared with me and will continue fighting for them in Washington. 
I have included some articles and releases you may find interesting located on the right side of this newsletter. It is an honor and privilege to represent the people of Texas’ 25th Congressional District and as always, please reach out to me with any issues and concerns that are important to you. 
In God we trust,

Recovery Efforts and Resources
Dear Friends,

Hurricane Michael battered much of our state and district last week, causing at least 19 deaths and devastation across the southeast. I hope you’ll join me in praying for the loved ones of the victims and for the swift recovery of our region. Ahead of the severe weather, the entire Georgia delegation and Governor Nathan Deal sent a letter to President Trump urging him to expedite emergency resources, and we all appreciate his quick approval of the disaster declaration. 

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Guard are already on the ground to facilitate clean up and search and rescue operations and are prepared to provide assistance to all those affected by the storm. I want to thank the many first responders who worked tirelessly to ensure the safety of local residents. Without your efforts, the effects of this disaster would have been far worse. While we’re still clearing roads and cleaning up debris, I want to let anyone who’s still reeling from the damage know that my office is here to help. 

There are lots of organizations offering resources to help with recovery, from the American Red Cross to the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA). You can find more information on the resources available to you below:

	•	If you need assistance or have questions, call 1-800-TRY-GEMA (1-800-879-4362) 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
	•	For medical or health-related questions, call 1-866-PUB-HLTH (1-866-782-4584).
	•	For the American Red Cross, text ‘GETEMERGENCY’' to 90999.
	•	For Congressional help, call my district offices at 770-207-1776 or 478-457-0007.
Each natural disaster we face offers us an opportunity to learn how to better prepare, better respond, and better serve our fellow Americans in crisis. I am grateful to all who put their lives in harm’s way in the face of disaster, and my heart goes out to all of those who suffered loss as a result of this storm.

Welcome Home
After two years of detainment on false charges by the Turkish government, our prayers have been answered and Pastor Brunson was finally welcomed home and reunited with his family. 

Brunson, an American who has led a small Christian community in Turkey for more than 20 years, was imprisoned on October 7, 2016 based on unsubstantiated accusations and a disturbing lack of evidence. In March, Pastor Brunson was issued an indictment filled with bogus charges relating to terrorism and espionage. Fortunately, thanks to the concerted and decisive actions of the Trump Administration and many in Congress, including myself, Pastor Brunson landed on U.S. soil on Saturday and was surrounded by loved ones. Click here to learn more about the legislative efforts we took to help end his unjust imprisonment.

The Numbers Are In! 
I’m very proud to announce that the 2018 Regional Job Fair in Covington on October 5th welcomed a total of 1,121 attendees from every walk and stage of life. This was an outstanding turnout and a true testament to the exciting things happening in our district. I am beyond thrilled that so many Georgians were able to meet with potential employers and begin the process of starting the next phase of their careers. In fact, Shire – a leading biotechnology company with a large manufacturing facility in Social Circle – found so many exceptional candidates that they have a follow-up event planned to re-engage with dozens of potential employees. 

In fact, one job fair attendee shared how she landed a job interview at Nisshinbo Automotive Manufacturing, Inc. the very next week. This company, located in Covington, has been steadily growing over the past few years, hiring more workers and expanding its warehouse. It’s stories like these that warm my heart and make me glad that our district is thriving.

Federal Fly Back
I always enjoy meeting with Georgia 10 residents, and last week was another productive period filled with individual and group meetings. I appreciated learning about everything from World War II organizations to scientific funding at the University of Georgia. 

On Wednesday, despite being in Georgia, I was glad to be able to Skype with commercial leaders from the Columbia County area who were visiting the Washington, D.C. area. These men and women are the true frontlines of our local economy and business community – creating jobs and building up the Central Savannah River Area. Thanks so much for taking the time to hear from me!
￼

The following day, I attended the Grand Opening of Shire’s state-of-the-art Georgia Manufacturing Facility. While there, I met with several Shire employees and State Representative Dave Belton to get a firsthand look at the explosive growth this company is experiencing and the many, positive effects it is having on our area. 
￼

On Friday morning, I was happy to sit down with students from the UGA Science, Policy, Education, Advocacy, and Research (SPEAR) program to discuss funding for biological research. It’s always a pleasure to meet with such bright and involved young people. Thanks for coming by!

Afterwards, I met with veteran and Oxford resident Jack Coyle to talk about the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, also known as SACO. This coordinated military unit between the U.S. and China – first implemented during World War II – gathered intelligence against the Japanese. I was excited to learn more about this piece of American history. Thanks so much for your time, Jack.

Later that same day, I spoke to high school students who are part of Youth Leadership Walton. These young students from across Walton County had insightful questions about leadership and getting involved in our community. Thanks for inviting me, and I expect to see great things from each of you in the years to come!

Need Help Dealing With the Government?
A big part of my job is helping folks cut through the red tape that often accompanies dealing with federal agencies. I understand that in a district as large as ours it’s not always possible to make it over to one of my three district offices. That’s why Team Hice regularly hosts Mobile Office Hours in every corner of Georgia’s 10th Congressional District. Next week, knowledgeable members of my staff will be available for meetings in Oglethorpe and Wilkes counties. 

Whether it’s trying to straighten out your Social Security payments or getting answers from the Department of Veterans Affairs, my team is ready to go to bat for you! If there’s anything we can do to intercede on your behalf with a federal agency, I hope you’ll stop by for help. Click here for more information on these upcoming events.

Helping Our Heroes
Our veterans have made incredible sacrifices for our Nation, and it only seems right that we roll out the red carpet treatment for them whenever we can. That’s why I’ll be hosting the 2nd Annual Helping Our Heroes event in appreciation of all our local veterans. On Saturday, October 27th from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. at the Jefferson County Leisure Center, I invite our local heroes to come and enjoy a continental breakfast and turkey giveaway, in addition to learning vital information regarding benefits specific to them, including filing claims, housing, and more. 

Team Hice will be joined by Forces United (formerly the Augusta Warrior Project), the Augusta Vet Center, the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center, the Georgia Department of Veterans Services, and Jefferson County Vets in Action. If you or someone you know is a veteran and interested in attending, I encourage you to click here or call (478) 457-0007 for further details on this exciting event.

￼

The Week Ahead
This upcoming week, I’ll be spending time in Washington and Oglethorpe counties, visiting folks from every walk of life, from job creators to students and more. On Thursday, I’ll also be in Greene County to help unveil the new display for the Foundations of American Law and Government, which will feature many documents fundamental to our Nation’s history. I invite you to meet me at the Greene County Courthouse, located at 113 N Main Street in Greensboro, at 10:30 a.m. for the ceremony. I hope you’ll join me in celebrating our shared heritage through these important documents.   As always, I’m here to serve you. Please contact my office with any questions, comments, or concerns.

State delegation asks president to expedite Hurricane Michael emergency aid Gwinnett Daily Post – 10/10 U.S. Sens. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., and David Perdue, R-Ga., along with the entire Georgia congressional delegation, wrote this week to President Donald Trump to request expedited emergency resources to aid counties in Georgia expected to be impacted by Hurricane Michael. On Tuesday, based on the latest forecast for Hurricane Michael and acting on a recommendation from Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency officials, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal issued an emergency declaration for 92 Georgia counties, making all state resources available to local governments and entities within the impacted area of the hurricane.
Post-Presidency Perks Are Ripe for Reform TownHall – 10/13 But Truman’s situation was unique. The income-earning opportunities for former presidents in the 21st century have grown considerably. They can cash in on their historical significance, name recognition, and connections to seal multimillion dollar book contracts, content production deals with streaming media giants, or collect several hundred thousand dollars per event for speaking engagements. Given the wealth and earning potential for modern-day former presidents, the time has come to reduce the burdens they place on ordinary taxpayers. Relief could come in the form of the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act, introduced in the House by Rep. Jody Hice (R-GA), and in the Senate by Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA).

Earlier this morning, Hurricane Michael was upgraded to a Category 4 storm and is expected to bring damaging winds, rain, and flooding throughout the Southeast.
Regional job fair brings hundreds of jobs in second year Covington News – 10/8 U.S. Congressman Jody Hice said this year’s job fair sets an example of how communities can work together for their residents.  “Building on last year’s success, I am blown away by the sheer number of people who participate and the way that our community comes together,” he said. “With hundreds of participants this year, my expectations have been surpassed yet again, and it is incredibly heartening to see so many people hired on the spot. “I’m proud to see that Georgia is brimming with opportunity, and today’s event is just another example of the growth and prosperity sweeping our nation. I could not be more grateful to the economic development offices of Walton, Newton, Jasper, Morgan and Greene counties, as well as Georgia Piedmont Technical College for making today’s event not only possible, but a ringing success!” Hall said the support of Hice shows his dedication to the constituents in his district. 
Early voting for Georgia November election opens Monday 13 WMAZ – 10/12 But Georgians will also settle races for Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, Agriculture Commissioner, Insurance Commissioner, Labor Commissioner and state School Superintendent. Two seats on the state Public Service Commission, which regulations Georgia utilities, are also on the ballot Three congressional seats that cover parts of Central Georgia are also up for grabs. Democrat Sanford Bishop, whose district includes part of Macon; and Republicans Jody Hice, whose district includes Milledgeville, and Rick Allen, who represents Dublin, all face challengers.

Protecting patient-centric health care

￼
Click to watch Rep. Lewis 
speak on Medicare for All

Dear Lindsey,
As your Representative, I have worked to ensure that Minnesotans have access to quality and affordable health care.  Throughout my time in Congress, I have supported numerous initiatives to this end as well as strengthened our patient-centric health care system.
Maintaining a patient-centric health care system is vital to protecting the well-being of Americans, ensuring the freedom to choose coverage, and helping keep the cost of care low.
Some of my Democratic colleagues in the House support the socialist alternative, Medicare for All, which threatens our health care professionals, the quality of our health care system, and the freedom to choose a coverage plan that works for you and your family.
Click here to watch my health care video!
Under Medicare for All, it will be illegal for employers to offer insurance and illegal for there to be a private insurance market. Individual choice and control is completely stripped from the health care system under Medicare for All.
Medicare for All would add approximately $32.6 trillion to federal budget commitments during the first 10 years of its implementation. This new system not only threatens the quality of services provided to those in need, hurts our doctors, nurses, and other health professionals alike, but also threatens the stability of our economy and budget.
Medicare for All is an unsustainable idea that would destroy our current patient-centric health care system and reduce the quality of care to the most vulnerable of our society. I will continue to work toward delivering quality and affordable care to Minnesotans and all Americans.
As I work on this and other issues, I always like to hear directly from you.  Please share any thoughts you may have through my website, and sign up for my e-mail newsletter for the latest updates from Washington, D.C. and around the district. You can also stay on top of my work by following my Facebook and Twitter pages. Please feel free to call my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-2271 or my local Burnsville office at 651-846-2120 with any comments or for assistance with a federal agency.

Sincerely,

Beatty Calls Out Republican  “Economic Squeeze” Agenda Leads press call on report ahead of Trump’s latest Ohio campaign rally
U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) recently spearheaded a press call with national and local media in advance of President Trump’s October 12th “Make America Great Again” rally in Lebanon, Ohio. During the call, Beatty, joined by Congresswoman Marcia Fudge (OH-11), highlighted a new report showing 95% of hardworking Americans are reeling from the Republican economic agenda.   Most troubling, the report concludes: • 78 percent of full-time workers are living paycheck-to-paycheck; • real wages have fallen in Ohio under the Trump Administration; • 90 percent of stock market gains have benefited the wealthiest Americans; and • Republican-backed efforts at repealing the Affordable Care Act is causing healthcare prices to skyrocket.  “Americans want a government for the people,” Beatty said on the call. “They do not want more broken promises from Congressional Republicans or President Trump—especially when it comes to take-home pay, jobs, healthcare, and the economy.”
￼ 
Congresswoman Beatty speaks with members of the press about House Democrats’ “For the People” initiative. 
Wrapping up the call, Beatty urged Ohioans to hold the White House and Republican leadership accountable for their abysmal legislative record, including on their much-maligned tax bill—that study after study has shown overwhelmingly benefits the super-wealthy and well-connected at the expense of everyone else.
“Republicans promised everyday Americans a $4,000 pay raise when the GOP tax bill became law. Instead, the vast majority of tax cuts have been used to buy back stocks and reward shareholders.” Beatty continued, “Republicans and Trump are trying to distract voters by focusing on the stock market and the wealth of big corporations. Democrats, on the other hand, are working ‘For the People,’ and lifting up voices and stories of the hardworking Americans that the President and the Republican-controlled Congress have forgotten.”
The full report can be read here. To learn more about House Democrats’ “For the People” initiative, please visit the Democratic Leader’s website.

RUTHERFORD ROUNDUP
For October 16, 2018

Dear Friends,  
Our hearts continue to go out to all those affected by Hurricane Michael. This was a deadly, destructive, and costly storm that will have far reaching impacts for years to come. 
We are tremendously grateful for all of the brave, selfless first responders who have worked around the clock to rescue those who are stranded and provide aid to those who have lost everything in this storm. My prayers remain with these men and women from all over the country, including many from Northeast Florida offering their time and skills to help those in need.
With the recovery process underway, it is my hope that those who are able will offer assistance to our friends in the panhandle. After Hurricane Irma tore through Northeast Florida last year, we received an outpouring of support from across the state and nation. Now it is our turn to lend a helping hand. For more information on how you can help, please visit: https://www.volunteerflorida.org/. 
As my colleagues and I in Congress work to provide emergency relief to communities in need, please continue to keep our fellow Floridians in your thoughts and prayers. 

￼ 

Making Our Schools Safer
￼ 
In January, I introduced the STOP School Violence Act, a bipartisan legislation to give local schools federal funding to implement school safety programs. My bill was signed into law in March, and I am proud to share that the Department of Justice has awarded more than $70 million to school districts across the country, including $3.9 million for Florida schools. The funds will provide violence prevention training to students, teachers, and law enforcement officers, and help schools enhance their security measures. This is another step toward making sure that our students are safe when they go to school each day. 
I will continue working with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to maintain funding for this vital program, so that even more Florida schools can apply for these safety grants in the years to come. For more information about this important program, click here.  
 
￼ 
Congress Passes Major Opioid Legislation
￼ 
The opioid crisis has taken far too many lives – nearly 5,000 Floridians died of an overdose in 2016 alone. It has devastated families and communities across the country, but recently Congress took yet another major step to combat this epidemic. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which I proudly supported, expands our capacity to treat those struggling with addiction and help them recover, supports methods of prevention to stop addiction before it starts, and cuts off the supply of both prescription and illicit opioids in our communities. This bill shows that we remain dedicated to ridding our country of this scourge. Read more about this vital legislation here.  
  
￼ 
More Tax Relief for Families
￼ 
America’s economic strength is at an all-time high with record optimism, historically low unemployment, and the fastest wage growth in a decade. The middle class is growing, and middle class incomes are rising. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which we passed in December, is putting money back into families’ pockets and playing a big part in the job and pay growth we are seeing across the country. 
The House of Representatives recently passed another wave of tax reform legislation to give families more tax relief and build upon our economic success. We are continuing to make good on our promise to the American people that there is a better way forward. Our newest tax relief package ensures that growing families and the American worker are rewarded and encouraged by a tax code that works for them. The non-partisan Tax Foundation’s analysis shows these changes will create 1.5 million new jobs, increase wages by nearly 1% and increase GDP by over 2%. The Senate now must act to pass these important changes. Some of the key highlights of this legislation include: 
	•	Making permanent the individual and small business tax cuts included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
	•	Creating the first ever Paid Family Leave Tax Credit 
	•	Doubling the Child Tax Credit and expanding eligibility
	•	Making it easier for small businesses to offer retirement savings accounts for employers
	•	Establishing universal savings accounts for Americans to save for any purpose
	•	Allowing families to access their own retirement accounts on a penalty-free basis when welcoming a new child into the family - whether by birth or adoption

Remembering a Local Hero 
￼ 
The City of Jacksonville lost a hero and valued companion recently when K9 FANG died in action in pursuit of an armed carjacking suspect. K9s perform very dangerous and important public safety work as FANG’s heroic display clearly demonstrated. These highly-trained dogs often put their lives on the line for their human partner and our citizens. FANG will be forever remembered, as his name will be memorialized on the K9 Monument at the JSO Academy. Learn more about his service to our community in the Times-Union.

Congressman Al Green's Statement on the USCIS Public Charge Rule 
(Houston, TX) - Congressman Al Green made the following statement regarding the public charge rule that was officially published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, October 10, 2018:   
 “The United States of America has long been the land of the free and home of the brave; a beacon of hope and a loadstone for everyone from every place. Although centuries of politics and international catastrophes have caused America’s welcoming spirit of inclusion to become more regulated, it has still been extended to the haves and the have-nots. However, the Trump Administration has made several attempts to not only eliminate America’s welcome to many vulnerable immigrant populations but also to end our embrace of lawful, law-abiding immigrants. This administration has abandoned the spirit of welcome emblazoned on our Statue of Liberty: ‘Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.’ This is evident in the shameful new proposed public charge policy. 
“This new public charge proposal published by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is but another example of the cruel and divisive policies emanating from the Trump administration. This was evidenced by the President’s attempt to ban Muslims from entering our country. It was evidenced by his patronizing and belittling ‘s---hole countries’ statement regarding certain African, Latin American, and Caribbean nations whilein the Oval Office. Currently, it is evidenced by his aim to slant our immigration system in favor of the haves, to the detriment of the have-nots referenced on our Statue of Liberty – those who may need a temporary hard hand up not a permanent hand out.   
“Ours is a country whose economy is sustained in part by immigrants, those ‘tired, poor, huddled masses yearning to breathe free.’ This new public charge policy is but a stealthy attempt at showcasing a ‘welcome’ sign to the haves while displaying a ‘do not enter’ sign to the have-nots.”

10/16/18 11:46,Did you see this?,"News from Representative Tom Emmer
￼
Dear Friend,  
Being back home in Minnesota reminds me of the reason why I chose to go to Washington, D.C. in the first place: to bring Midwest values to our nation’s capital. Minnesotans value community, economic prosperity and a strong work ethic and I am honored to represent those values in Congress. 
This month, I’ve enjoyed my time in Minnesota’s Sixth Congressional District, reconnecting with constituents who always give me a renewed sense of hope for the future. When I tour a new business, visit our elderly to hear their wisdom, or participate in a groundbreaking for a new endeavor, I am reminded that we are a strong and capable group of people, as Minnesotans, and as Americas, we never give up. 
I look forward to spending a few more weeks in Minnesota before heading back to Washington with more fervor and drive than ever to serve Minnesota’s Sixth Congressional District. Below, I shared some highlights from my travels around the district! If you would like me to visit you next, click here.  
￼ 
Congressman Emmer participating in a groundbreaking for the Interstate 94 expansion project. 
In April, I wrote to Commissioner Zelle expressing my strong support for completion of the capacity expansion project, particularly Phase 2 from St. Michael to Albertville. 
When it was announced in May that this project would receive funding as part of the Corridors of Commerce program I was ecstatic. This project targets one of I-94’s worst bottlenecks, which happens to have the highest rate and severity of crashes than anywhere else along I-94! It was great to break ground on this exciting expansion! 
￼ 
Congressman Emmer touring Yeager Machine, Inc. in Norwood Young America, MN. 
I attended the Highway 212 Safety Coalition meeting to hear from business owners that have trucks that travel along Highway 212 and have been concerned about the safety of their drivers and the economic impact of the highway on their business.  
The employees at Yeager Machine expressed those very concerns, which is why I have written several letters of support for the expansion of Highway 212. After years of advocacy, Highway 212 received a Minnesota Highway Freight Program grant for “Freight Bottleneck Improvements.” We are one-step closer to making Highway 212 safer for all Minnesotans thanks to all who are invested in this project. 
￼ 
Congressman Emmer learning about Mighty Axe Hops in Foley, MN. 
It was great to get back to Mighty Axe Hops, Minnesota’s largest hop farm, run by some of Minnesota’s greatest Young Farmers, Eric Sannerud and Ben Boo. I’ve enjoyed working with them throughout the years, especially with their work to develop the next generation of farmers with the National Young Farmers Coalition. 
￼ 
Congressman Emmer talking with Kelsey Schultz, Executive Director of Arbor Oaks Senior Living in Andover, MN. 
During my visit to Arbor Oaks, I learned of the staffing challenges that long-term care providers face. In addition, Kelsey Schultz, the Executive Director of Arbor Oaks Senior Living, and I discussed the ongoing concerns of the backlog of elder abuse claims that were plaguing our state just last year. We were both relieved that the backlog is finally cleared, and our senior citizens are being cared for in the way they deserve. I am encouraged to know caring individuals like Kelsey look out for our state’s seniors!

Dear Friends, 
October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month.  In recognition of this, the House - with my support - unanimously approved the reauthorization of the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act.  This is the primary source of federal funding to support emergency shelters and assistance for victims of domestic violence and their families.  
In addition to supporting this funding, I visited the Focusing Families Crisis Center in Hempstead, Texas to learn more about local efforts to combat domestic violence. This local organization is committed to strengthening communities through education, prevention, and intervention to eliminate family violence, sexual assault, and other crisis issues. Thank you for all of the incredible work you do in our local communities to help keep them safe.
￼ 
Below are some highlights from last week: 
Combating Chinese Espionage and Theft 
It was reported that a Chinese intelligence official was arrested in Belgium and extradited to the United States to face espionage charges. The Chinese government steals as much as $600 billion of the United States’ intellectual property annually. FBI Director Christopher Wray said last week that the Chinese government ""represents our broadest threat"" and are ""fighting tomorrow’s fight."" I have long advocated for a tougher approach to China and am glad that is finally happening. 
Earlier this year, I questioned State and Treasury Department officials about whether they were looking into placing tougher restrictions on the blatant aggression by China. As Assistant Attorney General Demers said: ""We will not tolerate a nation that reaps what it does not sow.""

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has spurred American innovation and unleashed unprecedented optimism across this country. I look forward to working with our local business leaders to continue providing the best environment for hardworking Texans to thrive.

TX-10 Fulbright Recipients 
Since its inception in 1946, the Fulbright Program has provided more than 380,000 participants — chosen for their academic merit and leadership potential — with the opportunity to exchange ideas and contribute to finding solutions to shared international concerns. As a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I am delighted that six students from TX-10 have been accepted this year. These students will follow in the storied history of the program that has molded renowned world leaders, intellectual titans, and even fellow Members of Congress. Congratulations and best of luck!

Dear Friend,  Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to read about some of last week’s highlights here in Texas.    Hearing From Rosenberg Manufacturers  On a recent tour of the Frito Lay facility in Rosenberg, I learned more about their commitment to safety and efforts to develop healthier snack options. We also discussed how aluminum tariffs will impact their business and others like it. Hearing directly from the businesses in our district gives me firsthand knowledge of how federal policies affect them. With over 12.7 million Americans working in manufacturing, including many of our friends and neighbors, it’s crucial that we implement pro-growth, pro-business policies to ensure the American manufacturing industry can grow and thrive. ￼  Rep.

We visited Memorial Hermann to learn about their Life Flight program. We also heard from guest speakers Ashlea Quinonez, Rachel Kemp, Leslie Norman, Dr. Melissa Kwan and Jason Glover, who shared how they started working in the medical field. The CYAC gives students an opportunity to meet with industry leaders, like folks at Memorial Herman. It’s also an opportunity for me to learn their priorities to better represent our youth in Congress.   ￼  Rep.

Dear Lindsey, 
Honoring Those Who Keep Us Safe 
On Friday, I joined Senator Shaheen to take part in the 20th annual Congressional Law Enforcement Awards Ceremony in Concord. Our law enforcement officers put themselves in harm’s way every day to keep us safe and play a critical role in combating the opioid crisis facing New Hampshire. It was wonderful to honor their unyielding courage, compassion, and dedication to our communities and state and I remain committed to fighting for the support and resources they need to do their jobs and protect Granite Staters. 
￼
With Senator Shaheen at the Congressional Law Enforcement Awards 
Investing in Granite State Communities 
I applaud the Senate for unanimously confirming Harold Parker as the next Federal Co-Chair of the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC). Since its inception in 2008, the NBRC has invested critical federal resources to rural communities throughout New Hampshire. From increasing affordable housing opportunities for veterans, to expanding treatment facilities for Granite Staters battling substance misuse, the NBRC has made a real difference in our state. I have introduced bipartisan legislation that was included in the House and Senate farm bills to ensure the NBRC is reauthorized, and I look forward to working closely with Harold Parker in his new position.  
On Tuesday, Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan and Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter and I announced that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has provided more than $1 million in grants for urban community development and affordable housing in Nashua. Investing in the well-being and success of people who are vulnerable and struggling financially is beneficial to everyone. These funds will help Nashua increase the number of its residents who have the stability that comes with a safe and affordable place to live. In addition, the funds will expand opportunities for people with low and more modest incomes to make a decent living and contribute to our state’s economy. I was proud to join my colleagues for this announcement, and I look forward to our continued efforts to help ensure all Granite Staters can get ahead and thrive.
Championing Higher Education  
I was deeply humbled to receive the New Hampshire College and University Council’s Granite Stater of the Year Award on Thursday evening. The New Hampshire College and University Council (NHCUC) understands the critical intersection of education in meeting the needs of our workforce challenges and acts tirelessly to strengthen collaboration with the business community, improve recruitment of students to New Hampshire colleges and universities, and champion higher education in the state. It was an honor to be recognized, and I look forward to continuing to work with NHCUC to improve skills training and access to quality, affordable higher education.
￼
Receiving the NHCUC Granite Stater of the Year Award 
Conserving New Hampshire’s Natural Treasures 
I joined Senators Shaheen and Hassan and Congresswoman Shea-Porter on Wednesday to announce that the U.S. Department of Interior has awarded New Hampshire more than $500,000 through the State Wildlife Grant (SWG) Program to boost Granite State conservation efforts. For generations, Granite Staters and tourists have enjoyed observing New Hampshire’s amazing wildlife, and these funds will help Granite State species with dwindling populations recover. I’m pleased about this collective investment in our environment, and I will continue to push for policies and programs that protect the animals that call New Hampshire home. 
Here to Serve You  
My biggest responsibility in Congress is to serve you, the people of New Hampshire’s Second Congressional District. If you have questions, concerns, or ideas, please do not hesitate to reach out to my Washington, DC office at 202-225-5206 or my Concord office at 603-226-1002. Thank you, as always, for everything you do to help make New Hampshire such a wonderful place to call home. Have a great rest of the week!

Last Week in Congress
Fed Chair: U.S. Economy is ""Remarkably Positive""
￼ ￼ Click here to read more from the Washington Post
Our last two years of economic growth have been incredible, and experts like Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell say that this success will continue for the foreseeable future. Recently, Chairman Powell described this growth as unprecedented, and predicted that unemployment will remain below 4% through 2020. He also noted that wages are rising but inflation is under control - great news for American workers and consumers. These results are being driven by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as our work to reduce excessive government regulations on businesses. 
￼
Major Cost of Living Increase for Social Security Beneficiaries
￼ ￼ Click here to read more from MarketWatch
The Social Security Administration announced last week that Social Security recipients will receive at 2.8% cost of living increase next year - the largest increase in seven years. This is outstanding news for seniors who count on these retirement benefits. Over 60 million Americans receive Social Security, and this adjustment will help many of them cover their expenses in the coming year.

Tracking a Productive 115th Congress
￼
I'm proud to be working hard to make the House productive for the people it represents. We've had a busy 115th Congress, passing over 1,000 bills through the House. This is almost 40% more productive than past Congresses, and it's part of our commitment to making the government work hard for the people of America. These bills have included landmark opioid legislation, major improvements at the VA, and historic increases in funding for medical research at NIH. You can visit better.gop to learn more about the many accomplishments of the 115th Congress.

Around the District
Military and Veterans Advisory Committee
￼ Kevin with the Veterans Advisory Committee members
On Thursday, I was honored to sit down with my Military and Veterans Affairs Advisory Committee to discuss the opioid crisis and treatment among vets, improvements to the VA Choice program, Tricare benefits, and suicide prevention measures for veterans. Congress recently passed the largest Veterans Affairs funding bill in our nation’s history, which will help keep vital programs available to those who put their lives on the lines for all of us. I was also proud to report that Congress passed the VA MISSION Act, which will expand the VA Caregiver Program to veterans from all eras to support veterans battling disabilities and ailments from their service who rely on family members as in-home caregivers. Thank you to Mike Cooper, Commander of American Legion Post #153 in Olathe for hosting the meeting. I’m so thankful for the service and sacrifice of our nation’s veterans, and I greatly appreciate their insight and advice about issues facing our military and veterans today.
￼
Shawnee Mission Education Foundation Breakfast
￼ Kevin with SMSD Superintendent Dr. Michael Fulton
I’ve enjoyed attending the Shawnee Mission Education Foundation (SMEF) breakfast for several years, and last week's breakfast was exceptionally inspirational. Students and teachers shared their success stories in the fields of medicine, robotics, energy/sustainability, welding, firefighting, and theater/fine arts. These students are being prepared for their futures here at Shawnee Mission School District as they work to ensure that every student impacts our world for good while in school and upon graduation. Thank you to Kim Hinkle, Executive Director of the SMEF for your leadership, and thank you to Dr. Michael Fulton, SMSD superintendent. Welcome to the SMSD team.
￼
Travanse Senior Living in Olathe
￼ Kevin with Mike Fraser and Tom Inderhees
Thank you to Mike Fraser for the invitation and tour of Travanse Senior Living in Olathe last week. I appreciated visiting with residents, seeing the veterans service wall, and learning about your care of the 55 residents, including home health and hospice. I'm working hard in Congress to keep prescription drug prices low for seniors, and recently we passed and the president signed the Know the Lowest Price Act. This important legislation eliminates “gag clauses” that prevent pharmacists from being able to tell Medicare consumers if there’s a cheaper way to pay for a prescription medicine at the drugstore, such as when the cash price is cheaper than an insurance co-pay. 90% of seniors take prescription drugs, and I am proud to be working to make those prescriptions more affordable.
￼
Heart to Heart International
￼ Kevin touring the new Heart to Heart warehouse
I’m proud of Heart to Heart International (HHI), headquartered here in Lenexa, and their work on the frontlines to provide disaster relief for victims of floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes here in the United States and all over the world. Last week, I toured the new warehouse and office space in Lenexa to see their operations and to hear about their partnership with FEMA and the CDC to provide medical teams, medical supplies, equipment, and hygiene health products during humanitarian crises. I was inspired by the work HHI accomplished after Hurricane Maria, visiting the hardest-hit and remote areas of Puerto Rico bringing medical relief to people cut-off from the outside world. They are still working in Puerto Rico to build solar powered water systems and rebuild homes. Thank you to Jim Mitchum and Kim Carroll for the great tour of the new facility, and especially your leadership of this amazing work.
￼
Kansas City Kansas Community College
￼ Kevin with new KCKCC President Dr. Greg Mosier
I had an awesome visit to the KCKCC campus last week, meeting the official Blue Devil mascot, touring the new Veterans Center and visiting with veteran students, observing a nursing simulation class, and talking with students and exhibitors at the transfer fair. I was most proud to learn from new President Dr. Greg Mosier that due to the work that I supported in the House to expand Pell Grants to year-round, 160 students were able to attend KCKCC this summer. If not for our work to make Pell Grants available in summer too, these students would not have been able to take classes and move closer to graduation and entering the workforce. Thanks Dr. Mosier and your energetic team!

St. Joseph Catholic Church 150th Anniversary
￼ Kevin with Father Scott Wallisch, Mary Raymond, and students from St. Joseph
This year marks the 150th anniversary of the founding of St. Joseph Catholic Church in Shawnee, Kansas. The small frontier town of Shawnee was founded in 1857, and one year later St. Joseph’s Catholic Church opened its doors to minister to the growing and diverse community. Today, 150 years later, St. Joseph’s continues to play an important role in the health and spiritual lives of people in Johnson County. This is a parish dedicated to the education of our youth and the well-being of our community, and I can only imagine the accomplishments the church will amass in the next 150 years. I was honored to present a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol to Father Scott, Mary Raymond, students and families in recognition of its anniversary, and tour the new renovations of the church.
￼
American Israel Public Affairs Committee
￼ Kevin speaking at AIPAC in Overland Park
On Monday, I spoke to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) in Overland Park about our strong and critical relationship with Israel. Over the past few years I have supported our ongoing military cooperation with Israel, and I have been a witness to the resilience, ingenuity and steadfastness of the Israeli people in the face of constant threats and intimidation from their neighbors in the region. I believe that it is incumbent upon the U.S. government to continue our support for the only democracy, and one of the last vestiges of stability and freedom, in the Middle East. I look forward to continuing to lead the charge on this important work in Congress and appreciate AIPAC’s ongoing support of the unique bond between our two great countries.
￼
Sarah Cannon Cancer Network
￼ Kevin with Matt Sogard, Yvonne Ward, Dr. Anne Kobbermann, and Ryan Hallenbeck
October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and last Thursday I toured the Sarah Cannon Cancer Network in Overland Park to see firsthand the amazing advancements in breast cancer prevention and treatments. It was great to visit with patients and health care providers about their care here including the importance of clinical trials. We also discussed the Oral Drug Parity Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor, that would allow for equal treatment of oral and infusible cancer therapies. As treatments become more advanced, many cancer drugs can be administered by mouth, like normal medication. Thank you to Yvonne Ward, RN, MSN, OCN, CBCN, ONN-CG, for the invitation, and Matt Sogard and his team from Overland Park Regional Medical Center for the tour.
￼
Claridge Court in Prairie Village
￼ Kevin speaking at the Claridge Court breakfast group
It was a pleasure visiting with the breakfast group at Claridge Court in Prairie Village about the economy and senior issues before Congress. I'm working in Congress to strengthen important senior programs like Medicare. I support the closure of the Medicare Part D donut hole, which is a gap in coverage for seniors with high prescription costs that ends up costing large amounts of out-of-pocket payments. Earlier this year, Congress moved to close the donut hole and lift this burden from seniors. Thanks to Richard for the invitation to stop by and speak with the group.
￼
National Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial Fundraiser
￼ Kevin with Sonia Tolbert, Scott Nusz, John Lawrence, and Vesna Lawrence
It was an honor to stop by the VFW Post #846 in Overland Park to support their National Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial fundraiser event. I had a great time visiting with many veterans, patriots, and their families. The proceeds from this fundraiser will go toward the new memorial that will be built on the National Mall in Washington, DC in 2021. I was proud to support the legislation that Congress passed to authorize the new memorial in 2017. Click here to learn more about the memorial and view designs for the final site.

Reminder: Medicare Open Enrollment Assistance Events Coming Up
￼ Kevin with seniors at a previous Medicare enrollment event
Attention seniors and caregivers of seniors: Medicare Open Enrollment Period begins next week October 15 and extends through December 7. I will be hosting two Medicare Open Enrollment Assistance Events to provide help to seniors during this time. These events will be held Wednesday, October 17 from 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM at Johnson County Central Resource Library and Tuesday, October 23 from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM at Kansas City, KS West Wyandotte Library.

National Farmer's Day
￼
Happy National Farmers Day to the 3.2 million men and women in Kansas and across the country who work tirelessly to provide the world with food, fiber, and fuel.

￼
Friends, 
As you well know, Hurricane Michael, the third most powerful hurricane to ever make landfall on the United States mainland, ravaged areas of Alabama, Florida, and Georgia last week. While only early estimates are available at this point in time, it has been reported that more than 650,000 homes and businesses across the Southeast lost power, and 60,000 of those are in Alabama. Hundreds of families lost everything, and it has been confirmed that at least 18 people were killed. 
￼  
While Hurricane Michael appears to have done its worst in Panama City, Florida, and the nearby areas, Barbour, Dale, Henry, Geneva and Houston Counties in our district were also impacted. It could potentially take days, or even weeks, before we know the full scale of the damage, but we do know that Hurricane Michael is the most powerful storm to ever hit Houston County according to recorded history.   
I encourage everyone to help out with relief efforts in whatever way you can. We should all be deeply thankful for the first responders and all those working to repair the damage. This is a very, very trying and difficult time for so many people across the Southeast, and we will get through it together. 
ASSESING DAMAGE IN THE WIREGRASS 
￼ 
I was on the ground in the Wiregrass last week assessing the Hurricane Michael damage to local agriculture with some of our farmers. I was able to see firsthand the devastation this storm brought to several farms both in Henry and Houston Counties.   While we don’t yet know the full scale of the damages, it’s safe to say our cotton farmers face significant economic setback. My office stands ready to assist in whatever ways we can. The AL-02 economy depends on our farmers and their important work. 
USDA DISASTER ASSITANCE TOOL 
As we begin our Hurricane Michael recovery efforts, many farmers and producers in AL-02 may be in need of disaster assistance. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a great tool to help you identify which disaster programs meet your needs. I encourage you to share this information with anyone you know who might need it.  TATE'S SUPERMARKET FEEDS THE COMMUNITY 
￼   It has been encouraging to see neighbors are helping neighbors during this tough time. Last week, Tate's Supermarket in Hartford emptied its freezers, cooked all the food, and gave it away to those in need. There are great people in this world.   During what is a very, very difficult time for so many, I encourage everyone to share examples of people helping other people. We will get through this together.   You can stay up to date on recovery efforts and my work in Congress via Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.         
It is an honor to serve you in Congress. Please never hesitate to let me know if there is a way my office can be of assistance.   Sincerely,  
￼  Martha Roby

Bad Deal for Pennsylvania's Refineries
The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is a federal program mandating oil refiners to blend a certain amount of renewable fuels, such as corn ethanol, into the nation's fuel supply every year.
This is one of the most egregious examples of the government picking winners and losers. Washington has deemed the workers at Pennsylvania's oil refineries the losers.
While sales of gasoline with up to 10% ethanol (E10) are available year-round, there is a ban on sales of fuel with 15% ethanol (E15) in the summer months, due to the smog it produces. Recently, the Trump administration directed the Environmental Protection Agency to craft a rule allowing for the year-round sale of E15 gasoline.
Authorizing the expanded sale of E15 gasoline without meaningful reforms for the U.S. refining sector is a missed opportunity that only benefits ethanol producers and their allies. This legally-dubious proposal does not address the high compliance costs associated with the government's Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which threatens thousands of jobs at Philadelphia Energy Solutions and Monroe Energy.
I continue to believe that changes to the RFS should improve conditions for both agriculture and the refining industry. This week's action is not only imbalanced, it risks worsening air quality and hurting consumers.

Promoting Civic Engagement
Promoting opportunities for youth civic engagement paves the way for students to become active participants in our republic.
In an effort to help high school students understand the roles of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the government, staff in my Allentown office, in conjunction with Lebanon Valley College, hosted the Youth Civic Engagement Symposium.
More than 100 Lebanon County students from six schools heard from speakers from all levels of government, including former Pennsylvania Governor, Tom Corbett.
I have no doubt that this year's Youth Civic Engagement Symposium provided students with an appreciation of our civic institutions. I thank all those who helped organize the event.
Read more about this terrific event in the Lebanon Daily News.

Tariffs Hurt Pennsylvania's Employers
On July 6, the administration began imposing a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of goods from China. As a result, Pennsylvania manufacturers are shouldering a new 25 percent tax burden on certain component parts.
Companies may seek an exclusion from these taxes if demand for a necessary item cannot be met by a domestic firm.
In an effort to assist Pennsylvania businesses affected by these tariffs, I sent a series of letters to U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer urging a full and fair review of all exclusion petitions by Pennsylvania companies.
Section 301 tariffs are direct taxes on American consumers and producers. They reduce American purchasing power, curtail freedom, impede job creation, and limit production. Approving these exemptions will help Pennsylvania employers remain competitive globally.
I hope these exclusion petitions are expeditiously reviewed.

Statement on U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley's Resignation
Ambassador Nikki Haley has done an exemplary job serving our country at the United Nations. She demonstrated strong American leadership on the global stage and reaffirmed our commitment to our top allies like Israel. Ambassador Haley also diligently worked to hold belligerent nations like Syria, Iran, Russia, and North Korea accountable for violating U.N. rules, human rights, and international norms. I am grateful for Ambassador Haley's service and look forward to President Trump nominating someone who shares her approach to representing American interests at the U.N.

Celebrating Vancouver's Waterfront Park, and new jobs
￼
It was exciting to be a part of Vancouver Waterfront Park's celebration on September 29 along with thousands of others. My hat is off to the City of Vancouver, the developers, builders, and investors who had the vision for highlighting the Columbia River with this incredible design.
￼
The new waterfront park will be a huge economic expansion in an area that has been through some highs and lows – this development will help even more families thrive in Southwest Washington. I was pleased to support federal grant funding that helped make this dream a reality.
 
Improving lives for recovering moms and their children
￼
Lifeline Connections’ new facility in Vancouver for pregnant and parenting women in substance use recovery will be life-changing for those families. 
￼
It was great to tour the gorgeous facility several weeks ago and see how the federal funding we helped secure for this program will improve lives for moms and children.

BIPARTISAN WORK: Ranked #15 out of 438 in working on bipartisan solutions
The Lugar Center and Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy released its Bipartisan Index. Out of 438 U.S. House members it scored, I was honored to be ranked as the 15th most bipartisan.

I’ve been laser-focused on creating better economic opportunities and solving problems for folks from Vancouver to Chehalis to Goldendale to Seaview, and whether that’s standing up for real health care solutions, protecting our native salmon runs, increasing survival rates for expectant moms or preserving manufacturing jobs, I’m proud to work with both parties on solutions.

ASSISTING SOUTHWEST WASHINGTON RESIDENTS
HELPING ARMY VETERAN WITH MEDICAL BILLS

Mr. Josh Bradley of Toledo, a veteran of the U.S. Army, contacted our office because he was involved in a vehicular accident for which he was not at fault. He was faced with massive medical expenses, and because the responsible party had limited insurance coverage, the VA was supposed to step in and pay the medical bills. 

However, Mr. Bradley was unable to get the VA to pay the medical expenses, even after hiring a lawyer. Our office reached out to the VA on September 4, and by September 7, the decision was made to cover his medical bills, amounting to $59,580.33.

Are you having trouble with a federal agency?
 
If you or someone you know needs assistance with a federal agency, please contact my Vancouver office at 360-695-6292, or through my website jhb.house.gov. While we can't guarantee an outcome, we will try our best to assist in any way we can.


HONORED TO BE A FRIEND OF FARMERS

I'm proud to receive the ""Friend of Farm Bureau"" award for my support of policy issues affecting Southwest Washington's farmers and ranchers.

I’ve worked to ensure that pest and disease research programs are available for cranberry farmers in Pacific County, fought to help berry and tree fruit farmers market and protect their crops, and pushed to repeal the ’Waters of the U.S.’ rule that would give the federal government control over ditches and puddles on private property. 

It’s an honor to have this work recognized, and I’ll always be a friend of farmers as long as I’m representing them in Congress.

NEWS FROM WASHINGTON AND ACROSS WEST TEXAS
Dear Friend,  
As the Autumn weather starts to fill the air and harvest is on the horizon, our priority remains building on pro-growth policies that expand our economy, creating a freer, safer, and prouder nation.  
Our Farmers 
Last week, we celebrated National Farmers Day, and I thought about the hardworking farmers and ranchers throughout District 19. A farming culture is ingrained in our region’s heritage, and we wouldn’t be the country we are today if it weren’t for our producers that have worked the fields throughout the years. From the sweat of their brow, they work day in and day out to produce our food, allowing our nation to remain independent and secure. 
￼ 
Did you know that one U.S. farm feeds 165 people annually in the U.S. and abroad? It is expected that by 2050, our global population will top 9.7 billion – farmers and rancher will have to grow 70% more food than what is now produced to keep up with the growth. That is why it is essential we pass a Farm Bill that gives our farmers and ranchers the certainty and stability they deserve as they enter into the harvest season. Even more so for our state, because ag is our #1 industry. In 2014, the industry contributed to 8.5 percent, or $135.5 billion, of Texas’ GPD. It keeps our people fed and clothed and keeps our economy thriving. 
￼ 
Farm Bill Status 
House and Senate Republicans on the Farm Bill conference committee have been faced with resistance and obstruction from our Democrat counterparts. It is unacceptable that at a time when our farmers and ranchers are already hurting due to low commodity prices and unfair foreign trade practices that we in Congress not provide them with the critical certainty and security they need. Unfortunately, the Farm Bill’s progress is being held up by Democrats on most of the titles of the Farm Bill, including common-sense, dignity-restoring work requirements for able-bodied adults – they are simply obstructing in hopes of winning the midterms in November. 
While I had hoped we could have delivered a Farm Bill to the President’s desk by the September 30th deadline, my colleagues and I on the Farm Bill Conference Committee will continue to work to pass a Farm Bill that gives our ag producers the long-term certainty they need and deserve before crucial safety net programs expire in December.
￼ 
Steaming Economy 
Our economy continues to steam ahead. With another positive, historic jobs report, consumer and business optimism is getting higher and higher. Unemployment continued to drop in the month of September – now at a 50-year low. Over the past few months we’ve seen a steady drop in unemployment: June – 4.0%, July – 3.9%, September – 3.7%. Businesses are expanding, and more people are contributing in the workforce. Pro-growth policies are boosting our economy, ensuring West Texans and ALL Americans are better off now. Read here for an article on the September jobs report.  
October marks Manufacturing Month, and this year our manufacturers have much to celebrate. Buoyed by tax reform and regulatory relief, 77% of manufacturers say they plan to increase hiring, 72% plan to increase wages or benefits, and 86% plan to increase company investments. That translates into a better quality of life and more jobs – in fact, 160,000 more manufacturing jobs since tax reform was put into effect. I send a special thank you to all our manufacturers in West Texas – your hard work plays a vital role in building a better country for our children and grandchildren.  
￼
Please know, it is an honor to be your representative. Feel free to reach out to my office and let me know how I can best serve you.

Kansas Common Sense  October 15, 2018
Hello,
 
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
 
Reforming and Modernizing our Nation’s Water Infrastructure
On Wednesday, the Senate voted 99-1 to reform and modernize our nation’s water infrastructure with passage of the America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018. From flood protection to modernizing our drinking water systems, this legislation will address critical components of Kansas’ infrastructure that are far too often taken for granted. Our farmers, ranchers and manufacturers rely on our ports and waterways for access to markets around the world.
 
With more than 60 percent of our grain exports moving through America’s inland waterways, along with a multitude of other commodities and products, this legislation will benefit Kansas agriculture and stakeholders across a number of industries. In addition, by increasing local involvement and providing more feasible cost-sharing arrangements with Kansans, this legislation delivers much needed progress for more efficient and innovative solutions to address our infrastructure needs. To read more on this important legislation, click here.
 
Meeting with AUSA Officials Representing Fort Riley
On Tuesday, I welcomed Chief of Staff of the Army General Mark Milley and Undersecretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy to the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Fort Riley-Central Kansas Chapter event during the AUSA’s annual meetings in Washington, D.C. I was pleased to spend an evening alongside Kansans representing our Army communities and the Army’s most senior leaders who have an appreciation for the tremendous support our state provides soldiers and their families. I’m thankful General Milley and Undersecretary McCarthy shared how invaluable Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley are to the future of the Army, and General Milley noted that Fort Riley will experience an increase in soldiers over the next few years as the Army continues to grow in end-strength. A strong national defense requires a ready and robust Army and I will continue to work to make certain the Army is fully funded, equipped and ready to protect our country.
￼ 
Questioning Witnesses on Data Privacy Regulations On Wednesday, I participated in a Senate Commerce Committee hearing to discuss how new data privacy rules like the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the recently adopted California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 have impacted consumers and what they believe is needed in order to have effective data privacy standards. There are many opinions on how these standards ought to look, which is why I have been working with my colleagues to collect the thoughts of all interested parties, including consumer advocates, industry representatives and academics to identify responsible federal privacy standards.  
As chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security, I am committed to ensuring that consumers’ personal data is protected from data misuse, while also establishing certainty for businesses to create jobs, innovate and compete domestically and internationally. To view my questioning, click here. 
￼ 
Requesting Information from Google on Data Vulnerability On Thursday, I joined other Senate Commerce Committee leaders in requesting a copy of an internal memo and answers about a security vulnerability from Google CEO Sundar Pichai, which placed private user information at risk. The memo, according to press reports, advocated against public disclosure of the vulnerability on grounds that it would attract the potential attention of regulators and Congress. As chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security, I will remain vigilant in identifying data practices that harm consumers, while aiming to provide long-term regulatory solutions that bolster consumer protections without unduly harming innovation in the internet ecosystem. To read the letter, click here.   
Participating in KSU Office Park Ribbon Cutting Ceremony  Friday evening, I joined the KSU Foundation to cut a ribbon for the new building, Phase II, of the K-State Office Park. Phase II is the second of four buildings planned for the K-State Office Park, and the multi-phase office park project enables the KSU Foundation to lease space to industry partners and leaders while creating a pipeline for student talent. Upon completion of the fourth phase, the office park will total 240,000 square feet and 1,000 new jobs as part of the combined 56-acre world-class ecosystem of innovative research and academic growth adjacent to the university in the office and research parks. During my remarks at the event, I discussed the importance of the relationship between private industry and our unviersities, and how we can all work together to create an innovative and educated workforce that meets the demands of our state’s ever-changing economy. A special thanks to Greg Lohrentz and Kate Ryan for inviting me to join this special occasion.
 ￼ 
Touring Rooks County Health Center  On Friday, I was in my hometown of Plainville to tour the Rooks County Health Center. During our tour, I was able to learn more about the facility’s new MRI suite. Having an in-house MRI suite is rare among critical access hospitals like Rooks County Health Center, and folks were eager to share the positive impact of the new equipment. Additionally, we saw and discussed the hospital’s swing bed program and the physical, occupational, speech and respiratory therapy programs. I was happy to visit with a number of employees who were interested in hearing more about veterans’ healthcare, the ability to streamline services, reimbursement and patient satisfaction. Thank you to Rooks County CEO AJ Thomas for arranging my visit and to MRI Technologist Randy Richmeier for leading our tour. Thanks also to Michele Hinger, Justin Thummel and Dr. Daniel Sanchez for joining our tour and discussion.
￼ 
Highlighting the FAA Reauthorization and Visiting with Kansas City FAA Officials  On Thursday, I spoke on the Senate floor to highlight the recently-passed FAA reauthorization. This five-year, bipartisan landmark legislation will enhance air travel for many Americans and provide stability for all those working in the aviation sector. During this speech, I highlighted my work and significant provisions for Kansas that were included in the legislation. To view more on these provisions, click here. To watch my floor speech, click here. 
￼ 
On Monday, I was in Kansas City where I joined FAA officials during their executive meeting. During the meeting, we discussed a number of topics including the FAA reauthorization bill and the significant impact it will have on the FAA’s responsibilities, our success in the fight against air traffic control privatization, protecting general aviation and supporting small and rural airports. Thank you to FAA Regional Administrator Joe Miniace and Deputy Regional Administrator John Speckin for arranging my visit and for the productive conversation. 

￼
Touring the University of Kansas Health Systems Emergency Department
Following my meeting with FAA officials on Monday, I was at the University of Kansas Health System Kansas City campus to tour their emergency department and meet with transplantation officials. I was pleased to hear from many hospital employees on things being done in the emergency department to protect vulnerable populations and improve outcomes for the many Kansans who utilize this world-class facility. During my tour of the emergency department, I heard many concerns about the growing impact of the opioid epidemic on the hospital, as well as the constant need for quality mental health services. Additionally, I met with transplantation officials to hear an update on the system’s diverse transplant program and current challenges they are facing, and we also discussed ways that we can work together to increase organ donations across the state and country. Kansas City and the whole state are grateful for the talented individuals who work at the University of Kansas Health System and their dedicated work to care for Kansans. Thank you to Health System Kansas City Division COO Chris Ruder for leading my tour and to Vice President of Operative Services Dr. Sean Kumer for discussing the transplantation program. 
Now Accepting Spring Internship Applications My own interest in public service was sparked by an internship for Kansas First District Congressman Keith Sebelius in 1974. As an intern, I had the chance to learn firsthand how a Congressional office operates and how the legislative process works. I am proud to be able to offer this same opportunity in my Senate office today, where I have interns year-round working closely with my staff on behalf of Kansans.  Applications for internships in my Washington, D.C. and Kansas offices for Spring 2018 are due October 27. Congressional internships are open to qualified undergraduate and graduate students who have an interest in public service and have achieved academic excellence. Click here for more information. 
Honored to Serve You in Washington
It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard. 
Please let me know how I can be of assistance. You can contact me by email by clicking here. You can also click here to contact me through one of my Kansas offices or my Washington, D.C., office.

Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends: 
Hurricane Michael was a devastating storm, one of the most powerful hurricanes in decades. Recovery and rebuilding operations have commenced in the aftermath of this storm and I am confident in the resilience of Floridians.  As you work to clean up your homes and property, please be careful to avoid scammers.

Constituent Corner
A constituent from Brooksville contacted my office because his tax return was being audited without any update from the IRS.  My office submitted an inquiry and learned that his return was pulled for final review before approval. The constituent later emailed my office and said “I wanted to update you and thank you for all of your assistance with our IRS tax return audit. We have received our return.”
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you. 
Legislative Update 
Last week, I published an op-ed in the Citrus Chronicle about a commonsense healthcare solution bill I recently sponsored. Most of our nation’s healthcare spending is spent on a small percentage of very sick people. These individuals account for a large portion of insurance companies’ expenses. In response, insurance companies recoup those costs by raising premiums, copays and deductibles for the rest of their customers - those who do not need much healthcare. 
The ACA exacerbated this problem by imposing an onerous list of mandated health benefits and unprecedented price controls on insurance companies in typical Washington top-down mandate. This toxic brew resulted in skyrocketing premiums on the young and healthy, with insurance companies still losing money because these individuals couldn’t afford to buy insurance.
Click here to read about the bill I’ve introduced to address this issue.

Saracini Aviation Safety Act Signed into Law
 ￼ 
Last week, the President signed a bipartisan FAA reauthorization measure that protects passengers, pilots, and flight attendants by mandating the installation of secondary barriers on all new commercial aircraft. Due to the tireless work of Ellen Saracini, Congressman Josh Gottheimer, and Senator Pat Toomey, The Saracini Safety Aviation Act is finally law. 
This critical measure seeks to prevent our aircraft from being hijacked again. I am deeply appreciative of the dedication of Ellen, Josh, and my bipartisan colleagues who worked fervently to enact this measure. American citizens are undoubtedly safer.  We will continue to fight until all current passenger aircraft contain secondary barriers.

Social Security Announces 2.8 Percent Increase
 ￼ 
I’m pleased to announce that 2019 Cost of Living Adjustment for Social Security will be 2.8%. The COLA is one of social security’s most important protections, which ensures benefits keep up with inflation. While the announcement of a 2.8% COLA is good news, we can and must do better for our seniors. Social Security is a promise and earned benefit that Americans have paid into throughout their entire lives. Whether it is ensuring seniors get the benefits they worked for or expanding access to Medicare for those in need, I am committed to standing up for Bucks and Montgomery county residents. 
  
Bensalem Business Visit
￼ 
As part of my small business tour, I visited the Jean Madeline Aveda Institute in Bensalem. The institution trains and educates beauty industry professionals in our community. Effective workforce development programs are key to preparing students for careers and furthering the education of professionals to remain competitive in the modern workplace. 
  
Oldest VFW in Bucks County
￼  
I was proud to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Joseph A. Schumacher VFW Post 1597 in Croydon. This post along with their Auxilary is the oldest Veterans of Foreign Wars Post in Bucks County. Thank you for your dedication to our veterans, their families and our community.

MARK IN THE NEWS
ABC7 News: Could air traffic controller shortage have impact on safety?
We cannot wait for a tragedy to prompt us to take action to address gaps in aviation safety and ensure that staffing shortages are addressed. Mark spoke with ABC7 News about the shortage of air traffic controllers in the Bay Area and around the country.

MARK'S LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Bringing Innovative Solutions to Housing Crisis America is on the verge of a major housing crisis, especially in high-cost regions like the Bay Area. Working families in communities across the country have few affordable housing options within a reasonable distance to their workplace. The tradeoff becomes traveling great lengths to their jobs and spending hours stuck in traffic rather than with their families. This week I introduced a bill that will help incentivize innovative solutions to America's housing crisis. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution to these challenges, our bill will help communities explore much-needed innovative housing solutions like expanding common amenities for a younger workforce, building accessory dwelling units—like basement apartments or converting garages into housing—and adapting one or several buildings into multiple housing units. To learn more about our bill, click here.   Fighting for Women and Working Families I am proud to annouce that I received a 100% from the American Association of University Women (AAUW) Action Fund for the 115th Congress for our work fighting for women's economic security, equal access to education, and civil rights. I look forward to building on these efforts and working to make America more just, fair, and equal. Learn more about the organization here.

OPINIONS FROM THE DISTRICT  
Hearing directly from you not only informs my work in Congress, but also is my favorite part of being your Representative. To share your opinions with me you can either email me or take our survey.
Below are some of the top issues you shared with me over the last week:
	•	160 constituents wrote in opposing the Advancing the Quality and Understanding of American Aquaculture (AQUAA) Act (S. 3138), which would allow for permits to be issued for marine finfish aquaculture activities and cause harm to fish.  
	•	36 constituents wrote in to oppose offshore drilling along the coast of California, which could cause serious damage to wildlife migration routes and habitats along the coastline.  
	•	24 constituents continued to express opposition to the House version of the Farm Bill reauthorization, which would cut essential programs like SNAP and agricultural subsidies.

LETTERS MARK RECENTLY SENT
Letter to the Acting Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency opposing the use of WIFIA loan funds to finance the WaterFix/twin tunnels project in California.
Letter to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to oppose the Administration's moves to roll back rules that protect conservation areas from environmentally harmful roads and logging infrastructure
Letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services urging them to rethink changes to the outpatient service payment rates that may reduce the ability of hospitals to deliver care to vulnerable patient

Dear Lindsey, 
Paying for childcare is just plain hard for the working families I’ve spoken with across Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District. As a mother of three and a new grandmother, I know it’s challenging to raise young children, and we must find ways to help make the lives of working families a little bit easier. I also know that too many families across the state struggle to care for aging parents, and giving them new financial flexibility to pay for that care is important. The Child and Dependent Care Modernization Act of 2018 will do both by modernizing the maximum amount a family can contribute to Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts to track with the real costs of dependent care today. 
￼
At the White House, I met with President Trump and the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons to discuss the administration’s progress to end human trafficking with cabinet-level officials. President Trump shared that the “administration is committed to leveraging every resource we have to confront this threat, to support the victims and survivors, and to hold traffickers accountable for their heinous crimes.” He praised my legislation, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), that has led the fight against sex trafficking on the internet. I look forward to continued cooperation with the President to fight trafficking and support survivors. 
￼
￼
￼
As a member of the Financial Services Committee, rolling back regulations that burden small businesses and Main Street Americans is one of my top priorities. Regions Bank is expanding into St. Louis with several branches, and I attended the ribbon cutting for their newest branch in O’Fallon. The reform of several Dodd-Frank provisions has given neighborhood banks like Regions the opportunity to expand and give back to the community. In Congress, it’s my privilege to continue cutting red tape and providing ways for our economy and job market to grow.

St. Charles County recently opened their new Emergency Management Operations Center. Together with St. Charles County Executive Steve Ehlmann, I visited the 30,000 square foot facility where the planning and coordination of disaster preparedness, response, and recovery takes place. The project finished over half a million under budget and enables St. Charles County to more efficiently respond to emergencies.   Next door, we met the St. Charles County Police Cyber Crimes Unit, which focuses on crimes against children and exploitation, including human trafficking. The unit is home to the Midwest’s only Electronic Storage Detection K9, Corporal Bonnie! We became fast friends, and besides being adorable, Bonnie can search, locate, and recover hidden electronics containing evidence to assist police in criminal investigations. I was fascinated to hear about their work and look forward to visiting again in the future!

 Last Friday, Seaman 1st Class Natale I. Torti, who made the ultimate sacrifice at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, was welcomed home to his final resting place at Jefferson Barracks. As Americans, we honor the memories of all those who served by remembering that freedom is not free. Our peace and protection have been bought and paid for with the blood of generations in uniform who have gone before us. My thoughts are with the Torti family, and I pray our country will be ever mindful of our heroes’ service and sacrifice.

One of my favorite stops last week was a visit to Mr. Brueckmann’s government class at Pattonville High School. I delivered 200 U.S. Constitution booklets and quizzed the students about the amendments and articles. Our nation’s Constitution is over 231 years old and still the standard bearer for freedom and democracy around the world. It was my pleasure to share our founding document with them--these Pattonville students have a bright future!

ADVOCATING FOR S.A.L.T. RELIEF 
The tax bill President Trump signed into law last year effectively eliminated the federal deduction for  state and local tax (SALT) paid by many Illinois residents, and punishes many Illinois families. Our state already pays more in federal taxes than we receive back in benefits, making the elimination of the SALT deduction even more egregious. Last week, I joined a letter urging Governor Rauner to address the damage of this new law on Illinois taxpayers and explore options for relief as other states have done, including New Jersey, New York, and California.
Read the letter on our website. 
  
NEIGHBORHOOD OFFICE HOURS 
This week, our constituent service representatives will be in Mt. Prospect, and  Glenview. If you need assistance with a federal issue, please come see us!

Dear fellow South Carolinians,  Thank you for subscribing to my weekly e-newsletter, and please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.  
Women Veteran’s Event Last week, I was happy to announce the keynote speaker at my upcoming South Carolina Women Veteran’s event: my friend and colleague, Sen. Joni Ernst.   Senator Ernst is a force to be reckoned with. Not only does she hold the title of United States Senator, but she also holds the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard. As a combat veteran herself, I am so excited to welcome her back to the Palmetto State. I have no doubt that her passion, story, and mission will resonate with South Carolina’s 43,000 women veterans.  You can learn more about the event here, and RSVP at www. scott.senate.gov/veteransrsvp.

10/15/18 16:57,"Baldwin’s Buy America Requirements, Reforms to Protect Water Resources Pass Senate","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email


￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
A number of key reforms championed by Senator Baldwin to support Wisconsin workers and businesses, invest in innovative water technology, protect the Great Lakes and address our drinking water challenges were included in the bipartisan Water Resources Development Act, which passed the Senate and now heads to the President for his signature. 
“This bipartisan legislation that passed the full Senate includes many reforms that I worked for to support Wisconsin businesses and our workers here at home, while investing in innovative water technologies to help us solve the water challenges we face throughout our state and nation,” said Senator Baldwin. “I am proud that we are working together to change how communities respond to water crises, improve public health and protect our coastal communities and freshwater resources, including the Great Lakes, for future generations to come.” 
To ensure the bipartisan Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) works for Wisconsin, Senator Baldwin took action by: 
Fighting for Wisconsin Workers and Businesses 
The bill includes a five-year extension of Buy America requirements for water infrastructure projects funded by the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. 
The Senate version of the water infrastructure legislation included Senator Baldwin’s permanent Buy America requirement, which earned President Trump’s support. The House-passed legislation included no Buy America requirement.  In House-Senate negotiations on the final 2018 WRDA, the House would only agree to move to a five-year Buy America extension. 
“Our American manufacturers and workers deserve a permanent Buy America commitment from Washington that rewards their hard work,” said Senator Baldwin. “I’m going to continue my work to ensure that we are doing right by them by making sure that America is buying what Wisconsin makes with a permanent Buy America standard.”
Supporting Innovative Water Technology 
Senator Baldwin secured provisions from her Water Technology Acceleration Act that will incentivize the development and deployment of emerging water technologies to provide better solutions to our most pressing water challenges. The bill dedicates $10 million each year to the new Innovative Water Technology Grant Program created by Senator Baldwin to address water quality issues. Wisconsin entrepreneurs are at the cutting edge of water technology innovation, and this effort will help to ensure these new solutions are deployed to respond to threats to our drinking water, from lead in water to groundwater contamination. This effort is supported by The Water Council. 
Preventing Asian Carp from Reaching the Great Lakes 
The bipartisan legislation also takes an important step to addressing a major threat to Wisconsin’s economy—the threat of Asian Carp entering the Great Lakes. The bill authorizes funding for the critical action-plan for blocking Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes. 
Senator Baldwin was successful last year in ensuring the draft-version of the Brandon Road Study was released publicly. Finalizing this critical effort is the next step in Senator Baldwin’s efforts to press for action and protect the Great Lakes fishery, a $7 billion industry. 
Investing in Clean Drinking Water 
Senator Baldwin fought for critical investments in WRDA to promote clean drinking water through the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund. This funding will provide financial assistance to local governments in Wisconsin for drinking water infrastructure projects. In addition, WRDA reauthorizes and strengthens the Water Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act to support water infrastructure projects. 
WRDA also provides grant opportunities for states to assist local communities in addressing water contamination issues and increases funding for the monitoring, testing and replacement of school drinking water fountains that contain lead components. 
Strengthening Wisconsin’s Coastal Communities 
WRDA directs the Army Corps to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the water resources needs of the Great Lakes System. Senator Baldwin worked to include this Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study to develop a coordinated strategy to manage and protect the Great Lakes coastline from threats associated with erosion, flooding and aging infrastructure. In Wisconsin, severe erosion threatens homes, public utilities and infrastructure in affected areas, including Mount Pleasant, Racine and Kenosha. 
This study has the support of seven Great Lakes states, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and several organizations including the Great Lakes Commission and Coastal States Organization.

Dear Friend,
It’s now been a little more than a week since the Senate voted to confirm now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. As I look back on the past few weeks, I think first about the hundreds of stories I heard from other survivors of sexual assault on Facebook, in the media, and most importantly, through direct messages I received from neighbors, friends, and acquaintances.
To everyone who reached out to me directly, thank you. Your messages were incredibly powerful and moving, and I cannot thank you enough for your trust.
For everyone reading this, I hope that the last few weeks have reminded us that millions of Americans have been victims and will be victims of sexual assault.  This is an epidemic, and we all have to work together to end it.
I had the opportunity to deliver remarks on the Senate floor about the messages I received just over a week ago, and in case you did not have the opportunity to see the speech, I want to share the text with all of you.
My floor speech, as delivered, is below:
It was a week ago today that members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on which I serve were riveted by the compelling and powerful testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. It is a week ago today that Judge Brett Kavanaugh delivered his forceful rejoinder and rebuttal. Today I want to take a moment and share with members of this chamber and folks who may be watching something else that was happening during that entire hearing that I did not expect that was powerful and unique and special in my experience as a public servant and that I've heard as I've listened to other senators of both parties who were present and who I've talked to afterwards. It was their experience as well. This conversation is bigger. It's bigger. It's more pressing. And I'd say it's more important than the question of one Supreme Court seat and one current nominee. This is a question about whether we as a country at the highest levels of power believe victims and survivors of sexual assault and are willing to listen to them, to believe them, and to take action.
So, what was it that happened last Thursday? As I tried to pay attention to the remarkable testimony of Dr. Ford, my phone was blowing up. I got texts. I got instant messages. I got phone calls. I got emails. I got Facebook posts. I got messages from more ways that you could connect with me than I knew were possible. And these were stories. Powerful stories. Stories that friends of mine, people I've known for years or decades, people I barely know, or people I hope to get to meet. They were sharing with me stories of assault. They were told by classmates, neighbors, friends, constituents, people who had carried these burdens alone for years. These stories are difficult to hear, but important that they be heard. It is important to understanding why survivors stay silent. And it's important to understanding why we as a body and a nation must get this moment right. Important to understanding why the President and others are wrong when they say that if a victim's allegations are true, she would have filed a report or come forward decades ago.
In response to the question, ""Why didn't Dr. Christine Blasey Ford come forward earlier?"" I have just this experience to share: that the texts and emails, the conversations in person and over the phone with friends I've known for so long and friends I've just met, make it powerfully clear to me that the many ways in which assault and violation happens in our country between people have as many different reasons why they hide them, carry them, and keep them in darkness, in quiet, and in shame. And each one of those stories reminds me even more powerfully the reasons we must, we must demonstrate that they are heard.
One friend from Delaware, a cancer survivor, someone I've spoken about on this floor before because of her survival of a nearly life-ending cancer, she confided in me she was terrorized and raped as a small child. Living with the effects of that experience, she said, has been way harder than cancer. She said to me early childhood trauma can be difficult to describe and doesn't lend itself easily to a court room narrative understanding. She is right.
A male friend, someone I know from high school, shared with me an experience he had during a spring break trip. Shared how on a biology field trip to Mexico when he sought help from the trip organizer after snorkeling fins blistering his ankles after administering first aid in the hotel room, he was assaulted. And his comment was he was too shocked to call for help and did not tell anyone for over three decades.
You know, he is right. She is right. They are not alone. Today I want to share a few more stories shared over the last weeks by brave men and women shining light on the challenges, the fear, the shame, and the anger surrounding sexual assault. This is under the #WhyIDidntReport and I think it helps lend some understanding to the dynamics of surviving assault.
Under #WhyIDidntReport, ""I had known him for years,"" one victim said. ""Why I didn't report? Because he was sorry. Because I was drunk. Because I was young and ashamed and felt like I had somehow asked for it even though I had said ‘no’ and ‘stop.’ Because even typing this makes me feel it all again.""
Another in response to this hashtag said, ""Because my counselor said they won't believe you because you're not a pretty girl.""
Another said, ""I blamed myself. I was humiliated and hurt. I thought they were my friends. I felt safe until I wasn't and then it was too late. I wanted to wash it away and never think about it again.""
Another said, ""Because I feel ashamed of what happened and didn't want to publicly ruin someone's life even though they privately ruined mine.""
""Because he was my boyfriend and I was sleeping. He told me he had been accused of this before and it wasn't rape because we were dating.""
Another victim posted, ""My mom did report my 18-year-old cousin when I was nine. I had to testify sitting across the table from him. I froze. I cried. I couldn't speak. All charges were dropped.""
And earlier this week at a town hall in Delaware, the Delaware City Fire Company. Someone I've known for decades got out of her car, came up to me, gave me a huge hug and weeping said, ""I never told my husband. I never told my son. And today I have."" And in her voice, there was both heavy emotion and an enormous sense of relief. And I have to say for me, a sense of great pain that I was wishing I could do nothing except sit and listen, to honor her story, to provide some sense of comfort and support and recognition and yet had to move on to the town hall after a few moments.
At a dinner here in Washington just last night, someone shared with me an amazing story of her daughter's suffering. And to hear a story of that power and pain in the midst of a social setting is both wonderful in that they are trusting with a story that they have held onto for so long and terrible in that it is a reminder of the ways in which we speak to each other of surviving assault in hushed tones and in dark corners and on the internet and anonymously.
Whatever comes out of this week, whatever comes out of the proceedings of this floor today and tomorrow and this weekend, we must listen and recognize that hundreds of thousands of American women and men have been victims, are victims, will be victims of sexual assault. And according to our Department of Justice, at least two thirds have never reported it. There is an ocean of pain in this nation not yet fully heard, not yet appropriately resolved, not yet fully addressed. And everyone within earshot of my voice, the women and men in this chamber, the staff, journalists, colleagues, friends, members of the public, those who think Brett Kavanaugh should be a Supreme Court Justice and those who do not, those who have either themselves been victimized by assault or know someone, a loved one, a family member, a neighbor, a classmate, a fellow parishioner, a colleague or a friend, we all, all have an opportunity here. A moment to make it clear that we welcome and will respect and listen to and act on stories that have been and will be shared with us. And that we will act.
If I could make one request, it would be that we come out on the other side of these last few weeks with an awareness of those who are in silent and deep and lonely pain often right next to us, all around us in our families, in our churches, in our workplaces and in our communities. And that we give them the listening, the understanding, and the embrace to help them heal.
You know in today's hyper-partisan environment where we are quick to question motives of others and search for any excuse to discredit or devalue and doubt. I also wanted to add one small, but I think important point. Every victim who has spoken to me in the past week, they were not looking for anything. They were not looking for a settlement. They were not looking for some lawsuit. They were simply looking for acknowledgment. They were looking to share something they've carried too long alone. They just wanted to be heard. 
Our country is watching. This is a moment where the Senate as an institution and the country as a whole needs to show we can and will do better. And I hope we will listen. That we will listen as we continue to move forward important legislation. The Violence Against Women Act, which my predecessor then-Senator Biden helped champion in a bipartisan way over several congresses. The Victims Against Child Abuse Act, which even now I am working with a bipartisan team to try and get through this chamber to be reauthorized. There are many more things we can and should do to work to combat sexual abuse, sexual assault, and to help prevent and heal.
But what I most wanted to say today, to the friends and the acquaintances, to my constituents and my community, to my nation and the world that may well be watching this moment in the United States, to those whose stories I have just shared and whose stories I have just heard, I simply wanted to say this. You have touched my heart deeply. I hear you, and I thank you.

Mrs. Lindsey P.

Scottsblue, NE 69361
  
Dear Mrs.  : 
  
Knowing of your interest in protecting life, I am writing to update you on recent developments. 
As you may know, the federal fiscal year ends on September 30th, and Fiscal Year 2019 began on October 1, 2018. This date marks an important deadline in the appropriations process, as no money can be spent in the new fiscal year without Congressional approval. Traditionally, this process involves a series of 12 separate bills which fund different sectors of the government. 
While the appropriations process is an essential step in the continued operation of our government, it is also a chance to set key spending and policy priorities for the next fiscal year. For this reason, on September 10, 2018, I joined forty-seven of my colleagues in writing a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy urging them to protect important pro-life and family values provisions which were included in the House version of the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2019 (H.R. 6470). 
These provisions would have prevented American tax dollars from funding abortion, protected health care providers from being discriminated against because of pro-life religious beliefs, defunded Planned Parenthood, prohibited the National Institutes of Health from funding research on aborted fetal tissue, and ensured faith based adoption and foster care providers are not subject to government discrimination. However, these important protections were missing from the Senate version of the bill.
Despite this support, the bicameral conference committee which negotiated the combined Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019 and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 (H.R. 6157) removed virtually all these provisions from the final version of the legislation. The removal of these provisions, in conjunction with historically and unsustainably high levels of spending, led me to vote against conference report, which eventually passed by a vote of 361-61, despite my opposition, on September 26, 2018.
While H.R. 6157 was signed into law by the President on September 28, 2018, I remain committed to continuing to work with my colleagues to advocate for these critical family values and pro-life provisions. Rest assured, as a member of the Bipartisan Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, protecting unborn life and defending religious liberties remain at the forefront of my legislative priorities.

Dear Lindsey, 
From a roundtable with local leaders in the salon and beauty service industry, to celebrating our farmers and manufacturers, to criminal justice reform, the last week and a half have been busy in Illinois' 18th District. Continue on to read my latest update:
Around the District
Tax Relief for Small Businesses
￼  ￼ 
I hosted a community roundtable with stakeholders across the hair care and beauty service industry to discuss bipartisan legislation to update current law to provide equitable treatment and administrative relief to small businesses. This legislation, introduced with Congresswoman Suzan DelBene (D-WA), will extend the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) tax tip credit to employer-based beauty service establishments where tipping is also customary—just as the food service industry was granted in 1993. Not providing salons and barbershops with the FICA tax tip credit cost the businesses and employees I heard from over $200,000 last year. Extending this tax credit to the salon and beauty industry is common sense. With over 80 percent of the 1.2 million beauty industry businesses employing less than ten employees, which are predominantly owned and operated by women and minorities, it is important that we provide them with the necessary tools to succeed.

Visiting Local Businesses to Celebrate Manufacturing Day
￼  ￼ 
In recognition of Manufacturing Day, I had the opportunity to stop in Goodfield to witness the innovative work CNH Industrial is doing for our agriculture industry, specifically in tillage and fertilizer equipment. While walking the floor, I had a wonderful time touching base with dozens of welders and floor managers to hear their stories about working at CNH and how modern manufacturing has presented new opportunities across the industrial sector over the years.

Criminal Justice Reform
￼
￼
I stopped by the Peoria County Jail to hear about the success of the Jobs Partnership re-entry program and impact it is having on students in the program. The Jobs Partnership program is a Biblically-based 12-week program that offers classes on how to manage money, job skills, resume writing, and other important life skills. Many times inmates feel like society has given up on them, but programs like the Jobs Partnership give inmates the necessary skills to find good jobs and reenter society with a purpose. Criminal justice reform is necessary, and I applaud program director Cheryl Parks and Peoria County Sheriff Brian Asbell for the work they are doing to improve our criminal justice system and find creative ways help individuals looking for a second chance.
USDA Grants Announced for West-Central Illinois
￼ 
Pleased to announce two U.S. Department of Agriculture grant awards for our rural communities in west-central Illinois. Farming communities are critical to the overall prosperity of our 18th District and I appreciate the USDA's commitment to investing in projects that will help those in need and expand access to necessary resources in our local communities.
Release: Rep. LaHood Announces Two USDA Grant Awards for Rural Communities in West-Central Illinois 
E15 Restrictions Lifted
￼  
President Trump’s announcement to lift restrictions on E15 is welcome news for the agriculture industry in Illinois’ 18th Congressional District. Ethanol sales help drive demand for corn in Illinois and the announcement today will broaden opportunities for our farmers looking to sell more E15. Not only will the expansion of E15 sales benefit our farmers in central and west-central Illinois, but this will provide fuel retailers and consumers with more cost-efficient choices that reduce gas emissions into our environment. I applaud President Trump for his commitment to the American farmer and recognizing the importance of ethanol sales for our farmers in the Midwest and appreciate his efforts to allow for year-round sales 
Ripon Advance: ""U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood (R-IL) also applauded the president for recognizing the importance of ethanol sales for farmers in the Midwest."" 
Celebrating National Farmers Day
  ￼ 
Happy National Farmers Day! Be sure to get out a thank a farmer for all the hard work they do to produce food, fiber, and fuel. Agriculture is the backbone of our 18th District and we have some of the best farmers in the world. I am grateful for the opportunity to represent so many dedicated farmers in Congress and thank you for your continued work in feeding America. 
Supporting Homeless Veterans
  ￼  ￼ 
Last weekend, I joined Goodwill’s 10th annual Stand Down for Homeless Veterans event at Dozer Park which served over 180 veterans with more than 250 volunteers. Services provided included hair cuts, showers, flu shots, HIV/STD testing, and information about  veterans health benefits.   Special thanks to the entire Goodwill staff, including Don Johnson and Johanna Wagner, and Bill Davies, the Post Commander of American Legion Post #2.

New Homes for Low-Income Communities
￼ 
Visiting Virginia in Cass County, I was able to witness firsthand the 25 new home construction projects taking place for low-income families. While serving in Congress, I've been supportive of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and have written in support of initiatives such as these, which allows developers to work with the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) and county housing authorities to construct affordable options for families.
Meeting with Local Leaders
￼ ￼
It was a great opportunity to catch up with the village president of Germantown Hills, Mike Henrichson, to hear more about the bold economic initiatives the town is planning to improve safety within their community.                        ￼   Sincerely, ￼  Darin LaHood Member of Congress

The Hill Report   A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions Week of October 8 - October 13, 2018
As the Co-Chairman of the Congressional Down Syndrome Caucus, I am proud of the strides we have made to better the lives of disabled individuals, their families, and caregivers. One of the greatest honors in my career was The Dylan Lee James Family Opportunity Act, which was signed into law in 2006, to give states the option to create a Medicaid “buy in” for families of children with disabilities whose family income or resources were up to 300% of federal poverty level.  In addition, after six long years of working with my colleagues, organizations, and families across the country, in December 2014 we also passed the ABLE Act. This nearly decade-long legislative effort has allowed families who have a child with a disability to save for their long-term care through 529-style savings accounts. These two landmark pieces of legislation are two major victories for the disability community and I am so proud that I was able to be a part of these efforts.
Last year, I was also fortunate to have had the opportunity to testify before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies as a father, as a Member of Congress, and as a fierce advocate for the disability community to discuss why I believe research in this area is critical to helping the disability community and providing them with every resource to give them the best quality of life possible.
 ￼ 
My son, Alex, is a hardworking, fun-loving, and accomplished young man who also has Down Syndrome. Every day, he shows me and those who know him that his abilities far outnumber his disability. While we have made immense strides, we still have more work to do especially in the area of research and advocacy. As your Member of Congress, I am honored to be able to help individuals with disabilities, like Alex, have the opportunities they need and deserve to succeed. 
Events in the District  
North Texas Crime Commission (NTCC)  On Thursday morning, I was delighted to once again join my friends with the NTCC for their monthly breakfast. Everyday, the men and women who work in law enforcement get up and place themselves in harms way in order to protect our communities. They deserve our respect and support, and I am always proud to stand in solidarity with them. 
￼  Congressman Sessions with Commissioner Rob Kyker. 
Walk to End Alzheimer’s  On Saturday morning, I participated in the Walk to End Alzheimer’s. This yearly event is a meaningful gathering of folks who walk in honor of someone special in their life who may have been impacted by Alzheimer’s. In addition to walking in honor of a loved one, this is a walk in support of finding a cure in our lifetime for this disease. My job as a Member of Congress is not only to represent those in our community, but also to understand their needs. It was a delight to speak about my personal connection with Alzheimer’s and join in the fight to find a cure.
￼  Congressman Sessions participating in the Walk to End Alzheimer’s. 
Medal of Honor Foundation AFS Award Luncheon  It was a true honor to serve as the Honorary Host at the Medal of Honor Foundation’s Tribute to Valor Luncheon. Every year, this luncheon brings together members of the American military’s most exclusive fraternity, the living men who have been awarded the Medal of Honor. It is a truly humbling experience to be around so many of our nation’s heroes, and an incredible honor to be asked to help pay tribute to them and the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice and were not able to make it home.
￼  Congressman Sessions at the Medal of Honor Foundation’s Tribute to Valor Luncheon. 
Rise School Roundup  On Friday evening, I attended the Rise Roundup celebrating the 20th anniversary of The Ashford Rise School of Dallas & the TouchDown Club of Dallas.  The Rise School Dallas provides the highest quality of early childhood education services to children with Down Syndrome and other developmental disabilities and to children without disabilities in an inclusive classroom setting.  As the father of a son with Down Syndrome, I greatly appreciate the amazing work of the Ashford Rise School of Dallas and the The TouchDown Club of Dallas.

October 15, 2018   Dear  @gmail.com,  As I do from time to time, I want to take this weekly opportunity to share a column from one of my colleagues.  
Nobody in Congress today has the same experience with politically motivated violence as my good friend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise. Last year before the annual Congressional Baseball Game for charity, Steve was shot by a self-identified leftist who attacked the Republican congressmen practicing for the game.  
I praise God for my friend's miraculous recovery, and I hope Steve's words below remind all of us how violence, harassment, and mob mentalities have no place in our Republic.  
Thank you for reading.  

Rep. Steve Scalise on FoxNews.com: When Eric Holder, other Dems call for violence, that's a direct threat to our democracy 
This summer, California Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters called on her supporters to harass cabinet officials. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that you “cannot be civil” with members of the Republican Party. And Wednesday, videotape was released of former Attorney General Eric Holder telling a Democratic audience at a campaign rally in Georgia on Sunday that they should “kick” Republicans when they perceive them as “going low.”   Despite the continued reports of politically motivated threats or violence, Democratic Party leaders have worked to keep this anger burning and incite even more harassment and violence.    Beginning with my own near-death experience at the hands of a deranged shooter who sought to assassinate a baseball field of Republicans, there is a growing list of violent or threatening actions taken against conservatives by Democrats. 
	•	Ashley Kavanaugh, Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s wife and his daughters received multiple credible threats.
	•	Dana Loesch, NRA spokeswoman, received death threats against her children on Twitter. Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., received such a threatening phone call that the man has now been indicted.
	•	Jamie Gardner, wife of Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., wife, received a text of a beheading after the vote to confirm Justice Kavanaugh.
	•	Several Republican Senators had their personal information, including home addresses, posted to Wikipedia for threatening purposes by a Democrat House staffer.
	•	Congressman Clay Higgins (R-La.) received threatening phone calls that led to a man’s arrest.   Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kent., and his wife Kelly Paul have both received credible threats that have led to arrests.
	•	Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and his wife, as well as White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee-Sanders, were chased out of restaurants.
	•	Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was confronted by protesters and harassed out of a DC restaurant.
	•	Rudy Peters, a Republican California Congressional candidate, was nearly stabbed while campaigning.
	•	My office has continued to receive threats against my life that have led to arrests. 
	•	A female pro-life activist was violently assaulted by a man that has now been found guilty of eight counts of assault for this and similar incidents.
And this list goes on. The threats and the violence have not let up and instead of seeing my Democrat colleagues calling for an end, there have been calls for their supporters to keep going, to do even more to threaten Republicans.  As a survivor of a politically motivated attack, it is tragic to think this is an acceptable state of political discourse in our country. I refuse to stand for this and I will continue to call for an end to it. A healthy, strong democracy is not possible if anyone lives in fear of expressing their views.  If this is going to stop, it must start with Democratic leaders, who need to condemn, rather than promote these dangerous calls to action.  In America, we win battles at the ballot box, not through mob rule or intimidation. While it’s clear many Democrats refuse to accept the election of President Trump, if they want change, they need to convince people with their ideas and actually win elections, rather than call for violent resistance, harassment, and mob rule.  As I see, working in Congress every day, it’s possible to agree without being disagreeable and address political differences in a civil manner. That’s an example leaders need to continue to set.  Instead, when Democratic leaders like Eric Holder call for violence, that is a direct threat to our democracy.  I hope he and others think long and hard about the world they are creating and the impact they are leaving on this country.  As the oldest democracy, our country has long been heralded as the freest country in the world. It doesn’t feel so free if anyone lives in fear for holding or expressing a differing opinion.   Let’s end this violence and return to civility before someone else gets hurt. 

Sincerely, 
￼  John Shimkus Member of Congress

Dear Friends,  
Last week was a busy one here in the Eighth District.  During my time in West Tennessee, I enjoy meeting with business owners, families, students, and other local leaders to understand the best ways to serve you in Washington.  Here's a close look at a few of the highlights from my week: 
Around the Eighth District
￼ 
I recently toured Gerdau Ameristeel Mill in Jackson. I got to see firsthand their day-to-day operations, and I am proud to have this impressive facility right here in West Tennessee. 
￼ 
I was honored to toss the coin for the game between University School of Jackson vs. Northpoint Christian. It was an exciting victory for USJ, and I thank Headmaster Stuart Hirstein for inviting me.
￼ 
I enjoyed getting out for the 4th Annual Minerals Day in Gleason. It was great visiting with Gleason Mayor Diane Poole, McKenzie Mayor Jill Holland, and good people from Weakley County to learn about clay mining. Thanks for having me! 
￼  I was honored to attend the graduation ceremony for the 27th Judicial District Recovery Court in Obion County. Thank you to Judges Jeff Parham, Jimmy Smith, and Tommy Moore; District Attorney General Tommy Thomas; and Sheriff Karl Jackson for all you do for our community. Congratulations to the graduates on this great accomplishment!
￼ 
Harvest season is a busy time of year in West Tennessee. Thank you National Cotton Council of America for organizing a tour of Walker Farms and the Longtown Gin.
￼ 
I had a great visit with local police in Germantown for National Coffee with a Cop Day. Thank you to our law enforcement for all you do to keep our streets safe.
Mark Norris Confirmed to West Tennessee District Court
Last week, Mark Norris for being confirmed as a West Tennessee federal judge.  Mark was among fifteen of President Trump's nominees to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  Mark’s many years of service have made him highly respected throughout the entire state of Tennessee, and I believe he will make an excellent addition to this court. 
West Tennesseans in Washington
    ￼ 
It was great to meet the Quinn family before their tour of the U.S. Capitol. Last week, they visited Washington from Collierville. Thanks for stopping by, John, Jackie, and Katherine!
What's Next in Washington
￼ 
This week, the House is in recess, which means there are no votes scheduled in Washington.  I am excited to be back in West Tennessee, and look forward to traveling around the Eighth Congressional District of Tennessee.  
As always, I am committed to working for you and the Eighth District of Tennessee.  My staff and I are always available to answer questions you may have and address any concerns about what is happening here in Washington.  Please feel free to send me an email by clicking here or visiting my website at Kustoff.House.Gov.  
Have a great week!

10/15/18 12:44,Trillion Dollar Mystery,"Monday Report from Representative Rick Nolan
￼

￼
￼
Whatever Happened to the President's  $1 Trillion Infrastructure Bill? 
￼  If you commute from the 8th District down I-35 to the Twin Cities, congestion will cost you about 41 extra hours in rush-hour traffic every year, along with an additional $1,332 in gasoline and wear and tear on your vehicle. Shipping delays due to highway and rail tie-ups cost Minnesota businesses millions of dollars every year.  
Dear Friend,  
Like so many other Americans, those of us who serve on the House Transportation and Infrastructure committee are wondering – whatever happened to the President’s promise of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill? The answer, 21 months after the President took office, is “nothing.” The President and GOP leaders have earned an “F” for their failure to deliver.   A healthy infrastructure is the foundation of jobs and economic growth, and states rely on the federal government for the lion’s share of funds to fix deteriorating highways, roads, bridges, airports, rail lines, transit systems and water treatment facilities.   The urgent need for more infrastructure funding was again made clear last week with the release a new study by the American Society of Civil Engineers that grades our nation’s deteriorating national infrastructure a “D-plus.” Minnesota is doing a little better than most other states, but not much. Civil Engineers here in Minnesota give our state’s infrastructure a grade of “C.” 
Here’s Minnesota’s Infrastructure Report Card:       Overall - C       Aviation - B       Bridges - C       Dams - C       Drinking Water - C-       Energy - C       Ports - C+       Roads - D+       Transit - C-       Wastewater - C   Minnesota’s overall “C” grade is no surprise. We have about 13,000 bridges, and one in ten are in serious need of repair. According to the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MNDOT), Minnesota ranks 38th in the Nation in the quality of our highways. In fact, more than half of our roads and highways are more than 50 years old.    If you commute from the 8th District down I-35 to the Twin Cities, congestion will cost you about 41 extra hours in rush-hour traffic every year, along with an additional $1,332 in gasoline and wear and tear on your vehicle. Shipping delays due to highway and rail tie-ups cost Minnesota businesses millions of dollars every year.   Because situations like these are so common throughout the nation, the Civil Engineers recommend an investment of at least $3.5 trillion to bring our infrastructure up to 21st Century standards that match what China and the European Union are doing.   To put that $3.5 trillion figure into perspective, we have already spent more than $6 trillion on wars of choice in Iraq and Afghanistan. With interest and the continuing cost of our involvement and care of our wounded military Veterans, that figure is estimated to reach nearly $16 trillion over the next 20 years.    As I have said so many times before, it’s time to put a stop to these endless wars of choice and start reinvesting in America – in infrastructure, human development, medical research, education, addressing climate change, and so many other urgent national priorities to help ensure a better life for future generations.  
We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email. 
Sincerely,  ￼ 

New Report Predicts Unchecked Climate Change Will Cost $54 Trillion  in Damage by 2040
￼  Bigger, more intense hurricanes due to warming ocean waters are causing tens of billions of dollars in damage along the U.S. coastline. 
While Hurricane Michael ripped through Florida with 150-mile per hour winds last week, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was releasing a downright frightening study predicting that even more disastrous storms, flooding, food scarcity, and damage topping $54 trillion will occur by 2040 unless the world undertakes an immediate, herculean effort to address climate change.   According to the report, such an effort would require “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.” In other words, we need a massive new investment in alternative non-fossil fuels - including wind, solar and geothermal - to replace oil and coal, especially in the U.S. and other industrialized nations.   None of this comes as a surprise to those of us who serve on the bipartisan Congressional Climate Change Solutions Caucus – or to experts all around the world who rely on facts and science to analyze and solve problems facing humankind.    As the Minneapolis Star Tribune pointed out last week, the United States should be leading the global effort to address and solve climate change with the same tenacity it took to defeat fascism in World War II or put a man on the moon in 1969.    But instead, the President has called climate change “a Chinese hoax,” announced that the U.S. will pull out of the Paris climate accords, and joined with Republicans in Congress to roll back environmental rules and regulations that have halted the release of billions of tons of carbon into the atmosphere. The hard, cold fact is that unless determined people of good will find a way to overcome his ignorance, the entire world will pay the price for countless generations to come.  

Nolan, Others, Demand Answers as Unauthorized U.S. Involvement in Yemen Civil War Continues Unabated 
￼  According to credible news reports from the region, some 1,400 children have already died as a result of military actions supported by the U.S., and more than 2,000 schools have been destroyed.  
America has no business involving itself in the Saudi-led civil war in the Arab nation of Yemen.  That’s why, last week, I joined more than 50 of my colleagues in a bipartisan letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo demanding that he provide Congress with key documents justifying the continued U.S. role in providing mid-air support to refuel Saudi and United Arab Emirate (UAE) warplanes engaged in targeting and bombing innocent civilians across the region.   That’s also why the House passed my bipartisan amendment to the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act prohibiting funds to deploy U.S. ground troops into the conflict.   Unauthorized by Congress and largely kept secret from the American people, U.S. military involvement in Yemen is contributing to the starvation of millions of people, fueling a terrible cholera epidemic, and strengthening support for anti-American terrorist groups including ISIS and Al Qaeda.   Estimates are that a child dies every 10 minutes from starvation and disease directly related to U.S. support for the Saudi blockade in the region. The simple fact is, America can best provide help in the Africa and the Middle East by dropping food and medicine – not bombs – on innocent people in need.   Moreover, these conflicts have already cost thousands of American lives and are now estimated to cost nearly $16 trillion over the next 20 years. That money should be spent here at home creating good-paying jobs, repairing our infrastructure, conducting medical research, helping young people pay for college, and restoring our environment – just to name a few of the priorities we should be funding with hard-earned taxpayer dollars. 

GOP Lawsuit Could Jeopardize Health  Care for 52 Million Americans with  Pre-existing Conditions
""Pre-existing Conditions"" may include  more than you think
￼  Republicans are back in court attempting to upend the Affordable Care Act and protections for 52 million people with preexisting conditions, and as our old friend, Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Steve Sack points out, Americans are getting pretty tired of getting bounced around with the GOP routine. 
Nineteen Republican-led states are asking a Texas court to declare the Affordable Care Act (Obama Care) unconstitutional. And if they succeed where Republicans in Congress failed in derailing the law, wealthy insurance companies would once again be allowed to deny health coverage to people with preexisting conditions – some 52 million Americans according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.   “Preexisting condition” is a term many assume is limited to diseases such as cancer, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and diabetes, just to name a few. But in reality, pre-existing conditions can encompass a much broader range of common conditions and situations.   For example, under some insurance plans, being pregnant or considering an adoption could be considered a pre-existing condition, as could ongoing marriage counseling and even incidences of domestic abuse. The non-partisan advocacy group Consumer Watchdog lists other common and chronic pre-existing conditions such as acne, toenail fungus, allergies, tonsillitis, bunions and arthritis. In some cases, hazardous occupations such as mining, law enforcement, fire fighting or being a test pilot could be termed pre-existing conditions that could jeopardize health care coverage if this Republican effort were to succeed. 

Severe Fall Storms Hit Northland Bringing Heavy Rain, Strong Wind,  and Snow
￼  My staff and several constituents from across the 8th District shared some photos of the snow they woke up to last Thursday morning – as much as 5 inches in some areas. 
￼  Click on the picture above for KBJR TV video highlights of the storm that hit Duluth  last week.  
Snow wasn't all the northland experienced last week. Heavy rain and strong winds wreaked havoc along the shoreline of Lake Superior - creating 20-foot waves and wind gusts as high as 86 mph. City officials in Duluth closed parts of Canal Park due to significant flooding and have reported considerable damage to local infrastructure, the lakewalk, and area businesses. 

Our Week in Nisswa
￼  After a long, cold, windy, and rainy week back in Minnesota, I thought it was the perfect time to put together the famous Nolan family chili dish. After all, who doesn't enjoy a good bowl of homemade chili?  
Our Week in Duluth
￼  Senior 6th Judicial District Judge John E. DeSanto speaks at the Safe Haven Shelter and Resource Center’s annual luncheon. Safe Haven is celebrating 40 years in the Duluth community this year. This past year, the shelter and resource center served nearly 1,500 survivors of domestic violence. My District Director Jeff Anderson attended this important community event on my behalf.
Our Week with Eleva-Strum School District 
￼  Students and educators from the southern part of Minnesota's 8th District traveled to Strum, Wisconsin to visit and tour the Eleva-Strum School District's student run Cardinal Manufacturing facility. Learning is the main focus of the Cardinal Manufacturing program at the Eleva-Strum School District. Since 2007, Cardinal Manufacturing has been providing exceptional education opportunities for students to build professional, problem solving, and career skills. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen joined the students and educators for a tour  and took these photos.  
Our Week in Crosby 
￼  Charles Black Lance discussed “Education for Minnesota’s Native Americans” at Heartwood Senior Living. Mr. Black Lance’s presentation included a brief history of American Indian education in Minnesota and the motivations and barriers Native American students encounter in the education system. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein attended the event on my behalf. 
Our Week in Pequot Lakes
￼  The Pequot Lakes Fire Department held its annual Fire Prevention Open House. While the cold weather forced much of the event indoors, it didn’t deter these hardy Minnesotans from enjoying the event! Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein attended the Open House on my behalf. 

Finally...
On this day in history: October 15, 2008 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummets 733.08 points, the second-largest percentage drop in the Dow's history 
￼   Ten years ago, unchecked greed and recklessness by Wall Street millionaires and billionaires plunged the U.S. into the worst financial catastrophe since the Great Depression, and as a result, Congress imposed tough new rules and regulations to make sure it would never be repeated. The U.S. government and U.S. taxpayers bailed out Wall Street. But almost as soon as the crisis eased, Republicans in Congress began efforts to allow big banks and investment firms to go right back to the same irresponsible lending practices and lax regulatory policies that caused the 2008 crash in the first place. We simply cannot allow this to happen again.

In Areas Hit by Hurricane Michael, Lines for Necessities Grow Longer  The New York Times PANAMA CITY, Fla. — With much of the area struck by Hurricane Michael without power or running water, residents here are adjusting to a new feature of daily life: the line.
5 key moments from Donald Trump’s rambling 60 Minutes interview  Vox “I’m president, and you’re not,” President Donald Trump told CBS’s Lesley Stahl during an interview aired on 60 Minutes on Sunday — a bizarre moment in a wide-ranging and often combative interview, taped Thursday, in which Stahl pushed the president on his beliefs on climate change, North Korea, and more.
Dean, Lee make closing arguments  Nashville Post Democrat Karl Dean and Republican Bill Lee disagreed most forcefully on health care, medical marijuana and sports gambling as they made their final pitches to voters at a debate Friday night at Belmont University in Nashville.
Senators concerned as Trump official disputes UN climate change warning  The Hill  The Trump administration on Sunday again appeared at odds with lawmakers over the severity of climate change and how it should be addressed in wake of a United Nations report warning of potential dire consequences.

Another Victim of the Trade Spat: U.S. Oil to China  The Wall Street Journal U.S. oil exports to China have slowed to a trickle amid the trade spat between Washington and Beijing, in an abrupt reversal that is upending global crude trade flows and forcing American producers to find new buyers. 
Taylor Swift, the Grown-Up in the Room  The New York Times Last Sunday night, Taylor Swift did something she had never done in her stratospheric career as a pop star: She endorsed a political candidate in Tennessee, her adopted home state.  White House considers 2 female ambassadors to replace Haley at U.N.  POLITICO The White House is adding two high-profile women, both confirmed ambassadors, to the list of candidates to succeed Nikki Haley at the United Nations, according to two senior administration officials: Jamie McCourt and Kelly Knight Craft.  Sincerely, ￼  Jim Cooper

10/15/18 12:06,CEI Blog: Changing our Perspective on Community Colleges,"District Update | October 15, 2018
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email

￼ 
  

Dear Friends,
As tuition at traditional, four-year universities soar, community colleges have grown as an effective and affordable option for American students. As a result, more attention is being paid to community colleges and to finding ways to enable those institutions to best meet the needs of multitudes of students with varied backgrounds, situations, and aspirations. 
However, community colleges are often viewed differently because they are not considered ‘elite’ or ‘competitive’ when compared to top-tier or four-year universities. 
Even though universities are making efforts to make their services available to a broader group of people through more opportunity for financial aid and merit-based scholarships, this is insufficient when addressing the needs of increasing numbers of students entering an evolving workforce. 
In Arkansas, the Career Pathways Initiative (CPI), which started in 2005, serves to enhance the community college experience. It connects education with training programs and support services that help nontraditional students strive for higher levels of education, enabling them to be more competitive members of the labor force. The community college curriculum does more than teach a variety of disciplines; it develops student workers through unique studies and through acknowledgement of employer interests. CPI participants are further supported through employment placement assistance, coursework coaching, and family support services.
About seventy percent of undergraduate students in postsecondary institutions in the United States are nontraditional, and over forty percent of all undergraduate students are from community colleges. Community college has become one of America’s largest and most important anti-poverty programs. The federal Pell Grant for low-income students maxes out at about $5,900 a year, which is usually more than enough to cover community college tuition, but too little to live on. In July, Congress increased the maximum to $6,095 in July, yet the gap between a Pell Grant’s value and the cost of living continues to increase. 
￼
Many low-income students are struggling to make ends meet. They are in a sensitive position, for while they attend school and commit to an education, they sacrifice wages that could be earned during that same time.  The purpose of attending community college is to receive an affordable, quality education that prepares students for a changing employment landscape and that helps them find a fulfilling role in it. Although the institutions do not directly resolve hunger, homelessness, or lack of health care, community colleges help students construct a positive mindset that encourages them to continue taking chances and working to improve their personal circumstances as effectively and efficiently as possible.
The hard work by a majority of CPI participants has resulted in increased wages and tax revenues in addition to a reduction in public assistance benefits. Arkansans who graduate from community colleges are becoming more independent and prepared for our changing world.
The benefits of attending community colleges continue to grow as more students enroll in their programs. Community colleges have become a major asset to our American society and economy as they work to fill the expansive labor gap found in rising generations. CPI has made major contributions to the people and students of Arkansas and will continue to do so as the demand for an evolving workforce is needed.
Sincerely,
￼ 
Representative French Hill

Happy Monday -  
We made it through another week once again. Thank you to everyone who takes the time to read my correspondence and send comments to me. It is an honor to serve Arizona's Fifth Congressional District, and I could not perform my job without the input from my constituents. I'll say it again: we live in the greatest district in the greatest country in the world. 
Exploring a New Frontier of Space 
￼ 
Last week on the podcast, I was pleased to be joined by House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology Chairman, Lamar Smith, who has been a champion for renewing American space exploration efforts and for cutting needless regulations in the federal government. It has been an honor to serve with him in Congress, and we will miss his leadership when he retires. Click this link or the logo above to listen to our conversation. 
Visiting the U.S. Border 
￼ 
This past Friday, I visited the U.S.-Mexico border, making my second trip in four months. Since taking office in January 2017, I have prioritized border security and enforcement of our immigration laws. This is what my constituents expect, and what is necessary to keep them safe from criminally violent illegal aliens. It’s important to travel to the border on a regular basis to understand the challenges our Border Patrol and ICE officers continually face. Special thanks to Border Patrol officer Art Del Cueto for leading the tour on each occasion.
Freedom for Farmers 
￼ 
Since coming to Congress, I have been committed to rolling back overreaching and duplicative government agencies; the ‘Freedom for Farmers Act’ continues this effort. Read MORE about the new bill I introduced last week. 
Subpoena Rod Rosenstein 
￼
￼
At the start of last week, I planned to be in Washington, D.C. for an expected committee hearing with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. When he did not appear, Congressman Matt Gaetz and I called for him to be subpoenaed to appear before the House Judiciary Committee. The Deputy Attorney General must appear before the committee and provide the transparency that the American people deserve. 
Tax Reform Works 
￼ 
The Congressional Budget Office released its latest monthly budget review and proved again that tax reform is working for the American economy.  
	1.	Revenue has INCREASED $13 billion in 2018, compared to 2017 (January through September).
	2.	""Individual income and payroll (social insurance) taxes together rose by $105 billion (or 4 percent),” and the rise in amounts withheld from workers’ paychecks “largely reflects increases in wages and salaries that were partly offset beginning in February by a decline in the share of income withheld for taxes.”
	3.	The fiscal year 2018 deficit ""would be about $11 billion SMALLER than the shortfall that CBO projected in its May 2018 report.""
Welcome Justice Brett Kavanaugh! 
￼ 
Congratulations to the next U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, who started his tenure on the Court over a week ago. I am deeply appreciative that Judge Kavanaugh and his family accepted the duty of public service, and I have no doubt that he will help lead the Supreme Court back to our Founders’ intentions. 
Congratulations Judge Susan Brnovich! 
￼ 
Congratulations to Judge Susan Brnovich. Arizona is fortunate to have a person of her expertise and integrity in the judiciary. We're thankful for the Brnovichs' public service.
A Little of AZ-05 in D.C. 
￼ 
Fall breaks in Arizona are bringing many constituents to Washington, D.C. Recently, the Edens, the Thayns, the Walkers, and the Shainmans visited the U.S. Capitol, and my office was pleased to lead them on tours. Thank you to these families for visiting; we are honored to serve you.

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 10.15.18
Monday, October 15, 2018 –                                 
Health Tidbits
Before the start of the 2019 fiscal year on October 1, the House of Representatives passed several appropriations bills combined with a Continuing Resolution to fund the Federal Government. They have since been signed into law by President Trump.
I voted for the Continuing Resolution. The Continuing Resolution was combined with appropriation bills for the Departments of 1) Labor 2) Health and Human Services 3) Defense, and 4) Education.
These combined bills funded many important things. Today I’m focusing on some of the important health priorities.
Among them: funding for black lung clinics. For the 2018 fiscal year, I introduced an amendment along with Congressman Bobby Scott (D-VA) to provide $10 million for black lung clinics, the most funding ever provided for them. Fiscal year 2019 built on that success by providing $11 million to treat those suffering from black lung, an increase of $1 million.
Further, $1.63 billion in funding was provided for Community Health Centers. These centers are vital for treating many residents of the Ninth District, where 31 centers serve 76,000 patients according to 2017 data. These funds come in addition to $4 billion previously appropriated to Community Health Centers for the 2019 fiscal year.
Finally, $6.7 billion was provided to fight and treat substance abuse and increase access to mental health services. The money is going to agencies such as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Not always but oftentimes, substance abuse and mental health issues overlap.
Every time we debate a bill this large, there are good things I call candy apples and bad things I call toads. In this case, the above-mentioned items were the candy apples that offset the toads.
Flu Season
The flu season is approaching. Young children and the elderly are particularly susceptible to the flu, but it can strike anyone.
Last year’s flu season was lengthy and severe, according to the CDC, causing high levels of hospitalization and emergency room visits. Tragically, it included the highest number of flu-related deaths reported in children during a single season in many years.
Influenza is an enduring threat to health in part because it is difficult to predict. The genetic material in flu viruses constantly changes.
For that reason, flu vaccines vary in effectiveness and must be reformulated each year. Manufacturers have to anticipate the genetic composition of the upcoming season’s prevalent flu strains so they can produce vaccines in time. If their estimate is off, the vaccine’s effectiveness declines.
One way vaccine creators prepare for a flu season is looking at the flu strains in Australia. As winter occurs there while summer takes place in the Northern Hemisphere, its flu season offers clues about what may lie in store for us. However, if the flu strains that hit us here differ substantially, it may be too late to change the vaccine for large-scale production.
Last season’s vaccination effectiveness varied depending on the flu strain. Vaccines for the dominant strain, H3N2, had a relatively low rate of effectiveness.
Ongoing research may provide a nimbler response to flu viruses. One key might lie in how vaccines are developed. At present, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves three methods for manufacturing the flu vaccine: egg-based, cell-based, and recombinant-based.
The most common manufacturing process for vaccines is egg-based. These vaccines take about 22 to 24 weeks to produce and are responsible for 80 to 85% of the flu vaccines manufactured.
Egg-based vaccine production has been used for more than 70 years. Other forms of vaccine manufacture can be produced faster. The FDA approved cell-based vaccine manufacturing in 2012; this production process takes about sixteen to seventeen weeks. Recombinant flu vaccine manufacturing, approved in 2013, can produce vaccines even faster, taking about twelve to fifteen weeks.
If vaccines are produced faster, they can better respond to the virus strains seen once flu season commences.
For those who take the vaccine, it ought to be the most effective for that particular flu season, which is why some other members of the Energy and Commerce Committee and I have been pushing the FDA, the CDC, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (part of the National Institutes of Health) on ways to increase use of faster vaccine manufacturing methods.

Dear Friend, 
When someone says the word ""hygiene,"" what do you think of? You likely think of brushing your teeth, washing your face or hopping in the shower.  
However, what's just as important in today's increasingly digital world is your cyber hygiene. 
Cyber attackers across the globe are working around the clock to gain access to your personal data. They seek out personally identifiable information like bank accounts and social security numbers to perpetuate identity fraud, engage in extortion, or sell our data to people who will engage in those activities. 
All this talk of ""cyber"" and ""digital infrastructure"" can be hard to grasp since we cannot always see someone hacking into computers, but the importance of staying safe online cannot be overstated. 
You don't have to be an expert coder or computer science prodigy to prevent most cyber breaches. As we observe Cybersecurity Awareness Month, read my latest Hurd on the Hill column to learn three easy tips you should implement into your daily ""cyber hygiene"" routine to make sure you protect yourself online.  
￼ 
As always, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office with any questions or concerns. For more updates on my work for you, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube at @HurdOnTheHill.  
Have a great day! 
 Sincerely,  Will

FY18 Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program – Department of Justice 
	•	Recipient: Orange County Sheriff’s Office
	•	Award: $250,000
	•	Description: Orange County Sheriff's Office (OCSO) faces several challenges to analyzing firearms and fired cartridge casings in a timely manner, including a limited number of qualified analysts, no available acquisition and correlation equipment onsite, and current policies for testing and analyzing firearms evidence by Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). At present, the time to conduct firearms analysis and get a report back from FDLE takes from one to six months. OCSO will purchase an Integrated Ballistic Identification System (IBIS) that gives the Forensic Unit the ability to analyze, correlate, and upload data to the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN). This data will become part of the national database for firearms-related evidence. Also, OCSO will engage local and regional partners to process firearms-related evidence for multiple law enforcement agencies, train additional forensic staff members to use the Brasstrax platform, build a secured workstation, utilize overtime hours to reduce the backlog of evidence, and pursue accreditation for the forensic lab. The Brasstrax/Matchpoint system will reduce the report time for firearms related evidence to as little as 48 hours, if needed for expedited cases. 
Federally-Facilitated Exchange Navigator Program Grant – Department of Health and Human Services

Rep. Blum Cosponsors Bill to Protect Social Security & Medicare
WASHINGTON-- Congressman Blum recently cosponsored H.Res.1026 to express the sense of the House that Medicare and Social Security must be protected for current enrollees and preserved for future generations.

Rep. Blum commented, ""Growing up, my mother was dependent on Social Security survivor benefits to put food on the table after my father passed— I personally understand the importance and necessity of these benefits. Iowans have worked hard and paid into the Social Security system with the expectation that these funds will be available upon retirement. Both parties in Congress must work together to enact responsible long-term reforms that will protect both current and future retirees- and this bill confirms my commitment to do so.""

Wicker Highlights Wins for America’s Airports, Water Infrastructure
Confirmation of New Supreme Court Justice Coincides With Major Legislative Accomplishments
The confirmation of a Supreme Court justice deserves national attention.  These lifetime appointments to the court are some of the most influential decisions a president can make.
The consideration of Judge Brett Kavanaugh was no exception, arguably drawing the most intense attention a Supreme Court nominee has ever received.  On October 6, I voted with the majority of my Senate colleagues to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Judicial nominations have been a priority for the Trump Administration, and the Senate has now confirmed two of the President’s Supreme Court nominees, a record 29 circuit court judges, and 53 district court judges.  However, these nominations have not stood in the way of other legislative victories.  In recent weeks, the Senate’s accomplishments have continued to grow, with bills impacting our infrastructure and public safety earning wide bipartisan support.  
Long-Term Reauthorization for FAA
One of those accomplishments is the recent reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which oversees all activities related to commercial air travel.  For years, the agency has operated under stopgap reauthorizations.  The new law’s five-year reauthorization is welcome news for airports, industries, and passengers that depend on FAA programs.   
More specifically, the FAA law will support the grant program that many of our state’s airports have utilized to improve and expand their facilities.  It will continue the work being done at Mississippi State University’s Center for Excellence for Unmanned Aircraft Systems, which is critical to the safe integration of drones into the national airspace.  The reauthorization will also institute measures to benefit consumers, such as minimum seat size requirements on commercial flights and protections against exorbitant costs imposed by air ambulance providers.  
Wicker Provision to Help Rural Communities
Another accomplishment I am particularly pleased to see reach the finish line is passage of the “America’s Water Infrastructure Act.”  Like the FAA bill, this legislation prioritizes the safety and well-being of Americans through needed upgrades and maintenance.  Without reliable ports and inland waterways, the commerce that fuels our economy would be severely hampered, hurting the communities along our coasts and rivers.  Without effective dams and levees, American lives and property are put at risk in the event of extreme flooding. 
The water infrastructure bill also includes a provision I authored to help small communities with their wastewater treatment systems.  Small communities often struggle with the costs and technical expertise required to operate these systems in compliance with federal rules.  My provision would create opportunities for these communities to receive technical assistance for wastewater treatment.  It follows the success of a similar provision I enacted into law in 2015 for drinking water systems.  Not only is clean drinking water and wastewater important to public safety, it can encourage critical economic investment.
Passage of these bills was accompanied by other bipartisan wins, including legislation to address our nation’s opioid epidemic and appropriations bills to keep the government funded.  President Trump has set forth an ambitious agenda for his Administration, and Congress continues to work to make good on its end of the deal – cutting taxes, rebuilding America’s infrastructure, and ensuring that our military remains the strongest fighting force in the world.

The Wilson Times: Butterfield questions Kavanaugh's 'past conduct, judicial temperament' 
Wilson's congressman says he's ""extremely disappointed"" in the Senate's confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh as the United States' 114th Supreme Court justice. 
U.S. Rep. G.K. Butterfield, a Wilson Democrat representing North Carolina's 1st Congressional District, expressed concern over the allegations of sexual misconduct Kavanaugh faces and predicted the appellate judge and former White House counsel for President George W. Bush will bring partisan politics to the high court bench.
""Now more than ever, our country needs a Supreme Court justice who will rise above ideology, protect the rights of all Americans and preserve our system of checks and balances by stopping presidential abuse of executive power,"" Butterfield said. ""Unfortunately, nothing in Judge Kavanaugh's record or past have shown he will be such a justice.""

Arizona Health Care Update
￼ This week the Arizona Department of Insurance published county-specific rate information before open enrollment. With these new rates come a window of optimism in the Arizona health insurance market that has suffered from the constraints of the Affordable Care Act.   In 2017, most counties only had one insurer offering plans on the ACA exchange. Beginning in 2019, Arizona will have five insurers participating in the ACA exchange across the state. Four of these insurers will be offering plans in Maricopa County and three will be offering plans in Pima County - both counties that had only one insurer in 2017.   For those in the individual market, you can view the 2019 expected rates through this link.   
Read My Joint Op-Ed
As the Arizona Department of Insurance publishes 2019 health insurance rates, I also wanted to share a joint op-ed I released with my colleague Representative Webster.   The Op-Ed introduces a plan for a Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program, and gives a reminder of the less then desirable outcome that the ACA imposed on insurers and patients.  The legislative proposal explains how Congress can address the issue of unaffordable health care and gives insurers the ability to recoup the extraordinary costs of their highest cost patients. This will help to ensure individuals have access to affordable health insurance at the lowest possible rates, whether they have a pre-existing condition or not.    For more information, read the full op-ed here.

Dear Friend,

 
Big milestone this past week as I marked my 250th classroom visit in our schools. I joined some sharp students in Mr. Bell's A.P. Government and Politics class at Minnetonka High School -- more below. 
A couple of important updates to two topics I've mentioned recently. First, legislation prohibiting so-called pharmacist ""gag clauses"" was signed into law last week after it earned bipartisan support in the Senate. I authored legislation in the House prohibiting these clauses, which prohibit pharmacists from telling patients when their are cheaper ways to pay for their medications and prescriptions. Learn more here. 
And, landmark opioid legislation which had already passed in the House was approved by the Senate, and is expected to be signed into law in the coming days. This is a big bipartisan win in the fight against the opioid crisis, and it's great news for the first responders, doctors and patients on the front lines of this epidemic. Learn more here.
 
Have a great week and please let me know whenever I can be of assistance to you or your family. Join the conversation online by visiting my website, Facebook page, Twitter, and Instagram. And as always, be sure to watch the latest Erik's Correspondence Corner below.

Sincerely,

A Big Milestone
I'm fortunate to represent some incredible schools and it's why I take the time to meet regularly with teachers and students. Every classroom is different and gives me an opportunity to learn a new perspective. This past week I marked my 250th classroom visit!  
It was great to join Mr. Bell's juniors and seniors in his A.P. U.S. Government and Politics class at Minnetonka High School. We discussed a wide variety of issues, how the media can play a positive and negative role surrounding public policy, as well as ways to become engaged in public service. Thank you to Minnetonka High School and Mr. Bell for hosting me!

Protecting Medicare for Seniors
Millions of Minnesota seniors rely on Medicare for their everyday medical needs, and none more so than those with complex, chronic conditions like arthritis, multiple sclerosis or cancer. But I fear a new Medicare proposal by the President's administration, designed to reduce costs, threatens access to critical care seniors need.
It's called Step Therapy, and in short, it would require doctors to treat seniors with an escalating series of treatments, starting first with the cheapest medication. This means patients will have to ""fail first"" on a low-cost treatment before their doctors can prescribe the care they think is best-suited to their needs.
I've heard growing concerns about this plan, so I convened a roundtable in my District Office with care providers, doctors and patients, to hear directly from them about their experiences with Step Therapy. Their message was unanimous: Step Therapy can be a nightmare, causing delayed treatment, creating massive loads of paperwork, and leave patients desperately waiting for the care their doctors know they need.
After what I heard, I'm calling on the Health and Human Services Secretary to reevaluate this proposal, because we should ensure seniors are able to get the treatments they need, when they need them. The doctor-patient relationship is critical and cutting costs should not come at the expensive of quality care for Minnesota seniors. 
 
 
A Tax Reform Success Story in Brooklyn Park
So many small businesses I've visited have shared their stories on how tax reform has helped them hire more people, invest more in capital equipment and give their employees a raise and better benefits. I heard the latest success story during my visit to Diversified Plastics in Brooklyn Park. Their business is strong, they've hired 7 additional employees, and they're boosting starting wages to keep up with the demand for their products. Learn more about my visit here.

Dear Lindsey, 
I extend my deepest sympathies to all those affected by Hurricane Michael and will continue to pray for a speedy recovery and return to normalcy for those affected. The Wiregrass region of Alabama was hit hard, but nothing compares to the heartbreaking devastation we are seeing for our neighbors in the Florida panhandle.
I also wanted to make you aware of the recovery resources available to you and those you know who may have been impacted by the storm. Click here to apply online for federal disaster assistance, here for information from the Alabama Emergency Management Agency, and here for disaster relief and recovery services from the American Red Cross including information on contacting missing loved ones.  
It is in times like these that we must come together as a community to assist each other, and I applaud the work of our first responders, electric linemen, area shelters, and all those helping those affected by this historic storm.  
A Day in Semmes 
￼ 
On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to discuss how Alabamians are ""better off now"" with members of the Semmes Chamber of Commerce. From lower taxes to less red tape, I and other commonsense legislators in Washington are helping to pave the way for a booming economy. A special thank you to the local ROTC for providing the colors for the luncheon. After visiting with the Chamber, I went with Mayor David Baker to see some of the recent developments around town; from road projects to new retail, Semmes continues to grow. I also appreciated visiting with some of the first responders at the fire department. These folks do a great job of keeping Semmes and the surrounding areas safe, and I am very grateful for their service to our community.
Building a Stronger Alabama 
In a major bipartisan effort, this week the Senate passed a piece of legislation that will help to unlock the full economic potential of our region and state. Having passed the House last month, America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (S. 3021) passed the Senate on Wednesday and will now go to the President’s desk to be signed into law.  
This bill authorizes funding for waterway projects, port improvement projects, and other important water infrastructure projects in all 50 states. Not only will this allow for much-needed infrastructure improvements, but the bill reinstates a “Buy America” provision for federally funded projects, meaning a boost for American steel producers.
There are very few places in the United States that can boast the sort of infrastructure we have here in Alabama. It is clear, though, that our infrastructure throughout the country is in need of updates, repairs, and overhauls to ensure that we are at the cutting edge of transportation and connection. Keep an eye out this week for my column with more information on this landmark legislation! 
Securing our Elections 
￼ 
Few things are as sacred to Americans as the ability to vote in free and fair elections. When the integrity of such a system is undermined by the actions of a group of outsiders, namely illegal immigrants voting in our elections, we must act.  
I joined Congressman Brooks, Congressman Aderholt, and 20 of my Congressional colleagues in sending a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions urging him to dedicate more resources to protect our elections from illegal voting. Too often, people focus on Russian interference in our elections while the issue of illegal immigrants voting falls by the wayside.  
We cannot allow this threat to our national integrity to continue, and we need to do everything in our power to uphold these deepest American values. There is still work to be done in securing our border, enforcing our laws, and keeping our elections safe, and I am dedicated to seeing those tasks through to the end.

Ways and Means Investigation on Maternal Mortality Rates in the U.S.:
Recent investigations have revealed that an alarming number of mothers in the United States are dying during and after childbirth while the maternal mortality rate is on the rise. Every year in the United States, more than 50,000 mothers are severely injured during or after childbirth and 700 die. In fact, maternal mortality review committees from nine states found that approximately 63 percent of pregnancy-related deaths were preventable. Bringing a new baby into this world should be one of the most exciting and rewarding times in a woman’s life. It is absolutely unacceptable that preventable failures are the cause of avoidable, unnecessary, and absolutely tragic deaths.
As Chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight, I sent letters to 15 major hospital systems around the country in a search for answers on why there is a growing rate of mothers dying from childbirth. The letters ask these hospital systems to detail the steps they are taking to identify risks and complications in pregnancies and to answer questions on their childbirth safety protocols. I hope we can find out why these deaths are happening and how Congress can act to prevent this tragic loss of life.
 
World Mental Health Day:
While this year’s World Mental Health Day fell on October 10th, the importance of treating and reaching out to those suffering with mental health illness must be a focus that lasts all year long. Mental health has many faces and millions of Americans are struggling not only with the illness, but also with the stigma surrounding the issue.
Both before and during my time in Congress, I have been an advocate for improving the mental health system in our country. I was proud to introduce H.R. 1877, the Mental Health First Aid Act, which was signed into law with bipartisan support in 2016 as part of the 21st Century Cures Act. The legislation drove innovation and prioritized the fight against the ongoing mental health crisis by creating an evidence-based education program that provides first aid training to community leaders such as teachers, police officers, and first responders. The training teaches communities how to identify symptoms of common mental illnesses, de-escalate crises, and help those showing early signs of mental disorders gain access to relevant mental health resources.
This program is not only making a difference to our communities, but also changing the stigma surrounding mental health illnesses. So many suffer in silence for fear of prejudices and discrimination; however, with better education on the causes, effects, and treatments comes increased understanding to ensure no one has to bear the burden alone. We have made essential steps in the right direction over the past several years, but more must be done.
￼
 
ICYMI: United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement:
Last week, the United States, Mexico, and Canada announced that an agreement has been reached to update the North American Free Trade Agreement. News of an agreement is welcomed as NAFTA has been an overwhelming success for Kansas’s economy and especially for Kansas agriculture. As Congress and the public analyze the full agreement text, I look forward to fully reviewing the details and hearing from farm, ranch, and working families across my district about their thoughts on the agreement.
 
Celebrating Our Navy’s 243rd Birthday:
Happy Birthday to the United States Navy! October 13th marks the birth of our country’s Navy 243 years ago. Our deepest gratitude to all the brave individuals serving, their families, and all who have served since the earliest days of the Navy’s existence.

Butler, Clark, and More
Congressman Warren Davidson has been working in Ohio as congress is not in session. 
On Monday, Davidson visited the Niederman Family Farm in Butler County. As an agribusiness, the farm has benefited greatly from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
On Tuesday, Davidson visited Brian Harbage on his farm in Clark County. Davidson said on his Facebook page the two spoke about several issues including trade and tariffs. They also discussed healthcare challenges for small businesses, and the various benefits small businesses are reaping from tax reform.
On Thursday, Davidson met with NFL Hall of Fame Inductee Anthony Munoz at Eaton’s annual Harvest Festival. He then stopped at The Almond Sisters Bakery in Hamilton before traveling to the Butler County Township Association’s Annual Banquet. 
On Friday, Davidson toured the new Ohio Eagle Distributing facility in West Chester. The company said the new facility is to become the center of their business in the area. Later in the day Davidson was invited to speak at a destination ceremony for a new housing facility in Hamilton.

From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:
Good Afternoon,
This week, The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Risk Management Agency (RMA) announced a new insurance plan that protects dairy producers from unexpected declines in quarterly milk sales.
￼
Expanding Resources for American Dairy Producers
Dairy Revenue Protection provides insurance for the difference between the final revenue guarantee and actual milk revenue if prices fall. This plan offers coverage levels from 70%-95% of revenue. Dairy Revenue Protection is another tool available to dairy producers to mitigate risks associated with a changing market and strengthen the rural economy. DRP is offered in all counties nationwide. Sign-up for Dairy Revenue Protection today; first available coverage will start in the first quarter of 2019.
For more information about Dairy Revenue Protection, click here.
Disaster Assistance Available to PA Residents 
Residents of Susquehanna and Wayne Counties who were affected by severe storms and flooding on August 13-14, 2018 are eligible to apply for low-interest disaster loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration. Loans up to $200,000 for homeowners and $2 million for businesses are available to repair or replace damaged real estate. These loans are a step in the right direction to ensure Pennsylvanians recovering from recent flooding can get back on track.
Applicants may apply online using the Electronic Loan Application at DisasterLoan.sba.gov or call 1-800-659-2955. The Filing deadline to return applications for physical property damage is December 10, 2018. The deadline to return economic injury applications is July 9, 2019.
Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River Awarded Grant 
I’m pleased to announce that Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River was awarded an Open Outdoors for Kids grant from the National Park Foundation.
￼
These funds will connect 1,330 students with the parks Delaware and Hudson Canal Days, which teaches participants about life on the canal in the 1800s through living history programs. Thanks to these efforts, more young people will have the opportunity to learn in our national parks this school year.
Celebrating National Farmers Day 
Every year on October 12th, we have an opportunity to thank those that work in acres, not hours.
￼
Agriculture and agribusiness have a profound impact on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and particularly on the 10th congressional district in Pennsylvania. Total economic impacts from agriculture gross over 135.7 billion and employ 579,000 Pennsylvanians. With 63,000 family farms currently in operation across the Commonwealth, any agricultural legislation is of the utmost importance to me. Thank you, Pennsylvania farmers, for everything you do.
Social Security Announces 2.8% Benefit Increase for 2019
More than 67 million Americans will benefit from a 2.8% increase in Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits in 2019. The 2.8% cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) will begin January 2019. Additional adjustments, based on the increase in average wages, will increase the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax to $132,900 from $128,400. Social Security and SSI beneficiaries can expect to be notified in early December regarding their new benefit amount.
Pennsylvania State Flaming Foliage Festival 
Each year in early fall, Pennsylvanians attend the Flaming Foliage Festival to celebrate nature’s beautiful colors and views. On Saturday, I stopped by to see the festival’s renowned parade, recognized as the largest parade in central Pennsylvania, and the crowning of the Flaming Foliage Queen. The festival featured an impressive food and craft show, featuring more than 100 vendors. What an opportunity to take in the fall beauty of PA. Thank you for having me!
As Always…

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend,  This week, the Second District was devastated by Hurricane Michael. Many of our friends and family in the counties that were hit by the hurricane have lost everything. We continue to pray for all those who lost loved ones and those who haven't yet made contact with their loved ones.   If you are still attempting to contact a loved one, please consider filling out this online form created by the Florida Department of Heath.   If you would like to volunteer your efforts the Red Cross and Volunteer Florida have an abundance of resources to help our neighbors. At this time, I urge you to heed the warnings of local emergency workers and law enforcement as rescue and recovery efforts continue. The Florida Department of Emergency Management is working around the clock with local first responders, law enforcement, the Florida National Guard, and various military entities to keep us safe.   On October 10, 2018, President Trump issued a major disaster declaration for the State of Florida, ordering federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts to areas affected by Hurricane Michael. This Major Disaster Declaration triggers the release of federal funds to help people and communities in the wake of Hurricane Michael.  All individuals and businesses who were impacted by Hurricane Michael should apply for FEMA assistance. Please call 1-800-621-3362 or visit http://www.DisasterAssistance.gov to apply. Individual assistance does not have an income limitation.  Over the coming days, weeks, and months more information about aid for storm recovery will become available. If you have any questions about applying for aid please contact my office at 202-225-5235. We are here to help.  If my office can be of any assistance as we begin recovery efforts please do not hesitate to contact us at 202-225-5235 or at www.dunn.house.gov.   Sincerely, ￼  Neal Dunn Member of Congress

Celebrating Pastor Brunson's Release



For over two years we have called for the release of Pastor Andrew Brunson. Today, our prayers were answered and Pastor Brunson can finally be reunited with his family. Pastor Brunson, who is originally from Black Mountain, North Carolina, was imprisoned in Turkey on October 7, 2016. On March 13, 2018, Pastor Brunson was issued an indictment filled with bogus charges relating to terrorism and espionage. Click here or on the image below for my full statement on Pastor Brunson’s release. 

￼

In May, a bipartisan group of my colleagues in the House and I sent a letter denouncing the wrongful imprisonment of Pastor Brunson. You can read the letter by clicking here. I also called for the release of Pastor Brunson in a June speech on the House Floor, which you can click here. On Saturday, I was honored by President Trump's invitation to join him and Pastor Brunson in the Oval Office to celebrate his return home. You can watch Saturday's meeting by clicking here or on the image below.

Firefighters Grant Workshop



On Wednesday, my office held it's annual FEMA Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program workshop for Tenth District fire and rescue departments on the campus of Gaston College in Dallas. It was a great turnout and special thanks to Cherryville Fire Chief Jeff Cash and Assistant Chief Jason Wofford for serving as instructors for the class. 

￼

In the Tenth District, fire and rescue departments use these grants to help them better serve their communities. A great is example is the Linconlton Fire Department, a recent recipient of a grant, which is planning on using the funding awarded to hire additional full-time firefighters. Click here to learn more about the Lincolnton Fire Department courtesy of the Lincoln Times News.





Did You Know?



The House of Representatives has been very productive. While you may have heard about historic legislation like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the important steps the House has taken to combat the opioid epidemic, and the well-deserved pay raise we voted on for our troops, the House of Representatives has done much more. Since January of 2017, the House has been working hard on the issues that matter in the Tenth District and all across the country. Click here to learn more about some of the 245 bills that are now law.

Gastonia police go pink for breast cancer awareness

Gaston Gazette 

The month of October is breast cancer awareness month. This month we honor and remember all of the mothers, daughters, sisters, and friends who have suffered from this terrible disease. The Gastonia Police Department is doing its part to raise awareness by wearing pink badges on their uniforms. It is inspiring to see our law enforcement officers, who keep our communities safe every day, go above and beyond for their neighbors in Gaston County.

Dear Friend,  
This past week, the strongest storm to ever hit the Florida panhandle also ripped its way through Georgia, with damaging winds, rainfall, and flooding. As we assess the damage of the storm, my offices will continue to remain in close communication with federal, state, and local officials to ensure Georgia has what it needs to recover.
I am very glad to report that on Thursday President Trump declared a federal state of emergency in Georgia for counties impacted by the storm. The designation authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide equipment and resources to impacted counties.
President Trump’s declaration came after the entire Georgia Congressional Delegation sent a bipartisan, bicameral letter to the White House requesting federal expedited assistance to impacted counties. I was proud to lead this effort among my colleagues, and I will continue working to ensure Georgians have the tools they need to get back on their feet following this catastrophic storm. Click here to read more on our letter to President Trump. 
For information on each county’s specific State of Emergency County Contacts, and other helpful state resources, please visit the Georgia Emergency Management & Homeland Security Agency website here: http://www.gema.ga.gov/.  
There is certainly a long way to go in clean-up and rebuilding, but I am confident that we have the right leadership in Georgia to get the job done.
  
BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH 
October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, a time to increase awareness of the disease which impacts 1 in 8 women in the United States. 
The most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and the second-leading cause of cancer death among women, breast cancer affects all of us – not just women – which is why it is so important we continue to fund cancer research and support those women in our lives who are impacted by this disease.

HAPPY 243RD BIRTHDAY TO THE UNITED STATES NAVY 
On October 13, 1775, a resolution of the Continental Congress established what is now the United States Navy. Today, the U.S. Navy remains the world’s most elite naval force.  
I want to wish a happy 243rd to the U.S. Navy and thank all our U.S. Navy Veterans for their service to our great country.

Meet Richard | How Can I Help You? | Issues | Media Center | Contact Me





Friends,
 
As a father, one of the most important things I can teach my son is to treat others the way he wants to be treated. That’s the Golden Rule. We should all work to set this example for America’s children.
 
That’s one reason why I am so encouraged when I hear of a politician, celebrity or professional athlete using their platform for the greater good. Take our new Carolina Panthers owner, David Tepper. After Hurricane Florence, he, Luke Kuechly, Cam Newton and nearly 80 staff members and players spent their time packing relief boxes for families.
 
In stark contrast, it’s why I am so disappointed every time I hear of someone using their platform to provoke violence or incivility. Just last week, former Attorney General Eric Holder said of Republicans, “When they go low, we kick ‘em. That’s what this new Democratic Party is about.” That’s the exact opposite of loving thy neighbor. And in a televised interview, Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said you “cannot be civil” with members of the Republican Party.
 
What has happened to political discourse in our country? The hatred and anger – sometimes expressed behind a keyboard – and the inability to listen to and respect someone with a different opinion has sadly become the new normal. Have they forgotten last year’s terrible attack at a baseball field in Virginia by a deranged shooter who was targeting Republicans? 
 
Inciting violence and stoking anger is irresponsible. Period.
 
As people of different political parties, we can disagree without being disagreeable. It’s no secret that I don’t see eye-to-eye with my Democrat colleagues on every issue from time to time. But that doesn’t mean I can’t work with them to get things done.
 
Since my first days in office, I’ve worked hard to build relationships and navigate disagreements to find common ground. I will always stick to my conservative principles, but I am willing to work across the aisle and fight for you and your priorities.That’s exactly how I began my first term when I had several pieces of bipartisan legislation signed by President Barack Obama and what I continue to do today.
 
I’m the 12th most conservative member of the House, but I’ve had tremendous success in bringing people together around bipartisan solutions to improve job-training programs, to combat the opioid epidemic, to improve care for our veterans, and to support our military. And I’m proud to have several Democrats support my Concealed Carry Reciprocity bill. I was able to get their support because I’m upfront and strive to have open and thoughtful discussions. And I listen. 
 
It’s like my grandfather always told me, “You have two ears and one mouth for a reason.”
 
As your Congressman, I continue to work with President Trump – a Republican – and Governor Cooper – a Democrat – on Hurricane Florence recovery. And just last week, my bipartisan energy bill with Congresswoman Diana DeGette – a Democrat from Colorado – passed the Senate and is now on the way to becoming law. I believe there is plenty of room for common sense, bipartisan solutions like this.
 
￼
I joined Governor Cooper in Hoke County last week to discuss Hurricane Florence recovery efforts. 
 
At the end of the day, I understand people are frustrated with Washington. That’s exactly why I first ran for Congress. I was fed up because our government wasn’t listening to us and progress was jammed because of partisanship. I continue to hear your concerns and I will not stop fighting until you have a federal government that works for you.
 
 
Until next week,
￼
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)

Remembering Sergeant Carraway
 
 
Wrenzie and I attended Sergeant Terrence Carraway's funeral this week. He touched the lives of everyone he met and our community is truly a better place because of his service- both in and out of uniform. Our community is shaken from this loss, but we’ve shown incredible strength and unity in the face of this tragedy. The entire Florence Police Department and their families remain in our prayers.

Neighbor Helping Neighbor
 
 
Last week, Wrenzie and I met some amazing folks at Sweet Home Baptist Church in Longs. They have been collecting and donating supplies, serving hot meals, and housing people in need. Our team went back to the church this week to donate supplies and see how they were doing. Despite some of the volunteers having lost everything in the storm themselves, they are dedicated to making sure their neighbors are fed, have a place to sleep that night, and have the resources to recover. We were so glad to be able to contribute!

On the Ground 
 
 
Senator Lindsey Graham and HUD Deputy Secretary Pam Patenaude were on the ground this week to survey damage from Hurricane Florence. We visited homes in Socastee and Marion to hear directly from residents about issues they are dealing with throughout the recovery process. We also met with local leaders to discuss the best path forward, specifically how we can apply the lessons we have learned from Hurricane Matthew to ensure we can help as many people as possible, as efficiently as possible. The support from President Trump and coordination between the Administration, Congress, and local officials will guarantee a strong recovery for South Carolina.

Thank a Farmer
 
 
Thursday was National Farmers Day, and South Carolina has the best farmers around. Many Seventh District farmers were impacted by Hurricane Florence, but we are working together to ensure our agricultural community has the necessary resources to fully recover from this storm. I am so grateful for their hard work, which allows us to put food on our tables and clothes on our back. In the Seventh District we thank our farmers everyday!
 

Have a great week,

Babin Applauds Kavanaugh Confirmation, Condemns 'Win-At-All-Costs Tactics'

With Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation secured, this embarrassing chapter in the history of the Senate can finally conclude. The shameful political theater Americans witnessed in disgust was never about determining the truth but designed to block this nomination by any means necessary – no matter how salacious or unprecedented. The longstanding process for vetting a nominee openly and in good faith was so flagrantly violated that the public's faith in our government institutions may be forever damaged.

I applaud my Texas colleagues Senator Ted Cruz and Senator John Cornyn for their leadership in fairly evaluating and ultimately voting in favor of this supremely qualified nominee. Unfortunately, this process previewed the new playbook of win-at-all-costs tactics by radical elements whose desire for absolute political power over their countrymen would lead them to willfully destroy the foundational principles so many Americans cherish. The events of recent weeks make clear that the stakes remain high in the ongoing fight to preserve our liberties.

I wish Justice Kavanaugh a long career on the Supreme Court. I have complete confidence he will conduct himself with the integrity, sense of fairness, and respect for our Republic's sacred heritage of law and order that was so glaringly and unconscionably abandoned during his confirmation process.

Update at the Wall
￼
I spent Thursday morning with agents of the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol in San Diego, CA as we looked at the different prototypes of President Trump's proposed wall. Securing our borders is perhaps the most important necessity facing our nation today. We have to protect our citizens and control our borders in order to maintain national sovereignty. It was great to be able to see the progress and hear stories from the brave men and women guarding our border. 

If you would like to see more, please visit my Facebook page where I posted a live video.
Small Business Roundtables
Small businesses are pillars of communities throughout our nation, so I was happy to meet this week with several small business owners in Warren and Hardin to discuss issues concerning them, including the need to reduce and eliminate overburdensome government regulations as well as how tax reform legislation passed this year benefits small businesses and their employees. Thank you to Brandy and Cory Winkler for hosting us at the Bar-B-Q Pit in Warren. Other participants included Cory Owens, owner of East Tex Paint & Body, Judy Lewis with Triple D Ranch, Valerie Middleton with Flowershop, and Shawn Ryals with R Texas Star Grooming & Boarding.
￼
Also, a huge thank you to the Hardin County Volunteer Fire Department for hosting as well as all of our participants which included Anthony Dagle with Southeast Texas Farm & Ranch in Raywood, Randy Brazil with Southeast Texas Olive in Devers, Connie Campbell with Maci Feed & Supply in Hardin, Patti Atkins with Oilfield Welding and Fabrication in Hull, Keisha Robinson with First Liberty National Bank in Hardin, Klint Bush with Bayview Home Health and Commissioner of Liberty County ESD 7 (fire station), and Grant Stoesser with G.S. Farm Company in Liberty.

Hull-Daisetta Site Visit
After Hurricane Harvey, Hull-Daisetta (H-D) Elementary School was completely flooded and all of its contents were declared a total loss. 

H-D Elementary has not had classes on this campus since August of 2017, but thankfully the reconstructed building is expected to be ready in December. Thanks to Superintendent Mary Huckabay and Principal Quinn Godwin (pictured below) for showing me around their soon-to-be new school!

Welcome Home SSG Phillip Blackmon
 Every year since September 11, 2001, RE/MAX Realty partners with the Texas Sentinels Foundation to build a house for a veteran who was severely injured in the line of duty. This year, U. S. Army SSG Phillip Blackmon has been named the recipient of a new home. 

SSG Blackmon was an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Specialist who holds the record for successfully diffusing more than 150,000 tons of unexploded ordnance during combat missions in Iraq over a four year span. In 2006, an improvised explosive device (IED) detonated three feet away from SSG Blackmon's vehicle causing him and others multiple injuries.

I am proud that Lanie Brown, Regional Director of Community Relations on my staff, was able to present SSG Blackmon with a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol and thank him for his willingness to answer the call and defend our nation's freedom.
Visiting with Chambers County Rice Farmers
I had the privilege of meeting with our local rice farmers in Winnie on Saturday where we discussed many important provisions in the Farm Bill. America thrives off of family farms, and it is crucial that we pursue policies to help them succeed. I will continue working hard to fight for our Texas farmers.

Touring the RoyOMartin OSB Manufacturing Plant 
 The RoyOMartin Oriented Strand Board (OSB) manufacturing plant located in Corrigan provides many great jobs and opportunities to the region. I was able to tour the site on Tuesday with the plant’s Vice President, Terry Secrest, and was very impressed with the production by their hard-working employees. I’m looking forward to seeing the impact the plant's operation has for the community and Texas.

 Friday Night Football Coin-Toss
 There is nothing like Texas football! The Woodville Eagles earned a tough win over the Warren Warriors last Friday night. Both teams played hard, and I was honored to flip the coin at the beginning of the game.

Dear Friend, 
A quick housekeeping note. The Congressional App Challenge registration deadline is October 15th. Any student in the 4th Congressional District can design their own software application and compete in this challenge. Please register soon if you're planning to participate! 
I wanted to take this chance during district work period to offer a recap of our recent efforts to combat the opioid crisis in this country.  
One American dies from opioid overdose every 12.5 minutes. In 2015, Colorado experienced 159 heroin overdose deaths. This epidemic is ravaging our nation.  
House Republicans have passed dozens of bills to address this issue. For a good sense of what we've been working on, you can visit this link: https://www.opioidcrisis.gop/. 
Last month, I introduced legislation to enhance data sharing between wholesalers of opioids, as well as between wholesalers and law enforcement. Those companies that sell opioids to pharmacies have a responsibility to watch out for suspicious orders. My legislation works to centralize order information so that wholesalers can better track problematic orders.  
I'm thankful that this legislation was included in the bipartisan, bicameral opioid package that passed Congress and was signed by the President.  
I also worked this year to expose the way that sanctuary cities are harboring illegal immigrants who traffic heroin. Nick Rogers, the President of the Denver Police Protective Association and a long-time detective on the streets of Denver, testified before the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security to explain how these policies prevent federal law enforcement from working with Denver police officers to apprehend certain illegal immigrants who assist in heroin trafficking. Denver is already a hub for heroin trafficking, and these policies only make the matter worse.  
In the following video, I question Robert Patterson, acting administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, about the connection between sanctuary city policies and the opioid crisis: 
￼
￼
If we want to win this battle against opioid and heroin addiction, we must attack it from all angles. The legislation passed over the past year will hopefully be a strong counter-offensive against this evil substance, saving lives and families across our nation.  
Keep an eye on my website for more upcoming events. And as always, for more frequent updates on legislation and events, please follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. I look forward to hearing from you; please do not hesitate to contact my Greeley, Castle Rock, or Washington office should you need any assistance. If you'd like to send me a message, you can do so on my website.

Walker Weekly Report
Kelly and I are praying for all of those still being impacted by the Hurricane Michael storm that came through our community on Thursday. Many of you, like me, are probably one of the around 200,000 North Carolinians who still remain without power. We have been in contact with Duke Energy and I know their brave lineman and utility workers are laboring around the clock to get everyone’s power back up.
Our thoughts are also with the many school children across our state who have been out of school and will likely remain out for the first part of next week.
The destruction in the Florida Panhandle is devastating. As North Carolinians, we understand what it means to rebuild and overcome. The combining of federal, state and nonprofits working together brings hope to suffering communities. Please join me in keeping these dear people in our thoughts and prayers.
Even in the darkness, there is light. We are elated that North Carolina pastor Andrew Brunson has returned home from two years in captivity in Turkey. This week, President Trump also signed an important healthcare bill into law, and we remembered the fantastic life and legacy of one of our district’s oldest and greatest heroes.
Keep reading for the full update. Have a blessed week.  Sincerely, ￼ Mark Walker

HIGHLIGHTS
￼
We're Bringing North Carolina Pastor Andrew Brunson Home
Every American should be proud that we are finally bringing North Carolina pastor Andrew Brunson home. His release on Friday, after a two-year unjust imprisonment, was only possible through millions of prayers and the concerted efforts of President Trump, Vice President Pence, Secretary Pompeo and members of Congress. This needs to be the end point for the many acts of aggression and human rights violations for Turkey and President Erdogan.
I am also grateful for the recognition President Trump gave to our efforts in getting Pastor Brunson home.   In July, we introduced the Turkey International Financial Institutions Act, legislation that would direct U.S. representatives at international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank to oppose loans to Turkey, pending the release of Brunson and all U.S. citizens and consular staff. We were also part of a bi-partisan effort sending a letter to President Erdogan demanding Brunson's release.
Brunson, the pastor of Izmir Diriliş (Resurrection) Church in Izmir, Turkey, was detained on October 7, 2016 on charges of ""support of a terrorist organization"" and ""political or military espionage."" Brunson was transferred on July 25, 2018 from jail to house arrest while awaiting the next hearing on his case.
According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), ""Pastor Brunson initially was held in a cell with 21 other inmates that was built to hold only eight prisoners. He spends 24 hours a day in his cell, leaving for one hour weekly for visits.""

Remembering Dr. Victory Tynes – A True Hero of Our Community and Our Nation
This week, I was deeply saddened by the loss of one of my oldest and greatest constituents and friends. I will never forget having the honor to present Dr. Victor Tynes with an American Flag flown in honor of his 102nd birthday. During the visit, we talked about his amazing life and his love of music, when we broke out singing Christmas Carols. He was an extraordinary man who lived an extraordinary life.
Dr. Tynes was a talented musician, an accomplished dentist, a devoted public servant, a WWII veteran and alumnus emeritus at North Carolina A&T State University. He was even chosen by the Pentagon to assist with the integration of Fort Bragg, serving as one of the first African-American officers. Thank you for your steadfast service to our community and our nation, Dr. Tynes. You will be missed.
Please keep his family in your prayers – from his children all they way down to his great great grandchildren.

President Trump Signs the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act into Law, Prohibiting Pharmacy Gag Clauses
This week, President Trump signed another important piece of legislation into law. The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act will help keep North Carolina seniors and families from unnecessarily paying more for medications and offer more choice and transparency, ending gag clauses that prevent pharmacists from telling patients about less expensive prescription options.
“Our great citizens deserve to know the lowest prices available at our pharmacies and now that is what they are getting,” Trump said at the White House.
This legislation is part of our commitment to reduce prescription drug costs for North Carolinians and provide more transparency and choice.

MORE GOOD NEWS ABOUT TAX REFORM
￼
CNBC: ""Most Economists 'Never Thought the Economy Could Grow This Fast'""
President Donald Trump's corporate tax cut and his business deregulation efforts are not just an economic ""sugar high,"" former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh argued on CNBC Thursday.
Most economists ""never thought the economy could grow this fast,"" said Warsh, who had been on the president's short-list for Fed chairman before Jerome Powell was chosen.
The government's final reading of second-quarter gross domestic product showed an advance of 4.2 percent on an annualized basis. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow real-time indicator put the third quarter gain at 4.1 percent, as of Monday.
Taken all together with the first quarter's 2.2 percent increase, the economy stands to grow at an average of 3.5 percent for the first nine months of 2018.
That would be above Trump's goal of economic growth 3 percent-plus. The president has used GDP numbers and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which closed at another record high Wednesday, as yardsticks of success for his policies.
""Today the economy is the strongest it's been since it's been in the U.S. since 2004"" when growth was 3.8 percent, Warsh said on ""Squawk Box."" ""At the end of this year, we may be saying the economy is the strongest since 1999,"" when growth hit 4.7 percent, he added.

Friends,
I hope you all had a great week. I certainly enjoyed traveling around the district meeting with you all! 
Health Care Update
Our country is stronger when we work together to address the issues we face. These bipartisan health care victories are vital to countless folks in Northeast Ohio and across the nation. 
￼
I believe health insurance coverage should not discriminate against those with pre-existing conditions, which can affect any individual, regardless of race, gender, age, social class, or creed. I support protections in the law for individuals with pre-existing conditions. 
I also believe people should have all the cost information when purchasing prescription drugs, which is why I am glad to share the President signed S. 2554 and S. 2553 into law this week. These measures eliminate the use of ""gag"" clauses that prevent pharmacies from alerting customers if the retail cost of the drug is less than the co-payment they would be paying for buying the medication with insurance. Before my colleagues and I took action, many pharmacists couldn't legally tell their customers whether drugs were cheaper when paying out-of-pocket. This common sense action will help rein in drug costs for families in Northeast Ohio. 
Forged by the Sea
￼
Yesterday, the United States Navy celebrated its 243rd birthday! On October 13, 1775, the Continental Congress authorized the purchase of two vessels to be armed and used against British merchant ships, thereby creating the Continental Navy. This is considered to be the first establishment of the U.S. Navy. 
In honor of the U.S. Navy's birthday, I am pleased to share that my colleagues and I recently passed the bill to fund the Department of Defense. I strongly supported this legislation, which gives our service members a much deserved 2.6% pay raise, the largest increase in 9 years. This measure also includes provisions to rebuild our military by increasing funding for our military readiness programs to ensure our troops are prepared for their missions. 
I'd like to take the time to thank all of our brave servicemen and women for serving our country in all five of our armed services branches. We are forever thankful for your service to our great nation.

Hi Friends,  
  
I’m happy to report that dozens of child predators have been prosecuted on the state and federal level in Northeast Texas since my Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act was signed into law by President Trump last year. 
  
My law enables law enforcement officers in our home communities to receive training at the National Computer Forensics Institute (NCFI). This ensures they know what digital evidence to look for and how to find it, so we can prosecute those who commit sickening crimes against the most vulnerable in our society.
  
￼ 
  
Ratcliffe tours the National Computer Forensics Institute in Hoover, Ala. 
  
In a recent meeting with my staff, Chief Investigator Corley Weatherford of Hopkins County Sheriff’s Office discussed how his NCFI training has helped him solve child exploitation crimes in coordination with the North Texas Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force. 
  
Thanks to his NCFI education on computer forensics and mobile device examination, Chief Investigator Weatherford has successfully worked on dozens of child exploitation cases that may have otherwise gone unsolved. This included the conviction of a Cumby school teacher with 100 child victims, and a conviction in a Sulphur Springs case involving a local pastor for child pornography.  
  
As a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Texas, the horrific child exploitation crimes I prosecuted still haunt me. They’re what spurred me to prioritize legislative efforts in Congress that focus on protecting children, and I won’t give up on this important fight.
  
Sincerely, 
￼  John Ratcliffe U.S. Representative for Texas’ Fourth District

Tenney Commends Madison County’s Action Against Non-Dairy Products Labeled as Milk
Dairy farmers are the backbone of our rural communities and economy.On Wednesday, I commended the actions of the Madison County Board of Supervisors in response to the resolution passed to address the mislabeling of non-dairy “milk.” Currently, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations define dairy products as being from dairy animals. However, the FDA has not enforced this regulation and the liquid extracted from grains, seeds, beans or leaves of various plants are being processed and marketed as milk.
Traveling across the district, I’ve listened to the problems facing our farmers and I’ve taken their concerns with me to Washington. Mislabeled imitation dairy including soy and almond milk greatly hurt our dairy farmers, and I am glad Madison County has worked to address this issue. In Congress, I cosponsored the DAIRY PRIDE Act and helped pass into law legislation that directs the FDA to take action against mislabeled imitation dairy foods. I was pleased to see that FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb announced plans to begin this process soon. 
In Congress, I have been a fierce advocate for our dairy farmers. I led the charge against the negative impact of the Canadian Class 7 milk pricing scheme which was eliminated as part of the new United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement (USMCA). I co-sponsored the School Milk Nutrition Act which allows schools to offer low-fat (1%) milk to students rather than just fat-free as well as the WHOLE MILK Act, which would allow schools to offer whole milk as an option to students.  
Tenney Announces Grant Funding for Cybersecurity Projects 
FuzeHub and Stony Brook Univeristy (AIM's partner Manufacturing Extension Partnership center) set aside $200,000 in funding to help NYS manufacturers reduce their cybersecurity risks. NYS manufacturers now have access to these funds through AIM. Each eligible manufacturer may receive up to a maximum of $3,000 for cybersecurity-related projects. 
Funds are offered on a first-come, first-serve basis, and are extremely limited.  
Please contact AIM as soon as possible to avoid missing out on this funding opportunity. For more information, or to apply, call AIM Cybersecurity Coordinator Paul LaPorte today at (315) 624-9800, or email him at plaporte@mvcc.edu.

Whether you’re a fire department in need of new equipment or a community organization looking to grow, our office can assist you in navigating the federal grant process.

Firefighters from across our community traveled to Albany to honor the life and legacy of Merle Nell, a Fire Police Captain and former Chief of the Vernon Fire Department.
Family, friends and fellow firefighters watched as Merle’s name was inscribed on the New York State Fallen Firefighters Memorial. 
Merle passed away in November, 2016 while on the scene of a fire in Vernon Center. His name is now etched on a wall with 2,551 other fallen firefighters from our great state who gave their lives in the line of duty. 
Affectionally known as “Skippy” to his family and friends, Merle’s legacy of service lives on through his sons and grandsons. Merle’s sons, Scott and Mark, serve as fire chiefs in Vernon and Verona, and his grandsons Adam and Matthew are active firefighters in Vernon and Zachary is a junior firefighter in Verona. 
A marine, father, postal worker and firefighter, Merle’s life of service was a true inspiration. His memory will live on in the hearts of our grateful community.

The Bost Bulletin  
Friend: 
It's been a very productive constituent work session in Southern Illinois this week, highlighted by meetings with constituents to hear firsthand their comments and concerns. My travels included visits with the Mascoutah Fire Department and Federally Employed Women, as well as a tour of the Continental Tire plant in Mount Vernon. Here's some of what we've been up to.

City Hall Board Meeting 
￼ 
I had the pleasure of meeting with Marissa mayor Chad Easton and other board members to discuss local issues facing Marissa. As a former local official myself, I understand the vital role local leaders play in shaping their communities. It is truly where the rubber meets the road.

Touring Continental Tire 
￼ 
And speaking of rubber meeting the road, I enjoyed a return trip to the Continental Tire facility in Mount Vernon. This local job creator plays an important role in strengthening Southern Illinois' economy.

Hearing From Mascoutah Firefighters 
￼ 
As a former Southern Illinois firefighter, I always welcome the opportunity to reconnect with my first responder brothers and sisters. I had the pleasure of dropping in on the Mascoutah Fire Department at their weekly meeting to thank them for what they do. I know how tough it is as I used to be in their shoes, and we owe our gratitude to these fine men and women risking their lives to keep us safe.

Visiting With Federally Employed Women (FEW) 
￼ 
I had the opportunity to hear from members of Federally Employed Women (FEW), an advocacy group working to improve the status of women employed by the federal government. 

Awarding Our Heroes 
￼ 
I had the honor of meeting with and awarding John Matheny's WWII medals to his son, Charles. John made the greatest sacrifice for his country and I know this recognition means a lot to his family. 

That's just some of the work I've been up to as I crisscross our 12 counties during the early weeks of October. I hope you have a great week ahead! 
Mike

10/14/18 12:51,Updates from the U.S. Senate,"￼  


Friends,  Confirming Justice Kavanaugh and passing comprehensive legislation to address our nation’s infrastructure needs are two of the Republican-led Senate’s latest efforts to help the American people, and I look forward to continuing to deliver even more wins for West Virginians.   Click here or the image below for more details on this week’s accomplishments, and keep scrolling for additional updates from this week.
  
￼ 
  
Investing in West Virginia’s Economy 
I’ve always said that economic growth starts at the local level, which is why it’s important we continue working to revitalize and support our small communities in West Virginia. That’s why, for years, I’ve worked directly with the Department of Commerce to encourage a renewed focus and drive investment in West Virginia: to help spur economic development and boost our economy.   Earlier this week, I joined Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in announcing that the department’s Economic Development Administration (EDA) has decided to—once again—invest in our state. $6.7 million in grants to be exact. These grants will support local business development and job growth efforts all across West Virginia. Not only are they expected to lead to more than a thousand new jobs for West Virginians looking for work now, but they will also lead to significant private investment that will benefit the region’s economy over the long term. Learn more about the individual awards here. 
Improving West Virginia’s Water Infrastructure 
Strengthening and improving America’s infrastructure is something we can all agree on, especially because of the enormous benefits that safe and reliable infrastructure provides. On Wednesday, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to pass a comprehensive water infrastructure bill that will cut red tape, grow the economy, and encourage fiscal responsibility. Better yet, as a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, I was able to ensure my provisions to benefit West Virginia communities were included in the bill. These provisions include measures that will grow and improve our water workforce and provide our communities better access to reliable wastewater systems. Combined with the many other legislative solutions in this bill, they will benefit Americans living in every single state, and I look forward to President Trump signing it into law.

Visiting the Eastern Panhandle 
On Friday, I hit the road and made a few stops in the Eastern Panhandle where I met with community leaders, students, educators, and small business owners. I spent the day discussing how Congress is working to help our veterans, combat the opioid epidemic, and improve our infrastructure. I also helped rally students at Martinsburg High School ahead of the school’s homecoming game, which was an exciting experience! Here are a few photo highlights from the day:

President Trump signed into law the most important legislation in a generation to help Tennessee songwriters
￼
Watch the above video of my remarks at the signing ceremony here. 
This week, I joined President Trump at the White House as he signed the Music Modernization Act -- a bill I led through Congress that will be the most important legislation in a generation to help songwriters. This is really big news for Tennesseans -- from Beale Street in Memphis, through Music City, all the way to the birthplace of country music in Bristol. We have thousands of songwriters -- taxi drivers, music teachers -- struggling to make a living, and in the Internet age, sometimes they aren’t paid for their songs, and when they are paid, they're not paid a fair market value. The Music Modernization Act is the most important law in a generation to help make sure that our songwriters in Tennessee -- and songwriters all over America -- can keep working and make a decent living by making sure they're paid when their songs are played, and making sure that they're paid a fair market value for their work. Our success is the result of most parts of the music industry -- songwriters, publishers, digital music companies and broadcasters -- working together on what they agree on instead of fighting over what they disagree about. It has taken us several years to get to this point, and I’m glad this very important legislation is now law.
I published an op-ed on this in the Tennessean this week. Give it a read here! 
 
￼
It was an honor standing next to President Trump to watch him sign this historic legislation for songwriters in our state.
 
Republican Congress Getting Results for Tennesseans:
	•	Senate Republicans blocked a Democrat effort this week that would take away from millions of Americans the option to buy more affordable health insurance.
	•	President Trump has nominated and Senate Republicans have confirmed a historic number of federal judges since the president’s inauguration. These include Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, 29 Circuit Court Judges, and 53 District Court Judges -- including Tennesseans Mark Norris and Eli Richardson who were confirmed this week.
Congress Extends the Freedom to Fish Act which Stops the Federal Government from Restricting Fishing Below Dams 
	•	The U.S. Senate passed a bill that is a big victory for Tennessee’s fishermen -- it extended the Freedom to Fish Act for five more years. Generations of fishermen have been fishing below the dams on the Cumberland River ever since they have been built, and this legislation ensures Tennesseans continue to have the freedom to decide for themselves when it is safe to fish rather than wasting taxpayer dollars to unnecessarily close off important fishing areas. The bill now heads to President Trump’s desk to become law.
 
Bill to help keep Chickamauga Lock construction on schedule heads to president
This week, the Senate passed the America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, which will ensure construction of Chickamauga Lock can stay on schedule in the coming years. This legislation is one way the federal government can help improve water infrastructure, which helps protect jobs and industry in Tennessee by keeping commerce flowing on our nation’s rivers. Separately, this year, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee I chair also worked hard to provide record funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to ensure we could keep federal lock and dam projects funded for the fifth consecutive year -- including the construction of Chickamauga Lock. I look forward to President Trump signing this legislation into law.
 
Tennesseans Mark Norris and Eli Richardson confirmed to serve as U.S. District Court Judges
This week, the Senate confirmed Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Mark Norris to serve as a U.S. District Judge for the Western District of Tennessee, and Eli Richardson to serve as a U.S. District Judge for the Middle District of Tennessee. I strongly supported Senator Norris and Eli Richardson’s nominations. Senator Norris is respected by his peers around the country, having been elected chairman of the Council of State Governments, and he has been an advocate and a champion for federalism and for the separation of powers. He is a citizen, a lawyer and a legislator. I have known him for many years -- since I was the governor of Tennessee -- and I am glad the Senate voted to confirm him. 
Eli Richardson will also be a strong asset to the federal bench. His professional experience -- as a litigator, FBI special agent and federal prosecutor in the Middle District of Tennessee, where he was appointed the office’s Criminal Chief -- make him uniquely qualified for this position. Tennessee is fortunate to have such a well-qualified nominee who is willing to serve, and I’m glad the Senate confirmed his nomination because it will help bring relief to a crowded docket.
 
Joined Tusculum University to inaugurate their new president, and celebrate their 225th homecoming celebration
￼
I enjoyed my time at Tusculum University yesterday, where I got to participate the inauguration of their new president, Dr. James Hurley. Dr. Hurley has a lot to offer this university -- he knows the territory, has a passion for education and basketball, was the first in his family to graduate from college and became president of that college, and we already know he thinks big. Big dreams include new programs to help the region deal with the opioid epidemic, transitioning from a college to a university and announcing a new College of Optometry. I also got to celebrate Tusculum’s 225th homecoming. Let’s look at Tusculum’s roots. Tusculum was founded two years before Tennessee became a state. There were a lot of Presbyterian pioneers and fighters who came to the area, including Rankin relatives of mine -- William B. Rankin, who became president of Tusculum College in 1854, and Thomas Samuel Rankin, who was a professor at Tusculum from 1885 when he graduated until 1931. These pioneers created the first higher education institution in Tennessee. This homecoming was a good reminder that Tusculum has plenty that is unique to celebrate, and it now has the arrival of an experienced, big thinking, new president who dreams of building on the success Tusculum has already had.

Stopping Senate Democrats from blocking 1.7 million uninsured Americans from buying more affordable health insurance 
￼
I spoke about this on the Senate floor, you can watch here. 
This week, Senate Republicans voted down a Democrat attempt to strip millions of Americans of an option to buy more affordable health insurance. This form of insurance, called short-term limited duration health plans, gives consumers a chance to buy insurance that might be 70% cheaper than plans on the Obamacare exchange. If you lost your job and couldn't afford insurance during the Obama years or if Obamacare plans got too expensive during the Obama years, you could buy short-term insurance for up to a year if your state allowed it. This week’s action means Democrats are saying, “We're not going to do what President Obama would do. We're going to keep your insurance high today with a yes vote. We're going to say to 1.7 million people that you can't buy insurance because we know more than you do.” I hope that across this country, as Americans look at this today you would ask Democrats: “Why do you want to kill a rule that President Obama favored that existed all during Obamacare while he was there, that gave people who might lose their jobs or couldn't afford Obamacare a chance to buy insurance that might be 70% cheaper? Why would you want to keep 1.7 million Americans who won't have insurance in 2019, according to the Urban Institute, from being able to buy these short-term plans?”
 
New law will allow pharmacists to help patients pay less for prescriptions
￼
This week, I went to the White House to join President Trump as he signed the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, legislation that was passed by the Senate health committee I chair. This bill will ban “gag” clauses that prevent pharmacists from helping patients pay less for their prescriptions. If you walk into a pharmacy and ask for the prescription your doctor has written for an antibiotic, you might have a copay of $40 under your insurance plan, but if you pay with cash, it could only be $5. I hear often from Tennesseans that they struggle to afford their prescriptions. This new law, led by Senator Collins of Maine, takes a simple step to allow a pharmacist to tell a patient about the option to potentially pay less for prescription drugs so they can keep more of their money in their own pockets. 
 
￼
 
I enjoyed meeting with Knoxville Mayor Madeleine Rogero and Mayor Steve Williams of Huntington, West Virginia. We discussed the opioid legislation that I helped pass out of the Senate last week, which will help their communities fight the opioid epidemic.

Saving $$ on Rx - Lowering Prescription Drug Costs!
Dear Friend:
As always, I appreciate you letting me bring you this brief update. It is an honor representing you!  This past Wednesday, the President signed into law two important bipartisan consumer bills, which I supported. The two bills, S. 2553, ‘Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018’, and S. 2554, the ‘Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act’ will lift what many local pharmacists describe as a ‘gag clause’ that prevented them from informing their customers how to lower their out of pocket costs when getting their prescriptions filled.   S. 2553, “Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018” amends title XVIII of the Social Security Act to prohibit Medicare Part D plans from giving complete information regarding the prices of specific drugs to Medicare beneficiaries. S. 2554, the “Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act” will end that practice and make the information publicly available. In some instances, for example, it can actually cost less to pay out of pocket for a prescription than it would to have it run through their health insurance policy yet pharmacists, prior to the passage of this legislation, were not allowed to give that information to consumers.  Consumers deserve the right to make fully informed decisions and withholding information regarding the cost of their prescription drugs is simply wrong. Th bills passed the House of Representatives on a unanimous vote and the Senate on a 98-2 vote.  
￼
 Rep. Mike Coffman met with Selena, manager of Gem Pharmacy in
Littleton, CO, following the passage of S. 2553 and S.2554
Another example what we can do for the good of our country when we work together in Congress was the final passage of H.R. 6, the ‘SUPPORT for Patients of Communities Act.’ This landmark legislation is the latest effort to combat the opioid crisis and it follows up on the passage of the ‘Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act’ and the ‘21st Century Cures Act’ last Congress. H.R. 6 includes key language to set up the programs to spend the $4 billion appropriated in fiscal year 2018 to help combat the opioid crisis, as well as the $6 billion included in the recent Defense-Labor-HHS appropriations package to boost programs that fight, treat, and stop substance abuse and provide better access to mental health services. Taken together, this package represents the most significant congressional effort against a single drug crisis in history.   I am also very pleased that H.R. 6, the “SUPPORT for Patients of Communities Act” included legislation, H.R. 4635, the ‘Peer-2-Peer Counseling Act,’ that I introduced in the House Veterans Affairs Committee earlier this year. H.R. The ‘Peer-2-Peer Counseling Act,’ will ensure the Veterans’ Administration’s (VA) existing peer-to-peer counseling program will be expanded to increase the number of female peer counselors to better serve the increasing numbers of female veterans. As our female veteran population continues to increase because women are approaching 20% of the active duty force, the VA will have to adjust the way it operates to accommodate when they leave active duty and become eligible for VA services.  The VA’s 2016 suicide data report found that “the risk of suicide was 2.4 times higher among female veterans when compared with civilian adult females,” so we clearly need to improve the quality and availability of counseling services for them. As a Marine Corps combat veteran and a member of the House Veteran Affairs Committee, making sure that our veterans receive the services they need has always been a priority for me.   Finally, I wanted to remind you that if you need help with a federal agency, my office is here to help. If you have a question personal regarding social security, Medicare/Medicaid or immigration, please contact our Aurora office at 720-748-7514, and one of our casework managers will assist you. I also invite you to visit my website or follow me on Facebook or Twitter to get the most up-to-date news as they happen.

Weekly Update: Long Deserved Recognition  By Congressman Rob Wittman  October 14, 2018  Let me set the scene: crystal clear sky, fresh cut green grass, the calm waters of the York River, and a sense of accomplishment.   Last week, I had the honor of joining Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke at Werowocomoco to celebrate the long overdue federal recognition of the Chickahominy, Eastern Chickahominy, Monacan, Nansemond, Rappahannock, and Upper Mattaponi tribes. Earlier this year, the president signed my bill granting federal recognition to these Virginia Indian tribes into law, and I was proud to stand with them to celebrate this achievement.  
￼

We started the ceremony with a blessing of the ground by Chief Anne Richardson of the Rappahannock Indian Tribe. As I stood there with these tribes, who hold so much of our nation’s heritage, I couldn’t help but think how blessed we are. We sometimes lamented and said, ‘Is this ever going to happen. Through faith, through dedication, through working together, we accomplished what seemed impossible.  

￼
The effort in Congress to gain federal recognition for these six tribes dates back nearly 20 years to when Congressman Jim Moran first introduced the Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act in 2000. Though these tribes had received official recognition from the Commonwealth of Virginia, they faced barriers preventing them from receiving federal recognition.  
￼
The tribes lacked formal treaties with the U.S. Government because they made peace with England well before the establishment of the United States. Additionally, due to the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, much of the tribes’ birth records, marriage certificates, and land titles were destroyed. The lack of these documents prevented the tribes from providing the necessary evidence to gain recognition through the Bureau of Indian Affairs federal recognition process.  Despite these obstacles, the tribes pushed forward. Committing themselves to working with Congress to get federal recognition through the legislative process. After decades, we have taken the critical last step in correcting the failure to recognize the ‘first contact’ tribes of the Commonwealth of Virginia.  
￼
This all started with a strong woman, Thomasina E. Jordan, who this legislation is named after. Now, the work of generations has finally come to fruition. I am humbled to have played a role in securing this moment decades in the making for our Virginia tribes. I will forever consider this one of my major achievements as a legislator.

Tired of winning? Neither am I.
 
 
When President Trump was blazing the campaign trail he promised the American people that we would win. He won in 2016 and is still winning today. Under President Trump's leadership, we've continued winning by putting America first and enacting policies that help get Americans off the sidelines and into the game. 

Over the last year or two, we've seen what winning looks like - a change of pace from the Obama Administration. Our economy is booming and unemployment levels are dropping their lowest level in nearly 50 years. These numbers did not appear out of thin air. They are a result of pro-growth and pro-American policies supported by Republicans in Congress and President Trump, such as tax reform. When our economy is winning, Americans win. 

A winning economy
· Lowest unemployment rate since 1969 – 3.7%
· Since President Trump took office, we’ve added more than 3.8 million jobs 
· Averaging 208,000 added jobs per month in 2018
· Average hourly earnings rose by 2.8% over the last 12 months
Tired of winning? Neither am I.

Winning the Supreme Court
President Trump has had the opportunity to appoint two very qualified conservative Judges to our Supreme Court. A monumental decision that will impact our country for years to come. I firmly supported both of President Trump's nominees, Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Justice Neil Gorsuch. Not confirming these men would have been a huge loss for Americans and would paved the way for further obstruction and destruction of our country by Democrats. We must continue placing conservative leaders in positions that will use the Constitution as a guide instead of a suggested reading. It was a hard fought battle, but President Trump and Republicans once again came out victorious.

Our military is winning
Through sequestration and other defense spending reductions, our military was hurting. President Trump made a promise to rebuild and strengthen our military - and we've done just that. A few months ago, we worked together to pass the National Defense Authorization Act making it the earliest passed NDAA in 41 years. To follow on the heels of the FY19 NDAA, we successfully passed the defense funding bill that will provide the necessary funding for our Armed Forces to have the tools they need to do their jobs. 

We are committed to making life better for all Americans.

Academy Day 2018
We had a great turn out at last Saturday's Academy Day. Students were able to talk with leaders from the academies and also hear from Mississippians who are currently enrolled or have graduated from an academy. 

￼

Students were able to hear from midshipman Lauren Green of the Merchant Marine Academy who is a senior this year and a native of Ocean Springs.

￼

They also had the opportunity to hear from LTJG Shelby Henderson, USCG Commanding Officer located in Gulfport. 

￼

I'd like to thank all who attended this year's Academy Day as well as the leaders from the U.S. Service Academies who were there to share more about their schools. 

In your service,
￼
Steven

THE SCALISE CAPITOL REPORT
My prayers are with the people of Florida and other impacted states as they begin the recovery process from the devastation of Hurricane Michael. In South Louisiana, we are no strangers to storms like this, and my office is already helping my colleagues in Florida during their time of need so people can rebuild and get back in their homes as quickly as possible.   There is no place for violence in politics. There have been too many reports of threats, harassment, and violence taking place against others simply because of their political affiliation or views. Despite these reports, we have continued to see Democrat leaders in Washington work to keep this anger burning and incite even more harassment and violence. I refuse to stand by silently, and I will continue to call for an end to this new wave of political bullying and even criminal activity. A healthy, strong democracy is not possible if anyone lives in fear of expressing their views. That might be how tyrannical dictators do things in third world countries, but that is not who we are in America. If this is going to stop, it must start with Democrat leaders, who need to condemn, rather than promote these dangerous calls to violence.  I wrote a column about this on FoxNews.com, which you can read here. I also joined Fox & Friends to drive home how important it is that we return to civility for the sake of our democracy. Click here or below to watch.

Touring the National Finance Center with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue Earlier this week, I was pleased to host U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue in Southeast Louisiana. During his visit, we toured the National Finance Center (NFC) in New Orleans, an accounting hub for the U.S. government that manages the payroll for over 700,000 federal employees. The NFC, which employs nearly 1,000 people in our area, is managed by USDA and overseen by Secretary Perdue. Unfortunately, the building was severely damaged by a tornado in early 2017, but thanks to the dedication and hard work of the Louisianans who work there, the National Finance Center has never failed to fulfill its role in keeping our government running properly. During our visit, Sec. Perdue and I discussed how we can do even more to improve the center's operations and rebuild after the devastating tornado that destroyed their building.
￼ Secretary Perdue and I meet and talk with the dedicated employees at NFC.  
￼
Louisiana Agriculture Commissioner Mike Strain, Drago's owner Tommy Cvitanovich and I watch as Sec. Perdue charbroils some Louisiana oysters for lunch. 
 It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more information please visit my website, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook pages.   God Bless,

October 14, 2018
Dear Friend,  
My thoughts and prayers are with all of our neighbors in the panhandle and beyond who have been in the destructive path of Hurricane Michael.  Please be assured we will ensure those communities have all of the federal support needed to facilitate recovery.  This most recent natural disaster is an ever-present reminder of the urgent need for the Senate to take action on the reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). All Floridians need continued access to affordable flood insurance, and the House passed our bill a year ago. I urge my Senate colleagues to take this issue up immediately. 
Last week was quite busy.  I enjoyed the opportunity to meet with many constituents and to attend events throughout our community.  However, I was saddened to learn about the passing of Carl Orth, a long-time reporter with the Suncoast News. It was truly a pleasure to work with Carl. His reporting was always thorough and fair. He made such a unique impact on our community by ensuring that his readers stayed up-to-date on current events in West Pasco. May his memory be eternal!
Please continue reading for an update of my work on your behalf last week! 
Meeting with Community Leaders and Surveying Community Needs 
As I travelled throughout the district last week, I talked with business owners and residents being impacted by flooding. Down by the sponge docks, the flooding was once again pretty bad. Much like I did in Holiday and other parts of Pasco County, I am working to secure federal funding to help address this problem in Tarpon Springs.   
￼ 
It was also great to have the opportunity to participate in the Downtown Avalon Park West groundbreaking ceremony in Central Pasco last week. This will be a great addition to our community. 
￼ 
I really enjoyed visiting the Pasco Housing Authority to learn more about the Family Self Sufficiency Program. This amazing program is transforming lives by giving participants the opportunity to improve their vocational skills, financial literacy and credit. Many graduates of the program have been able to leave public housing and purchase their own homes. I also appreciated the chance to talk with the dedicated employees who are on the front lines working with families to help facilitate this change. 
￼ 
Additionally, I enjoyed meeting with the leaders of Habitat for Humanity of Pinellas to learn more about the great work they are doing in our community! 
￼ 
Protecting our Seniors 
I understand how important increases in the Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA) within the Social Security program are to seniors living on a fixed income. So I was pleased at last week’s announcement of a 2.8% COLA increase, which is substantially higher than recent years.  Additionally, I know that many of my constituents saw last year’s COLA absorbed by increases in Medicare premiums. Fortunately, this year’s Medicare Part B base premium only increased by $1.50 this year, so most seniors shouldn’t face the same issue again this year.  However, I am actively working on legislation to fix this problem for the future, because I know how many seniors rely on their COLA to cover rising costs. 
As part of my effort to provide greater transparency in healthcare and to reduce the cost of Prescription Drugs, I was pleased to vote in favor of S. 2554, The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, which ensures health insurers cannot prohibit pharmacists from informing a patient about the lowest available price for a drug. For example, pharmacists should be able to alert patients when it is cheaper to pay cash for a medication than it is to pay a copayment. Additionally, S. 2553, Know the Lowest Price Act, ensures this same access to information for Medicare and Medicare Advantage participants. Both bills were just signed into law last week. There is no one simple solution to lowering the price of prescription drugs, but we are taking an aggressive approach and passing multiple measures that are part of the solution, including my bill to create more competition when none exists and my efforts to streamline approval for combination products. We have already seen my work help to lower costs on medications like the EpiPen, and last week’s new laws will help even more. 
It was also great to speak with my constituents at Heritage Park Health and Rehabilitation Center in Dade City last week. We discussed Medicare, Social Security and my efforts to reduce the cost of prescription drugs.

Fighting for our Heroes 
With more than 54,000 Veterans calling Pasco home, our community has outgrown the current VA West Pasco Outpatient Clinic. Veterans in our community deserve access to the best possible care, which is why I have fought tirelessly for a larger, state-of-the-art facility which will better meet the needs of our local heroes. This article highlights my efforts. This new facility will bring added convenience for Veterans. I look forward to celebrating its grand opening.

""GAG CLAUSE"" PROVISIONS OUTLAWED

This week, I joined President Trump as he signed my proposal to ban ""gag clause"" provisions into law. 

￼
Rep. Carter joins President Trump at the White House for the signing ceremony of legislation to ban ""gag clause"" provisions

In case you missed it, Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) were able to include requirements in contracts that prevented pharmacists from providing advice to their patients on the best and cheapest out-of-pocket alternatives to medications covered under insurance. This is commonly known as a ""gag clause."" As a result, you could be paying more for your prescription than you need to. 

Now, this is outlawed and pharmacists will be able to tell you about the best and cheapest options available. 

It was an honor to join President Trump as he signed this important legislation making it law. Click here to view the signing ceremony. 

Now, I am committed to continuing this work with my colleagues in Congress and President Trump to lower prescription drug prices and health care costs for all Americans. 

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CLXXXIII

Monday, October 8, 2018:  This past weekend was a busy one as on Saturday morning I joined in the 13th annual Buddy Walk at Forsyth Park in downtown Savannah.  This great event is sponsored by the Lowcountry Down Syndrome Society (LDSS), a family support group that benefits people with Down syndrome and their families in eight surrounding counties in the Savannah area.  This is a very special group to me as I grew up with an Aunt who had Down syndrome.  Along with my good friend Joe Marchese and his beautiful daughter Emma, I walked part of the route with the thousands of people supporting this great cause.  Later in the afternoon, I traveled down to Kingsland in Camden County where I met with constituents from the surrounding area.  Yesterday, I flew from Savannah to Atlanta where I was honored to speak at the American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery (AA0-HNSF) annual meeting.  After being introduced by my good friend, Dr. Michael Zoller from Savannah, I was able to bring the group up to date on the latest health care news in Washington and then enjoyed answering questions.  Afterwards, I flew back to Jacksonville and stopped in Brunswick on my way home to Pooler for a meeting with constituents.  This morning I’m honored to be at the 4th Annual Folds of Honor Stars and Stripes Golf Tournament held at the Savannah Country Club on Wilmington Island.  The mission of the Folds of Honor is to provide educational scholarships to spouses and children of America’s fallen and disabled service members.
￼

This year’s event is chaired by Col. David Simons of Savannah and the special guest is Ginger Ravella whose husband, an F16 pilot, was killed in a combat mission in 2006 leaving her with five children, all under the age of 8 at the time.  All of Ginger’s children are receiving scholarships for school provided by the Folds of Honor.  Later in the afternoon, I head to Skidaway Island for a meeting with constituents before heading to Tybee Island for another meeting with constituents about important issues to them.  
Tuesday, October 9, 2018:  For the fifth year in a row, I’m at Richmond Hill Montessori Preschool in Bryan County to read to students in celebration of Georgia Pre-K week.  This year I get to read the classic Click Clack Moo: Cows That Type to four classes and participate in an activity where we make cow masks out of paper plates. 
￼
Rep. Carter reading to Richmond Hill Montessori Preschool 
Afterwards, I head to downtown Savannah where I attend the inaugural State of the Airport address given by Savannah Airport Commission executive director Greg Kelly as he outlines the growth of the airport throughout the years as well as future expansion. 
￼
Rep. Carter at the State of the Airport Address 
I am very proud that our office was successful this year in helping the commission secure an $8 million grant to fund a terminal apron expansion.  Later in the day, I head back down to Richmond Hill to meet with a group of students from Richmond Hill High School.
Wednesday, October 10, 2018:  I’m on a plane to Washington bright and early this morning and, once back in my office on Capitol Hill, I have the opportunity to catch up on some paperwork as well as meet with my policy team to review their work over the past few weeks.  While I’m away from Washington my legislative staff takes meetings with different groups visiting the Capitol and keeps me informed of their work.  Early in the afternoon, I head to the White House where the President has invited me to a bill signing ceremony in the Roosevelt Room.  The two bills being signed are companion bills to my legislation, the Know the Cost Act, that eliminates the “gag clause” provisions in health plans that prevent pharmacists from providing advice to their patients on the best and cheapest out-of-pocket alternatives to medications covered under insurance.  
￼
Rep. Carter at the White House signing ceremony of legislation to ban ""gag clause"" provisions 
As the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress, I know firsthand how important it is for pharmacists to help patients access the lowest cost options and that is why I took the lead on this legislation.  A link to the C-SPAN coverage of the bill signing ceremony can be found here. Afterwards, I head back to the airport for my return flight home.  
Thursday, October 11, 2018:  Thankfully, most of our district was spared from the ravages of Hurricane Michael that hit the Florida panhandle yesterday.  While our thoughts and prayers go out to those who were impacted by this devastating storm, we are glad that we were spared and also glad that our emergency management leaders did such an outstanding job preparing us for the worst.  Because of the bad weather, most of our events in the district for today and tomorrow have been canceled but I start my morning with a radio interview with my good friends Bill Edwards and Laura Anderson with WTKS in Savannah as we discuss my trip to the White House yesterday when the President signed my “gag clause” legislation into law. Later in the day, I have television interviews with Savannah stations WJCL, WSAV and WTOC before having a phone interview with the Savannah Morning News to discuss my “gag clause” legislation. A link to the WSAV interview can be found here.

Congressman Smith's E-news: October 13, 2018 
￼  I recently had a great meeting with the Scottsbluff Gering Chamber of Commerce to learn more about the exciting prospects for growth in Nebraska's panhandle.  
   Reviving Air Travel in Nebraska 
On October 5th, President Trump signed into law the 2018 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act to update and authorize its activities for another five years. This is important to Nebraska’s Third District because it contained a policy change whose specific aim is to support and revive commercial air service to our rural communities.   Air travel volume at smaller airports in rural areas such as the Third District declined in recent years due in part to increased government regulations. One major cause occurred in 2013 when the FAA changed its requirement for first officers, or co-pilots, to certify 1,500 hours of flight time instead of 250 hours, which was previously the norm.   Under the previous regulation, junior pilots were able to earn a wage while training on the job with experienced pilots. This change, while well-intentioned from a safety standpoint, created a shortage of co-pilots which was cited as the main reason behind the bankruptcy of two airlines which previously served Third District airports.   The domino effect continued as air traffic declined and in turn threatened these airports’ access to federal funding should they fall below 10,000 enplanements per year, which is the threshold for full funding under the Airport Improvement Program. This program provides funding for capital and safety improvements to buildings, runways, control towers, and fueling infrastructure.  A small decline in enplanements could snowball into a much larger issue affecting the competitiveness of our airports by allowing them to fall into disrepair if deprived of such a vital source of funding. In order to stop this chain reaction, I wrote and introduced the Small Airport Regulation Relief Act in 2014, which was enacted into law in 2016 and again in 2018 as part of the FAA reauthorization I mentioned above.   Its purpose is to provide relief to these airports by exempting them from the 10,000 enplanement minimum and allowing continued access to federal funding as the pilot labor market expands to fill the void created by increased regulation by the FAA. In meetings with pilots and airline representatives, I have been told that changes to the structure of pilot training programs will help to provide additional pilots moving forward.   Should this not materialize, I am ready and willing to consider additional regulatory relief to deliver a full recovery at Third District airports. Declining demand is not a fact of life at our rural airports as recently announced direct service to Las Vegas from Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island has shown us. Commercial air service is vital to maintaining a vibrant rural economy and it will remain among my highest priorities as I serve as your representative in Congress.    E15 Year-Round 
The year-round availability of higher ethanol blends such as E15 is a simple, common sense measure which I have long championed for its benefits to producers, refiners, and consumers across America. In addition to introducing legislation requiring the EPA to allow the sale of E15 throughout the year, I have sent multiple letters and consulted administration officials on numerous occasions to this end. President Trump has long stated his support for renewable fuels, and I appreciate him following through on his commitment this week.  
As always, feel free to forward my e-newsletter to family and friends, or let them know they can sign up to receive updates from my office on my website at AdrianSmith.house.gov.

October 13, 2018
Greetings,
For far too long, Social Security has been wrongly tied to Medicare Part A enrollment. On Tuesday, I introduced the Retirement Freedom Act with Rep. Gary Palmer (R-Ala.) to address this problem. This bill would empower America’s senior citizens by allowing them to utilize private health insurance without losing their Social Security benefits. Seniors should be able to choose a health insurance plan that fits their needs, without the fear of losing their Social Security benefits, and I am hopeful my colleagues in Congress will act swiftly to create more healthcare options for seniors.
Across the Lone Star State, Texans are thrilled with the historic tax cuts, the job-killing federal regulations we’ve rolled back, and the strong, constitutionalist judges we’ve confirmed to the federal bench. However, there is still more Congress can do to deliver on the promises we made to the American people. This week, I had the pleasure of meeting with job creators and city officials from Killeen, Conroe, and El Paso. We discussed the military’s expansion in Texas, making the tax cuts permanent, reducing the burden of federal regulations, and reforming healthcare, among other issues. On Wednesday, I penned a letter with Sen. John Cornyn and Rep. Louie Gohmert in support of the City of Lufkin’s request for a foreign trade zone (FTZ) which, if established, will incentivize further investment in the city and create more good paying jobs and opportunity for Texans. Jobs and economic growth continue to be my top priority in the Senate, because they are the top priority of Texans. Additionally, I sent a letter with Senator Cornyn and Rep. Jodey Arrington to the Secretary of the Air Force inviting her to visit Dyess Air Force Base.
On Thursday, I penned an op-ed with Rep. Kevin Brady in the Dallas Morning News. We highlighted our bipartisan Equal Treatment of Public Servants Act, which would repeal the current Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and replace it with a fairer formula. For decades, our teachers, firefighters, police officers, and other public servants have been subjected to an unfair, one-size-fits-all approach to calculating their earned Social Security benefits. I am hopeful Congress will act swiftly to replace this formula, and ensure our public servants are treated fairly as the accomplished individuals they are, receiving Social Security in line with their work history.
Texas benefited from a number of policies aimed at strengthening our port infrastructure and mitigating against future hurricane damage this week. On Wednesday, I voted for the bipartisan America’s Water Infrastructure Act, which includes projects that will begin to help shield a number of our Gulf Coast cities from the impacts of hurricanes and storm surges, and increase economic growth in several of our port communities. I take seriously my responsibility to work with Texas port communities, Gulf Coast city officials, and job creators to ensure they have the resources needed to remain a strong economic engine for our state and our country. I was also pleased the Department of Commerce announced this week its intention to allocate $10 million in grants to the state of Texas to enhance critical port infrastructure to support business development and disaster resiliency. According to grantee estimates, the projects combined are expected to create and retain nearly 16,000 jobs and spur almost $46 million in private investment. The ports of Port Arthur and Beaumont are making strides down the road to recovery.
Our prayers are with those Americans in the path of Hurricane Michael, and we continue to lift up those Americans recovering from Hurricane Florence. Both of these recent hurricanes are a stark reminder of the importance of taking all steps necessary to prepare our homes and families for any future weather event. For those seeking preparedness information and resources, please refer to the federal and state resources listed here.

Gold in East Cobb 
A special congratulations to Seline Nie, who lives in Marietta, for being named one of ten honorees to receive the Girl Scouts' 2018 National Gold Award. Seline was selected for being an inspiring young leader who takes a plan and puts it in to action. Seline's project focused on engaging girls in STEM education. Seline hosted 17 workshops and seminars worldwide to help grow girls' interest in science and technology. Way to go, Seline!

Social security benefits increase
For the first time in seven years, seniors will see their social security benefits increase. Benefits will increase 2.8% increase in 2019 — which translates into an additional $40 per month. The tax cuts are fueling more federal revenues and fostering greater stability for Social Security.
Click here to read more from the Wall Street Journal. 

Tax cuts continue to help families
Five ways the tax cuts are helping families and small businesses in Georgia's 6th District: 
	1.	The standard deduction has doubled - more of what you earn is tax free
	2.	Wages are rising, the largest in over nine years
	3.	 About 90% of families of all income levels are seeing a greater increase in take-home pay
	4.	The Child Tax Credit has doubled
	5.	 Businesses are expanding sick leave benefits for families

Friends in our prayers 
We are thinking of our friends dealing with the destruction of Hurricane Michael. In Southwest Georgia, many were left without power, roads were blocked, and Georgia's crops and livestock were deeply affected. Sadly, we lost a young person to this hurricane’s wrath. Our prayers continue.

 Delivering Results for Texans



Despite what you might see in the mainstream media, the Senate has been hard at work getting things done during the 115th Congress.
In the past week alone, we’ve passed water infrastructure legislation, provided funding to prosecute cold cases solved by DNA evidence, and confirmed Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court.
On top of that, we have confirmed 84 judges under President Trump. That includes three Texas judges on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and five that preside over Texas district courts.
We’ve also been able to repeal burdensome regulations leftover from the Obama Administration, like Obamacare’s individual mandate, to give consumers more choices when it comes to picking health care plans that work for them.
One bill I’m particularly proud of, the Fix NICS Act, helps fix our broken background check system and ensures that convicted felons aren't able to purchase or possess firearms. I authored that bill as a response to the tragic shooting in Sutherland Springs.
And finally, we’ve restored America's defense with the greatest investment in the military in decades, reauthorized important intelligence-gathering tools that help track terrorists abroad, and passed the VA Mission Act, which strengthens health care and community care options for veterans.
We put money back in America's pocket. We rolled back regulations to make their lives a little bit easier. We strengthened our military, gave our veterans access to better health care, and protected our communities from harm.
But we’re not done yet.

Dear Friend,
Information is power. Unfortunately, current rules and regulations are preventing you from having all the information you need when paying for certain prescription drugs. That’s right, red tape and insider deals meant to benefit bottom lines are preventing your local pharmacy from being able to tell you if you could pay less for the same prescriptions. That all changed last week when President Trump signed into law a ban of “gag clauses,” which had previously benefited health care industry insiders at the expense of Missouri families trying to care for loved ones...KEEP READING HERE  The early images from Hurricane Michael look devastating, and I'm praying for everyone in the storm's path. If you or a loved one happen to be in Michael's wake, please stay safe and listen to local authorities.

Dear Friends,  Given these turbulent political times, it's more important than ever that we remain engaged and knowledgeable of current events.   
That is why I am sharing with you my reading picks for this week. These are the articles and editorials that have captured my interest and, I believe, are crucial to our understanding of the forces seeking to shape the future of our government, our country, and the world. When we empower ourselves to seek out the truth with verified, factual reporting, we are better equipped to make crucial decisions and create positive change. 
Happy reading and all the best,   ￼

My Private Oval Office Press Conference With Donald Trump, Mike Pence, John Kelly, and Mike Pompeo
By Olivia Nuzzi, New York Magazine Intelligencer
￼
Around 12:20 p.m. on Tuesday, I was on my way out of the White House after a series of meetings in the West Wing. I was reporting on a question that has hung over this administration for months: How has Chief of Staff John Kelly managed to keep his job in spite of convincing and persistent rumors and reports that the president is unhappy with him, and he is unhappy in his job? I stopped to talk to another reporter, and then I began to walk toward the North Gate. As I walked, I noticed I had a missed call from a Washington number I didn’t recognize. It was Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. She sounded very serious. She asked me if I had left yet. When I said no, she asked me to come back inside, and when she greeted me, she looked very serious. She implied she wanted me to go with her behind a door. I didn’t understand, maybe didn’t quite hear her. Then, she told me Trump wanted to speak to me.
I walked to the Oval Office. I guessed that the president wanted to disabuse me of any notion that Kelly was about to be fired, or had almost been fired many times before. I was right, but my imagination was too limited. What ensued amounted to a private press conference — featuring a series of special guest stars from the highest echelon of the Trump administration — to try to get me to change my mind.

An acclaimed American charity said it was saving some of the world’s most vulnerable girls from sexual exploitation. But from the very beginning, girls were being raped.

Special to ProPublica
On Sept. 7, 2013, on a long, straight avenue that runs across the bustling downtown of Liberia’s capital, Monrovia, street hawkers peered at the spectacle. Guests sweltered on packed rows of plastic seats, while at the end of a red carpet, next to the U.S. ambassador, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf sat atop something like a throne. 
She was a dervish of hugs, laughter, even tears. Her name was Katie Meyler. It was her 31st birthday and, she would later say, the best day of her life. The More Than Me Academy was opening. 
The building had been a war-ruined shell people used as a toilet, festering so long a tree had grown through its walls. Now, with the Liberian president having given Meyler free use, it shone, improbably rebuilt into a school. A slogan ran step by step up a staircase: “I – promise – to – make – my – dream – come – true.” A sense of possibility infused the day, for Liberia and for the girls whose lives Meyler was transforming.

Pastor Andrew Brunson Returns Home

After two years of detainment, Pastor Andrew Brunson was released from house arrest and is returning home today. In October of 2016 Pastor Brunson, along with his wife, were imprisoned as part of a political crackdown in Turkey. While his wife was released after 13 days, he was not. Today we celebrate his release and a safe return back to the Unites States to be with his family. This welcome news is long overdue and our prayers were finally answered. We look forward to your return Pastor!

Prescription Drug Pricing for You, Not the Pharmaceutical Industry

On Wednesday, the President signed two bills into law, the Know the Lowest Price Act and the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act. These laws will help seniors and all recipients of prescription drugs save money and receive the lowest possible price. Ending these so called ""gag orders"" will allow pharmacists to tell you when the cash price for a prescription is less than what you would pay using your insurance. For too long North Texans have been subjected to high prices that many struggle to pay while cheaper prices were available.

Happy Birthday US Navy!

Tomorrow we celebrate the 243rd birthday of the US Navy, I want to thank all sailors, past and present, for their service and courage defending our great nation. The Navy has endured some of the most difficult tasks and carried out numerous missions critical to the safety and well being our nation. The US Navy transported our soldiers and guided them to the beaches of Normandy under heavy fire on D-day and shifted the momentum of WWII at the battle of Midway, destroying 4 Japanese carriers enabling the U.S. to go on the offensive and eventually onto victory in the war. Our country owes a great debt to the nautical men and women who protect our seas and defend our sovereignty. Happy Birthday US Navy!

Events and presentations for Navy veterans and the USS Texas
                                                                                                                                

Pearl Harbor Survivor presented with overdue Service Medals
 Earlier this year I met Master Chief Petty Officer Bill Hughes, U.S. Navy (Ret.), of Coppell, while working to document his experiences in WWII through the Veterans History Project and to present to him his service medals, which he unfortunately did not receive upon discharge from the U.S. Navy.
MCPO Hughes’ earned the Pearl Harbor Survivor’s Medal, which is awarded to survivors of Pearl Harbor who participated in combat actions against the surprise attack on December 7, 1941. This award was commissioned by Congress in 1990 to be given to those veterans on the 50th anniversary of the attack. 
After conducting a search of his military records and working with the DOD, we were able to acquire his National Defense Service Medal (w/ Bronze star), WWII Victory Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, and Navy Good Conduct Medal. However, I was notified by the Department of Defense that there were no longer any Pearl Harbor Survivors Medals in possession by the DOD, or U.S. Government, to present to him. Upon hearing this my staff and I began communicating with the U.S. Mint, National Personnel Records Center, and U.S. Navy in hopes of finding one last medal to present to MCPO Hughes.
After weeks of searching, the U.S. Navy notified me that they finally located the last un-awarded Pearl Harbor Survivors Medal in existence. I then had the opportunity to present this medal to MCPO Hughes in front of an audience of his family, friends, and fellow veterans who helped to thank him for his service and commemorate this wonderful accomplishment. Please join me in thanking this outstanding veteran for his service.

Justice Kavanaugh's First Day on the Supreme Court
Justice Kavanaugh took the bench for the first time this past Tuesday, receiving a warm welcome from Chief Justice John Roberts per tradition. The high court heard arguments regarding prison sentences for repeat offenders and despite recent tensions and protesting outside the court, it was an amicable and respectful showing for the justices. Justice Kavanaugh's confirmation was a big win for conservatism and protecting our Constitution. I look forward to following the new Supreme Court Justice's career and I want to congratulate him on this tremendous achievement.

Protecting Social Security is one of my highest priorities as your Congressman. More than 200,000 people in our area receive Social Security, and roughly half depend on it as their primary source of income.

I wanted to let you know that the Social Security Administration just announced that benefits will increase 2.8 percent in January of 2019 – the highest Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) in seven years. 

This increase is long overdue after years of little or no growth.

The last six years have been very difficult for seniors who live on fixed incomes. Last year’s COLA was 2 percent, but the year before that it was 0.3 percent and in 2015 it was 0 percent.
 
We must never lose sight that seniors have worked their entire lives so they can retire with the dignity and benefits they have earned.
 
As a senior member of the Social Security Subcommittee in Congress I will continue fighting to protect and strengthen the program for today’s seniors and future generations.

Social Security and Medicare are two of government’s most successful programs, and we need to do everything possible to keep them strong and solvent. 

Please let me know if you or anyone you know depends on Social Security.

Dear Lindsey, 
The past couple of weeks have proven to be very busy, but I wanted to take the time to update you onour recent work in Washington, D.C. and the 15th District of Texas. 
It is an honor to serve as your congressman. 
As we continue to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, I would like to thank the 1.2 million Hispanics currently serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. Join me in celebrating the many more Hispanics working in our school districts, medical field, and law enforcement in the 15th District of Texas!
￼ 

Recently, Northern District Director Albert Martinez attended the grand opening and ribbon-cutting ceremony for Brick’s Hardware and Feed Store in Benavides, Texas. The 15th District of Texas has proven, time and time again, to be a suitable host for small businesses. I look forward to the many successes of Brick’s and the support it willprovide local agribusiness.
￼ 
Recently, I stood before a very remarkable group of individuals on a day that neither they, nor I, will ever forget – the day that they became American citizens. It was truly an honor to speak atlast week’sNew Citizenship Ceremony in McAllen, Texas and to welcome them as neighbors, educators, and innovators. To my newly minted fellow Americans – welcome home. 
￼ 
Recently, I presented the Martinez family with Congressional Record honoring the life of their late son, Javier A. Martinez. Mr. Martinez was only 11-years-old when he was tragically diagnosed with Ewings Sarcoma but he was a fighter. Stories of Javier’s strength and courage have inspired me, and I thank him for being a role model for every resident in the 15th District of Texas. Javier, I will continue to work in Congress, on your behalf, to bring more federal funding to research and studies to put an end to this disease. Godspeed, my friend.
￼ 
While I am pleased to see the U.S., Mexico, and Canada reach a deal on the U.S.–Mexico-Canada Agreement, I believe we missed an opportunity to address a key barrier and cost to doing business in Mexico: insecurity. We must make this a top priority as we engage with the incoming Mexican Administration.

On Tuesday, I joined Congressman Filemon Vela (TX-34) to announce that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has moved forward on a remediation plan for the Donna Canal and Reservoir Superfund site. This will improve the health of residents in Donna, Texas, and surrounding communities.

￼ 
Recently, I cosponsored H.R. 1017, the Removing Barriers to Colorectal Cancer Screening Act of 2017. This bill helps eliminate unexpected costs for Medicare beneficiaries when a polyp is discovered and removed. Thank you to fellow Texansfrom Seguin, Brownsville, Laredoand elsewhere for your advocacy.

The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) = jobs in the 15th District of Texas. Therefore, it will remain my mission to be vocal about NAFTA 2.0, or the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and work to ensure that Central and South Texas remains protected and profitable as the process moves forward.

￼ 
On Tuesday, I highlighted a new Associated Press report showing soaring prescription drug prices. Little is being done to fix America’s prescription drug market. Millions of families, senior citizens, and sick Americans only continue to see rising prescription drug prices.
I pledge to reversethis unacceptable trend and lower prescription drug prices For The People. I encourage all Members of Congress to support A Better Deal to Lower the Cost of Prescription Drug Prices which would create a new “price gouging” enforcer to stop outrageous behavior in its tracks, allow Medicare Part D to negotiate drug prices and require drug manufacturers to publicly release hard data and information justifying any significant price increase.

￼ 
On Thursday, October 11, 2018, I announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Rural Development program has awarded a $174,857 grant for the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV). It is my belief that every person in rural Texas deserves the same access to economic opportunity and long-term financial stability as people living in urban communities. I thank the USDA for providing women and Hispanics in our region with the tools necessary to harness their skills and talents. UTRGV will serve as the vehicle to provide technical assistance to these folks, and I thank the university for leading such efforts. I will continue to work to ensure that the door remains open for all people to be able to pioneer their own success. Read more here by clicking here. 
Friday, October 12, 2018 was National Farmer’s Day. The 15th District of Texas boasts over 4.3 million acres of farm land and 8,000 farming operations that make us more competitive in local, state, national, and global markets. During my first term in Congress, I have worked to give farmers and farmworkers the resources they need to thrive. And as we continue to face crop and cattle diseases, droughts and flooding, labor shortages, and other issues, I am working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and other federal agencies to ensure that Central and South Texans are heard and have access to whatever assistance they may need.
￼ 
As always, please let me know if there is anything I can do to better serve you. To contact any of my offices in South Texas or in Washington, D.C. click the ""contact me"" icon above.   
Please click “sign up for my newsletter” to register for updates to learn more about how I am serving the 15th District of Texas. I look forward to seeing you soon in Washington or back in Texas.

A NEW SUPREME COURT JUSTICE Last Saturday, the Senate voted to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. He was sworn in by President Trump on Monday night. Judge Kavanaugh’s fortitude and resilience throughout his confirmation process is beyond admirable. His commitment to the rule of law, justice, and the Constitution will serve this country well while he sits on the bench for the many years ahead. My congratulations to Judge Kavanaugh on his confirmation to the United States Supreme Court. There is no one more qualified or more deserving to serve on the highest court in the land.
DISCUSSING JUSTICE KAVANAUGH ON FOX BUSINESS On Monday, I joined Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business to talk about the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the Trump effect on our communities and our economy.

MOBILE OFFICE STOPS FOR VETERANS  
￼
In the Second District, I have offices located in Claremore, Muskogee, and McAlester. However, I understand that many constituents don’t live near one of my offices, or don’t have the time to travel to one. Our veterans deserve first-class service no matter where they live. That’s why I’m sending my veterans caseworker to you so that a member of my team can assist you in your own town.
Members of my staff will stop in five southeastern counties in OK-2 this month. The stops below are coming up next week. Visit my website to see the full list of dates and locations. Stop by if my team can help you!

McCurtain County Mobile Office Stop Thursday, October 18, 2018 1:00PM – 4:00PM CT American Legion Post 501 NW Veterans Dr. Idabel, OK 74745  
VISITING WITH OKLAHOMANS I was able to tour Home2Suites in Muskogee, which is a property associated with the Oklahoma Hotel and Lodging Association. I got to meet and speak with many employees onsite. The Oklahoma Hotel and Lodging Association provides employment for nearly 24,000 Oklahomans, representing more than 200 lodging operators and members in the state. Associations like these are providing great opportunities for economic growth across our state.  
￼
I met with Nelita Cash of the Alzheimer’s Association to discuss current topics and legislation relating to Alzheimer’s disease. As a member of the Alzheimer’s Caucus, it is important to me to keep informed on what those impacted have to say and see how we can help from a federal level.  
￼
Enjoyed visiting with Drushane Teehee and her family.  
￼
Thanks to members of Direct Traffic Control who stopped by my Muskogee office for a meeting to talk about improving infrastructure in Oklahoma.  
￼

I had the chance to talk to Ken Snyder, a U.S. Army Veteran, about his difficulties and frustrations with the VA appeals process. If we can help you or a veteran you know with problems with the VA, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

￼

Thank you to Vallourec Star for the tour of their production facility in Muskogee. Manufacturing plays a vital role in our economy and I am grateful to the team at Vallourec Star for showing me around and sharing their thoughts about the new trade deal between the United States, Mexico, and Canada.  
￼

I was able to talk with students at the College of the Muscogee Nation and at OSUIT this week. I updated them on current happenings in D.C., and then engaged in a Q&A with them afterwards.

￼

Nice to have a discussion over lunch at OSUIT.

I toured Tiger Mountain Recovery facility in Henryetta. It was great to speak with Leah Ledford about updates on the latest opioid package and more on patient safety.

￼
It was an honor to be the keynote speaker at the NAHB Area 11 Leadership Conference. I talked to the attendees about the importance of leadership and how important those aspects are in Congress.  
￼
I wasn't able to meet with these members of FCCLA since I wasn't in Washington this week, but I'm glad to see they were still able to get a great tour of the U.S. Capitol!

Friend, 
Since day one in Congress, I made supporting Sandy Victims and all South Jersey residents during a natural disaster a top priority. In the immediate aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, we saw families and business owners struggle to rebuild their lives and the federal government fail them. 
That’s why I introduced legislation to address issues many South Jersey families faced when dealing with FEMA and other federal disaster aid programs. 
ENACTED INTO LAW: Disaster Assistance Fairness for Sandy Victims 
Following Superstorm Sandy, the federal government made it difficult for some in our community to recover because of the actions of a few bad actors. Before my provision was enacted into law, FEMA could change their mind on disaster assistance grants and make disaster victims pay back previously awarded disaster assistance, sometimes years after the award. This happened to many South Jersey residents after Sandy and I am grateful I am in the position to stop this practice once and for all. 
ENACTED INTO LAW: Greater Access to Federal Disaster Aid for South Jersey Residents 
The federal government should make it easier, not harder for those who have just gone through a natural disaster. I championed a policy that allows Small Business Administration (SBA) loan recipients to also be eligible for FEMA disaster aid grants. The last thing families should have to worry about is whether taking an SBA loan will disqualify them for FEMA disaster grants that become available later on. Now, the president can waive the duplication of benefits during a federally declared disaster, allowing disaster victims to have both loans and other forms of federal aids available to them.
I won’t ever be blinded by partisanship and I refuse to take part in the partisan dysfunction that prevents progress. The nonpartisan Lugar Center at Georgetown University recently named me again among the most bipartisan members of Congress, because I work against Washington dysfunction and stand up for Burlington and Ocean Counties. If I can ever be of any assistance, please visit my website or contact my office: http://macarthur.house.gov.

Weekly Review
 



October 8

Trade in the Lowcountry: About a month ago now, I made it a point to attend the grand opening of the new Mercedes Benz plant in Ladson. It was neat to be there and see the ways in which the plant had grown since I was at a ribbon cutting years ago as governor.
At that time, bizarre trade requirements dictated that they build the Sprinter van in Germany, disassemble it, ship it to Charleston...and then reassemble it for sale in the domestic United States. Talk about a waste of money and time!
But that was the most we could do based on the tariffs that were in place, and it did get our foot in the door with regard to production. Demand has grown from 8,559 units in 2010 to 28,519 units by 2015, and they’ve moved past the break-even point in dealing with tariffs so that they could go ahead with production.
So, I guess last month’s celebration is a reminder of two things. Click here to read more.

Big News of the Week: The political world was shocked today by news of Nikki Haley’s upcoming resignation.
It’s a reminder of how we can never say never in life. Life indeed is a world of perpetual surprises and new wrinkles, and given her success as US Ambassador to the United Nations, this certainly surprised everyone.
In its wake, I’m left with a couple of different thoughts.
One, I wish her well. By all accounts, she’s risen to the challenges that that UN posting brought with it and, accordingly, proved her critics wrong. You may remember at the beginning of her tenure, some had suggested that because she had only been governor of South Carolina, this international posting was beyond her resume. That’s positively not the case. It’s the reverse. If you’ve been governor of South Carolina, a posting like the UN position is relatively simple in form compared to all the moving parts that come with different political bodies, a cabinet, tens of thousands of state employees, and the whirlwind that is South Carolina politics. Click here to read more.

Military Academy Nomination Deadline: It’s hard to believe, but we are just nine days away from our service academy application deadline on Friday, October 19th. While we currently have a host of applications here at the office, I don’t want any interested high school juniors or seniors to miss the incredible leadership and academic opportunity that the service academies represent.
In fact, I can’t say enough about the quality of the training received by students at these academies. You obviously have impressive young people entering these institutions, but these students find themselves in a setting where they’re no longer first or top in the class but rather participants in a world wherein every one of their peers were the same. In this regard, iron sharpens iron, and the bearing, demeanor, and impressiveness of the students I’ve seen graduate is none other than inspiring.
For those unfamiliar with the process, my office has the chance to nominate a number of students from the First District to attend four of the five national military academies each year: West Point, the United States Naval Academy, the US Air Force Academy, and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. While admission is determined by each academy, graduating students must have the recommendation of a Member of Congress to be considered. The opportunity to attend a service academy comes with a commitment to serve in the military for a minimum of five years upon graduation.
For more information and to see the application, visit my website at the link below…. And if you happen to know of any high school juniors or seniors who might be interested, my simple ask would be that you share this post or maybe tag them in a comment below!

New Ethanol Standard: Earlier this week at a rally in Iowa, President Trump announced that he’s pushing to raise the ethanol content of year-round sales of gasoline from 10% to 15%. Currently, the higher ethanol-blend gasoline is not allowed for summer sales, based on its impact with smog and the environment of the warmer months of the year.
This is horrible policy at two different levels.
One, the EPA restriction is there for a reason, given the smog consequence in places like Atlanta, New York City, or Los Angeles. Making bad air worse during the summer months doesn’t seem like good policy.
Two, it continues to make our country less efficient with regard to the fuel that we burn. While it’s certainly pure pandering to the corn belt and to Iowa voters, it’s not good for the country as a whole. And at some point, we’ve got to get back to policy that watches out for the whole of our nation rather than particular voting blocks.
The ethanol industry has been propped up by taxpayer dollars to the tune of about $45 billion in subsidies over roughly the last thirty years. Former US Senator Tom Coburn made this a particular crusade in looking at both the subsidy in ethanol and the inefficiency that it brought to internal combustion engines of all sorts. Click here to read more.

The Reconstruction Era National Historical Park Act: Last month, the House passed H.R. 5532, the Reconstruction Era National Historical Park Act, which will redesignate Beaufort’s Reconstruction Era National Monument as a Historical Park and allow for the creation of a national “Historic Network.” This bill will build upon the recently created park that celebrates South Carolina’s importance in our nation’s Reconstruction era by celebrating locations like the Camp Saxton Site in Port Royal, the Brick Baptist Church, and the Penn School.
Outside of the historical significance that this bill attempts to commemorate, highlight, and protect, here are a few things that are important about this bill that Rep. Clyburn and I passed through the House.
One, it’s going about the protection of land in the right way. I believe that the Antiquities Act has been abused by Republicans and Democrats alike. It has shifted power from the legislative body, which should control the purse strings of our country, to the executive branch so that a president can by proclamation protect areas of our country. Doing so is at odds with the legislative tug of war that our Founding Fathers intended when we go to committing your and my financial resources as taxpayers. So though protection of Penn Center began with President Obama’s use of the Antiquities Act, this bill attempted to codify what happened there with actual legislation. And I believe that’s the right way to protect natural and historic resources of our country. Click here to read more.

￼


Dear Friend,  This week our country saw great devastation rip through the South. My thoughts and prayers continue to be with our fellow Americans who lost their homes, personal belongings, and for some, family or friends because of Hurricane Michael. America stands with you during this tragic time. My thoughts and prayers are also with the first responders who continue to work day and night to keep their communities safe. And with the utility and transportation teams in the area who are working around the clock to reopen roads and restore power to the areas affected by this catastrophic storm.  Social Security Beneficiaries  The Social Security Administration announced this week that due to changes in the cost of living throughout the country, monthly benefits will be increased by 2.8 percent beginning December 2018.  Wins for the American People  This week, the President signed three very important pieces of legislation into law. Having served in law enforcement for 33 years, I was proud to see the Justice Served Act signed into law, which I cosponsored. This bill addresses the growing backlog of violent crime cases involving DNA evidence, ensuring criminals receive the justice they deserve for their crimes. It also brings much-needed closure to victims and their families.  The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act and the Know the Lowest Price Act were also signed into law this week. These two bills are an important step in helping improve transparency in drug pricing for patients across the country.  American Flags and Tours of Washington, DC  Constituents of Washington’s 8th District looking to book tours in Washington, DC or order U.S. flags from my office must submit their requests before November 15th. Any requests after this date and before 2019 can be submitted to one of the Washington Senators Patty Murray or Maria Cantwell.  Discussing Today’s Top Issues  It was good to see Paul Benz and his friends with the Faith Action Network. They stopped by to discuss immigration and the farm bill.

Putting ""America First"" in our Trade Deals
President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised to put “America First” in his policies, and there is a lot of evidence he is delivering on that promise. Earlier this year, the President announced he was willing to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada unless Mexico and Canada renegotiated terms of the agreement. The President also warned those countries they could be subjected to tariffs if trade talks fail. Last week, President Trump announced a renegotiated arrangement that had been agreed to by all three countries, which he is referring to as the USMCA (the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement). I am glad our countries were able to find common ground, and it appears the new agreement will enhance American businesses’ ability to compete. I look forward to carefully reviewing this agreement when it is brought up in Congress for a vote. 
I support free trade, but agree with the President that trade must be fair also. I watched as my father lost his manufacturing job to a factory in Mexico, and I still hear all too often similar stories from people across the First District of Tennessee. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is 24 years old and was in need of modernization. However, I also have talked to a lot of businesses and farmers throughout the First District in the past several months who were concerned about an escalating trade war with our neighbors, and the need to maintain access to markets throughout North America. One of the greatest benefits of this deal will be the stability it provides to thousands of East Tennessee workers whose businesses rely on both free and fair trade.  
The announced framework of the USMCA appears to benefit American manufacturers and farmers; protect intellectual property; and ensure safe working conditions for laborers. East Tennessee has worked hard to rebuild our manufacturing sector and any agreement must not only maintain those gains, but also ensure further growth. For example, in East Tennessee, the motor and equipment manufacturing industry employs over 4,200 individuals – these are good-paying jobs that support a middle class family. I firmly believe we should encourage growth of these job opportunities for American workers.  
Canada and Mexico are our first- and third-largest export markets for U.S. food and agricultural products, making up 28 percent of total food and agriculture exports in 2017, while supporting 325,000 American jobs. That’s why it’s particularly good news for our farmers that the updated arrangement will maintain strong markets where they sell their goods.  
Some of the other benefits of the agreement that President Trump and his administration have negotiated are removing provisions from NAFTA that are no longer relevant; discouraging the practice of offshoring jobs while creating opportunities for additional auto manufacturing in the U.S.; and ensuring more market access for our farmers. Specifically, this deal should increase access to the Canadian market for our dairy farmers, many of whom are right in East Tennessee. Canada is also providing full access for other U.S. dairy products, eggs and poultry to be sold in their market. This is great to hear, particularly after so much turmoil earlier this year for many of the dairy farmers in East Tennessee 
I look forward to carefully reviewing the USMCA and learning more about how it affects East Tennesseans. I also hope this agreement will provide momentum to complete trade discussions with other countries, notably Europe, to continue the great economy we have right now. 
My door is always open to East Tennesseans. Feel free to contact my office if I can be of assistance to you or your family.

Lowest unemployment rate since 1969



Dear Friend: 
Welcome to your weekly update. As always, you can learn more about these and other legislative issue at my website: upton.house.gov. 
Lowest unemployment rate since 1969
September’s job report showed sustained economic growth and a strong labor market fueled by pro-growth tax cuts and regulatory reform.
This past month, 134,000 jobs were created and the unemployment rate fell to 3.7% the lowest rate since 1969. 
Recently, the House passed the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act which would make tax cuts permanent for middle class families and small businesses across Southwestern Michigan and help individuals save for their future and have retirement security. 
To learn more about my work on tax reform, please click here. 
Supporting innovative PFAS research
This week, I sent a letter to the Acting Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) expressing support of a research proposal being developed by doctors at Western Michigan University and Michigan State University. 
The research being done at Western Michigan University and Michigan State University is vital to our understanding of plumes of contaminates and how they affect residents around them. 
It is critical that we are able to alleviate some of the major data and knowledge gaps regarding the PFAS sites with the highest levels of contamination. 
To read the full letter, please click here. 
Learn more about my work on this PFAS issue here.
Back in Southwest Michigan
With no votes in the House this week, I am home in Southwest Michigan. 
October 10th was International Walk to School Day and I was happy to join students at El Sol Elementary in Kalamazoo for their morning commute to promote a healthy lifestyle, a cleaner environment, pedestrian safety, and a strong sense of community. 
I was able to celebrate the Seita Scholars Program at Western Michigan University, met with veterans at Van Buren County Project Connect and Veteran’s Stand Down in Hartford, and attended the Red Bud Motocross of Nations Event in Buchanan. I also visited the Kalamazoo Metro for a facility tour to highlight the $2.8 million grant we announced that will go towards modernizing the Central Transportation Authority’s fleet of fixed-route buses which provides nearly 3 million rides annually. Just to name a few!

10/13/18 9:02,News and Updates from Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett,"￼ 
  
October 2018   
Disaster Related Unemployment Assistance Extended for USVI



This week, Stacey introduced the Plaskett Amendment to the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. The Amendment provides for an additional 26 weeks’ worth of unemployment assistance to Virgin Islanders who lost employment as a result of hurricanes Irma and Maria. The extension is retroactive from the time of expiration in late March, up to 52 weeks after each disaster declaration for Hurricanes Irma and Maria. It amounts to the longest Disaster Unemployment Assistance period ever extended by Congress. An extension of disaster-related unemployment assistance is critical to Virgin Islanders who work in the industries most impacted by the devastation of hurricanes Irma and Maria and will serve as a much-needed lifeline for many Virgin Islands families.

Addressing the Needs of the USVI's Public Education System in Congress

Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett with 
St. Croix AFT President Rosa Soto-Thomas,

Carol Callwood, (far right).
Recently, Stacey and other Democratic Members of the House Education and Workforce Committee hosted a forum to examine whether recovery efforts in the U.S. Virgin Islands were meeting the needs of local students, parents, and educators. At the forum, Rosa Soto-Thomas, President of AFT Local 1826 and Carol Callwood, President of AFT Local 1825 presented compelling testimony regarding the needs of the students and teachers of the territory. Before the forum, Stacey visited local schools as they opened for the new school year, and shared what she saw at those schools during the forum and at a press conference held outside the Capitol Building. View the full press conference here.  
Military Service Academy Information


The deadline to apply for a nomination to one of the U.S. Military Academies is October 31. Stacey encourages all Virgin Islands students who meet the eligibility requirements and are interested totake advantage of this opportunity! You can contact the district offices in both St. Thomas and St. Croix for more information. 340-774-4408 (STT) and 340-778-5900 (STX). Download a nomination packet here.

Upcoming Town Hall Meetings with the National Park Service



This month, Stacey will host two town hall meetings with the National Park Service in St. Croix and St. John. The first town hall is scheduled for 6:00 pm Tuesday, October 16 and will be held in the Danish West India & Guinea Company Warehouse (Old Post Office) in Christiansted, St. Croix. The second town hall is scheduled for 6:00 pm Wednesday, October 17 and will be held in the Cleone Creque Legislative Conference Room in Cruz Bay, St. John. Both town halls will focus on CUA opportunities, business concessions, park entrance fee structures, and employment opportunities, with particular focus paid to the Slave Wreck Project on St. Croix and road access through the park in St. John. 

FEMA Awards $42 Million in Hurricane Recovery Grant Funding to the Water and Power Authority




Stacey announced recently that the territory is slated to receive four grants totaling over $42 million toward the post hurricanes Irma and Maria rebuilding effort. The grants come through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and will go to the V.I. Water and Power Authority for contracted power debris removal throughout the islands of St. Thomas, St. John and Water Island as a result of Hurricane Maria.

10/13/18 9:02,Tariffs,"News from Representative Crawford 
￼ 
￼   ￼   ￼   ￼   ￼   ￼   
￼
Tariffs
China has repeatedly demonstrated an inability to play by the rules of international trade. Following the United State’s decision to respond to unfair Chinese trade practices, President Xi had an opportunity to  make simple, fair reforms and fully integrate China into the international market. Instead, China implemented retaliatory tariffs. 

On a level playing field, the US can compete and mutually benefit from trade with any other country. However, China’s retaliatory tariffs are precision crafted to harm American firms and consumers. Congress and the Administration must establish a formal exclusion process to allow US companies to seek relief if there is no alternative to Chinese suppliers or if other special circumstances exist. The process must be fact-based, and have stringent but reasonable criteria for companies to meet for exclusion. 

Exclusions exist and have been successful for the first 2 rounds of tariffs, so there is no reason not to continue the policy with the most recent list of products. This week, 130 of my colleagues and I asked the US Trade Representative to create an exclusion process for American companies so that these tariffs do not weaken America’s competitive advantage in key industries.
 
FAQ (What folks have been calling/texting my office about this week)
Q: What's the latest update on the Farm Bill?  A: It's no secret that our farmer's need a farm bill to ensure security at a job that comes with a lot  of uncertainty and risk. Two versions of the Farm Bill currently sit at a committee made up of both Senators and Congressman as they hash out the differences between the two. Many things are delaying the process which I've discussed in a previous newsletter as well as in this interview with KASU.

Helena puts hope in Civil War, music histories for tourism spur

A Civil Rights Park is being planned near Freedom Park, Miller said. U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Jonesboro, has agreed to bring the park proposal before a congressional committee. If it survives the committee process, it will be voted on by Congress, he said. How long it will take and how much it will cost are not known, he added.
“Our thoughts are that a civil rights park would be a natural fit,” he said.

McKinley Talks Workforce, Economic Growth With Local Businesses 
This past week we have traveled across the district to meet with several companies to discuss how the government and local businesses can work together to face economic challenges. We continue to discuss ways to create more jobs , increase production and manufacturing, combat the opioid epidemic, and incentivize workforce training for the people of West Virginia. After all, these businesses are vital for our economy and our communities. There is a lot of optimism about things turning around for our state.  Click on the following to read more about our meetings:   Rep.

President Trump Signs Bills to Lower Drug Prices
This week we were glad to see President Donald Trump signed two bills at the White House aimed at lowering pharmaceutical drug prices by promoting greater disclosure in drug pricing.

On my weekly ""Capitol Hill Report,"" I spoke with Darin Svenson of KDEC in Decorah and Eric Vansickle from Waverly Newspapers about Justice Brett Kavanaugh, E15 and the Farm Bill.  
Q&A: E15 Year-Round
Q. What is the Renewable Fuel Standard? Q. Why is the Trump administration's E15 announcement good for the Iowa economy? 
Quick Links
The Senate confirmed Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in a 50-48 vote. Justice Kavanaugh was one of the most qualified nominees in history. His 12 years of experience on the most important federal circuit court in America proved that he was unquestionably qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. Justice Kavanaugh has a lifetime of public service, teaching, coaching and volunteering. He also stands out as a devoted husband and father. Justice Kavanaugh will serve the Supreme Court and the American people honorably.

Opening the door for year-round sales of higher blends of ethanol is a victory for farmers, Rural America and the nation as a whole. Allowing an open marketplace with more fuel options for consumers encourages competition, drives down consumer fuel costs and is good for the environment. It also maintains and creates jobs in parts of the country that need them most and decreases America’s dependence on foreign oil. I want to thank President Trump for his leadership and for keeping his promise to the farmers and agricultural workers in Iowa and throughout the nation. 
Senator Joni Ernst and I joined Senate colleagues in sending a letter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urging them to investigate and respond to recent cases a serious nervous system condition that causes polio-like symptoms in patiences, such as weak muscles. Because the causes of this condition are unknown, we urge the CDC to provide more information immediately about preventive measures and treatments.
President Donald Trump nominated Iowan Douglas J. Strike to serve as the United States Marshal for the Northern District of Iowa after a joint recommendation from Senator Ernst and me. Mr. Strike has served Iowa as a law enforcement officer for more than 34 years, most recently as the Chief of Police for the Iowa Falls Police Department. His exemplary record will continue to serve the people of Iowa well in this new role. I thank President Trump for carefully considering our recommendations and making such an outstanding selection.
The Missing Children’s Assistance Act of 2018, which I authored, was signed into law. This legislation extends and updates programs that make resources available to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) for the continued fight against child abduction and exploitation. Organizations like the NCMEC provide families, caregivers, schools and other community leaders with critical support to prevent and respond to child exploitation.

A message from Senator Thom Tillis 
￼ 





Pastor Brunson Released From Prison  
 ￼
North Carolina native Pastor Brunson is on his way home to the United States, where he will be reunited with his family. While the Brunson family has been caught in the middle of a diplomatic and political nightmare for the last two years, their unwavering optimism and faith kept them strong during this very difficult and stressful time. Despite the anguish Pastor Brunson has had to endure locked away in prison with his fate uncertain, I was personally inspired when I watched him stand up in a Turkish courtroom during his trial – facing an effective lifetime sentence – and announce that he harbored no animosity or bitterness towards the individuals who falsely accused him. That is a testament to his incredible character and devotion to the principles of his faith, which he shared with the Turkish people for more than twenty years.  
When I first met with Pastor Brunson in a Turkish prison earlier this spring, he told me his greatest fear was that the American government would accept the indictment and forget about him. I told him we would never allow that to happen, and over the last several months, Americans from every corner of the country have prayed for his release, and leaders from both parties have worked together behind the scenes. Securing Pastor Brunson’s release was truly a bipartisan, all-hands-on-deck effort. I’m grateful for the efforts of President Trump, the State Department, and my colleagues in the Senate. We pursued a number of diplomatic and policy channels that kept the pressure on. The Turkish Government ultimately made the right decision, which will undoubtedly help improve U.S.-Turkey relations moving forward. While the outcome took longer than anyone would have liked, Pastor Brunson is finally coming back home as a free man.

Dear Friend,  From the interstate highway system to the Erie Canal, the transcontinental railroad to the Hoover Dam, infrastructure projects have transformed our nation, lifted our spirits, and caused the world to marvel at the incredible ingenuity of America.  As your representative, it is my duty to ensure that the guardrails of community, prosperity, health, and security are maintained.  Robust, reliable, innovative, cost-effective, and often aesthetically breathtaking infrastructure plays a critical role in achieving these ends.  Our government recently initiated some necessary infrastructure projects that directly affect Nebraska.  After a long process, including intense interactions with various heads of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) across several administrations, I’m happy to report that Lincoln’s historic VA campus has been chosen as the location for a new state-of-the art VA clinic.  This is an important victory for the economic regeneration of a unique historic property.  It arrives subsequent to a similarly successful public-private partnership to expand, improve, and innovate at the Omaha VA Medical Center.  Nebraska continues to lead the nation with creative public-private partnerships to assist our veterans.  As a critical part of our national defense infrastructure, the Air Force’s 55th Wing conducts surveillance, intelligence, reconnaissance, and United States Strategic Command cyber missions from the Offutt Air Force Base in Bellevue.  Among its several dozen airplanes is the OC-135B, which fly in critical support of the Open Skies Treaty, a 34-member global agreement that enables unarmed observation of signatory compliance with international nuclear arms agreements, particularly that of the Russian Federation.  To ensure continued successful oversight of treaty compliance, I recently joined with members of the Nebraska Congressional delegation to secure funding for the OC-135B Aircraft Replacement Program as part of the 2019 Defense Appropriations Act.  One plane is funded for 2019; another will be funded in 2020.  The replacement of these aircraft is vital to our national defense strategy.  Their advanced age and maintenance issues had impacted the Air Force’s ability to fully execute the mission of the Open Skies Treaty—one of the last remaining functional arms control regimes between the U.S. and the Russian Federation.  On the heels of a new headquarters for United States Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base, work is also underway to repair the Offutt runway.  As part of this effort, the Lincoln Airport will soon begin infrastructure improvements to pave the way for intelligence-gathering aircraft from the Air Force’s 55th Wing while the Offutt runway is rebuilt.  Along with other improvements, the Lincoln Airport’s maintenance hangar will be expanded to accommodate the larger military aircraft.  Once the Offutt runway project is completed in December, 2020, the improved facilities will be returned to the Lincoln Airport for its ongoing use.  Other recent infrastructure accomplishments concern civilian aviation.  Late last week, the President signed into law the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act, which the House passed late last month.  The bill authorized funding for the FAA for five years and makes several changes designed to help airline passengers.  This is a big bill, but even small things can matter in it.  The community of Columbus brought to my attention a particularly local problem.  And we offered an amendment that allowed the Columbus Airport to use their fair share of federal funding to fix something that seems silly: Snow removal equipment bought with local funds could not be housed in federally financed facilities.  Now the Columbus Airport has access to funding for a new, much larger storage facility.  One of the more colorful characters in our nation, Elon Musk, who sort of runs Tesla I guess, and has all kinds of other Iron Man visions for the world, spends a lot of sleepless nights dreaming about the future of infrastructure.  In the meantime, as Mr. Musk figures out a way to get us to the moon, let’s make sure the everyday stuff works well on earth.    Sincerely, ￼  Congressman Jeff Fortenberry

Pastor Brunson released!
￼
Pastor Andrew Brunson. Photo: www.uscirf.gov
What's new:  Earlier today, Andrew Brunson, a Christian pastor from the United States, was released from house arrest in Turkey and is free to return home after being unjustly detained for over two years. This is great news and I applaud President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their work to help secure his release. I also have long pressured the Turkish government to free Pastor Brunson as no evidence substantiated any of the alleged terrorism charges against him. Pastor Brunson’s release was long overdue, and I hope he can return to the U.S. as quickly as possible.  Why it matters:   Pastor Brunson’s release is important as it demonstrates the Trump Administration’s continued commitment to religious freedom at home and abroad. It further highlights the need to continue to advocate and work hard to secure the release of other Americans and prisoners currently detained for exercising their freedom of religion. The freedom to practice your religion without a fear of persecution is a human right that knows no borders and the United States must hold governments around the world accountable when those inalienable and universal rights are infringed upon. 
What’s next:
Pastor Brunson is returning to North Carolina. And whether it’s in Turkey, China, or elsewhere around the globe, I will continue to be a strong advocate for supporting religious freedom at home and abroad.

Do you believe the Free Exercise of Religion is a fundamental human right?

In the Wake of Tragedy, Schoharie Residents Unite
The tragic limo accident in Schoharie shocked the conscience of our Upstate New York communities. My prayers are with all who were impacted by this horrific accident, including the families and friends that lost loved ones and the emergency personnel that responded to the scene.
On Wednesday evening, I joined members of the Schoharie community who gathered to remember the 20 innocent lives lost and to thank the brave first-responders for their service. Resilience is a thread that runs through this community. In a time of great sadness, our neighbors in Schoharie have come together with unity and strength to support each other and to honor the legacies of those they’ve lost.

￼

Working to Increase Transparency and Lower Costs for Patients
On Wednesday, President Trump signed two bills into law to prohibit pharmacy “gag clauses.” These gag clauses have severely distorted prescription costs by preventing pharmacists from telling patients about cheaper drug options. Signing this bipartisan legislation will increase transparency and lower healthcare costs for consumers.   I helped to pass these important bills in the House, and I will continue to work to remove barriers to affordable, quality care for our seniors and families in Upstate New York. You can read more about this legislation here: https://nbcnews.to/2CEPBWm

U.S. Thwarts Chinese Espionage
“China has for years used spycraft and cyberattacks to steal American corporate, academic and military information to bolster its growing economic power and political influence.”
China continues to develop its economy and influence by swindling American innovation. By charging a Chinese agent with economic espionage and extraditing him to the U.S. to stand trial, we are taking an important step in halting China’s dangerous activity. 
You can read more here: https://nyti.ms/2PskhNj

Meeting with MAMCO Precision Molding in Oneonta
Earlier this week, I joined the team at MAMCO Precision Molding to tour their state-of-the-art facilities in Oneonta. MAMCO is a leading custom plastic injection molder, with clients in New York State, across the U.S., and around the world. In addition to manufacturing parts for various industries, including automotive and aerospace, MAMCO also produces cutting-edge anti-microbial maple spouts used in maple sugaring operations.   As Upstate New Yorkers, we value fresh, high quality local maple syrup and recognize the importance of our state's growing maple industry. These spouts help prevent bacterial growth, which leads to increased sap yields and syrup production.

￼

￼

Concerns with Expanded Ethanol Sales
President Trump recently proposed removing restrictions on the sale of gasoline with 15-percent ethanol (E15) to expand the sale of E15 year-round. Currently, the sale of E15 is prohibited during the summer months due to concerns that it will produce more smog in hotter temperatures. 
I am opposed to this expansion. When ethanol is mixed with gasoline, it draws moisture into the fuel system which accelerates corrosion and fouls many engines - we should not be adding more. I am also concerned that this increased amount will result in emission levels that will exceed the Clean Air Act during the summer months and that is unacceptable.
Read more about the directive here: https://bit.ly/2CGHQ27

Working to Minimize Impact of Soaring Recycling Costs
Restrictive changes to recycling standards by the Chinese government have had serious impacts on local recycling agencies across Upstate New York. Costs have soared, and these agencies are left with few options. Columbia County, for example, is considering a resolution to allow the county Solid Waste Department to charge a $50 fee for those who utilize its recycling services to offset the rising costs associated with processing recyclables.
I have been working with local leaders to address this issue and urged U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to intervene during ongoing trade negotiations to ensure that we have a cost-effective way of removing recyclable materials. You can read the letter I sent to Ambassador Lighthizer here: https://bit.ly/2OW5gpS
Additional information about the proposed fee hike in Columbia County can be found here: https://bit.ly/2QMANrL

Delivering Books to Stamford Village Library
Reading is an important way in which we expand our knowledge, boost our creativity, and foster a lifelong love of learning. I had the pleasure of stopping by the Stamford Village Library this week to deliver books my office collected through the Library of Congress' Surplus Book Program.  The Surplus Book Program allows for the donation of books from the Library of Congress to public libraries, schools, and museums, as well as to other nonprofit organizations and government offices. This is a great program that allows local schools and libraries to continue to build their book collections at no cost to them. 
Library Manager, Pat Parks, and members of the Board of Trustees were kind enough to show me around and discuss the many programs the library offers to the greater Stamford community.

Social Security Beneficiaries to Receive Significant COLA Bump in 2019
The Social Security Administration announced a 2.8 percent cost of living adjustment (COLA) for 2019 – the largest increase in seven years. With over 60 million beneficiaries on Social Security, these benefits often serve as a financial lifeline for our seniors in Upstate New York. As estimates show that over 15 million seniors rely on their social security benefits to stay out of poverty, it’s important that their payments continue to adequately reflect the cost of living. 
I am working with my colleagues in the House on thoughtful and effective long-term solutions to ensure the continuation of this important program. I am an original cosponsor of H.R. 3423, the Social Security Commission Act of 2017, legislation that would create a committee to advise Congress on guaranteeing the strength and stability of Social Security for the next 75 years.
You can read more about the 2019 COLA adjustment here: https://on.mktw.net/2RKlIrI
If you or anyone you know is having difficulties with social security benefits, my office may be able to help. Feel free to call my Kinderhook District Office at (518) 610-8133 and my staff will be available to assist you.  

Next Week: Dutchess County Veterans Resource Fair
On October 20th, I am hosting a Veterans Resource Fair at the Pleasant Valley Town Hall, located at 1554 Main Street in Pleasant Valley. At this event, local veterans can learn about important opportunities and resources available to them. They will have the chance to meet and speak with representatives from community outreach programs as well as from county, state, and federal agencies.

One of my greatest priorities as your Representative is to ensure veterans have access to the benefits earned through their brave and heroic service to our country. Should you have any questions about this event, please feel free to contact my office at (845) 514-2322.

NEWS FROM THE FIRST DISTRICT
Dear Friends, 
We got some very good news across the state this week. I was pleased to announce that several organizations and cities across New Hampshire will be receiving resources from multiple federal agencies to help support victims of sexual violence, secure our schools, and help children impacted by the opioid crisis. The City of Manchester will also be receiving nearly $1.6 million to prepare students for postsecondary education. 
The week before last in Washington, I introduced legislation to address wildlife diseases that hurt species we need for pollination, like the Little Brown Bat, which has been devastated by white-nose syndrome in New Hampshire. And in the district, I presented Korean War Veteran Donald Medbery with four service medals he earned while serving in the US Air Force. 
Presenting Donald Medbery with his service medals 
This week, I presented Korean War Veteran Donald Medbery with four service medals he earned while serving in the US Air Force and Air Force Reserve from 1953-1960. Mr. Medbery is an American patriot, and we are all inspired by his service. Mr. Medbery earned the Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Korean Service Medal, and the United Nations ‘Korean’ Service Medal. Like many veterans from the Korean War era, Mr. Medbery did not receive the medals he was awarded while he was serving, and his records were lost in the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) fire in 1973. At my request, and with supporting documents provided by Mr. Medbery, the NPRC authorized the shipment of Mr. Medbery’s medals. Like all of the other veterans we have had the pleasure of serving in our office, he is modest about his service but happy to tell the funny stories. It was a great honor to present him with his medals.

Standing up for Wildlife Refuges and working to address wildlife diseases 
Last week, I led a letter with the top Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee, Raul Grijalva, to the National Wildlife Refuge System requesting additional information on their decision to disarm refuge managers who also have a law enforcement role stopping illegal hunting and other illegal activities on refuge lands. I am concerned that removing these dual function officers, and replacing them with fewer full-time officers, will lead to less geographic coverage for the more than 560 refuges across the United States and could put them in danger.  
I also introduced legislation that would help address wildlife diseases that are devastating important species. In New Hampshire, only one Little Brown Bat was found this past winter compared to the more than 3,000 that would regularly hibernate before the population was decimated by white-nose syndrome. Wildlife diseases are a threat to our nation’s economy, food security, and environmental health. The Interior Department has to have the ability to monitor wildlife diseases and coordinate an effective response to these emergencies as they arise. This bill would help address the threats posed by wildlife diseases by allowing the Interior Department to declare and rapidly coordinate responses to wildlife disease emergencies such as white-nose syndrome, which have devastated bat populations in places around the country. My legislation would create a federal Wildlife Disease Committee to help federal agencies and state governments respond to these diseases, and it would establish a grant program to fund states’ efforts to counter these diseases.
Calling for faster action from DOD to replace dangerous PFC-based firefighting foam 
While I appreciate the Department of Defense’s efforts to address PFAS contamination and to develop and field a replacement firefighting foam that does not contain PFAS chemicals, it is clear that this work will take many more years and is not progressing as quickly as is needed. I secured a provision in this year’s Defense Authorization to require DoD to brief Congress on its efforts to replace this foam, and I expect this briefing to show considerably more progress towards attaining our shared goal of reducing the use of this dangerous foam. I commend those in New Hampshire and across the country who are speaking up and demanding action, and I agree with Ms. Amico, the founder of Testing for Pease, that these chemicals do not deserve the benefit of the doubt. Those who have polluted our groundwater, including DoD, must pay for the costs of cleaning up the contamination and for ensuring that the public has all the information it needs about these chemicals and their health impacts.
Funding programs that support victims of sexual assault 
Law enforcement must have the tools and resources it needs to investigate sexual assault cases, and this $650,000 in funding from the US Department of Justice will help our police departments and victims seek justice. I was pleased to announce this federal funding last week, which will help address the backlog of untested sexual assault kits. With these grants, the New Hampshire DOJ will also hire a specialist to work with victims to ensure their cases are investigated, and it will create an online system to allow victims to easily see the status of their assault kit test. It’s so important that victims have confidence that their assault kits will be tested and their cases investigated, and this funding will help our state achieve this goal.
Helping Manchester students 
Last week, the Congressional Delegation announced that the City of Manchester will be receiving nearly $1.6 million to help prepare students for postsecondary education. Too many middle and high school students struggle to access the support they need to help them prepare for secondary and higher education. By funding innovative approaches and traditional teaching supports, this grant from the US Department of Education will help current sixth- and seventh-graders throughout their time in Manchester’s schools to be better prepared for the next steps in their education. Congratulations to the City of Manchester, the New Hampshire College and University Council, and all those who partnered to design the GEAR UP Manchester program. This grant will help give these children a bright future. 
Supporting children impacted by the opioid crisis 
I was pleased to announce last week that the New Hampshire Department of Justice will be receiving $750,000 to bolster services for children who have been impacted by the opioid crisis. The opioid crisis doesn’t discriminate based on age, and children are especially vulnerable to the impacts of this devastating epidemic. I am pleased that our state will be receiving this essential federal funding to provide Manchester children with the support they need. These services will include mental health care in schools, trauma support groups for students, and training for school staff to help students who are exposed to trauma, including the trauma that occurs when a close family member is struggling with a substance use disorder. 
Protecting students in the classroom 
All children have a right to safe schools and classrooms. I am pleased that the Federal Bureau of Justice Assistance at the US Department of Justice has awarded $1.25 million to New Hampshire to help protect our students by supporting crisis training, threat assessment, and intervention response programs that prevent and stop violence in schools. These are important programs that need to be funded, but Congress must also take action to help stop gun violence by passing common sense reforms. 
Closing thoughts 
Last Monday was World Lung Day, when we highlighted the importance of healthy lungs and the need to prevent and find a cure for lung diseases. My interest in lung health has driven many of the issues I’ve worked on, from starting the Congressional Asthma and Allergy Caucus, to helping pass the Affordable Care Act and limiting the Defense Department’s use of burn pits overseas. www.Lung.org   
Last Monday was also National Voter Registration Day! Please take a moment to make sure you and your family are registered to vote. For more information, visit: https://www.usa.gov/register-to-vote 
It was great to run into veteran advocates from the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) New Hampshire at the Deerfield Fair! Thank you for continuing to serve our nation by helping other veterans. https://www.dav.org/

Sixth District Report
￼ 
Dear Friend, 
As many of us are too familiar, the opioid crisis is hurting Kentuckians across all demographics, backgrounds and regions. For these reasons, I have supported record level funding for local grants and designations to give states the flexibility to address this crisis at the local level. 
This month, I was proud to join local leaders and law enforcement officials at the Mt. Sterling Police Department to officially announce the designations of Montgomery and Powell Counties as High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA). Under the jurisdiction of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the HIDTA program coordinates and brings additional federal resources for localities to use in combating drug production and trafficking. 
As the state that suffers from the third highest opioid overdose mortality rate in the nation, Kentucky's Montgomery and Powell Counties are two of only 10 counties nationwide to receive new HIDTA designations.  
Throughout my service in Congress, I have been proud to advocate for the HIDTA program. Just this summer, Congress passed my amendment to increase the program's total funding to $280 million. I applaud the dedication of Montgomery and Powell County officials for working with my office to secure this designation and bolster Kentucky's efforts to fight drug trafficking and substance abuse in Kentucky. 
Find out what local officials are saying about this designation for their communities here.  
Congress Passes Historic, Bipartisan Opioid Package 
￼ 
In an effort to further bolster our efforts to combat this epidemic, I was proud to support the most significant Congressional action against a single drug crisis in history. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act marks a critical investment to better protect our communities by advancing prevention, treatment and recovery initiatives for individuals and families struggling with addiction and substance abuse.   
I was proud this legislation included my bill, the CAREER Act, to expand transitional housing options, similar to many throughout the Sixth District - such as Chrysalis House, Recovery Kentucky, St. James Place, and Shepherd's House - to empower individuals to rise above addiction by transitioning back into the workforce through stable housing and job training. 
To watch my speech during debate of this important bill on the floor of the House, click here. 
Advancing Economic Growth through Tax Reform 2.0 
￼ 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act strengthened our economy after nearly a decade of being stuck in the slowest, weakest economic recovery since the Great Depression. Last month, the House voted to build upon this success and pass three bills, known as Tax Reform 2.0, to make the middle-class and small business tax cuts permanent, promote family savings, and advance the next generation of American entrepreneurs. 
Due to uniform Senate Democrats' opposition last December, the original Tax Cuts and Jobs Act only maintained the individual and small business tax rates for eight years. For these reasons, I was proud to support Tax Reform 2.0 to deliver additional relief and certainty to American families and small businesses.  
To find out more about these three bills, click here. 
Additionally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its September Jobs Report, which found: 
	•	The unemployment rate hit 3.7% - the lowest point since 1969.
	•	Average hourly earnings rose 2.8% from a year earlier.
	•	The unemployment rate for Hispanic or Latino Americans fell to 4.5% - the lowest in nearly 50 years.
	•	The female unemployment rate fell to a 65-year low.
	•	U.S. consumer confidence is at a 17-year high.
Supporting University of Kentucky's Medical Research 
￼ 
This month, I had the opportunity to attend the ribbon cutting for UK's new research building. This building represents the hard work of Kentucky's researchers, physicians and professors and it's a privilege to represent this cutting edge University that is dedicated to helping Kentuckians lead healthier lives. 
Additionally, I was honored to congratulate UK College of Health Sciences for receiving the largest-ever awarded grant to expand the Sports Medicine Research Institute. I have been proud to support funding for the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense, both of which fund programs for UK HealthCare's research development.  
Photos of September 
￼ 
This month, I was honored to be a part of Menifee Central School groundbreaking. This will be a wonderful facility for the students of Frenchburg. 
￼ 
On September 26, I received the National Federation of Independent Businesses ""Guardian of Small Business Award,"" for supporting policies that are essential to the growth of Kentucky's small businesses. 
￼

￼ 
As we recognized American Business Women's Day on September 22, it was great to meet Alyssa Erickson and Kirstin Bohnert, founders of Kentucky Hempsters. These incredible young business owners are truly impressive and I was proud to share my advocacy for the Industrial Hemp Pilot Program in Kentucky. 
￼ 
This past month, I had the chance to start my day sending off our veterans and their families on an Honor Flight to travel to Washington, D.C. to tour their monuments and memorials. 
￼ 
It was great to join the Scott County Farm Bureau for their annual meeting on September 18. A special thanks to Kentucky Farm Bureau President Mark Haney, First Vice President Eddie Melton, Past President Darcy Smith and Incoming President Steward Hughs for their commitment to our farmers and community. 
￼ 
On September 15, I hosted the Military Academy Day for young men and women of Central and Eastern Kentucky interested in applying to our nation's service academies.  
￼ 
There's nothing like spending a beautiful afternoon at Keeneland's September Yearling Sale, where the filly of American Pharaoh sold for $1.2 million. I also had the opportunity to discuss our accomplishments for Kentucky's thoroughbred industry with TVG. 
￼ 
It was great to present a Congressional Record to Pastor Robert Blythe and members of the First Baptist Church in Richmond as they celebrated their 175th anniversary!  
￼ 
I was honored to receive the National Retail Federation's 2018 Hero of Main Street Award for supporting policies, like tax reform and regulatory relief, that benefit Kentucky's retailers and small businesses.

Courant Writer Receives Award for Work on Crumbling Foundations 
On Tuesday, the Hartford Courant’s Carolyn Lumsden was awarded the 2018 Pulliam editorial fellowship to research the crisis of crumbling foundations in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Lumsden will do a comparative case analysis with our neighbors in Canada to assess how they handled a similar issue involving concrete foundations containing pyrrhotite. I want to congratulate Carolyn on her award, and I look forward to reading her work on this devastating problem for local homeowners. 
The crisis of crumbling foundations has impacted dozens of communities across central and northeastern Connecticut, and we need to leverage every possible resource on the state and federal level to address this problem. As a reminder, on Saturday, October 13 at 10:00 AM, the CT Coalition Against Crumbling Basements will be hosting a town hall meeting in the Ellington High School Auditorium with captive insurance superintendent Michael Maglaras. Mr. Maglaras will be presenting on the captive insurance process, eligibility, and underwriting guidelines – this insurance claims process is the beginning of getting dollars into the hands of homeowners to help offset the cost of repairs.

Economic Growth Continues to Surge Across Eastern Connecticut 
Last weekend, the Connecticut Department of Labor released 2017 Connecticut Town Economic Indexes which showed that several local towns are among the fastest growing in the state. As economic growth is surging across southeastern Connecticut, that is good news for our entire region and state. As ranking member of the Seapower subcommittee, I have fought hard to increase federal support for shipbuilding at EB which in turn has helped fuel economic growth and hiring across our region. The momentum continues to grow as businesses of all shapes and sizes are populating and developing within our district. Eastern Connecticut’s diverse business climate will continue to bring more investment and new residents into the region. 
￼

Meeting with Business Leaders in Enfield 
I was happy to join the North Central Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday morning to provide a legislative update to local business leaders. Members of the chamber work hard to promote our local economy as a business-friendly community with an unrivaled quality of life for residents. We disused several important developments from Washington over the past year, as well as topics of local concern like the ongoing crisis of crumbling foundations. 
Like other meetings I have had with local employers recently, one topic that came up is the need for skilled workers, particularly in the healthcare sector. I shared with them the news that Capitol Workforce Partners (CWP), the Enfield region’s assigned Workforce Investment Board, was recently awarded of $5 million for job retraining activities by the U.S. Department of Labor. The CWP Job Center at Asnuntuck Community College is a brilliant collaboration that will help the region address shrink the “skills gap”. I would like to thank the Chamber for providing with this opportunity to meet with leaders from the Enfield area.  
I hope you enjoyed this snapshot of my work, and as always thank you for taking a moment to read my weekly update. If you have any questions or concerns about the information in this newsletter, you can contact me through my website or by calling my Norwich district office at 860-886-0139.   
Have a great weekend,

We Must Not Agonize, We Must Organize


￼
Justice Kavanaugh's Confirmation The GOP’s decision to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court has wounded the very soul of justice in our country.   
Amid our heartbreak, however, we renew our resolve and determination.  We are awed by the dignity and bravery of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, and by the courage of the countless survivors across our country who have come forward with their own stories, even at great personal risk.  Their dignity and bravery continue to be a rallying cry and a source of strength for survivors across the world, inspiring an ever-growing chorus of women to say ‘Me Too’ and ‘Time’s Up.’ 
We must not agonize, we must organize!  What is at stake under the GOP Congress is nothing less than the health and financial security of families across America.  The new conservative majority on the Supreme Court threatens a rollback of protections for people with pre-existing conditions, more leverage for corporate special interests over working families, and little hope to reform Citizens United.  Democrats will work even harder to advance our For The People legislative agenda: lowering health costs and prescription drug prices, raising workers’ wages with strong economic growth by rebuilding America, and cleaning up corruption to make Washington work for you! 
￼ 
Hurricane Michael   Hurricane Michael has left millions of Americans reeling from the heartbreaking devastation and destruction of their homes and communities throughout the Florida panhandle and across the southeast.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the families, friends and loved ones of all those who have lost their lives, and our hearts go out to the families whose lives have been upended by this unprecedented storm. 
Our deepest thanks go to the heroic first responders who have worked selflessly in the days before and after Hurricane Michael to come to the aid of those in need.  Federal, state and local authorities must come together to provide every resource necessary to help these brave men and women in their critical, life-saving efforts.  Congress must be ready to assist all the communities impacted by this deadly storm now and on the long road to recovery. 
￼ 
My office was able to help a disabled veteran who was experiencing an issue securing a temporary passport because he did not have a birth certificate or an early childhood record. My office contacted the San Francisco Passport Agency and was able to secure a one-year temporary passport for my constituent.

Let’s Read! Tinian. Tinian Elementary School, Tinian Junior/Senior High School, and Tinian Public Library received fifty boxes of books on Thursday—part of my on-going “Let’s Read!” initiative to promote literacy in the Marianas. Since my first term in 2009, your congressional office has been hand-selecting brand-new books from the Library of Congress and sending them to our schools and libraries. This year, we reached the milestone of 50,000 books. In fact, book #50,000 is probably one of those we delivered this week! 
 

More CIP for water authorized

The America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, passed by the Senate this week and now on the President’s desk, could double water project funding for the Marianas. The Act increases the authorization for the Safe Drinking Water Act, from the current $1 billion to $1.95 billion in 2021. The Marianas has received about $3.5 million annually from this fund since 2010, when I increased the insular area set-aside from 0.33 to 1.5 percent. The new Act gives us opportunity to double that amount through the annual appropriations process. It also cancels a proposed deauthorization of $20 million for Saipan water infrastructure, from the 2007 Water Resources Act. The Army Corps sought the deauthorization for this and hundreds of other projects nationwide, because funds have never been appropriated. Keeping the $20 million authorization means we can keep working for that funding in the next Congress. We need the money: the Environmental Protection Agency estimates $198.4 million is needed in the Marianas to provide water service to households and protect our environment. 
 

Medicaid working group formed

As I did to extend the Commonwealth Only Transitional Worker (CW) program for ten years in the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act, I have now formed a congressional working group to address the end of supplemental Medicaid funding in  September 2019. The supplemental funding—$109 million for the Marianas—was included in the 2010 Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, P.L. 111-152, or Obamacare. The money kept the Commonwealth Healthcare Center open after the Fitial administration cut the hospital out of the government budget and is now almost entirely spent. 

The CW working group was simpler than the Medicaid working group will be, because only the Marianas was involved. With Medicaid I have invited congressional staff from American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, all of which face the same Medicaid “cliff,” but each of which has different constraints and capabilities in delivering health care. That makes a resolution more complicated than the CW extension. The working group has already met with Senate and House committees with jurisdiction over Medicaid, so the issue is on the agenda for the next, 116th U.S. Congress beginning in January. I have also included legislative language in the Health Equity and Accountability Act, H.R. 5492, that would solve the “cliff” problem by treating all the insular areas like states for purposes of Medicaid. This bill has the support of 67 Members so far and is likely to be a starting point for health care legislation in a Democratic-majority House next year. 
 

Social Security increases 2.8%

The 2,955 Marianas retirees receiving Social Security and 1,027 getting Supplemental Security Income will see a 2.8 percent cost-of-living adjustment for 2019. Social Security Commissioner Nancy Berryhill wrote me this week with details. The estimated average monthly benefit for retired workers will rise from $1,422 to $1,461. The maximum SSI monthly benefit for an individual will increase from $750 to $771 and for a couple from $1,125 to $1,157. The increases are intended to keep pace with inflation in the cost of goods and services. Social Security beneficiaries will start receiving their increase in January 2019. Those on SSI will see the higher payments beginning December 31, 2018. 
 

Disaster Recovery Centers open

FEMA/SBA Disaster Recovery Centers opened this week on Saipan, Tinian and Rota to help those impacted by Typhoon Mangkhut through FEMA’s Individuals and Households Program and the Public Assistance Program.  If you have already spoken with a Disaster Recovery Assistance personnel, you DO NOT have to register at a Disaster Recovery Center. 

ROTA:
Northern Marianas College (Room A-1)
Mon–Fri: 9am-6pm, Sat: 10am-4pm, SUN: CLOSED

SAIPAN:
Joeten-Kiyu Public Library
Mon–Fri: 9am-6pm, Sat: 10am-4pm, SUN: CLOSED

TINIAN:
Northern Marianas College (Room C)
Mon–Fri: 9am-6pm, Sat: 10am-4pm, SUN: CLOSED

The U.S. Small Business Administration can also help residents recover from Typhoon Mangkhut. Business Physical Disaster Loans are available to businesses; private, non-profit organizations; homeowners; and renters to repair or replace uninsured/underinsured damaged property. Economic Injury Disaster Loans are available to businesses that may or may not have sustained any damage but have experienced a downturn in business because of the typhoon. Residents and businesses should first file their insurance claims and register with FEMA, then apply to SBA for assistance. 

The filing deadline for businesses and residents to return SBA applications for property damage is Nov. 28, 2018. The deadline for businesses to return economic injury applications is July 1, 2019.

For specifics on the types of disaster loans offered by SBA, credit requirements for loan applicants, interest rates for loans and what restrictions apply to each loan, click here for the breakdown. 

Contact your congressional office if you are unable to receive the assistance you need.
 
 

If you served, register! Our Veterans Registration Drive continues this weekend and next. The more veterans we get registered, the better our chances that the feasibility study I included in the VA MISSION Act will  recommend a VA-staffed Community-Based Outpatient Clinic, or CBOC, for Marianas veterans. Your congressional staff and the CNMI Office of Military and Veterans Affairs office will be present at the registration table to answer any questions you may have about benefits. 
 

Vet count remains a problem

Veterans should have a place of their own, where they can go for the health care they need. That is why I included a requirement to study the feasibility of a Marianas Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) in Section 213 of the VA MISSION Act, Public Law 115-182. An issue for the CBOC feasibility study, and for any request for staffing by the U.S. Veterans Administration, is the number of veterans living in the Marianas who need the service. The VA consultants hired to conduct the feasibility study tell me that the typical threshold for a full-time, primary care VA physician is 1,200 veteran patients. There are close to 2,000 veterans registered with the Commonwealth Veterans Affairs office, but the number enrolled for VA health care is much lower, approximately 450 veterans. To increase enrollment, the congressional office is conducting bimonthly veterans registration drives. Veterans are encouraged to register for VA health benefits and the CNMI veterans registry. The next event is scheduled for Saturday, October 13 and 20, from 10am to 2pm at the Joeten Superstore in San Jose. We have to get our numbers up. 
 
 

Apply now for academy nomination

Young men and women from the Northern Marianas interested in an exceptional college education at no cost and committed to serving our country should apply now for a congressional nomination to one of the U.S. service academies. As a result of changes I included in U.S. Public Laws 111-84, 111-383, and 114-92, there is an opening for next year’s incoming Class of 2023 at the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy, and the U.S. Military Academy. Attending any of the academies is a unique opportunity to obtain a premier education and an officer’s commission in return for five years of service. As your Congressman, I may make nominations, but the final selection among nominees is made by academy admissions officials. They look for strong grades, high SAT or ACT scores, physical ability, and leadership potential. More information and an application form are available at https://sablan.house.gov/serving-you/academy-nominations, and at your local congressional office. Applications are due December 7, 2018. 
 

More support for status bill

Representatives Frank Pallone (D-New Jersey) and Gregory Meeks (D-New York) have added their names as cosponsors to the Northern Mariana Islands Workforce Stabilization Act, H.R. 6578. My bill gives long-term workers and investors in the Marianas the opportunity for permanent status. We now have a bipartisan total of 36 cosponsors. Granting improved status to workers would help stabilize our existing workforce and reduce reliance on the CW program. And knowing they will be permanent members of our community will encourage long-time investors to increase investment in our economy. A Republican Congress is unlikely to pass legislation granting a pathway to citizenship to any group. However, Democrats are expected to lead the 116th Congress and introduce comprehensive immigration legislation, to which I plan to add the Stabilization Act. 
 

Governor, Demapan back parole

Thanks to Governor Ralph Torres and Representative Angel Demapan for supporting another two-year extension of parole-in-place for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and other persons not eligible for visas. I believe this is the first time that a Governor or the Legislature has supported the parole-in-place policy. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services first granted parole to these individuals at my request in November 2011. I had introduced H.R. 1466, legislation giving them a way to get green cards, or U.S. lawful permanent resident status. And parole would allow them to remain legally in the Marianas, while Congress considered my bill. I also raised the issue with President Obama at our first meeting. Unfortunately, the Fitial administration successfully blocked H.R. 1466. Nevertheless, I was able to get the Obama administration to continue the parole policy in 2012, 2014, and 2016. It expires again at the end of 2018 and the question is whether the Trump administration will renew it. According to USCIS, there are currently 1,300 persons who have been granted this special status. But the Trump administration has also denied over 1,400 requests for the humanitarian parole. 
 
 


Trump admin wants new green card obstacles

Lawful Permanent Residents, CW workers, and E-2 CNMI investors are among the groups that could be negatively affected by the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed changes to public charge standards published in the Federal Register on October 10. Currently, individuals seeking admission to the United States or applying for a green card can be denied, if they are determined likely to become dependent on government assistance, such as Supplemental Security Income. But the proposed new regulations would expand to include likely participation in any public benefit program, including Medicaid, Section 8 housing and rental assistance, and nutrition assistance. And an affidavit of support in which an immigrant’s sponsor agrees to financially support them would not automatically overcome these public charge concerns. A public charge evaluation would also be required for extension and change of status requests, including CWs and E-2 CNMI investor petitions. To avoid public charge concerns, individuals would have to demonstrate a household income above 250% of the federal poverty level. This means $30,350 for a single person and nearly $63,000 for a family of four. The deadline to submit comments on the Trump administration's proposed rule is December 10, 2018. 
 
 

App Challenge deadline: Monday. A reminder to students: Monday is the deadline to submit your app and video in order to participate in this year’s Congressional App Challenge. Winners only have to compete against other entries from the Marianas, winning a trip to Washington, D.C. to present your app to members of Congress, leaders in the tech industry and other winners from across the country.

Foxx Report
 
As we work to put America first in our international trading relationships, we must ensure local industries can continue to thrive. Farmers and local businesses have brought the need for targeted assistance from recently imposed tariffs to me. Therefore, I joined with 159 of my House colleagues today and signed onto a bipartisan letter to Trade Representative Lighthizer requesting an exclusion process for the recent tariffs imposed on China. While unfair trade practices need to be challenged, it must be through a deliberate process for remedying trade problems that works to protect our nation’s businesses, farmers and consumers. This process would afford U.S. companies the opportunity to seek relief if tariffs that harm their global competitiveness and would help target the effects of the tariffs on China rather than on U.S. companies and their customers. In doing so, we can challenge unfair practices while advancing the interests of our local economy.  
Tuesday, it was great to have a group from Bethel Baptist Church in Watauga County come to DC and allow me to give them a behind-the-scenes tour of our capitol! 

￼

Today kicks off the North Carolina State Fair. Safe travels and good luck to participants and competitors from the Fifth District, including Eli Herman who is performing in the opening ceremony! When I met this young man last month, I was so impressed by his exemplary patriotism and determination that I recently recognized him on the House floor. Watch my remarks below.

Pastor Andrew Brunson Released from Unjust Detainment
Today is a great day for North Carolina and for the United States, as we’ve learned Pastor Andrew Brunson has been released after being unjustly detained in Turkey for the last two years. Pastor Brunson is from Black Mountain, N.C. and worked peacefully as a Christian missionary for 23 years before his arrest and detainment in October 2016. There was no evidence substantiating the terror-related charges against him, and he was repeatedly denied access to appropriate legal counsel.
President Trump and his Administration made Pastor Brunson’s unconditional release a top priority, and I want to thank them for their tireless work on his behalf. Senators Thom Tillis, James Lankford and others kept up strong pressure from Congress, as well. Because of their efforts, an innocent man will soon be back home.
Our prayers are with Pastor Brunson and his family as they celebrate his return and recover from this brutal ordeal.

October 12, 2018 
 
Dear Friend,  
This week, I visited midshipmen from Tennessee’s 9th Congressional District studying at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and came away impressed at their commitment to becoming U.S. Navy or Marine officers. I also wrote the Shelby County Election Commission expressing my concern at its reported high rate of invalid voter applications, introduced a bill to prevent double taxation on purchase of digital goods and services, cheered the signing of bills on which I worked that block insurers from enforcing “gag clauses” that prohibit pharmacies from telling customers about how they can pay less for drugs, attended a documentary film on the Watergate scandal, condemned the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, wrote an opinion column on the treatment of Obama-era judicial nominations, began inviting veterans to my Veterans Day barbecue, offered my constituentsU.S. Capitol Society calendars and provided a health tipon Alzheimer’s disease. Keep reading to learn more about my week and follow me on Twitter and Facebook to see more updates as they happen.

Visiting 9th Congressional District Constituents at the U.S. Naval Academy 
￼ 
On Tuesday, I had a delightful visit with three, third-year Midshipmen from the 9th Congressional District at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. These young men will graduate as U.S. Navy or Marine officers after a fine education at an elite institution. Memphis University School graduate C.J. McCoy, White Station High School graduate Brody McDonald and Evangelical Christian School graduate David Boyd will make this country proud. Receiving a Naval Academy education is a tremendous honor and a major achievement. It also instills qualities of character that produce true leaders. I was disappointed I couldn’t meet with four other 9th District midshipmen who are on the Navy football team and were busy training, but I’ll give a shout out to them, too: Sean Williams of Cordova and Memphians Cameron Kinley, Caleb Clear, and Camren Taylor. I wish them all a Navy toast of “fair winds and following seas.” 
Expressing Concern about Voter Registration Application Invalidations 
On Wednesday, I wrote to Shelby County Election Commission Chairman Robert Meyers expressing my concern about the Commission’s assertion that 55 percent of voter applications are being ruled invalid. I asked Chairman Meyers what the Commission is doing to ensure federal law is being followed and that applications are processed before the beginning of early voting on October 17 – next Tuesday. I also asked what the Commission is doing to inform eligible citizens whose applications have been deemed incomplete what they are required to do to complete them,and what is being done to inform felons who are eligible to have their voting rights restored what they are required to do to complete an application. Read my letter here.  With what’s going on in Georgia, where 53,000 registration applications are being held up – 70 percent of which are from African Americans  -- we must ensure that no Tennessean’s right to vote is compromised. 
Introducing the Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act 
On Friday, I joined Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) in introducing the Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act aimed at protecting consumers who make purchases over the internet or by smart phone. The bill would   ensure that consumers  aren’t taxed at a higher rate than they would be for purchases of tangible items. It would also ensure that consumers aren’t  double taxed. I look forward to its consideration by the House Judiciary Committee on which I serve. 
Blocking Big PHARMA’s Influence over Insured Drug Costs  
On Wednesday, two bills were signed into law that block insurers from enforcing “gag clauses” that prohibit pharmacies from telling customers about how they can pay less for drugs. I was proud to cosponsor the House version of The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act which was introduced by my colleague Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-TX), as well as the House version of the Know the Lowest Price Act.  These bills will help ensure that consumers can find out whether a prescription drug would cost less were they to pay for it out of pocket instead of through their health insurance. The Patient Right to Know Act applies to patients covered by private insurance and takes effect immediately. The second measure applies to Medicare recipients and takes effect in 2020.  
Attending Washington Premiere of “Watergate” 
￼ 
Watergate prosecutors George T. Frampton, Richard Ben-Veniste, and Jill Wine-Bank speak with “Watergate” director Charles Ferguson (with microphone). 
On Wednesday evening, I attended and enjoyed the Washington premiere of the first half of the documentary “Watergate – Or, How We Stopped an Out-of-Control President” at the National Portrait Gallery. The part I saw led up to 1973 and depicted a paranoid, obsessed president whose involvement in illegal activity and its coverup was abetted by people around him who realized but hid that he was out of control. Nixon is seen attacking The Washington Post and other news organizations and falsely asserting that the Watergate special prosecutors would find nothing in their investigation of the burglary, the political chicanery or the payoffs to keep witnesses silent. As a member of the House Judiciary Committee,I found the parallels to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing investigation of Russian interference in our elections, and Trump’s response to it, chillingly similar, and was reminded why it is so important for Congress to pass the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act to protect Mueller from being inappropriately fired. The documentary airs on cable television in early November.   
Condemning the Confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh
Much of the country was disappointed at last Saturday evening’s Senate vote confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. I talked with the Reverend Al Sharpton of MSNBC on Sunday and with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Monday about the confirmation process and the impact Kavanaugh is likely to have in jeopardizing voting rights, women’s reproductive rights and other critical issues resolved by the nation’s highest court. Kavanaugh does not have the judicial temperament for the job. We need fair and impartial judges to protect the rights of the most vulnerable.  
Lamenting Obstruction of Obama-era Judicial Nominations 
In response to a recent column by Senator Lamar Alexander in The Commercial Appeal accusing Senate Democrats of stalling the confirmation of federal District Court judge nominees, including state Senator Mark Norris, I  wrote my own op-ed in The Commercial Appeal pointing out the lengthy delay and ultimate derailing of President Obama’s nomination of former U.S. Attorney Ed Stanton to become a federal judge. Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to let the Senate consider President Obama’s nominee for the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland. Senator Norris was confirmed by the Senate Thursday night. The record reflects that Republican senators engaged in far more obstruction of Obama’s nominees than Democratic senators have of Trump’s nominees. 
Inviting Vets to My Veterans Day BBQ Luncheon 
￼ 
Words cannot fully express the gratitude our nation owes its military veterans for their dedication to our country and the sacrifices they have made. My annual Veterans Day Luncheon is a time to thank them and their families. This luncheon serves as an opportunity for me to hear their concerns and for veterans to hear what is being done at the federal, state and local levels to better serve their needs. 
My 10th Annual Veterans Day Barbecue Luncheon will be held on Monday, November 12, from noon to 2 p.m. at the Kroc Center of Memphis – Hardin Hall, 800 East Parkway South. Vets should RSVP by Thursday, November 8 at (901) 544-4131. 
Offering U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars 
My office will soon have a limited number of 2019 U.S. Capitol Historical Society calendars available. If you would like to receive a calendar, please complete this form on my website. Due to the rules of the House, I can mail calendars only to residents of Tennessee’s 9th Congressional District. Please feel free to share this email with other residents of the 9th District who may be interested in receiving one but who do not receive my e-Newsletter.

Weekly Health Tip 
￼ 
Each week, I share a health tip in the hope of promoting a healthy lifestyle for residents of the 9th Congressional District. As always, it is best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine or lifestyle. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) estimates 5.7 million Americans are now living with Alzheimer’s disease, the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. While some risk factors, like age and genetics, can’t be controlled, the CDC offers a few tips to improve your chances of staving off dementia, including staying active, avoiding smoking and, perhaps surprisingly, just trying to learn new things. Alzheimer’s is also the most expensive disease in America, with one in five Medicare dollars spent on someone with the disease. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, early diagnosis would save billions while providing better treatment options for families and caregivers.  
Quote of the Week  
￼ 
With the post-season upon us, it’s always nice to be reminded of the wisdom of baseball great Yogi Berra: 
“You can observe a lot by just watching.” 
“Baseball is 90 percent mental and the other half is physical.” 
“Never answer an anonymous letter.” 
I'll be at the Liberty Bowl Saturday afternoon when the Tigers take on UCF. Let's go Tigers!  
As always, 
I remain 
Most sincerely,

Assistant Secretary Collett
This week, I had the pleasure of hosting Assistant Secretary of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services, Johnny Collett, to the 6th district to tour work centers specialized in providing employment opportunities and rehabilitation services to those with disabilities. 

Creating meaningful opportunities for these individuals is so important and I was so pleased to have Assistant Secretary Collett with me to see all the progress being made in Wisconsin. I have long advocated for increasing efforts to help those with special needs find employment and workplace opportunities.

The Assistant Secretary and I visited three different work centers, Brooke Industries, RCS Empowers, and Lakeside Packaging Plus. These organizations offer a wide variety of services to those with special needs and their families so that they have the opportunity to lead lives of fulfillment. To read more about my visit with Assistant Secretary Collett and the organizations, click here.

Social Security Increase
This week, Social Security announced a 2.8 percent increase in benefits for more than 67 million Americans throughout the country. This increase will change the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax from $128,400 to $132,900.   

The increase will begin in January of 2019 and beneficiaries will be notified of the increase by mail in December. This increase is long overdue and its great to see our government providing some support to Social Security beneficiaries. To learn more click here. 

Weekly Roundup
Happy National Farmer's Day! Today, we celebrate farmers across Wisconsin and throughout the country for their hard work, resilience, and determination to help feed our nation. I will always advocate for farmers as they represent such a critical part of our country.

WEEK IN REVIEW
￼
To start off this week's From the Front... I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nation’s capital, including the Cook family from Holiday Island, Gary and Cynthia Marshall from Bella Vista, the Collins family from Bentonville, members of the Arkansas Early Learning, Inc., members of Arkansas Family, Career and Community Leaders of America, the Dunn family from Fort Smith, Andrew and Sarah Huntsinger from Cave Springs, the Wilkinson family from Bentonville, Dan and Valeria Bekebrede from Fayetteville, Kaleb and Jennifer Plank from Bentonville, and the Vere family from Russellville. Safe travels back to the Natural State.
It’s great to be back in Northwest Arkansas for the district work period! I kicked off the week meeting with city and school education leaders and stakeholders in Centerton. We discussed a range of issues and challenges that impact our local students and schools. Getting firsthand insights from teachers, administrators, parents, and government officials is important to ensuring I have the information I need to advocate for our community in Congress. My goal as a representative  is always to empower our teachers and administrators. They know the needs of our next generation better than Washington bureaucrats.
￼
I then headed over to Bentonville West High School to tour the campus and meet with students. From woodshop class and jazz band rehearsal, to English lectures and track practice - I was extremely impressed by the work of all the students, teachers, and staff. I was especially pleased to learn that that some of the student woodworkers were building a project for veterans involved in the Wounded Warrior program. They expressed the importance of supporting and giving back to those who have served our country. I’m proud to see our next generation hard at work and building their skills for success! A special thank you to Principal Jonathan Guthrie and Bentonville Schools Superintendent Dr. Debbie Jones for taking me around!
My next stop was to Holman Family Dentistry to tour the facility, meet with some patients, and check out the expansion of the building. It’s always great to meet with new providers in the area who support the health and economic strength of our community!
￼
On Wednesday, I hosted a “Coffee with the Congressman” event in Pindall. We discussed a variety of topics, including infrastructure, immigration, economic growth, and the polarized electorate. During the event, a constituent also expressed an ongoing issue she has had with the Department of Veterans Affairs. My office was able to help her right away, and I’m glad we secured a favorable outcome. Please don't hesitate to reach out to my office if you ever need help with a federal agency. It’s always great to hear directly from the people I represent! Thanks to all those who took time out of their busy schedules to share some coffee and respectful conversation. 
￼
Manufacturing is a key engine that powers innovation and economic growth in our state and across the U.S. I had the opportunity to get a firsthand look at the work being done at the WestRock facility in Harrison. The company prints and sells packaging for customers across the world. Many of the products you pick up at your local grocery store likely had its packaging printed by WestRock. I had a great tour of the facility and enjoyed talking to employees on the floor. Businesses like this boost our local economy and provide great manufacturing jobs in our community.
￼
I finished up the day at Alpena High School. One of the best parts of my job is being able to engage with the next generation and talk about their futures. We discussed the importance of education, leadership, and service. Today’s students are tomorrow’s leaders – and I saw a room full of young people ready for success. I ended the visit with a quick basketball free throw contest. I’ll have you guess who won. Hint: it wasn’t me! 
￼
Thursday morning, I started my day at Van Buren High School with students from its AP History and Politics class. We talked about the importance of being civically engaged and active in the community. They asked great questions about the U.S. legislative process, polarization in government, policy work in Washington, my role as an appropriator and Chairman of the Budget Committee, and the intersection between federal and local government. These young adults are Arkansas’s next generation of public servants, and I was truly impressed by the caliber of discussion we had. By engaging and motivating young people to get involved in the democratic process now, they will be better prepared to tackle the issues of the future.
￼
Have you ever wondered where the plastic bags for certain products are made? A lot of these goods are produced in Arkansas’s Third Congressional District at Arkansas Poly, Inc. I took a tour of the facility and was able to see the manufacturing of the products from start to finish. The employees were hard at work and it was helpful to see how their different jobs contribute to creating the final product. It was yet another example of the impressive manufacturing work happening in the district!
￼
I then stopped by Five Rivers Distribution to discuss trade policy and tariffs. We toured the facility and saw an empty warehouse that should be full of product. While I respect the administration’s goal of securing fairer trade deals, some tariffs are unintentionally hurting local businesses. Trade is a critical part of our economy, and companies like Five Rivers are important to the strength of our region. Without being able to fill the warehouses with product, they won’t be able to compete and make their bottom lines. We need to make strategic exceptions for goods not domestically produced in the U.S. to protect American and Arkansas jobs. I’m working with the administration and House leadership to make this a priority.
￼
My last stop was to join the Van Buren Chamber of Commerce for its annual Dishin' Up Democracy event. It was a wonderful night filled with great conversation, food, and people. The event focused on the importance of our civic duties – and I was especially touched by the presentation of our flag. I was honored to lead the keynote address. As I said in my speech, America is strongest when we work together, despite our differences. God bless our great nation!

SO FAR THIS OCTOBER WORK PERIOD...
 Farmers continue to serve as the backbone of our rural economy and the heart of Georgia's number one industry. Today, during these trying times, it is more important now than ever to thank and support our farmers wholeheartedly in the midst of Hurricane Michael's aftermath. 
￼

As we focus on recovery efforts, Robin and I are continuing to pray for all of those affected. Please take a look at the following helpful tips from FEMA as well as USDA’s efforts to provide assistance to those who have experienced loss. 
1. Stay alert.  Follow guidance from local officials, and do not return home until you are told it is safe.
2. Expect disruptions.  Be prepared for power and phone service outages, roads blocked by flood and/or debris, water and sewer outages.
3. Be careful during clean-up.  Wear protective clothing like waterproof boots and gloves, wash your hands often, and work in teams. 
4. Start the recovery process.  If you have insurance, and it’s safe to return home, call your insurance company to file a claim. Take photos and videos of all damages before you start cleaning up.
I joined my fellow Members of the Georgia Delegation in sending a letter to President Trump requesting expedited emergency resources to aid counties in Georgia that were impacted by Hurricane Michael, and I am thankful that President Trump approved Georgia’s emergency declaration in a timely manner. 
￼
I visited with some of our farmers in the district to assess some of the damage from Hurricane Michael and will continue to work diligently with constituents and federal agencies throughout the relief and recovery process.  During Georgia Pre-K Week, I visited Lake Forest Hills Elementary in Augusta as the guest reader for many smiling, young scholars.
￼

￼
Georgia Pre-K Week was launched to raise awareness about the importance of a quality early childhood education by providing opportunities for community leaders to engage with Pre-K classrooms in Georgia. It is humbling to see so many young students with a passion to learn and I thank our state and local communities for being at the forefront of this great effort.
I also spoke to a group of high school students at Trinity Christian School about my work as their Congressman on behalf of Georgia’s 12th district.
￼

I joined some of the great employees at UPS where I was able to grab a uniform, hit the road, and make some deliveries to a number of valued customers throughout our community.

￼

￼

Thanks for showing me some of your day-to-day operations that keep your many dedicated customers so happy!
I also attended the Augusta Kiwanis meeting.
￼
I always enjoy seeing so many familiar faces and I thank them for their continued dedication to improving our local community.
I spoke at the Claxton Quarterly Chamber Luncheon about tax reform, our red-hot economy, and my work on the House Education and Workforce Committee.
￼

￼
Then, I headed over to the Canoochee EMC Annual Members Meeting.
￼

￼
Canoochee EMC serves parts of nine rural southeast Georgia counties and provides an invaluable service as they “light up a little piece of the South.”  As U.S. Army Cyber Command continues the transition to Fort Gordon, I was honored to speak at a “Road to Gordon” Townhall at Fort Belvoir. 
￼
Augusta is experiencing tremendous growth as a result of U.S. Army Cyber Command’s transition, and I was humbled to speak about the Augusta area, all of its amenities, the supportive community, and my personal experience growing up and raising a family in the area. I look forward to welcoming many of the service members, civilians, and industry leaders who currently work at Fort Belvoir to Georgia-12!  
The CSRA Leadership group was in Washington for their D.C. fly-in, and because I was in the district, I connected with them via Skype!
￼
I continued the conversation about the growth that Georgia’s 12th district is experiencing, as well as my work on the House Education and Workforce Committee to ensure that we have a qualified workforce that is ready to fill the nearly seven million available jobs throughout our country.
In my Augusta office, I had a great meeting with Jim Franklin on behalf of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.
￼
Thanks for taking the time to stop by the office and for your continued work advocating for extensive diabetes research.
Before heading to the district, I also welcomed Lauren Maddux to my D.C. office before her tour of the U.S. Capitol.
￼
If you are interested in scheduling tours in Washington, please visit my website at allen.house.gov.

October 12, 2018 
Dear friend, 
While I’ve been home this week, the U.S. Senate has been busy passing my water storage bill. On Wednesday, my New WATER Act was passed as part of the America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (WRDA) and will now go to President Trump to be signed into law. This legislation will allow us to leverage non-federal investments and finance the construction of new water storage in California – including new reservoirs, below ground storage projects, recycling and desalination projects – for the first time in decades. This is real progress that will benefit our community for generations to come. 
Also included in WRDA is language I drafted to significantly enhance flood protection in San Joaquin County by authorizing long-delayed and badly needed flood control protection efforts for more than 50,000 Valley residents and a number of critical infrastructure facilities. Finally, I was able to include language to expedite the feasibility study of Reclamation District 17, which includes the French Camp veterans treatment facility. 
To learn more about what I am doing to secure water storage for the Central Valley and fight the Sacramento water grab, visit Denham.house.gov/water. 
Federal regulators visit the Valley, join fight against Sacramento water grab On Thursday, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler came to the Valley at my urging to see firsthand the devastation that Sacramento’s planned water grab would have on communities, farms and the economy. We visited weir traps on the Stanislaus River, hosted a field hearing with irrigation districts in Riverbank, and met with the local agriculture leaders at Stanislaus County Farm Bureau in Modesto. 
￼ 
Following his tour of the district, Acting Administrator Wheeler had this to say: “EPA is working closely with California’s farmers and landowners to help protect their valuable water resources and provide them greater certainty with respect to where federal jurisdiction begins and ends. Hearing directly from Californians and our Region 9 EPA staff is vital to our efforts to protect the public health, environment, and natural resources of this unique and beautiful region of our country.” 
The EPA has authority under the Clean Water Act to stop Sacramento’s radical water grab. The state’s plan fails to meet Clean Water Act’s “sound, rigorous” science standards for flow criteria, and the EPA previously commented on the last version of this plan, telling the State Water Resources Control Board that the science supporting Phase I of the Water Quality Control Plan for the Bay-Delta is deficient. Last month, my colleagues Reps. Jim Costa (CA-16) and Tom McClintock (CA-04) joined me in sending a letter to the EPA asking them to enforce the Clean Water Act’s requirement. I also recently sent a letter to the White House requesting the president take immediate action to stop Sacramento, and I secured the support of Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue in combatting the state’s Bay-Delta plan. I will continue to bring administration officials here to see firsthand the damage this plan would have until Sacramento pulls the plug. 
U.S. DOT official joins local infrastructure roundtable and bus tour On Tuesday, I hosted U.S. Department of Transportation official Derek Kan to discuss the Central Valley’s key transportation infrastructure needs with the Stanislaus County Council of Governments at a roundtable and bus tour in Modesto. We discussed several projects that I’ve helped from a federal level, including the Gateway Express Project, North County Corridor, 7th street bridge project, Altamont Corridor Express (ACE) and upgrades to SR 99. I’m fighting to build critical Central Valley infrastructure, and I will continue working with local leaders and the U.S. Department of Transportation to bring solutions home to the Valley.

Need help with the government? Read one constituent’s casework success story. When U.S. Air Force Veteran Larry Hite needed help, he was surprised to discover that the country he served had stopped serving him.   
Upon leaving the service, Larry was told that he would be taken care of in terms of his benefits – including his medical care. During his unemployment, Larry used his VA card very few times and stopped using it once he was employed again.   
However, when Larry fractured his wrist and turned to the VA for treatment, he was told that he no longer qualified for VA benefits. 
Larry went straight to Senator Feinstein’s office for help. But instead of having his needs addressed, he received a letter informing him that Congress changed the laws and his household income made him ineligible for benefits. 
“When I received that letter from Diane Feinstein, I really felt abandoned by my country,” said Larry. 
Upon a recommendation from a friend who had received similar help, Larry decided to contact my office.    
“Almost two weeks to the day later, I got a call from the VA,” said Larry. He received new benefits that aligned with the changes in the law and received the treatment that any veteran deserves. 
Larry advises that anyone going through a similar problem should contact my office. 
“I really appreciate the fact that Congressman Denham was looking out for me as a veteran,” says Larry, “I contacted an elected official who I felt actually represented me…it was nice that someone was willing to go to bat for me.” 
I am glad that Larry called my office and that we were able to help him receive benefits so quickly. If you or anyone you know is having trouble with a government department or agency, call my Modesto office at 209-579-5458, or you can submit a casework request on my website. We’re here to help.

10/12/18 18:13,how tax reform is helping families in Eastern Washington,"
 
￼

Hello, 

Here in Eastern Washington, I'm proud to represent so many higher education institutions that are working every day to help students meet their full potential and live out their passions. I was the first person in my family to graduate from college. I worked my way through school and just paid off my student loans last year. When it comes time for our students to graduate, we must make sure student debt isn't holding them back. That's why I am working hard to ensure that college is affordable and that there are jobs here in our community for our graduates. Here's how: 
	1.	I voted to increase the maximum Pell grant award to $6,195 for the 2019-2020 award year. This was included in a funding bill that the President recently  signed into law.  
	2.	I've also led to get legislation signed into law that ensures Pell Grants are available year round.
	3.	I recently supported funding to support programs like TRIO and GEAR UP, which provide resources to first-generation college students.
	4.	I am working to provide more funding for alternative education options like trade schools, vocational schools, and community college.
	5.	I voted to require yearly financial counseling, which will make sure college students have access to the information they need to make smart financial decisions and reduce the risk of over-borrowing.
	6.	I have cosponsored legislation that extends funding for the Perkins Loan Program, which offers need-based, low-income loans to college students.
Traveling around our communities and meeting with local college students, I've listened to their concerns -- they want to find a good-paying job when they graduate. Fortunately, because of our work to grow the economy, today's graduates are entering a job market that's better than students of the past decade could've imagined. Thanks to tax reform and our pro-growth policies: 
	1.	Unemployment rates are dropping across every county in Eastern Washington, which means college graduates can stay and work in our communities.
	2.	Wages are rising -- the largest increase in a decade. Wages have increased in every Eastern Washington county between 3-9%.
	3.	The youth unemployment rate has hit a 52-year low.
	4.	For the first time EVER in America, there are more job openings than people looking for work. 
In our economy built for growth, students and recent graduates are Better Off Now. Students are graduating with the best job market in years and employers are competing for good, well-educated employees.

Thanks, ￼ Cathy McMorris Rodgers Member of Congress

Dear Neighbor,
We recently stopped by the Salvation Army Anew Center in Jamestown to discuss the reauthorization of Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).
With October being the National Domestic Violence Awareness Month we recognize the importance of bringing sunshine to a topic that affects millions of Americans of any gender, age, race, religion and socio-economic background.  
We signed onto a letter with 46 other Republicans calling for a bipartisan reauthorization of VAWA and we are confident that the continuing resolution will be passed before the December 7th, 2018, deadline.
We care about the women in our community who have been impacted by domestic and sexual violence.
Studies show one in five women and one in seventy-one men will be raped in their lifetime, with children and young adults being most at risk of sexual assault.
In April, along with Congresswoman Jackie Speier (CA-14)  and 24 of our colleagues, we introduced a bipartisan Congressional Resolution recognizing April as Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month.
Legislation we have supported to prevent domestic and sexual violence include, but are not limited to:
The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act which reauthorizes:
	•	The National Domestic Violence Hotline
	•	Grants that go to states and organizations to assist victims of domestic violence and their children
	•	Domestic Violence prevention programs
Combat Online Predators Act
	•	Adds five years to the maximum prison sentence for stalking minors
	•	Requires the Department of Justice to report to Congress on federal, state, tribal, and local efforts to enforce laws related to stalking.
Pro bono Work to Empower and Represent (POWER) Act 
	•	Requires the U.S. Attorney's office in each judicial district to conduct, at least annually, a public event to promote pro bono legal services for survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.
Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017
	•	Mandating reporting, within 24 hours, of a child and sexual abuse in amateur athletics organizations to local or federal law enforcement, or a child-welfare agency.   
	•	Increase civil remedies for personal injuries.
	•	Designates the United State Center for Safe Sport as the independent national safe sport organization for the United States.
If you or someone you know has been impacted by domestic violence or sexual assault, please contact local law enforcement to report this crime.  Additional resources are available for survivors. To learn more, contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800- 799-SAFE (7233) or the National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline for safe and confidential help at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673).

As always, please reach out to any of our offices if you need assistance.

Until next time,

ICYMI: PRESIDENT SIGNS PHARMACY BILL PUSHED BY REP. CARTER

Friends, 

Earlier this week I joined President Trump as he signed my proposal to ban ""gag clause"" provisions into law. Yesterday, I spoke with the Savannah Morning News about how important this legislation is to ensure patients have access to the best and lowest cost options when medication is needed. In case you missed it, click here to read the article. 

As always, thank you for the honor to serve.

President signs pharmacy bill pushed by Rep. Carter
By: DeAnn Komanecky
October 11, 2018

Paying for your prescriptions might be a bit cheaper soon thanks to legislation championed by U.S. Congressman Buddy Carter, R-1.

The legislation removing what is known as the “gag clause,” was signed into law by President Donald Trump on Wednesday.

Carter has worked on the legislation for a quite a while, he said.

“It’s been a long process.”

The gag clause allowed pharmacy benefit managers to prohibit pharmacists from letting patients know their medication could be cheaper by not using their insurance. If pharmacists violated the gag clause rule in their contracts with the insurer, the pharmacist could be kicked out of the network, Carter said.

Carter, the only pharmacist in Congress, said getting rid of the gag clause is great news.

“It is a great day for patients,” said Carter. “I know firsthand how important it is for pharmacists to have the ability to work with patients to figure out what is in their best interest. Banning “gag clauses” will help ensure that is possible by allowing pharmacists to help patients access the lowest cost options.”

Carter said the legislation was a bi-partisan effort with Michigan’s Democratic senator, Debbie Stabenow, sponsoring the bill, S. 2553, Know the Lowest Price Act. S.2553 prohibits gag clause provisions in Medicare. A related bill, S. 2554, The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, prohibits gag clause provisions in group and individual health plans. S. 2554 was sponsored by Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican.

“High drug costs impact everyone,” Carter said.

Carter said Sen. Stabenow has had personal experience in prescription price differences in and outside of insurance.

“This is an extreme example, but her husband is ill and his $1,300 prescription cost through insurance was only $40 if she paid cash,” Carter said. “There is no legitimate reason for that to happen, but it does.”

Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar had high praise for Georgia’s Representative during a call-in to a radio show, WTKS, on Thursday.

In part, he said, “Buddy Carter was a real champion of this, he’s been the one calling attention to this outrage that was happening and so much of the credit goes to him as well as the president for taking this up. What it is – these insurance companies were telling pharmacists that they couldn’t tell their patients that they could get their drug for cheaper, just by paying out of pocket than using their insurance. Now that’s outlawed. Now those gag clauses can’t be used and you can ask your pharmacist – could I pay less and that’s thanks to the president and bipartisan actions of Congress.”

President Trump also thanked Carter during the bill’s signing.

″...Somebody that’s really worked hard, I’ve heard this for a long time, Representative Buddy Carter, really worked, thank you Buddy,” regarding the gag clause legislation.

Carter said removing the gag clause is just the beginning.

“This is just the start,” Carter said. “We are going to be working with the president to bring down prescription drug costs.”

NEWS FROM THE FIRST DISTRICT
Dear Friends, 
victims of sexual violence, secure our schools, and help children impacted by the opioid crisis. The City of Manchester will also be receiving nearly $1.6 million to prepare students for postsecondary education. 
The week before last in Washington, I introduced legislation to address wildlife diseases that hurt species we need for pollination, like the Little Brown Bat, which has been devastated by white-nose syndrome in New Hampshire. And in the district, I presented Korean War Veteran Donald Medbery with four service medals he earned while serving in the US Air Force. 
Presenting Donald Medbery with his service medals 
This week, I presented Korean War Veteran Donald Medbery with four service medals he earned while serving in the US Air Force and Air Force Reserve from 1953-1960. Mr. Medbery is an American patriot, and we are all inspired by his service. Mr. Medbery earned the Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Korean Service Medal, and the United Nations ‘Korean’ Service Medal. Like many veterans from the Korean War era, Mr. Medbery did not receive the medals he was awarded while he was serving, and his records were lost in the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) fire in 1973. At my request, and with supporting documents provided by Mr. Medbery, the NPRC authorized the shipment of Mr. Medbery’s medals. Like all of the other veterans we have had the pleasure of serving in our office, he is modest about his service but happy to tell the funny stories. It was a great honor to present him with his medals. 
￼ 
Standing up for Wildlife Refuges and working to address wildlife diseases 
Last week, I led a letter with the top Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee, Raul Grijalva, to the National Wildlife Refuge System requesting additional information on their decision to disarm refuge managers who also have a law enforcement role stopping illegal hunting and other illegal activities on refuge lands. I am concerned that removing these dual function officers, and replacing them with fewer full-time officers, will lead to less geographic coverage for the more than 560 refuges across the United States and could put them in danger.  
I also introduced legislation that would help address wildlife diseases that are devastating important species. In New Hampshire, only one Little Brown Bat was found this past winter compared to the more than 3,000 that would regularly hibernate before the population was decimated by white-nose syndrome. Wildlife diseases are a threat to our nation’s economy, food security, and environmental health. The Interior Department has to have the ability to monitor wildlife diseases and coordinate an effective response to these emergencies as they arise. This bill would help address the threats posed by wildlife diseases by allowing the Interior Department to declare and rapidly coordinate responses to wildlife disease emergencies such as white-nose syndrome, which have devastated bat populations in places around the country. My legislation would create a federal Wildlife Disease Committee to help federal agencies and state governments respond to these diseases, and it would establish a grant program to fund states’ efforts to counter these diseases.
Calling for faster action from DOD to replace dangerous PFC-based firefighting foam 
While I appreciate the Department of Defense’s efforts to address PFAS contamination and to develop and field a replacement firefighting foam that does not contain PFAS chemicals, it is clear that this work will take many more years and is not progressing as quickly as is needed. I secured a provision in this year’s Defense Authorization to require DoD to brief Congress on its efforts to replace this foam, and I expect this briefing to show considerably more progress towards attaining our shared goal of reducing the use of this dangerous foam. I commend those in New Hampshire and across the country who are speaking up and demanding action, and I agree with Ms. Amico, the founder of Testing for Pease, that these chemicals do not deserve the benefit of the doubt. Those who have polluted our groundwater, including DoD, must pay for the costs of cleaning up the contamination and for ensuring that the public has all the information it needs about these chemicals and their health impacts.
Funding programs that support victims of sexual assault 
Law enforcement must have the tools and resources it needs to investigate sexual assault cases, and this $650,000 in funding from the US Department of Justice will help our police departments and victims seek justice. I was pleased to announce this federal funding last week, which will help address the backlog of untested sexual assault kits. With these grants, the New Hampshire DOJ will also hire a specialist to work with victims to ensure their cases are investigated, and it will create an online system to allow victims to easily see the status of their assault kit test. It’s so important that victims have confidence that their assault kits will be tested and their cases investigated, and this funding will help our state achieve this goal.
Helping Manchester students 
Last week, the Congressional Delegation announced that the City of Manchester will be receiving nearly $1.6 million to help prepare students for postsecondary education. Too many middle and high school students struggle to access the support they need to help them prepare for secondary and higher education. By funding innovative approaches and traditional teaching supports, this grant from the US Department of Education will help current sixth- and seventh-graders throughout their time in Manchester’s schools to be better prepared for the next steps in their education. Congratulations to the City of Manchester, the New Hampshire College and University Council, and all those who partnered to design the GEAR UP Manchester program. This grant will help give these children a bright future. 
Supporting children impacted by the opioid crisis 
I was pleased to announce last week that the New Hampshire Department of Justice will be receiving $750,000 to bolster services for children who have been impacted by the opioid crisis. The opioid crisis doesn’t discriminate based on age, and children are especially vulnerable to the impacts of this devastating epidemic. I am pleased that our state will be receiving this essential federal funding to provide Manchester children with the support they need. These services will include mental health care in schools, trauma support groups for students, and training for school staff to help students who are exposed to trauma, including the trauma that occurs when a close family member is struggling with a substance use disorder. 
Protecting students in the classroom 
All children have a right to safe schools and classrooms. I am pleased that the Federal Bureau of Justice Assistance at the US Department of Justice has awarded $1.25 million to New Hampshire to help protect our students by supporting crisis training, threat assessment, and intervention response programs that prevent and stop violence in schools. These are important programs that need to be funded, but Congress must also take action to help stop gun violence by passing common sense reforms. 
Closing thoughts 
Last Monday was World Lung Day, when we highlighted the importance of healthy lungs and the need to prevent and find a cure for lung diseases. My interest in lung health has driven many of the issues I’ve worked on, from starting the Congressional Asthma and Allergy Caucus, to helping pass the Affordable Care Act and limiting the Defense Department’s use of burn pits overseas. www.Lung.org   
Last Monday was also National Voter Registration Day! Please take a moment to make sure you and your family are registered to vote. For more information, visit: https://www.usa.gov/register-to-vote 
It was great to run into veteran advocates from the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) New Hampshire at the Deerfield Fair! Thank you for continuing to serve our nation by helping other veterans. https://www.dav.org/

Dear friends,
Georgia and our neighboring states had a tough week as Hurricane Michael made landfall, devastating homes, lives and farms. 
President Trump approved our state’s disaster declaration request for 108 Georgia counties, responding to Governor Deal’s requests and our supporting letter urging expedited emergency resources to aid counties in Georgia expected to be impacted by Hurricane Michael. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also approved Georgia’s Public Health Emergency declaration on Thursday.
We remain in close communication with Governor Deal, and Senator Perdue and I will work together in the Senate and do all we can to support preparedness, response and recovery efforts. 
As recovery efforts continue, we keep our neighbors in our prayers. 
Additional hurricane recovery resources can be found below.
	•	Call 911 for emergencies. 
	•	Visit the American Red Cross’s Safe and Well site to check in, and to find missing individuals.
	•	Report power outages by contacting your power provider. The two main providers in Georgia are:
	◦	Georgia Power (contact here or at 888-891-0938)
	◦	Georgia electric membership cooperatives (EMCs) (find your local branch here)
	•	Check the status of road closures and plan your routes using Georgia 511.
	•	Farmers should contact their local Farm Service Agency or U.S. Department of Agriculture Disaster Assistance Programs.
	•	View information regarding the National Flood Insurance Program online here.
	•	For up-to-date resources and information on the federal response, visit the Federal Emergency Management Agency online here. 
	•	For up-to-date resources and information on the state’s response, visit the Georgia Emergency Management & Homeland Security Agency here. 
	•	The Georgia Attorney General’s office has recommendations online to avoid scams including home repair fraud, illegitimate charities and resources to report price gouging.
	•	The Disaster Distress Helpline has been made available by the Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to assist residents in impacted areas. To connect with a trained crisis counselor, call 1-800-985-5990 or text: “TalkWithUs” to 66746.
Passage of Water Resources Bill
On Wednesday, the Senate overwhelmingly passed comprehensive water infrastructure legislation, which provides additional resources for Georgia’s ports and coastal areas, promotes our nation’s infrastructure and commerce, and invests in the safety and reliability of our drinking water. 
The America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 updates funding authorization for water infrastructure priorities to better reflect current needs and more efficiently use taxpayer money.  
I’m glad to see this legislation pass to help our economy, our coastal communities and our ports - including the Port of Savannah. As our ports continue to set new records for commerce, the America’s Water Infrastructure Act will help ensure there is no last-minute bureaucratic hurdle to completing the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project on time.
More Healthcare Choices For Consumers
On Wednesday, I joined my Senate colleagues in rejecting legislation that would have blocked an important Trump administration rule giving consumers better options and more protection when they purchase short-term limited-duration healthcare plans, a lower-cost alternative to the Obamacare marketplace. 
Americans want and need more options for health care coverage - not fewer. This rule is an important step forward to get more affordable health care for some who don’t currently have access, and it’s critical that we keep it in place. This commonsense opportunity allows consumers more options that fit their needs, often at a lower cost. And one need not look far for proof that they are needed, because thousands of consumers purchased these plans before they were restricted by the Obama administration. 
If adopted, this resolution would have taken away health coverage from Americans enrolled in short-term plans, eliminated consumer protections, and forced people into one-size-fits-all Obamacare plans that too often don’t cover the doctors or hospitals they need.
In Other News
	•	Last Saturday, the Senate voted to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. Justice Kavanaugh is a talented and experienced jurist, and I am confident he will bring a strong commitment to the Constitution and the rule of law to the Supreme Court.
￼
	•	On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed into law the Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2018, bipartisan legislation I introduced to increase veterans’ disability benefits from the VA. Our men and women in uniform have sacrificed greatly, and it is our duty to make sure our disabled veterans and their families are provided the benefits they have earned. 
	•	On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed into law the Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act of 2018, bipartisan legislation I introduced to reform the U.S. Peace Corps by improving access to medical care for volunteers, strengthening accountability and oversight, and enhancing procedures to reduce the risk of crime where volunteers serve. This legislation builds on the reforms we made to better protect our volunteers through the Kate Puzey Peace Corps Volunteer Protection Act of 2011, which I introduced in honor of a Peace Corps volunteer from Georgia and that was signed into law previously. I appreciate the president’s commitment to providing greater protection and safety for our Peace Corps volunteers whose work and goodwill produce results for both the communities they serve and the United States. 
	•	On Wednesday, President Trump also signed the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act into law to improve price transparency and fix incentives that have driven up the cost of prescription drugs. This will help pharmacists provide drug pricing information with patients.
	•	On Thursday, President Trump signed the Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act into law. I was proud to support music licensing law reform for the 21st century and create a fairer marketplace for songwriters and other content creators. 
	•	On Thursday, the Senate confirmed Judge William M. “Billy” Ray, II, of Grayson, Ga., to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Billy Ray has an outstanding history of service to Georgia in our state Legislature and on the bench and a history of getting things done. He created ‘Heidi’s Law’ in Georgia to tighten penalties in repeat DUI cases, and he created the drug court in Gwinnett County. I’m pleased the Senate confirmed Judge Ray and look forward to his continued service.
	•	On Thursday, the president also signed the Global Food Security Reauthorization Act into law. This bipartisan legislation that I introduced in the Senate will keep this lifesaving food security program in place through 2023. The legislation streamlines the whole-of-government approach to addressing hunger and food insecurity across the globe. Food insecurity leads to instability and violence, so helping our neighbors abroad bolsters our security by strengthening U.S. influence and fostering stability. This program is designed to ensure a maximum return on our foreign assistance and also allows our farmers and researchers in Georgia to share their knowledge and benefit from these investments.
What’s on Tap?
The Senate has adjourned until after the November 6 elections.

10/12/18 17:22,Defending Montana Against Junk Health Insurance Plans," ￼    ￼   ￼

￼
A complete sham.  That is exactly what big, out-of-state insurance companies are trying to sell Montanans.
￼
These insurance companies are flooding our state with junk health insurance plans that cost Montanans money, but don’t cover our most basic health care needs.  These plans are marketed to Montanans as cheap insurance that will keep families healthy, but they will leave you hanging when you need it the most.   That’s why this week, I took to the Senate floor to stop the expansion of these junk plans, but Congress fell one vote short.  As a result of this vote, these short-term plans, which were designed to fill the gaps in coverage for a few months, are now available to be purchased for years.   If you read the fine print, you will discover that dialysis, blood pressure pills, and x-rays aren’t covered. In fact, most things aren’t.  These plans also aren’t required to cover care for patients with preexisting conditions like asthma, cancer, and diabetes.  The cost of health care is already way too high, and now big insurance companies are getting a free pass to sell Montanans health care plans that don’t cover the care they need. Simply put, these plans are junk.   That is why I am working to hold these insurance companies accountable and I will defend Montanan from the harmful health care decisions being made by Washington politicians who don’t understand Montana.  I am working to lower the cost of health care and ensure that every Montanan family is able to see a doctor without breaking the bank.  I won’t stop fighting until we stop insurance companies from selling garbage plans that don’t cover preexisting conditions.

10/12/18 17:14,Learning From You: An Update from Congressman Newhouse,"News from Congressman Dan Newhouse
￼  
Preserving Native Culture 
￼ 
I had the opportunity to visit and tour the Yakama Nation Tribal School in Toppenish. The Yakama Nation strives to instill cultural awareness and pride to the students and the surrounding communities, which was apparent by the traditional dance they performed as a welcome. The school currently serves students from 8th to 12th grade, but the school board is hoping to expand their resources to teach younger students as well. We discussed the different ways the federal government can help the school achieve their goal of providing high quality education and life skills to students while preserving their native culture for future generations.  
Expanding Resources for Students 
￼ 
I met with Omak School District staff to discuss the importance of vocational and technical education programs for students entering the workforce, as well as options for expanding these opportunities in North Central Washington. We discussed the importance of Impact Aid funding for school districts like Omak, and I toured several of their facilities to learn how they are managing a growing student population with limited resources. Impact Aid provides federal funds to schools in areas that are highly impacted by public land, like Okanogan County. I recently voted to support increased Impact Aid funding as part of the Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill that was signed into law by President Trump. This bill provided $1.4 billion - an increase of $32 million above the FY18 level. 
Progress for the Methow Headwaters 
￼ 
The U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has announced a public meeting on the Methow Valley Headwaters' mineral withdrawal application. The notice issued in the Federal Register reopens the public comment period on the withdrawal proposal until November 13, 2018. BLM also announced that a public meeting to discuss the Methow Valley Headwaters' mineral withdrawal will be held at 6 p.m. on November 13 at the Red Barn in Winthrop, located at 51 North Highway 20.  
The public meeting is the last step BLM must complete before a final recommendation on the withdrawal is made by Joe Balash, the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management, to the U.S. Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke. I thank BLM for responding to my request to initiate this major step for the Methow Valley Headwaters mineral withdrawal application. Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to meet with folks in the Methow Valley, like Mayor Ing-Moody and Maggie Coon, to witness - once again - the natural wonder of the region. I encourage local community members to attend this public meeting and have their voices heard. Click here for more information. 
The Birthplace of Smokejumping 
￼ 
I toured the North Cascades Smokejumpers Base at Methow Valley State Airport and met with the North Cascades Smokejumper Base Working Group. We discussed recent federal grants that will provide additional space for aircraft parking and meet Federal Aviation Administration standards. These upgrades are vital for keeping the historic base in Winthrop where it belongs. Read more about the recently awarded grants here. 
Victories for Farmers 
￼
I was invited to address the Okanogan County Farm Bureau at their annual meeting in Omak. I was excited to share the progress being made on issues that are important to Central Washington. Last week, President Trump announced the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is vital to Washington's robust export market. 30% of our apples, 25% of our cherries, and 90% of our wheat are exported, and maintaining a strong relationship with our closest trading partners is essential for our farmers and ranchers. We also discussed the importance of sending a completed Farm Bill to the President's desk. While many of the programs in the Farm Bill will continue to operate through the crop year, we must reauthorize it to provide certainty and stability to farmers, producers, and stakeholders.  
Economic Development in Douglas County 
￼ 
I gathered with local business owners in Douglas County to discuss the successes and challenges of small businesses in the region, as well as some of the ongoing economic development projects. The roundtable was hosted by the Ports of Chelan and Douglas Counties, and there were representatives from a wide variety of industries - from grain growers and distilleries to technology and retail companies. I appreciate the opportunity to connect and learn from business owners first-hand in Central Washington. 
￼  I had a great time with Soren and Cyprus in Omak. We shared chocolate chip cookies (my favorite) and many laughs. Thank you for brightening my day!   
Thank you for reading this e-news update. It is an honor and privilege to serve you in Congress. 
Sincerely, ￼  Dan Newhouse Member of Congress

Press Release of the Week: Judge Brett Kavanaugh Confirmed as Supreme Court Justice
 
 
Rep. Loudermilk (R-GA) issued the following statement after the Senate voted to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court: 

“My colleagues in the Senate did the right thing, confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh has led an exemplary life; as a family man and a career judge. 

""His road to confirmation was paved by the most comprehensive review of a Supreme Court nominee in history; seven FBI background checks, 36 hours of testimony before the Senate, and more than 500,000 pages of Executive Branch documents - more than the last four nominees combined.

Combating Human Trafficking in Tennessee 
This morning, I had the pleasure of joining my good friend, Senator Bob Corker in Chattanooga for a discussion with Second Life Tennessee on what organizations in Tennessee are doing to combat modern slavery and human trafficking. As an original cosponsor of the legislation that was passed by both chambers and signed into law by President Trump earlier this year, I have been working on solutions to end human trafficking for many years. Protections granted to tech companies made sense in the early days of the internet – when websites were hardly more than message boards – but now that the industry has matured, and it’s time to reassess whether those protections are still practical.
￼
While Backpage, a website that knowingly facilitated sex trafficking, has finally been shut down, there is still much more work to be done at home and abroad. I will continue to be involved in the fight against human trafficking and remain committed to protecting the safety and security of Tennesseans and Americans everywhere.


President Signs Music Modernization Act Into Law
I have had the honor and privilege of representing the Nashville area for many years. It’s a wonderful place, where men and women have flocked to chase their dreams. Throughout my time in Congress, I have been a champion for singers, songwriters, producers, and everyone else who is a part of the creative process. After achieving near impossible levels of success, these artists deserve to be fairly compensated for their work.

￼
This week, President Trump took a huge step towards achieving that goal by signing the Music Modernization Act. It is one of the most significant pieces of copyright legislation to ever come through this chamber. I am so proud to have been an original cosponsor of this bill. Our music industry will thrive under a regime that balances the need to incorporate modern technologies with a respect for copyright, and all that goes into creating a song.
Thank you President Trump for signing this wonderful legislation into law!
Social Security Announces Cost-of-Living Increases For 2019
The Social Security Administration announced the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) on Thursday.  In order to cover the increase in the cost of living rises, Social Security and SSI benefits will increase by 2.8% in 2019.

This year, you will still receive your COLA notice by mail. In the future, you will be able to choose whether you receive your notice online instead of on paper.  You can learn more HERE. 

Senate Confirms Two Tennessee Federal Judges 
After much delay, the U.S. Senate has finally confirmed two qualified Tennesseans to serve as federal District Court judges on our state’s highest courts. Last night, Eli Richardson was confirmed as U.S. District Judge for the Middle District of Tennessee, and Mark Saalfield Norris, Sr. was confirmed as U.S. District Judge for the Western District of Tennessee. I am confident that both judges will be great assets to the federal bench. Most recently serving as Senate Majority Leader in the Tennessee state legislature as well as Chairman of the Council of State Governments, Mark Norris has been a well-respected leader in Tennessee and staunch advocate for federalism and the separation of powers for many years. Eli Richardson brings a wealth of professional experience to the bench, having served as a litigator, FBI special agent, and federal prosecutor in Tennessee’s Middle District. With extensive records of service to our state, Tennessee is fortunate to have such uniquely qualified leaders for these positions and I grateful that the Senate took action last night to confirm them.


Bipartisan Water Infrastructure Package Headed to President's Desk 
On Wednesday, the Senate passed America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, a major infrastructure package, by a vote of 99-1. I The bill now heads to President Trump’s desk for his signature. Part of this package included the Water Resources Development Act of 2018, or “WRDA,” which I voted for in the House in June. In Tennessee, we know all too well that our inland waterways, locks, dams, and flood protection infrastructure are critical to our state’s continued economic security and growth. This bill authorizes vital improvements to our nation’s inland waterways, and reauthorizes the Safe Drinking Water Act for the first time in two decades, ensuring our communities have safe, reliable drinking water available. It also promotes hydropower development, which creates clean energy jobs here at home and provides consumers with low-cost, emissions-free electricity. Overall, this package represents a major step toward meeting the challenge of improving our nation’s infrastructure. We must continue to find fiscally responsible ways to provide locally driven, but nationally important investments in our water resources infrastructure.


Happy National Farmers Day
Today, we honor all of our hard-working farmers and ranchers in Tennessee and across the nation that feed our families and keep our economy running. The agriculture industry is crucial in Tennessee. 80 percent of our states’ land is used for agriculture or forestry purposes, and 95 percent of Tennessee farms are small family operations, contributing approximately $74.8 billion to our state’s economy each year. I have fought in Congress for years to protect our farmers and get rid of burdensome, one-size-fits-all regulations that threaten the livelihood of many family farms across the state. Today, we say thank you to all those farmers who work around the clock to make sure we have the food and fuel that we depend on.

Celebrating 243 Years of the U.S. Navy 
Tomorrow marks the United States Navy’s 243rd birthday. Established in in early days of the American Revolution, the U.S. Navy continues to be one of our nation’s greatest military assets, and a force to be reckoned with across the globe. We thank all of the
men and women of the U.S. Navy for their service in defending our great nation.
Your sacrifice does not go unnoticed. Happy 243rd Birthday, and God bless our troops!

Judge Kavanaugh’s Confirmation to the Supreme Court 
I am deeply disappointed by the Senate’s confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court last week, after a drawn-out and partisan process. Judge Kavanaugh’s combative and often misleading testimony before the Senate Judiciary committee made it clear that he is not the impartial voice that the Supreme Court needs, and he is not the voice that the majority of Americans want. 
I am grateful to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford for the selflessness and courage she showed by coming forward with her story. Her testimony was clear, confident, and credible, and her bravery and poise inspiring. It is extremely difficult to share a traumatic personal story, let alone to do so in front of the United States Senate and the American people. She is an example to us all, and a reminder of our moral obligation to support survivors. 
The United Nations’ Dire Warning on Climate Change 
This week the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change—a group of scientists convened by the United Nations—released a deeply troubling report on the immediate threats that climate change poses to the planet absent drastic measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The report warns of severe droughts, larger wildfires, food shortages, coral reef die-offs, and other environmental degradation as early as 2040. The authors warn that avoiding the most serious damage will require transforming the world economy within just a few years, in order to prevent the atmosphere from warming 2.7 degrees above preindustrial levels. 
The authors note that while the economic and technological changes needed to avoid this level of warming are technically possible, they will be incredibly challenging to achieve politically. The findings of this scientific panel reiterate the fact that this is a make or break moment for the future of the planet. I’m proud of the work that California and a handful of other states have done in this regard, but without nationwide and global leadership, we’re all in real danger.
You can read the IPCC’s full report here. 
Opposing Polluter-Friendly Methane Regulations 
Last week, I co-led a letter to President Trump urging him to cancel two polluter-friendly rulemakings on methane emissions—one at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the other at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). 
The proposed EPA rulemaking would weaken leak inspection and repair requirements for oil and gas operations, and the proposed BLM rule guts measures designed to reduce methane venting, flaring and leaks from oil and gas operations on public lands – a move that BLM itself has said will permit the waste of nearly $1 billion worth of publicly owned natural gas.
Unchecked methane emissions are erasing any climate benefits natural gas has to offer, and without strong regulations in place, there is no productive role for the fuel to play in a low-carbon future.  
To read the full letter, click here. 
￼
The Trump Administration is seeking to ease the standards for methane emissions on public lands.  
Defending President Obama’s Clean Power Plan 
As co-chair of the Safe Climate Caucus, I recently led a letter signed by 50 caucus members to Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler urging him to rescind the Agency’s proposed Affordable Clean Energy Rule. This proposed rule would replace the Obama Administration’s Clean Power Plan, which set the first ever national limits on carbon pollution from power plants. 
The letter cites overwhelming scientific evidence, including the EPA’s own analysis, which indicated the rule would be detrimental to public health and climate change. According to even the Trump Administration’s own EPA, the proposed rule would also result in more than 1,600 deaths by 2030. 
At a time when the world is facing record heat waves and droughts, wildfires and hurricanes of unprecedented size and frequency, rising sea levels, and a surge in other extreme weather patterns, it is unthinkable that the Trump Administration would propose regulations that will exacerbate the impacts of climate change and risk the welfare of the American people. The Clean Power Plan was a crucial step toward reducing the deadly climate-changing pollution produced by power plants.  Although it is highly unlikely, I hope that the EPA will decide to side with the 70 percent of Americans who support strict limits on carbon pollution of existing power plants, and abandon plans to replace the Clean Power Plan with a plan that worsens the American public’s health and welfare. 
A signed copy of the full letter is available here.

Each week hundreds of constituents contact my office to share their views on a variety of topics. I have recently received many messages from constituents expressing their express their support for the Ban Nerve Agents in Our Food Act. Below is a portion of my response to those messages: 
  
“I support this bill, which would ban the use of organophosphate pesticides in the United States. Organophosphates have been linked to neurological damage, respiratory illnesses such as asthma and other chronic and debilitating diseases. 
I am concerned about the effect of toxic and harmful chemical exposure on public health, and the responsible use of pesticides in agriculture.  Because of my concern, I am also a cosponsor of the Saving America’s Pollinators Act to suspend the use of certain insecticides that are harmful to pollinating insects like bees. 
During my time in Congress, I have continuously prioritized the protection of the environment and the health of our communities and will continue to do so.”

The Presidential Succession Act of 1947   Continuing our Congress U look at important federal legislation through the years, I wanted to take a look this week at the Presidential Succession Act (PSA) of 1947. Taken up shortly after the death of President Franklin Roosevelt, this law remains our nation's current succession rule for the office of the presidency. 
The original Presidential Succession Act was passed in 1792, and said that in the event of the removal, resignation, death, or inability of the president, the vice-president would take over. If there was no vice president (a situation which has happened numerous times), the PSA set the next in line as the president pro tempore of the United States Senate, followed by the speaker of the House. 
Over a period of four years in the mid-1880s, there were two instances in which there was no vice president, president pro tempore of the Senate, or speaker of the House to take over if something had happened to the president (in this case, under President Chester Arthur in 1881, and again under President Grover Cleveland in 1885). 
This prompted the passage of a new PSA in 1886, which replaced the president pro tempore of the Senate and the speaker of the House with the members of the presidential cabinet. The order of succession was determined by the order in which each cabinet department had been created (Secretary of State was first in line after the vice president). 
During the 61 years the PSA of 1886 remained in effect, there were six instances of the office of the vice president being vacant, including nearly four years of vacancy after President Truman succeeded President Roosevelt. 
The PSA of 1947, which was signed into law by President Truman and remains in effect today, reset the line of succession after the vice president as: the speaker of the House, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then the cabinet secretaries in order of each department's creation. It also required that anyone succeeding to the presidency must meet the requirements of the office of president as set down in the Constitution. 
The PSA of 1947 has been amended several times since, mainly to add cabinet offices in the line of succession as these offices have been created. The last added was the Secretary of Homeland Security, which joined the list in 2002.

10/12/18 17:07,Fighting the Opioid Epidemic,"
  
￼
Dear Neighbors,
When I travel throughout New Jersey, I hear constantly about the opioid epidemic that is devastating our communities. More than 2,200 people died from drug overdoses in 2016, nearly a 40 percent increase in the death toll from the previous year. Thousands more individuals and families face the debilitating realities of addiction. That is why I have made it a priority to address the opioid epidemic in Congress.
As the Ranking Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees health care, I was proud to work on bipartisan legislation that was signed into law in 2016, providing billions in grants to states to fight this crisis. Last month, I helped pass reforms that will improve our efforts to advance treatment and recovery initiatives, improve prevention, and bolster our efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl. The president is expected to sign this legislation into law.
One provision I authored helps Medicare to cover Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) and medication-assisted treatment (MAT). This will help pay for necessary medications, counseling, and testing to treat substance abuse. Another provision I authored will give the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the ability to take action against illicit controlled substances coming in through International Mail Facilities across the country. 
￼

Rep. Pallone at the International Mail Facility in Secaucus. Pallone’s SCREEN Act will take a number of important steps to increase funding to combat illicit opioid importation.
While these are important steps, I believe that Congress must do more to provide funding to fight the epidemic and provide increased access to treatment for families. I also remain concerned that attempts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act and roll back Medicaid will reduce access to treatment for millions, including those with substance use disorder.
We can also all do more to make sure that excess prescription and over-the-counter drugs do not fall into the wrong hands and contribute to the opioid epidemic. This week at a Walgreens in West Long Branch, I met with health leaders to discuss how we can prevent drug overdose deaths and make our communities safer by discarding these medications.
The Walgreens Safe Medication Disposal Program has disposed of more than 270 tons of unwanted medications since the launch of their program. There will be a total of 25 disposal sites in New Jersey that will allow individuals to safely dispose of prescriptions at no cost. You can learn more about the program here.
I will continue do everything within my power to continue to fight for funding and access to treatment.  I also want to know what YOU think we should be doing to combat the opioid epidemic. Please share your thoughts with me by responding to this email.
 Sincerely,
 Congressman Frank Pallone

Confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court is one of the most important things we have done in my 42 years in the Senate. Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation sent a strong message to the country that civility, due process, and the integrity of our institutions matter.

While the American people will not soon forget the unfair and unjust behavior that led us to one of the Senate’s lowest points in decades, we took an important step in overcoming the politics of personal destruction.

Long’s Short Report – The crisis next door
By Rep. Billy Long
Of my 434 colleagues in the House of Representatives, I can’t think of one that won’t try and convince you that their Congressional District has the worst opioid problem in the U.S. We all have horrific stories to relate of friends or family or constituents lost to this scourge. With such a widespread problem that stretches across all demographics, it’s easy to understand why this is a problem we are addressing on a bipartisan basis, which is extremely rare in today’s Washington, D.C. 
One of my proudest accomplishments in Congress was the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, which passed with a huge bipartisan majority. With 10,000 diseases and only 500 cures, it’s easy to see how we worked across the aisle and achieved a good result as we have with the opioid epidemic too.
Each day, more than 115 people die in the U.S. from this epidemic. And sadly, Missouri is no exception. In 2016 alone, there were 903 opioid-related deaths, which was a 35 percent increase from the previous year. This deadly epidemic has hit every part of the state, including Greene County, which has been one of the hardest hit counties in the state.
Over the past several years, the Energy and Commerce Committee, which I sit on, has been one of the leaders in Congress fighting this issue. The committee has worked on identifying issues and solutions that ultimately led to the passage of more than 60 bills addressing this epidemic. Nearly every bill passed with bipartisan support in the committee.
Just recently, both the House and the Senate passed H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which included the more than 60 bills passed in committee rolled into one. This bill targets five areas: treatment, recovery, prevention, communities and combatting fentanyl, which is 100 times more potent than morphine, which is a widely used opiate.
Specifically, H.R. 6 would offer additional grants to communities to help fight this epidemic by creating recovery centers for those struggling with addiction, increase access to telehealth technologies, which is especially helpful in rural areas like Missouri’s 7th Congressional District, allow the National Institutes of Health to research alternative, non-addictive drugs for pain management as well as authorize additional grants to help local authorities better detect fentanyl and synthetic opioids. 
It’s legislation like H.R. 6 that reminds me once again of the great work Congress can accomplish when we put politics aside. I look forward to watching this bill being signed into law by President Trump.

NEWSLETTER-MN07: Updates

￼
 
Dear Friends,
 
This week, the White House announced a plan to allow higher blends of ethanol to be sold year-round. I have been advocating for this change for quite some time because farmers in my district are well-suited to benefit from E15 being sold during the summer months. I hope this development will encourage Members of Congress to pass legislation to permanently fix this problem. October 12 is National Farmers Day, so be sure to acknowledge a farmer in your community for everything they do to provide us with an abundant food supply.
 
Sincerely,
￼ Congressman Collin C. Peterson
Minnesota 7th District
 
Year-Round E15 Sales
￼
 
On Tuesday, the Administration announced that they directed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to allow year-round sales of fuel blends containing 15 percent ethanol. Year-round sales of E15 will provide a needed boost to the ethanol industry and give corn farmers access to a broader segment of the domestic fuels market. This decision will provide some relief at a time when farmers are struggling with depressed commodity prices, adverse weather conditions, and an ongoing trade war. I’ve been a consistent advocate for E15. I founded the Congressional Biofuels Caucus to educate my Congressional colleagues and work with the Executive Branch on the benefits of promoting American-grown biofuels. Since that time, the Caucus and I pushed the Trump and Obama Administrations, met with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, and cosponsored legislation to require the year-round sale of E15. I am glad to see this step in the right direction, however, this administrative action will likely get tied up in the courts, so passing legislation remains the most reliable avenue to finally getting this done.
 
Adams on Agriculture
￼
 
I sat down with Mike Adams to talk about the Farm Bill and where we are in the process of getting a new bill passed this year. I told Mike that we are still working together closely, both at the member and the staff level, to close out different titles of the bill and get ourselves to a place where we can have the process completed in mid-November. It’s important to see this process through and get it finished in 2018, rather than let it continue into next year, given the challenges that farmers face both locally here in the Seventh and across the country.

Counting for Dollars: Census-Guided Financial Assistance to Rural Areas
￼
 
This week, I co-hosted a briefing on the rural impact of the decennial census with Representative Tim Walz (D-MN) as part of the Congressional Rural Caucus. A new study announced that $31 billion in federal funding is guided to rural areas each year through census data. Dr. Andrew Reamer of the George Washington Institute of Public Policy, Howard Fienberg of The Census Project, and Arthur Scott of the National Association of Counties spoke about the impact this funding has on our rural communities. The data gathered by the 2020 census will determine Minnesota’s eligibility for grant and loan programs, define rural areas, and factor into dozens of federal, state, and local government decisions.
 
Uponor Hutchinson Facility Ribbon Cutting
￼
 
This Thursday, Uponor North America hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony and plant tour in celebration of its newest facility, a 237,000 square foot facility in Hutchinson. Uponor manufactures piping products that are used in everything from heating and cooling systems to drinking water and fire sprinkler systems. The event also highlighted Uponor’s commitment to Career and Technical Education. As part of this effort, Uponor is partnering with Hutchinson High School to provide students a hands-on experience with state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment. I will continue to do everything I can to promote the type of good work that is happening in Hutchinson, so we can continue the great tradition of manufacturing and technical education in Minnesota.
 
Social Security Administration Announces 2018 Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)
￼
 
This week, the Social Security Administration announced this year’s COLA to Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. Based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), a 2.8% COLA was triggered. Beginning in December of 2018, this will directly increase benefits by the same percentage. For Social Security beneficiaries, the estimated average monthly benefit will rise from $1,422 to $1,461. The maximum Federal SSI monthly payment per individual will rise from $750 to $771.
 
Willmar Lakes Area Chamber of Commerce
￼
 
On Wednesday, my staff aide Jacki Anderson attended the Willmar Lakes Area Chamber Lunch with Leaders Event that featured educational leaders from the Willmar area as well as Minnesota State Colleges Chancellor Devinder Malhotra. The discussion was focused on the growing trends of encouraging education in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and promoting hands-on training through public-private partnerships. Challenges remain to prepare youth for the workplace of tomorrow, but I look forward opportunities that will be available to them. I am working to help overcome some of the challenges we are facing today. One major issue is the insufficient workforce in rural Minnesota, which is why I have introduced the bipartisan Addressing Teacher Shortages Act of 2018 that would establish a grant program at the Department of Education through which school districts can apply for funding to recruit, retain, and support teachers.
 
North Star Electric Coop
￼
 
The annual North Star Electric Coop meeting was held in Baudette this week. Board Chairman Steve Arnesen and General Manager Ann Ellis led the discussion and updated members on the condition and activities of the Coop. One of my staff aides attended the meeting and to provide an update on my work in Washington. I am happy to support coops like this because they provide affordable electricity for rural Minnesotans.
 
Day at Home Event in Alexandria
￼
 
On Thursday, my staff attended the 8th Annual Day at Home Event in Alexandria, a mental health advocacy event. Mental health is something that impacts people of all ages and this conference emphasized the importance of addressing mental health with our youth and the ability to connect at the earliest possible moment. We recognize that there is a lot of work to do, and I will continue to advocate at the federal level for policies that will improve mental health services.
 
Rural Minnesota Concentrated Employment Program
￼
 
On Thursday, the Rural Minnesota Concentrated Employment Program (CEP) celebrated 50 years of service. My staff aide Jacki Anderson stopped by the Alexandria Workforce Center open house celebration to thank the staff for their dedication to helping others. Rural Minnesota CEP is a private, non-profit partner in the Minnesota Workforce System with several locations and a variety of partnerships. I am grateful for the staff around the state that help community members develop new skills and find work opportunities.
 
Germany / Minnesota Energy Partnership
￼
 
Two cities in the 7th District, Warren and Morris, have partnered with cities in Germany to exchange ideas for increasing energy efficiency in their communities. This week, Warren City Administrator Shannon Mortenson welcomed Carsten Peters, and energy advisor from the city of Arnsberg, Germany. Carsten and Shannon shared project details for cities to achieve Minnesota’s goal of 25 percent renewable energy by 2025.

Southwest Area Transportation Partnership
￼
 
On Friday, the Southwest Area Transportation Partnership (ATP) held their quarterly meeting in Willmar. My staff attended to get the latest updates on area transportation projects and announcements. Many of our infrastructure projects utilize federal funds that are passed down to the State of Minnesota Department of Transportation (MNDOT) to manage and distribute. MNDOT works together with the ATP to identify transportation priorities for future funding and closely follows project progress once they are funded.
 
A Musical Tribute to Norway
￼
 
Kai Robert Johansen, a Norwegian trumpeter, and his musical group performed classic Norwegian music in Thief River Falls this week. They tour the state and perform their Norwegian tribute in Golden Valley, Minneapolis, Dalton, Dawson, Fargo and Bloomington. The concert included Kai Robert on trumpet, Ellen Karine Lanne on vocals, Jane Bracken on piano and Svingen Torader leading the button box accordion ensemble. During the show, Kai recognized the local Sons of Norway leaders with plaques honoring their service to the Norwegian-American community. Minnesota has one of the highest concentration of Norwegian descendants in the U.S. and this event offered a chance to hear the music of their ancestors.
 
National Farmers Day
￼
 
October 12 is National Farmers Day. Please take time to thank a farmer in your community, and to reflect on the fact that the average farmer grows enough to feed 165 people per year. Farmers make up only 2 percent of the American population, yet they produce most of the food consumed by the rest of the nation. The number of farms has been steadily declining in recent years, causing Americans to be less connected to the people growing their food. It is important that we recognize the folks that provide us with a plentiful and affordable food supply. We must also encourage young people to take up the profession so that our farms continue to produce the goods we depend on for generations to come.
 
Welcome Kaelib!
￼
 
My Washington, D.C. office welcomed Minnesota native Kaelib TeeGarden this week. Kaelib is a senior at Luther College, studying Political Science and Economics. Kaelib is in D.C. for his fall semester, taking evening courses and gaining internship experience while working with us on Capitol Hill. I am happy to be able to give students interested in government an up-close view of the legislative process.
 
This Week in American History
￼
Minnesota Lynx Point Guard Lindsay Whalen (HUTCHINSON)
 
On October 11, 2011, the Minnesota Lynx won their first WNBA Championship, beating the Atlanta Dream in three games. This was the first championship won by a professional sports team in Minnesota since the Minnesota Twins won the World Series in 1991. Hutchinson native Lindsay Whalen was the team’s starting point guard during the 2011 season, leading the WNBA in assists with 5.9 per game.
 
What’s the Story?
￼
 
Minn-Dak Farmers Cooperative (MDFC) is collectively owned by approximately 500 sugarbeet shareholders and growers across Minnesota and the Dakotas. MDFC members grow 115,000 acres of sugarbeets which create the granulated sugar used in the production of many sweet goods. More than one-half of sugar produced in the United States, roughly 4 million tons, comes from sugarbeets. The entire sugarbeet is used in the sugar production process. Sugar and molasses are removed from the plant, and what remains can be processed into a nutrient-rich cattle feed. There are many sugarbeet farmers in the 7th District, and I will continue to support them as their Representative in Congress. The bag of Minn-Dak granulated sugar shown above can be found in my Washington, D.C office.

Friend-
This morning, I spent some time surveying the damage left behind in our district from Hurricane Michael. I saw roads washed out, bridges collapsed, power lines down, and lots of damaged property. In the coming days, I hope you and your family will take caution and continue listening to local officials. I wanted to pass on some helpful resources to help you navigate storm damage and prepare for future incidents.
Quick links for state and federal emergency recovery and preparedness:
Virginia Department of Emergency Management Federal Emergency Management Agency
Resources after a storm:
	•	Be aware of areas where floodwaters have receded. Roads may have weakened and could collapse under the weight of a car.
	•	If your power is out, keep freezers and refrigerators closed. The refrigerator will keep food cold for about four hours. A full freezer will keep the temperature for about 48 hours. Use coolers with ice if necessary. Monitor temperatures with a thermometer.
	•	Maintain food supplies that do not require refrigeration.
	•	When in doubt, throw it out! Throw away any food that has been exposed to temperatures 40 degrees or higher for two hours or more, or that has an unusual odor, color, or texture.
	•	If the power is out for more than a day, discard any medication that should be refrigerated, unless the drug’s label says otherwise. If a life depends on the refrigerated drugs, consult a doctor or pharmacist and use medicine only until a new supply is available.
	•	Check Virginia 511 before travelling to avoid hazardous road conditions assess damage
	•	Use caution when driving. Six inches of water will reach the bottom of most passenger cars causing loss of control and possible stalling.
	•	A foot of water will float many vehicles while two feet of rushing water can carry away most vehicles including sport utility vehicles (SUV’s) and pick-ups.
	•	Check out this power outage information sheet 
	•	Restore utilities and report outages to your local energy provider  o Practice generator safety  o Dominion o Northern Neck Electric Coop  o Rappahannock Electric Coop
	•	Learn how to apply for federal assistance
Preparing for next time:
	•	Be Informed. Knowing what to do before, during, and after an emergency is a critical part of being prepared.
	•	Compile an Emergency Kit. Use this downloadable checklist to ensure you have necessary supplies on hand.
	•	Family Emergency Plan. Make sure your family has a plan in case of an emergency so that everyone is on the same page about how you will get in contact with each other, where you will go, and what you will do in an emergency. 
	•	Keep a copy of this plan in your emergency supply kit or another safe place where you can access it in the event of a disaster.
	•	Use this Flood Safety Checklist provided by the Red Cross to be sure you are informed and prepared for any flooding that may occur in your area.
	•	Listen to news reports for possible flood warnings and reports of flooding in progress or other critical information, like whether the community’s water supply is safe to drink post-flooding
	•	Know the difference between a Flood/Flash Flood Watch (which means flooding is possible in your area) and a Flood/Flash Flood Warning (which means flooding is already occurring or will occur soon in your area).
	•	Options for Protection. Depending on your circumstances and the nature of the emergency, the first important decision is whether you stay where you are or evacuate. You should understand and plan for both possibilities. You can also check out the Virginia Hurricane Evacuation Guide on what to do just in case you need to evacuate your home.
	•	Hurricane Safety Checklist. Review this Hurricane Safety Checklist from the American Red Cross to prepare for the dangers of a hurricane. 
	•	Severe Weather Checklist. Learn the steps to take before, during, and after severe weather hits.
	•	Warning Systems and Signals. Stay informed during a disaster through emergency broadcasts.
	•	 Additionally, the Virginia Evacuation Coordination Team for Operational Response, along with the Virginia Department of Transportation, has created preparedness videos on hurricane evacuations and emergency supplies that can be viewed on YouTube or at www.ReadyVirginia.gov. 
It's an honor to serve you and Virginia's First District in the People's House. Please do not hesitate to reach out to my office should you need further assistance.
Sincerely,  Rob

Response to Hurricane Michael Underway Appropriations Highlight: National Endowment for the Humanities/ National Endowment for the Arts Congressional App Competition Deadline Approaching Cyber Security Awareness Month Salute: Bethel Church of Morristown Celebrates 175 Years! Salute: 50 Years of Service for the Mountain Lakes Junior Fire Department  
Response to Hurricane Michael Underway 
The strongest storm to ever make landfall on the Florida panhandle, Hurricane Michael, left a path of widespread and catastrophic destruction across the southeastern portion of the U.S.
Once again, first responders from all branches of government and across the nation have stepped up to respond to those who are in harm’s way. This includes volunteers from New Jersey Task Force One (NJ-TF1)  who have deployed to Montgomery Alabama at the request of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist with search and rescue efforts  in some of the hardest hit areas.  NJ-TF1 members just returned from the Carolinas after helping in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence.
Last month, the House Committee on Appropriations provided an initial supplemental Appropriations package of $1.68 billion in emergency funding for the Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) programs to assist with hurricane response.  In the coming days, I stand ready to work with all of my colleagues to ensure any necessary resources are available for a full response and recovery from this storm.
 
Appropriations Highlight: National Endowment for the Humanities/National Endowment for the Arts 
Earlier in the year, my Appropriations Committee completed its work on the Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Interior Appropriations bill, sending the legislation to the House of Representatives, which gave approval to the bill on July 19.  
In addition to funding the Department of the Interior, this bill provides resources to a number of critical federal agencies including the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the Endowment for the Arts (NEA).
Similar to FY 2018, the President’s FY 2019 budget request recommended eliminating both programs. However, my Appropriations Committee rejected the President’s proposal and increased funding for the NEA and the NEH, providing $155 million for both, an increase of $2 million over FY 2018 levels.
Both the NEA and NEH have a direct impact on New Jersey. The New Jersey State Council on the Arts, which is funded through the NEA, awards grants to the arts community supporting 700 organizations, projects, and artists throughout the state. In 2017, grantees spent $275 million in New Jersey; employed an estimated 25,000 workers; and attracted nearly 7.5 million patrons. You can learn more about the New Jersey State Council on the Arts here.
The NJ Council of the Humanities, which is funded by the NEH, provides dozens of grants to libraries, museums, social service organizations, historical societies, cultural organizations, and colleges and universities across New Jersey’s 11th Congressional District to develop meaningful humanities projects for New Jersey audiences. You can learn more about the NJ Council of the Humanities here.
 
Congressional App Competition Deadline Approaching 
The application period for my annual “Congressional App Challenge” for high school students in the 11th Congressional district will close on Monday October 15, 2018.
U.S. high school students in New Jersey’s 11th Congressional District are invited, either as individuals or as teams, to create and submit their own software application (“app”) for mobile, tablet, or other computing devices on a platform of their choice. A panel of local computer science professionals will judge the apps, and the winners in each district will have the honor of being recognized by Congress.
This competition highlights the value of computer science and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education, while providing local students with a national platform to display their skills as coders and engineers!
I look forward to viewing the submissions!
To enter, students should follow the rules and submission steps listed on the competition website here.
 
Cyber Security Awareness Month 
As you may know, October is National Cybersecurity Awareness Month (NCSAM). Initiated in 2004 by the National Cyber Security Alliance and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), this annual initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of cybersecurity and ensure that all Americans have the resources they need to stay safer and more secure online.
We all are aware of the growing risk of a connected and online world however, many Americans are confident they are safe online. Unfortunately, this is not the case. In 2017, 143 million adult Americans, more than half of the U.S. adult population, were victims of cybercrime. 
I would encourage you to visit here to learn more about the risks of cyberattacks and to review information on how to keep you and your family safe.
 
Salute: Bethel Church of Morristown Celebrates 175 Years! 
Congratulations to Pastor Sidney Williams and the entire congregation of the Bethel Church of Morristown, who are celebrating their 175th anniversary. Since 1841, the Church has been an integral part of the Morristown and surrounding communities. During its early years, in addition to being a church, it served as the only schoolhouse for children of color in Morris County and supported veterans of the Civil War!
You can read my Congressional Record statement celebrating this historic anniversary here.
 
Salute: 50 Years of Service for the Mountain Lakes Junior Fire Department
This weekend the Mountain Lakes Junior Fire Department (MLJFD) will be celebrating 50 years of service to the Borough of Mountain Lakes and surrounding communities.  The MLJFD is one of the largest and most active junior departments in the state and has assisted numerous departments from Morris, Sussex, Passaic and Essex counties in establishing their own junior fire departments.
We thank the men and women of the MLJFD for their dedicated service!

Friends,
Some very notable developments have been made in Washington over these last few weeks. From a new America First trade deal, to the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and the resignation of South Carolina native Nikki Haley from the United Nations, I wanted to send a quick recap. 
At the beginning of this month, President Trump successfully renegotiated a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada. The deal eliminated Canada’s protectionist dairy tariffs, requires wage increases for Mexican autoworkers to prevent American jobs from being sent across the border, and includes a host of other reforms that without question will benefit the United States. I am extremely happy with this deal as it is a huge win for American workers. For more detailed information on the content of the new US-Mexico-Canada deal, check out this Washington Post article.  
___________ 
I am also extremely pleased that the Senate was able to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court on October 6, 2018. While this confirmation is long overdue, I am proud that Senate Republicans were able to remain diligent and strong throughout this chaotic process and confirm a highly-intelligent, supremely qualified judge to the bench. 
I am very saddened by the fact that Judge Kavanaugh’s good name and reputation were destroyed by the Democrats in the process. Many Democratic Senators opposed Kavanaugh within the hour of President Trump’s nomination announcement, signaling that they didn’t really care about his record, his rulings, or his judicial philosophy. Right from the very start, this process was not about advice and consent – it was about political power.  I also firmly agree with Senator Susan Collins that people who wanted to engineer the defeat of this nomination cared little, if at all, for Dr. Ford’s well-being. As a result, Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford have suffered, their families have suffered, and our nation has suffered through this grueling process. I am thankful for Judge Kavanaugh’s willingness to serve after going through one of the worst smear campaigns in the history of our country.  
___________ 
As you may have heard, Ambassador Nikki Haley publicly announced her resignation from the United Nations (UN) this week. She will continue to hold the position through the end of this year. Ambassador Haley has been a tireless leader and supporter of President Trump’s America First agenda on the world stage at the UN. She made sure the American people’s voice was heard across the globe, and she always did so with poise and strength. I am thankful for Nikki’s leadership – she has made our state and our nation very proud! 
___________ 
The September jobs numbers were GREAT – we hit our lowest unemployment rate since 1969. We are without a doubt better off now! Check out this article from Financial Times for more information. 
As always, it is a great honor to serve as your U.S. Representative. Should you need assistance with a casework issue, please do not hesitate to contact one of my district offices in Anderson and Clinton. Should you have any legislative questions or concerns, always feel free to reach out to my Washington, D.C. office. Also, don’t forget to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and subscribe to my newsletter through the links below for real time updates on my work in South Carolina and in Washington.

 The United States Marine Corps Teams Up With UCI To Save Lives
I am proud to announce a new partnership between the University of Irvine, Medical Trauma Center and the USMC 1st Medical Battalion, 1st MLG, Camp Pendleton.   This is a significant step to help our military medical professionals prepare to save lives overseas. The partnership posts select medical professionals at the UCI Medical Trauma Center so they can gain vital experience in treating traumatic injuries. 
￼ 
These soldiers are part of our military’s shock trauma platoons, a small, highly mobile medical unit designed to support and deploy alongside United State Marines and other American forces inside combat theaters. These teams have had success in saving our soldiers overseas.   Finding new ways to protect and support our soldiers is one of my top priorities in Washington. Ensuring soldiers have the weapons, equipment, and support they need to be successful is not only a matter of national security but a moral imperative. Every soldier who answers their nation’s call has earned our support. If the worst happens to them, units like the shock trauma platoon helps keep that soldier alive so that they can return to their family and a grateful nation.   I am honored to have taken part in this signing and look forward to a fruitful and beneficial partnership between UCI and our armed forces. 
Sincerely,

Senator Maggie Hassan  
See below for highlights of my week fighting for the priorities of Granite Staters.
Visit my website for more updates at Hassan.Senate.Gov. 

This Week: The American People Deserve Better than Justice Kavanaugh 

Last weekend, the Senate voted to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Even beyond the very serious and credible allegations of sexual assault against him, I opposed Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination because of his record of putting corporations before people and diminishing the rights of individuals, particularly women. 
From gutting protections for people with pre-existing conditions, to undermining a woman’s constitutionally protected reproductive rights, and supporting an unchecked presidency – at least for Republicans – it is clear that Judge Kavanaugh has a partisan agenda that is deeply at odds with the will of the American people. Judge Kavanaugh is the antithesis of the impartial arbiter that a Supreme Court Justice must be, and the American people deserve far better. 
￼  
Ahead of the final vote, I spoke on the Senate floor about my opposition to his nomination. You can watch it here. 
This week, I also joined my colleagues in fighting back against the Trump Administration’s latest effort to sabotage health care for hard-working Granite Staters and Americans across the country by expanding junk insurance plans. 
We forced a vote on the Senate floor to try to overturn the Trump Administration’s final junk insurance plans rule, which would further destabilize health insurance markets, drive up health care costs for hard-working Granite Staters and Americans, and undermine important consumer protections, including for people with pre-existing conditions. I was deeply disappointed that only one of my Republican colleagues would join us in blocking these junk insurance plans. 
 ￼ 
I participated in a press conference after Senate Republicans blocked our effort to overturn the Trump Administration's final rule on junk insurance plans, and I'll keep standing up against the Trump Administration's continued reckless efforts to sabotage and undermine care for the American people. 
This week, the Senate passed a bipartisan water infrastructure bill that will fund water infrastructure projects around the country. I'm pleased that the mitigation efforts at Hampton-Seabrook and Portsmouth Harbors that Senator Shaheen and I pushed for were included in the passage of this bipartisan bill. 
This funding will help ensure the safety and vitality of our Seacoast. If fishermen cannot get their boats out to the open water, our coastal communities and small businesses will suffer, which could create a ripple effect throughout our state. I hope the President signs this bill into law without delay. You can read more here. 
The President signed a bipartisan bill I cosponsored to end so-called “pharmacy gag clauses” into law. These gag clauses prevent pharmacists from being able to inform consumers if there is a cheaper option to purchase their prescription medications. 
No Granite Stater or American should be taken advantage of when they go to the pharmacy to purchase potentially life-saving medications. This law will help address that, helping to ensure that patients have the information they need to purchase the most affordable options for their prescriptions. I’m encouraged that this commonsense, bipartisan bill was signed into law, but our work to address the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs and to hold big pharma accountable is far from over. Read more here. 
Everywhere I go in New Hampshire, I continue to hear from our businesses about the need for more workers with the tools and skills necessary for success in the 21st-century economy. 
So this week, I joined my colleagues in introducing the bipartisan Invest in America Act, which will encourage long-term job creation and boost economic growth in the Granite State by investing in workforce development in industries and communities that need it the most. 
Read more here. 
I also questioned the Acting Director of the National Counterterrorism Center about recent reports that a resurgent ISIS has 30,000 fighters engaged in its attempts to reassert control over Iraq and Syria. This seemingly contradicts the President’s claims that ISIS has been “obliterated.”  I emphasized to the Acting Director how important it is to ensure that we have finished the job of defeating ISIS. Read more here.  
Senator Shaheen hosted the Angels of Addiction exhibit at the U.S. Capitol this week. 
When Granite Stater Anne Marie lost her daughter to an overdose, she painted a portrait to remember her. That was the start of Angels of Addiction, and Anne Marie has now painted more than 100 portraits showing the devastating human cost of the opioid epidemic in New Hampshire and across the United States.  
￼ 
I had an opportunity to visit the exhibit, and I hope that my colleagues see these portraits and are reminded of the human impact the devastating opioid crisis is having on our communities.

Dear Friend:
Here are some of the ways in which I'm fighting hard this week to keep Lower Hudson Valley communities safe, healthy, and secure: 
	•	Urging the IRS to Drop Proposed SALT Regulation  
	•	Protecting Medicare and Social Security for Seniors  
	•	Helping a Westchester Resident with the VA 
Urging the IRS to Drop Proposed SALT Regulation
I sent a letter last Friday urging IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to amend a proposed regulation that would prohibit New York and other states from providing much-needed relief for taxpayers by circumventing the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction imposed by the new tax law. 
	•	I wrote: ""The SALT deduction was established to ensure that Americans are not taxed twice on the same income, which is exactly what will happen as a result of the cap. My constituents and taxpayers all over New York State simply cannot be squeezed any further, which is why I applauded efforts by the State to enact opportunities for charitable contributions to the state and local governments. This is consistent with federal law and established precedent and the state should be permitted to deliver necessary relief to New York taxpayers.""  
	•	Read the full letter here. 
Protecting Medicare and Social Security for Seniors 
￼ 
Rep. Lowey speaks with local residents during the annual Senior Fair in Ossining.  
I was happy to join Senator Carlucci and Assemblywoman Galef at their annual Senior Fair in Ossining to discuss the importance of protecting and strengthening Medicare and Social Security benefits that seniors have earned through a lifetime of hard work. 
	•	Months after passing their tax law, the House majority is demanding $537 billion in cuts to Medicare. The economic and health security of tens of millions of Americans are on the line.  
	•	I am working in Congress to prevent these cuts from taking place, and will continue fighting so that every senior has access to a healthy and secure retirement.  
	•	Every senior deserves access to a healthy and secure retirement! 
Helping a Westchester Resident with the VA  
A Westchester constituent contacted my office regarding a check for her husband's funeral expenses from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that went to the wrong address. The VA said it would send the new check, but after several months the constituent had still not received it. I contacted the VA and the constituent soon received the check.

Remembering the Victims in Schoharie 
Our community is mourning the lives that were tragically cut short in the Schoharie limousine crash. I will be working with Senator Schumer and the New York delegation to have the National Transportation Safety Board explore the safety of these limousines so that we can ensure accidents like this do not happen again. On Wednesday night, I joined the Schoharie community at a vigil honoring the lives of those lost. I ask that you keep the victims and their families – many of whom were our neighbors – in your thoughts and prayers as we mourn this devastating loss of life.
Heroin and Opioid Roundtable in Fulton County 
￼ 
Thank you to the community leaders, advocates, and family members of victims who participated in our productive opioid roundtable discussion Thursday in Gloversville. As a member of the bipartisan Heroin Task Force, I helped the House pass over $10 billion in funding to combat the opioid epidemic. I also helped the House pass the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, and the 21st Century Cures Act, which have both been signed into law. Recently, I helped the House send the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act to the President’s desk for signature. This legislation will better equip law enforcement and community leaders with new tools to combat opioid abuse. I will continue working in Congress to fight addiction and save lives.
Merry Den Alpaca Farm in Franklin County 
￼ 
I had a great time visiting the Merry Den Alpaca Farm and store in North Bangor on Monday. Over the past ten years, the McElwain family has worked hard to grow this farm from three alpacas to twenty-five! We had a productive discussion about USDA funding opportunities and support for the industry in the Farm Bill. Turning alpaca fur into yarn is a complex process, and I appreciated the chance to learn more. Thanks for having me!
Inspecting Areas Impacted by Low Water Levels in Saint Lawrence County 
￼ 
This week, I visited Wilson Hill on Lake Saint Lawrence to see the impact low water levels have had on NY-21 constituents and businesses along the Saint Lawrence River. I’ll keep working in Congress to ensure the voices of residents affected by low water levels are heard. Click here to read more about my visit in the Watertown Daily Times. 
Bolton Landing Brewing Company in Warren County 
￼ 
Our region’s brewers are not only creating jobs and growing our economy, but they’re also raising the North Country’s profile in the booming craft beer industry. I toured Bolton Landing Brewing Company in Warren County to see their brewing operations first-hand. Thank you to the folks at Bolton Landing for hosting me, and for our productive discussion on ways to strengthen our North Country small business environment! 
Social Security Cost of Living Increase 
￼ 
This week, the Social Security Administration announced that 67 million Social Security beneficiaries across the country will be receiving a 2.8 percent cost of living increase – the largest increase in seven years! This is great news for seniors across our district. Click here to read more about this important announcement. 
Our offices are proud to work on behalf of Social Security beneficiaries to ensure they are receiving the correct amount they are owed, and to date we have helped recover over $1.9 million in Social Security benefits for our seniors. If you are having trouble accessing your Social Security benefits, click here to contact us with your specific casework needs. 
Making Prescription Drugs More Affordable 
￼ 
President Trump has signed into law two important pieces of legislation that I helped pass to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Families across our district, especially seniors, continue to struggle with the costs of their prescription drugs, and these two bills increase transparency and make it easier for consumers to purchase the lowest cost available drugs at the pharmacy. I will continue to work across the aisle to ensure the North Country has access to quality, affordable healthcare. Click here to learn more about these two bills.  
 Breaking Through the Gridlock in Congress 
￼ 
Hardworking families in my district and across the country are tired of the endless partisan bickering that has become far too common in Congress. I’m cosponsoring a bipartisan package of reforms that will make House leadership more reflective of the entire legislative body, eliminate roadblocks to smart policymaking, and ensure that members of both parties are able to offer amendments to major pieces of legislation. This legislative  package builds on my record of consensus building that includes being recognized by the Lugar Center as one of the most bipartisan Members of Congress. Click here to read more about the “Break the Gridlock” resolution.
Combating Harmful Algal Blooms in North Country Waters 
Harmful Algal blooms threaten to disrupt the health of our North Country waters, including Lake George. As a Member of the Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, I am pleased to support two important pieces of legislation to combat algal blooms. These bills will increase research and help provide resources to protect our natural ecology. In Congress, I will continue to work across the aisle to protect our North Country treasures. Click here to read about both pieces of legislation.

Justice for Jamal

By Congressman Gerry Connolly (D-VA)

Jamal Khashoggi is a renowned Washington Post contributor, Virginia resident, and my constituent. Like many people who visit a diplomatic consulate, he expected his trip to be a fairly swift and routine piece of business. He was getting documents so he could marry his fiancée. Instead, he has been missing since Oct. 2 and may not have left the consulate in Istanbul alive.

Khashoggi is a thought leader and a voice for democracy who has challenged authoritarian abuses of power. He is not a radical or a threat to the Saudi kingdom.

His disappearance is deeply troubling and we – the United States government - and the Turkish government must demand a robust and transparent investigation into what happened. The idea that he left and “we don’t know what happened,” which is the Saudi story, is full of holes and implausible. The Saudis’ denial is even more suspect given recent revelations that U.S. intelligence sources intercepted Saudi officials discussing a plan ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to trick Khashoggi into returning to his homeland in order to detain him.

In the days since his disappearance, there have been leaked details from Turkish government sources that suggest a much grizzlier account. According to these reports, a hit team of fifteen Saudis flew into Istanbul, went to that consulate, murdered Khashoggi, and then dismembered his body. Such a series of events would amount to a crime of unspeakable depravity by a sovereign state in another sovereign state with a resident of a third sovereign state. A diplomatic consulate is a place of business, not an abattoir.

The United States cannot stand idly by, irrespective of our longstanding relationship with Saudi Arabia, and allow that to happen with impunity. This act, if true, would be a gross violation of international law and bring us back to a law of the jungle. To allow an event like this to happen without consequences would rewrite the rules of international diplomacy and threaten the safety of dissidents and journalists around the world.

When Russian authorities attempted to poison and murder two Russian citizens on British soil earlier this year, Britain and the entire international community, including the United States, reacted with punitive measures against Russia. This included the expulsion of diplomats and additional sanctions.

We have to stand ready to react with similar strength and unity if it is determined this act against Khashoggi was carried out by Saudi Arabia. It is not acceptable behavior and those responsible for it will be held to account, no matter how high up it may go.

Unfortunately, the reaction by the president and the secretary of State has been anemic at best. President Trump said he was unaware of what was going on. Secretary Mike Pompeo actually said they’d ask the Saudis to investigate this. We cannot expect, nor should we accept, an investigation done by the Saudis. Such an investigation would lack any modicum of credibility.

This incident demands a robust, independent investigation with U.S. leadership and full international cooperation, including diplomatic, intelligence community and FBI support. The bipartisan effort in the Senate to force a presidential review of possible human rights violations consistent with the Magnitsky Act is an example of how Congress must lead if the administration won’t.

Something terrible happened to Mr. Khashoggi. We owe it to him, his family, and to our own American values to get answers regarding his disappearance.

Today is National Farmer’s Day! 
Agriculture is South Dakota's number one industry - by a significant margin. All in all, it contributes about $25.6 billion to the economy. 
The last few years have been tough for farmers, both because of natural disasters and because prices have been suppressed by foreign buyers. Recently, we’ve seen Canada and Mexico return to the negotiating table to produce better, fairer deals. China needs to do the same.  
At the same time, we're expanding domestic markets. President Trump, for instance, moved ahead with the process to approve year-round E15 - giving a 2 billion bushel boost. Despite these recent successes, market access remains a concern, and I won’t stop fighting to ensure South Dakota producers get access to markets across the globe.
￼ 
More than 46,000 ag producers call South Dakota home, and I'm incredibly proud of the work they do. They grow the world's food - and they grow it better than anyone else.
Thank you for everything you do!

SERVING YOU  |  MEDIA CENTER  |  LEGISLATIVE WORK  |  OUR DISTRICT
 
October 12, 2018
 
 
Dear Friend,   Last week left many Americans, including myself, feeling angered and saddened. We witnessed rushed hearings, a very limited FBI investigation, and the unfair treatment of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. The Republicans confirmed Brett Kavanaugh as the newest Supreme Court Justice on Saturday afternoon, sending a message to women and victims of sexual harassment and assault that their voices don’t matter.  So, I was proud I got the chance to speak at the Lady Project’s Summit after the confirmation. This organization does great work connecting, inspiring, and showcasing amazing things women are doing across Rhode Island.   Throughout 2018, women across our state and country have inspired me with their passion, courage, and determination. With good reason, they are rightfully sick and tired of being marginalized, ignored, and denied the respect they deserve.  I was happy to talk with summit attendees about what I’m working on to ensure that women achieve full equality in our society, including guaranteeing access to full reproductive health care, freedom from violence and discrimination, and efforts to guarantee workplace fairness, including equal pay for equal work, paid family leave, and access to quality, affordable child care.   Under the right leadership, I know we can advance a number of proposals in Congress to empower women. I have sponsored and supported legislation that would protect a woman's access to birth control and family planning services, provide resources to victims of domestic violence, promote sexual harassment training and education, and strengthen health care programs for women.   This past year, the #MeToo movement has been propelled by so many courageous women and helped to shine a light on the serious and pervasive issue of sexual harassment and sexual violence in our society. Hopefully, with continued resolve, this movement will help ensure that we put an end to sexual harassment and gender-based violence in the workplace, at home, and in our society at large.  There is still so much that needs to be done to support women, and I will continue to fight in Congress for full equality because I firmly believe that when women succeed, America succeeds.   AUTUMNFEST   Every year Autumnfest in Woonsocket is one of my favorite events. I always look forward to checking out the incredible crafts and sampling the delicious food, which serves as a real reminder of the skill and ingenuity of so many of our state’s residents.  Autumnfest began over 40 years ago as an opportunity for everyone to enjoy the spirit of Woonsocket and Northern Rhode Island, and it is one of the biggest selling points for the city. Between the festival, the parade, and the MegaWar, it is a truly unique event that perfectly captures the close community ties that make Woonsocket such a wonderful place to live and do business.  The future growth of this city depends on our ability to attract great businesses that provide good-paying jobs to local residents. And Autumnfest serves as an amazing attraction which brings in visitors and allows us to celebrate so many of the exciting things happening in the city.   ORDER SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF ITALY  This past weekend I was thrilled to join the Order Sons and Daughters of Italy in America for their 42nd annual dinner to celebrate Columbus Day and our great Italian-American heritage, to honor accomplished leaders, and to recognize talented young people in our state.  During Saturday’s dinner, it was my privilege to help recognize recipients of scholarships and present them with an honorable mention on behalf of the United States Congress.  Each year, it is my honor to celebrate our Italian heritage and recognize the great contributions that Italian-Americans have made to Rhode Island and to this entire nation. Together, we take pride in a community that has given the world incredible thinkers, entrepreneurs, and inventors.  Italy is a great friend to the United States, and as a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Italian-American Congressional Delegation, I am proud to work to strengthen the close ties between the United States and Italy.  100th ANNIVERSARY OF CLUBE SOCIAL PORTUGUESE  On Saturday, I joined members from Clube Social Português to celebrate their 100th anniversary and recognize the important work they’ve done to maintain and promote the Portuguese language, culture, and customs in Rhode Island.  For a century, this organization has been a vital force in the Portuguese-American community across the state. The club’s work helps to ensure the incredible values and traditions of the Portuguese community are passed on to the next generation. It also helps strengthen the ties between the United States and Portugal, a nation which has long been our close friend and ally.  All of us in Rhode Island are better because of our successful and thriving Portuguese-American community, one of the largest in the entire country.   As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns, please call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov.   You can also click here to follow my work on Twitter.    Warm regards, ￼  David Cicilline Member of Congress

Lipinski Introduces Legislation to End Dumping of Untreated Sewage Into Great Lakes
￼
Congressman Dan Lipinski has introduced H.R. 6967, the Great Lakes Water Protection Act, which will improve water quality in the Great Lakes Basin by working with wastewater treatment plants to end the dumping of untreated sewage during rain events.  Through a process called blending, which happens when there is more water coming into a treatment plant than it can process, untreated or partially-treated sewage is mixed with fully-treated water before it is discharged.  This bill will ban blending and provide financial assistance to help municipalities comply.  Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) will be introducing a Senate version of the bill in the coming weeks.
“My bill and the legislation Senator Duckworth will be introducing in the Senate will improve water quality in the Great Lakes by ending the practice of blending and making sure that wastewater discharged into the lakes is fully-treated,” said Rep. Lipinski.  “We are also creating a Great Lakes Cleanup Fund that will provide federal dollars to offset the cost of infrastructure improvements needed to end wastewater blending, and make sure that an undue burden is not placed on local residents.”

Lipinski Introduces New ""Buy American"" Bill to Help Boost Job Creation and Ensure Taxpayer Dollars Are Spent in the U.S.
￼
Congressman Lipinski has introduced H.R. 6907, the BuyAmerican.gov Act, which helps ensure that federal agencies follow Buy American laws and prioritize the purchase of American-made goods.  The legislation directs the General Services Administration to establish a website to collect and display information about each request by a federal agency to bypass “Buy American” laws and purchase foreign-made products.  If approved, manufacturers and others will be able to use the site to identify contract opportunities and hold federal agencies accountable for abusing “Buy American” waivers. 
“Despite the fact that too many Americans still can’t find good-paying jobs, the federal government continues to buy many products outside our country instead of using our hard-earned tax dollars to buy American products and hire American workers,” said Rep. Lipinski.  “This bipartisan bill will help change that.”
In the last five years, federal agencies have spent $47.7 billion on goods manufactured by foreign firms.  The Department of Defense, the largest purchaser of manufactured goods in the world, has spent almost $200 billion on manufactured goods made by foreign companies since 2007.  At the same time, the United States has seen a reduction in middle-class manufacturing jobs that could have been kept in the U.S.  A companion bill has been introduced in the Senate.
 
Five-Year FAA Reauthorization Includes Lipinski Provisions Protecting Passengers and Reducing the Impact of Airport Noise
￼
Congressman Lipinski released the following statement after a five-year reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA):
“This bill is a compromise so it is far from perfect, but it gives this essential agency some stability and direction while including a number of wins for the traveling public, residents around airports, and airline workers.  It continues investment in the nation’s airports and aviation facilities – albeit not as much as I would like to see – and it will help maintain the safest aviation system in the world. 
“While the final bill doesn't do what I am seeking in my Airline Consumer Protection Act, I was able to include several key provisions.  One provision requires the Government Accountability Office to quantify all the costs to passengers that resulted from every airline computer failure since 2014.  I am hopeful this report will spur Congress to take further action to assure better passenger protections.  Other provisions I authored will improve transparency in ticket sales and help develop the aviation workforce’s next generation.
“Locally, the final bill includes a number of tools that can help lessen the noise heard by area residents from planes using Midway and O'Hare.  This list of steps includes studies reviewing allowable decibel standards, the impact of continual noise on human health, and the relationship between noise and aircraft speeds.  Another provision requires airport operators to submit revised noise maps to the FAA prior to proposed significant changes (like adding a runway), allows nearby communities or airport operators to ask the FAA to examine alternatives when designing new departure routes and directs them to take such requests into consideration, tasks the FAA with better public outreach when redesigning airspace, and creates a regional noise ombudsmen to listen to residents about the impact of airplane noise.
 “Another of my amendments authorizes $5 million a year to provide grants to schools, airlines, trade associations, governments, tech schools, and more to promote the development of the aviation technician workforce.  Unfortunately, the bill does not include language which would prevent airlines from claiming operating bases in countries that lack protections for airline workers.  This is a fight I will continue to protect American jobs.”

Lipinski Announces Grant for Pillars Community Health in La Grange
￼
Congressman Lipinski is announcing that the Pillars Community Health Center in La Grange has been awarded a federal grant through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  The organization will receive $243,200 to help expand access to treatment for substance use and mental health services.
“Pillars Community Health has done a heroic job healing, caring, and educating for almost a century,” said Rep. Lipinski.  “This funding to support care for people dealing with mental health and substance abuse issues will help Pillars continue the great work they have been doing in the community.  I promise to keep fighting for more support for community health centers and for more funding for issues that no family is immune to.”
The new funding will help Pillars pay for additional staff and screening tools to identify substance use disorders such as hazardous drinking, alcohol abuse or dependence, use of prescribed and over the counter drugs, and non-medical use, and quickly connect individuals with needed education and treatment.
Pillars Community Health is a nonprofit provider of health and social services.

Protecting Our Northern Border Means Attracting the Best & Brightest to North Dakota
￼
My bipartisan CBP Hire Act, which recently passed in the U.S. Senate, addresses concerns I heard from officers stationed along North Dakota's Northern Border. In 2016, I brought DHS Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas (pictured here in Pembina) to our state's border to hear directly from these fine men and women.
MY BIPARTISAN BILL TO IMPROVE HIRING AND RETENTION OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION (CBP) OFFICERS PASSED IN THE U.S. SENATE. In rural and remote areas like the Northern Border, CBP faces unique challenges in sustaining the strong and highly-qualified workforce we need to protect our borders. After hearing firsthand from folks on the ground about the challenges CBP faces, I helped introduce a bipartisan bill last year with U.S. Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) to help the agency attract and retain the best workforce possible. My bill passing in the Senate is an important win for North Dakota communities, our CBP workforce, and our national security. The legislation builds on my successful efforts to obtain a new Northern Border strategy, and I'll keep fighting to keep North Dakotans safe from both foreign and domestic threats. Click here to listen to my latest episode of my podcast, ""The Hotdish,"" which focuses on the need to secure the Northern Border.  
NORTH DAKOTA SOYBEAN FARMERS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE TRADE WAR-INDUCED HEADACHES. Major snowfalls weren't the only thing stressing out farmers this week. Right now, our state's soybean growers are seeing zero orders of soybeans to China, which is typically the largest buyer of North Dakota soybeans. As beans still sit in bins and elevators, this year's crop is stranded with no place to go—  and our farmers are fed up. Additionally, this week ag bankers warned about additional uncertainty for farmers, ranchers, and processors in the near future. I'm continuing to push back against this misguided trade war with China, and click here to see how I'm taking actions for smarter trade policies that  would expand— not shrink— North Dakota's access to international markets. 
BIG BIOFUELS NEWS: On Tuesday, the administration finally announced plans to allow year-round sale of E15, which I've been strongly pushing the administration for to support North Dakota farmers. At a time when the trade war is threatening commodity prices, we need to do everything we can to support farmers, and upholding our commitment to biofuels is one way to give ag producers some much needed certainty. In June, I toured the Red Trail Energy Plant in Richardton and discussed the need to protect RFS and support job-creating facilities like Red Trail. After working in a bipartisan way to build support for E15 and protect the RFS, I was honored to receive the Fueling Growth Award from Growth Energy. look forward to continuing to work with the President and the administration to make sure this policy is implemented in a way that protects farmers and biofuel producers in North Dakota.

Congress has delayed action on the life-and-death issue of maternal health for far too long, and my bipartisan bill would help facilitate stronger, safer, and healthier pregnancies by investing in cutting-edge research, beefing up information sharing, and giving physicians and providers the tools they need to improve the patient experience. 
IN GRAND FORKS, I HEARD FROM MOMS ABOUT HOW WE CAN PUSH FOR HEALTHIER PREGNANCIES. According to the CDC, pregnancy-related deaths in the United States increased by 250 percent from 1987-2014. No mother in the United States should have to worry about dying due to pregnancy complications, and it’s absolutely shameful that we’re seeing a growing number of maternal deaths in this country. At my roundtable discussion, I brought together health care providers, families, and maternal health advocates to examine the causes of rising nationwide maternal mortality rates and to discuss ideas, like my new bill to better support the health and well-being of mothers and newborn children across North Dakota. Last month, I helped pass a bipartisan funding bill that includes $50 million in funding I pushed for to be used for a new initiative aimed at reducing maternal mortality, which is an important step forward.   
DEPARTMENT OF DO YOUR JOB: THE U.S. HOUSE SHOULD HELP PASS A FINAL VERSION OF THE 2018 FARM BILL. On September 30, the current version of the Farm Bill expired. After the Senate passed a strong Farm Bill— which I helped write and negotiate— with historic and overwhelming support from Republicans and Democrats, it's disappointing that House Republicans continue to push for partisan and regional provisions that have no chance of building the bipartisan coalition necessary to pass a final bill. Particularly at a time of turmoil in farm country due to the administration's trade war, it's also disappointing that the House took a break in August and much of September— and has adjourned until mid-November. Americans expect members of Congress to get to work and do their jobs, but passing a strong Farm Bill is clearly not the priority it should be for House Republicans who want to keep pushing partisan provisions— including provisions that leave North Dakota farmers behind. I’ll continue to work toward passing a final bill that works for rural America as soon as possible.  
CONGRATULATIONS TO MY GOOD FRIEND DALLAS CARLSON! On Thursday night, the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) Director Dallas Carlson to serve as U.S. Marshal for the District of North Dakota. I've known Dallas for many years and worked with him closely during my time as Attorney General, and he was my first choice for this important job. He'll make North Dakota proud as he works to prevent major crimes, protect North Dakota communities, and maintain the rule of law. I wish him the best of luck, and I look forward to working with him to strengthen law enforcement's ability to keep our families and towns strong and safe.
￼
Recently, I got to catch up with Monique and Jocelyn Lamoureux (and their amazing mom) while they were in the nation's capital. These awesome leaders are more than Olympic Gold Medalists – they are inspirations for girls and women all across North Dakota.

Friends, 
  
The House of Representatives was quiet this week, but the same cannot be said for Florida Panhandle. 
  
Hurricane Michael made landfall on Thursday, devastating Florida's Gulf Coast and Panhandle. My heart goes out to the victims, especially those who have lost not only their livelihoods, but their loved ones, as well. The brave men and women of the U.S. armed forces are actively conducting search and rescue efforts. 285 people were said to have remained in Mexico Beach, where some of the worst damage can be seen. Many residents are still missing, with the National Guard rescuing up to 20 survivors in one night. President Trump is expected to travel to Florida next week and survey the damage. 
 ￼ 
  
￼
￼
￼
 
Kansas called to help Florida
The Kansas National Guard has received a request from the state of Florida for assistance conducting aerial search and rescue in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael. The Kansas National Guard is responding with one UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and six crew members. The request was made through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, a multistate agreement that expedites interstate support for disaster response and recovery operations. A huge thanks to everyone responding to the call for aid, including our departing National Guardsmen.           
  
  
￼
A-Maze-ing News!
On Tuesday, President Trump announced EPA plans to allow the sale and use of E15 throughout the year. This is a tremendous victory for Kansas agriculture and a huge step towards freeing our nation's producers from unnecessarily strict regulations. The ban placed on E15 smothered summer consumption of ethanol and limited options for consumers. Our farmers are already seeing their net income drop to its lowest dollar level in a decade due, I am hopeful that these deregulatory measures will relieve some of that pressure. This is a massive victory for our biofuels industry, as well. Kansas ethanol plants produce roughly half a billion gallons of ethanol a year and create over 4,000 jobs across our state. Their workers can now expect greater market certainty and job security. I am extremely grateful to President Trump for keeping his promise to place our farmers and consumers first. 90% of cars are approved for using this cleaner, safer, and higher octane fuel, so it makes no sense to punish those who want to use it. Deregulation of E15 is a huge step in the right direction. Read my full press release here. 
￼
Happy National 
Farmer's Day!
Today on National Farmers day we celebrate the Kansas farmers and ranchers that are feeding the world. Agriculture is the largest economic driver in Kansas accounting for 44.5% of the state’s total economy. The agriculture sector employs 13% of Kansas’ workforce through direct and indirect careers. Kansas is the nation’s 8th largest agricultural exporting state, shipping $4.7 billion in domestic agricultural exports abroad in 2016. Agriculture in Kansas is not just about growing crops and raising animals. The Kansas agricultural sector includes renewable energy production, food processing, research and education, agribusiness and more. I am proud to represent the farmers of Kansas that provide such vital roles in our society.
So make sure you thank a farmer today!
￼
National Blue 
Ribbon Schools
Kansas's own Lee Elementary, Marion Elementary, and Sterling Elementary are now included amongst this year's National Blue Ribbon Schools. The title is awarded to schools across the nation whose students exhibit exceptional academic performance. Secretary of Education, Betsy Devos, recognized 349 public and private schools this year and, unsurprisingly, Kansas has distinguished itself once again. A special thanks goes out to Kansas educators who work tirelessly to deliver a top-notch education to our children and provide them with the tools for a more prosperous future. 

Troop Inspection
This week I sat down with Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville to discuss Fort Riley. We had a great conversation, and I always look forward to discussing the strengths Fort Riley brings to the Army. As usual, it w
as a pleasure seeing General McConville, and a great end to AUSA week!

Dear neighbor, 
Our fellow Floridians in the Panhandle and Big Bend just faced one of the strongest Hurricanes our state has witnessed in decades. There are over 400,000 people without power, massive property damage, and communication services are still down. Over 8,400 people are in shelters, and that number is expected to increase today. 
While officials continue to assess the extent of the damage from Hurricane Michael, FEMA granted a Major Disaster Declaration for the state of Florida, triggering the release of federal funds for programs that offer debris removal, food stamps, temporary shelter, property damage claims, and emergency protection measures. 
Here are some of the assistance programs you and your loved ones in these counties can count on starting today: 
	•	Assistance to individuals and households has been approved for the following counties: Bay, Franklin, Gulf, Taylor, and Wakulla.  
	•	Public assistance for emergency work and the repair or replacement of disaster-damaged facilities has been approved for the following counties: Bay, Calhoun, Franklin, Gadsden, Gulf, Hamilton, Jackson, Jefferson, Leon, Liberty, Madison, Suwannee, Taylor, and Wakulla.  
	•	All counties in the State of Florida are eligible to apply for assistance under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. 
Individuals in Bay, Franklin, Gulf, Taylor, and Wakulla Counties can register with FEMA the following ways: 
	•	Apply online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov. 
	•	Constituents may call the registration phone number at 1-800-621-3362; those who have a speech disability or hearing loss and use TTY, should call 1-800-462-7585 directly; for those who use 711 or Video Relay Service (VRS), call 1-800-621-3362.  
Our prayers are with North Floridians during this difficult time. In the face of adversity, Floridians have always come together, with a resilient spirit and a lending hand, to bounce back stronger than before. This won’t be the exception. 
As always, my office is here to help.  
Sincerely, 
￼

10/12/18 13:04,Blaine's Bulletin: National Breast Cancer Awareness Month,"￼ 
October 12, 2018

BLAINE'S BULLETIN

Too many Americans know firsthand how devastating breast cancer can be. Whether it is your mother, sister, wife, aunt, cousin, daughter or friend, everyone can name someone who has courageously fought against this horrifying disease. Since 1985, October has been recognized as National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  This month provides an opportunity to increase awareness of the disease while educating women across the nation on the importance of early detection.
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in women. Sadly, according to the American Cancer Society, 40,920 American women will die from breast cancer in 2018. This year we expect 5,160 new breast cancer diagnoses in Missouri, alone.

The key to defeating breast cancer is early detection and treatment. The most reliable way to find breast cancer early, when it is small and has not spread, is by getting regular screening tests. For women with an average risk of breast cancer, the American Cancer Society recommends women aged 45 to 54 get mammograms every year, with the option to start screening every year beginning at age 40.

Regular screening remains the most important strategy to prevent death from breast cancer, yet only 70% of Missouri women aged 40 and older got a mammogram in 2016. A large reason for that is due to the lack of access to prevention and screening services, particularly in rural America. This healthcare disparity creates a huge challenge for women in our district and across the country as we fight breast cancer.

Last year, I introduced the Mobile Mammography Promotion Act. My bill expands access to preventative care in rural communities by supporting mobile mammography units, often called “mammovans.” Specifically, this legislation would allow mammovans, many of which are supported by non-profit organizations and private donations, to provide vital services in underserved areas tax-free. A similar exemption is already provided to blood collection centers under current law. Mobile mammography units travel thousands of miles each year to provide mammograms and other services that help prevent and treat medical challenges facing women, so we must do everything we can to ensure they stay in service.

We have 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in the United States, and if we continue to highlight the importance of early detection and treatment, millions more will successfully fight the disease. This October, I hope you will urge your loved ones, your mothers, sisters, wives, aunts, cousins, daughters, and friends to educate themselves on the importance of regular breast cancer screenings as we continue on the path toward eliminating cancer for good.

Hoosiers,

Breaking news → The Social Security Administration just announced that the cost-of-living adjustment for 2019 benefits will be 2.8%, the biggest increase in seven years. 

This is great news for the millions of seniors I am fighting for every single day who rely on Social Security benefits to support themselves. Click here to learn more about how this will help our country's seniors keep up with the changing cost of living. 

￼

Ensuring seniors have financial security and access to quality care is an important part of my job as your representative. Just this week, I visited both the Harrison Healthcare Center, a nursing facility in Indiana that provides both short-term recovery services and long-term care for seniors, and Bickford in Greenwood, an assisted living and memory care center. At both of these visits, the caregivers showed me around and shared all they are doing to provide the best possible care to our seniors.

Additionally, my office works every day to help seniors who are having issues with VA benefits, Social Security payments, or Medicare coverage. If you or someone you know is having difficulties cutting through the government's red tape, please reach out to the Jeffersonville office at 812-288-3999 for assistance.

Be of good cheer,
￼

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh 
On Saturday, the Senate confirmed Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. This is a historic moment in the fight to preserve our constitutional liberties. For the first time in my lifetime there will be an originalist majority on the Supreme Court who will interpret the law and uphold our constitutional rights as the founders intended. Thank you President Trump for nominating and the U.S. Senate for confirming Judge Kavanaugh.

STILL TIME TO REGISTER FOR 
HUNGER FORUM!
￼ 
Our communities have worked to raise awareness of the problem of hunger in our region just as others have sought to bring attention to it on a worldwide level. Although the challenges to overcome hunger are daunting, they are not beyond our ability to confront and in many cases resolve them. 
I will be hosting a forum, “Confronting the Scourge of Hunger”, which will focus on the issue of global hunger and hunger as experienced by many in our own region, and approaches to address and alleviate hunger both locally and globally.  
According to the Northern Illinois Food Bank, nearly 600,000 people in northern Illinois rely on food pantries and meal programs to feed themselves and their families. I look forward to hearing about constructive approaches to address the scourge of hunger and expert insight into how we as a community, both locally as well as globally, can participate in finding solutions and helping those whose lives are afflicted by hunger. 
""Confronting the Scourge of Hunger""

Hurricane Florence Resources and Information
My staff and I are here to help. Hurricane Florence deeply impacted our great state, but we will continue working until you get the help you need to recover. As we begin the process of recovery, I've compiled a list of resources and information below to better help. You can also visit my website HERE for further information. 
￼ 
FEMA Assistance 
	•	On September 14, 2018, President Trump issued a major disaster declaration for the State of North Carolina, ordering federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts to areas affected by severe storms, flooding, and tornadoes. The flood has displaced many families and communities. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is the primary federal agency tasked with helping individuals, businesses, and public entities recover after a disaster. 
	◦	North Carolina residents in the following counties may apply for disaster assistance: Beaufort, Bladen, Brunswick, Carteret, Columbus, Craven, Cumberland, Duplin, Harnett, Jones, Lenoir, New Hanover, Onslow, Pamlico, Pender, Robeson, Sampson, Wayne County.
	•	If you had storm or flood damage in any of the affected counties you may apply for FEMA assistance online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov or by calling 800-621-3362. Lines are open every day from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Survivors who use TTY may call 800-462-7585. Please have the following available when you call or apply:
	◦	A phone number and a reliable alternate in case FEMA needs to call you back; Address of the damaged property; Social Security number; Bank account information (or direct deposit information); Insurance information (if you have insurance); Brief description of damages; Current mailing address; and Pen and paper to write down your registration number.
	•	All applicants for federal disaster assistance have the right to appeal a decision.  Your appeal can be filed online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov or at any disaster recovery center. In order to file an appeal you must bring your determination letter, your written appeal and any supporting documents requested in your determination letter.
	•	Survivors may locate disaster centers near them at www.fema.gov/disaster-recovery-centers or by calling the FEMA helpline at 800-621-3362. You can seek assistance at any disaster recovery center, including centers in other states. The following are currently open in North Carolina:
￼ 
￼  
SBA Business Recovery Loans 
	•	The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers low-interest disaster loans to businesses of all sizes, most private nonprofit organizations, homeowners and renters. If you are a disaster survivor in North Carolina applying for assistance with FEMA and are referred to SBA, it’s important to complete the application for a low-interest disaster loan. Submit your SBA disaster loan application online at https://disasterloan.sba.gov/ela/, or at any disaster recovery center listed below.  
￼ 
￼ 
Mold and Cleanup 
	•	Mold may be a serious health risk so don’t wait for a visit from FEMA or your insurance company before you start cleaning up. FEMA inspectors and insurance claims adjusters will still be able to verify flood damage. Take lots of pictures before your insurance adjuster visits. 
	•	Be sure to consult with your local officials for instructions before setting out debris. If you don’t have local emergency management contact information, it can be found online at NCDPS.gov/Florence.  
	•	To request assistance with clean up from disaster relief agencies please visit: https://www.crisiscleanup.org or call 1-800-451-1954.  
￼ 
Ag Assistance 
	•	After Florence, many North Carolina farmers were left with livestock loss, flooded fields, damaged barns, debris, and destroyed milk and produce. Federal assistance may be available through one of the authorized disaster assistance programs under the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Additionally, the USDA has assistance for Landowners, Farmers and Producers. More information from the North Carolina Department of the USDA for flood assistance can be found at https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/disaster-assistance-program/index.  
￼ 
Food Assistance 
	•	Individuals who might not ordinarily qualify for SNAP may be eligible for D-SNAP if they had expenses related to protecting, repairing, or evacuating their homes (or if they have lost income as a result of the disaster). Additionally, individuals who are already participating in the regular SNAP program may be eligible for additional benefits under the D-SNAP. These Disaster benefits are provided like regular program benefits through an EBT card that can be used at authorized food retailers to buy food. 
	•	If you are in need of a meal, the following Southern Baptist locations are still open:  Temple Baptist Church 1500 Kingdom Way  New Bern, NC 28560 (Craven County)  First Baptist Church, Wilmington 1939 Independence Blvd. Wilmington, NC 28403 (New Hanover County) Hyde Park Baptist Church 310 N. Roberts Avenue Lumberton, NC 28358 (Robeson County)  Southview Baptist Church 4089 Elk Road Hope Mills, NC 28348 (Cumberland County)  Catalyst Church 1985 Gum Branch Rd. Jacksonville, NC 28540 (Onslow County)  Mt. Olive Baptist Church 2919 Galloway Rd. Bolivia NC (Brunswick County)   
	•	A statewide food bank database can be found at http://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank/.  
￼ 
Tax Relief  
	•	The Internal Revenue Service is providing tax relief to individual and business taxpayers impacted by Hurricane Florence and living in the areas designated by FEMA under the Federal Disaster Declaration. For the latest information about tax relief, please see: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/help-for-victims-of-hurricane-florence.  
	•	The declaration permits the IRS to postpone certain deadlines for taxpayers who reside or have a business in the disaster area. For instance, certain deadlines falling on or after Sept. 7, 2018 and before Jan. 31, 2019, are granted additional time to file through Jan. 31, 2018.
	•	The tax relief is part of a coordinated federal response to the damage caused by the floods and is based on local damage assessments by FEMA. For information on disaster recovery, individuals should visit www.disasterassistance.gov.

￼ 
WINNERS AND LOSERS
￼ 
Lindsey - 
Yesterday I spent an hour at the South Florida Water Management District Governing Board Meeting working to lower Lake O to prevent discharges.
This is what I was told: “We’re not in the business of picking winners and losers.” 
But we know that’s just not true. 
When the towns on the west coast ask for more water during the winter for the Caloosahatchee and are denied but then those same towns are sent toxic water during the summer, you are picking winners and losers. 
When you artificially inflate the height of the lake because you have 5.5 feet worth of water permitted for agriculture and then discharge toxic water to the east and west each summer, you are picking winners and losers. 
They say they have no choice because of emergency conditions, but their decisions are CAUSING the emergency conditions. 
They push the blame to the Army Corps, saying they have no choice because LORS forces their hand, but today they again admitted they already have the authority to draw down the lake to 10.5 feet. 
So, I’m still waiting for an answer: why won’t you work with us to keep the lake lower during the dry season? I think the 5.5 feet of water permitted for agriculture speaks for itself.

CONFIRMED
Majority Leader McConnell: Brett Kavanaugh will be an Excellent Supreme Court Justice 
￼
On Saturday, October 7th, under the leadership of U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Senate confirmed President Trump’s nominee for the United States Supreme Court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Senator McConnell delivered remarks on the Senate floor, saying, ""Brett Kavanaugh is among the very best our nation has to offer. He will make the Senate and the country proud. He will serve with distinction on our highest court....The chamber we are privileged to occupy is often called the world’s greatest deliberative body for good reason. When the rubber meets the road, when the hour is critical, when a historic precedent needs to be set -- the United States Senate most often finds its way to doing what is right. Today, we honored that history. We voted to turn away from the darkness. We voted to set a precedent about fairness and judgment that will define this body for the better.""

McConnell Measure Saves Rough River Residents from Costly Payments; Bill Now Goes to President for Signature  
On Wednesday, the Senate passed the America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, which now goes to President Donald Trump for his signature. This legislation, which will help support our nation’s water infrastructure, includes a number of Kentucky priorities insisted upon by Senator McConnell – including a provision to protect property owners at Rough River Lake.
“Families in the Rough River community can finally breathe a sigh of relief,” said Senator McConnell. “The measure I secured will protect property owners from paying thousands of dollars in fees to fix decades-old surveying mistakes by the Army Corps of Engineers. This is a critical issue for Kentucky’s Rough River community, where the Army Corps’ errors threatened to stick local landowners with a steep bill. As Majority Leader, I was proud to lead the charge in crafting a commonsense solution to prevent this Kentucky community from paying a financial price for past government mistakes.”
“I want to thank Senator Mitch McConnell for his willingness to help the Rough River community,” said Breckinridge County Judge/Executive Maurice Lucas. “We have fortunately avoided a costly and burdensome process for all of our local landowners because of this legislation which Senator McConnell was able to secure as Senate Majority Leader.”
K105-Radio in Leitchfield, Kentucky reported:
After an outcry by residents, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Rand Paul sponsored a provision in legislation entitled, America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, that offers financial relief to homeowners at Rough River Lake.
Working with the Army Corps’ leadership, Sen. McConnell and Sen. Paul secured a measure prohibiting the Army Corps of Engineers from imposing or collecting fees from impacted Rough River Lake residents. The legislation also requires the federal government to reimburse all property owners who have already paid fees. Click HERE to read the full article.

Congressman Al Green’s Statement on Possible Voter Registration Irregularities in Waller County, Texas 
(Prairie View, TX) - On Thursday, October 11, 2018, Congressman Al Green released the following statement regarding possible voter registration irregularities in Waller County, Texas: 
“I have received reports that students registered to vote on campus at Prairie View A&M may be required to vote at an off campus location on election day. These reports could depress voter turnout or dissuade students from exercising their right to vote.” 
“Unfortunately, Waller County has a long history of voter disenfranchisement as it relates to African-Americans and the students at Prairie View. I have alerted the U.S. Department of Justice to these reports, and look forward to working with Prairie View and Waller County to find a solution for these students before the general election on November 6, 2018.”

10/11/18 18:11,You’re Invited – Building Inclusive Workplaces for Women of Color,"  
￼ 
  
 
Dear Lindsey, 
Women of color are strong, smart, and capable. We lead our communities, our families, and often the country. 
But all too often, we face discrimination, prejudice and closed doors in the workplace. 
Women of color face vast wage gaps. Black women earn an average of just 62 cents compared to white male men. Native American women earn just 57 cents on the dollars. And for Latinas, it’s even worse -- just 54 cents.
These wage gaps add up -- if we closed the disparity in earnings, the average black woman would earn enough every year to pay for two and a half years of child care! 
We need to do better.  
As we add new job opportunities in the tech, green energy, and health care industries, we need to ensure that women of color are at the table.  
I hope you’ll join me this weekend for a Summit on Women of Color in the Health, Justice, and Tech Workforces. I’ll be hosting a discussion with experts and fellow members of the Congressional Black Women & Girls Caucus on how to open doors for women of color in these growing industries. 
Our conversation will start at 9:30 am on Saturday, October 13th at Merritt College in Oakland, and we welcome your thoughtful participation. 
I hope to see you there, and as always, my office is happy to assist you and your family. If you need help with a federal issue, please call my Oakland office at (510) 763-0370. You can also connect with me via email, facebook, twitter, and Instagram. 
In Solidarity, 
￼ 
  
P.S. Space for the summit is limited. Please follow this link to register for the event.

￼  Comstock Introduces Metro Oversight, Grant Legislation  By Renss Greene 
Rep. Barbara Comstock has introduced legislation aiming to get more money into Metro—and more oversight of its operations.
Comstock said she introduced the “Grants for Reliable, Efficient, and Accountable Transit” or GREAT Act after conversations with local, state, and business leaders around her similar legislation last year. Although that bill, the Metro Accountability and Reform Act, stalled in committee, the Metro leadership and the states since then have agreed to a number of funding and administrative reforms.
 “In light of the reforms and changes that have been made collectively there, we wanted to try to scale back our bill to do a more narrow bill that would complement what DC, Maryland and Virginia did,” Comstock said. 
And she said the possibility of bringing Amazon’s new headquarters to the region brought the legislation new attention and urgency.
“Because of the whole Amazon situation, you all of a sudden had a renewed interest,” Comstock said. 
Among the bill’s measures: reauthorizing the federal Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement grant program for $1.5 billion of 10 years, contingent on $500 million matches from Virginia, Maryland and DC; new whistleblower protections, similar to federal whistleblower protections; moving Metro employees from defined pension plans to savings plans like 401Ks; and narrowing the role of arbitrators in labor disputes.
It also targets union power by creating new protections for union whisteblowers. 
The bill comes months after a contentious debate in the Virginia General Assembly on increased transit funding that resulted in some money being moved from the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority to Metro.
“We have to have people getting back to Metro and knowing it’s a reliable form of transportation,” Comstock said. “We have in this area—certainly in my district in Virginia—we have a high number of professionals, so when you have professionals going to work, they need reliable ways to get to work.”
The bill does not commit to filling a hole in the federal government’s contributions to Metro: capital costs. The federal government only contributes to Metro’s operating costs, while much of Metro’s cost overruns in recent years can be attributed to delayed or neglected capital expenditures like major rail and station maintenance and railcar replacements.
“We’re working to continue the money. I’ve gotten the full funding that has been committed, and we’ve fought for that even against my own guys sometimes, but what we haven’t got is some really just modest reforms that have been recommended by a bipartisan coalition,” Comstock said.
Del. Karrie K. Delaney (D-67) and David A. Reid (D-32), Loudoun’s representatives on the state House of Delegates transportation committee, were unavailable for comment.

Dear Friend,  This month, I am back in my beautiful congressional district travelling up and down the coast from Marin to the Oregon border after a busy few weeks in Washington.  As always, I am grateful for all of the feedback and community engagement I get on the issues of the day, from climate change to health care to the Senate’s confirmation hearings on Brett Kavanaugh. Here’s an update on what else I’ve been working on, both locally and back in Washington.   In the Second District 
	•	Fighting Climate Change: I recently joined North Coast leaders to discuss strategies for maintaining forward progress in the fight against climate change. As a community, and a state, we must do everything we can to protect our earth. From abandoning the 2016 Paris Climate Accord to rolling back protections so corporate polluters can leak more methane into the air our kids breathe, the Trump administration regularly puts polluters over people. It was a productive discussion with community leaders and an amazing fellow panelist, Christiana Figueres, an architect of the Paris Climate Accord, about the power of state, local, and non-governmental organization leadership and the importance of accelerating our work to confront what I believe is one of the greatest environmental, economic and moral imperatives of our time.
	•	Hearing From You at Town Halls: Town halls are an important time for me to answer constituent questions and share my policy perspectives, and the response to the dozens of town halls we’ve held over the past two years has been remarkable – more than 13,000 constituents have participated (with additional participants joining us online). Most recently, I held a town hall in Marin on Holding the President Accountable with special guests, Audrey Cooper, Editor-in-Chief of the San Francisco Chronicle, and Melinda Haag, Former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California, as well as a town hall in Petaluma, where I got to answer your questions about a range of issues from the status of Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination to Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. This week, I’ll be heading to two more in Mendocino County on fire recovery and other topics. If you haven’t been able to attend one of our recent town halls, don’t worry – we’ll keep them coming!  I hope to see you at a community event soon. 
	•	Visiting Schools Across the District: One of my favorite parts of being a Representative is getting the opportunity to talk with students and visit schools throughout the district. Since school started, I have visited a number of schools including Fort Bragg High School, Miller Creek Middle School in San Rafael and  San Antonio High School in Petaluma. I enjoyed the wide ranging dialogue with these young, intelligent and civic-minded students about how their government works, current events, and some of my policy work in Congress. I also shared information about opportunities like the Veterans’ History project, Congressional App Challenge, and Congressional Art Competition.
￼ 
Back in Washington 
	•	I urged a postponement of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination proceedings: I joined 65 of my colleagues in sending a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in response to the allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh. In this letter, we urged a postponement of further nomination proceedings in response to the allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against Judge Kavanaugh. While the Constitution is clear that the review and approval of Supreme Court nominations are the responsibility of the Senate, I have expressed my strong opposition to Judge Kavanaugh -- both in my role as an elected member of the House of Representatives, and as an American.
	•	I sent a letter advocating for the preservation of our public lands: I sent a bipartisan letter to Speaker Paul Ryan and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi urging that the Land and Water Conservation Fund be permanently reauthorized and fully funded before it expires. Over the past 50 years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has helped preserve public lands here in California and across the country and provided outdoor recreation opportunities for generations of Americans.
	•	My bipartisan bill authorizing long-term leases for historic ranches and dairies in the Point Reyes National Seashore passed the House!:  I introduced H.R. 6687  to reaffirm Congress’ longstanding intent to continue authorizing historic ranches and dairies in a portion of the Point Reyes National Seashore, consistent with all environmental laws and public planning processes.  This honors a policy directive from former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar six years ago to provide long-term permits so that multigenerational ranching families have the certainty and clarity they need to continue operating.  The bill is supported by the Marin County Board of Supervisors (unanimous vote), Marin Agricultural Land Trust, and Marin Conservation League, among other groups, and has received very positive editorials from the North Bay’s two largest newspapers, the Marin Independent Journal and Press Democrat.  For more information on the bill, click here. 
	•	I secured two key wins for rural air service and pilots on the North Coast: The bipartisan Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act of 2018 will provide vital long-term funding for aviation safety, improve passenger experience, and will set in motion critical reforms to FEMA’s disaster response and recovery programs to better prepare the North Coast for disasters. In addition to these national gains, the legislation includes provisions I authored to improve rural air service for small community airports like the California Redwood Coast - Humboldt County Airport and increase the equitable treatment of forestry and fire protection pilots.
	•	I introduced the Northwest California Wilderness, Recreation, and Working Forests Act: After hearing from countless constituents and stakeholders on my draft legislation to address these issues, I introduced this carefully developed bill to protect the communities and lands we value the most. This bill will guard communities against wildfires, provide local jobs, restore lands impaired by illegal marijuana growing operations, and protect many of Northwest California’s spectacular wild places and pristine streams.

And check out my Off the Cuff w. Rep. Huffman podcast to hear my longer take on pressing policy questions.    With Best Regards,  Jared Huffman Member of Congress

10/11/18 16:50,Standing Up For Americans With Pre-Existing Conditions,"The Durbin Report: A message from Senator Richard J. Durbin
￼ 


Fellow Illinoisan, 
It was only one year ago that Congressional Republicans and President Trump cheered on efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and all of its patient protections for pre-existing conditions.  They fell just one vote short in the Senate of disrupting our entire health care system.
This week, Republicans in the Senate decided to continue on their path of health care sabotage and voted against Senator Tammy Baldwin’s (D-WI) resolution to overturn the Trump Administration’s “junk” health insurance plans.  These “junk” plans will be especially harmful for people with any kind of medical history or pre-existing condition such as asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, or a history of cancer. 
So what exactly are “junk"" health care plans? Earlier this year, the Trump Administration finalized a rule that would return the health care system to the dark days when insurance companies could refuse to cover people with pre-existing conditions and raise premiums significantly for older Americans.  Under the rule, health insurance companies will be able to peddle “junk” health insurance plans that don’t have to provide essential health benefits like maternity care, prescription drug costs, substance abuse treatment, mental health services, and emergency room visits. These plans will also be able to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, or charge them prohibitively expensive premiums. 
￼ 
DURBIN SPEAKS ON OVERTURNING JUNK HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS 
I voted in favor of Senator Baldwin’s resolution to overturn President Trump’s “junk plan” expansion because more than five million Illinoisans with a pre-existing condition are counting on quality health insurance to be there when they need it most.  These Illinoisans depend on the fundamental protections guaranteed by the Affordable Care Act. I’m dismayed Republicans disagree with this basic premise. 
We have to remain vigilant when it comes to protecting our health care from the Trump Administration’s sabotage. No one should have to pay higher premiums or be tricked into buying a worthless junk plan. And no one should be denied coverage because they have a pre-existing condition or medical history. No one knows what tomorrow will bring, and that’s why I’ll always stand up against efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. What we should be doing now is working together to improve upon the law and make health insurance more affordable for working families still struggling to make ends meet. 
Sincerely, 
U.S. Senator Dick Durbin

Lindsey – No one should ever be denied an education because they can’t afford it. 

But today, skyrocketing costs are making college more and more unaffordable. We must make sure people can get the help they need to get ahead. 

That’s why my office is partnering with the Sacramento CAL-SOAP Consortium to hold Cash for College Workshops this fall to help young people and their families apply for financial aid.

Click HERE to RSVP for a Cash for College Workshops this October!

￼
Meeting with U.C. Davis graduate students in my Washington, D.C. office.

These workshops are a great opportunity to get free, in-person help from trained volunteers.

At these Workshops, folks can get help navigating their Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and other financial aid opportunities. Students and their families will likely need several documents when applying, so be sure to click here to learn what you should bring.

It’s been ten years since the 2008 economic crisis. Thankfully, our economy is stronger and many folks are back on their feet, but we still have more work to do to make sure our students are ready for the workforce – and that starts with a good education.

If you’re interested in attending a Cash for College Workshop, please visit my website to learn more or RSVP. You may also call my office at (916) 635-0505 to ask any questions!

Be well,

Do you support allowing pharmacists to share lower drug prices with patients?


Yes, I support allowing pharmacists to share lower drug prices with patients.

No, I oppose allowing pharmacists to share lower drug prices with patients

I don't know/have no opinion.

Click to open in a separate window

Dear Friend,
Good news! 
President Trump has signed two bills into law removing barriers preventing pharmacists from helping patients find the least expensive way to purchase their prescription drugs.
The “Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act (S.2554)” and the “Know the Lowest Price Act (S.2553)"" prohibit pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from imposing provisions in pharmacy contracts that bar pharmacists from sharing lower drug prices with patients, also known as “gag clauses.” 
A 2018 report by the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics determined patients overpaid for their prescription drugs at the pharmacy 23 percent of the time.  As a result, patients may be paying more for their prescriptions than is warranted because of the PBM gag clauses.
As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee I am proud to have helped steer these two bills through Congress.  Like you, I have long believed patients should always pay the lowest cost for their medications at the pharmacy counter.  These new laws will boost transparency in prescription drug purchasing and reduce prescription drug costs for patients. 
Thank you for taking the time to read this important legislative update.   Let me know your thoughts and views by replying to this e-mail or leaving me a message on my Facebook page.  I look forward to hearing from you. 
Best personal wishes,  
￼  Leonard Lance

Click here if you have trouble viewing this email
￼
Congressman Don Beyer will host his Fourth Annual Women’s Conference, Breaking Through: Women Work For Change, to be held Saturday, October 13th, at 8:30 AM at George Mason University’s Arlington Campus. 
George Mason’s Dr. Toni-Michelle C. Travis, Professor of Political Science, will open the Conference and introduce Kaitlyn Oliver, who will lead the Pledge of Allegiance.
Congressman Don Beyer will then offer opening remarks, followed by an opening performance by Carla Dirlikov Canales from The Canales Project. After the performance, the Congressman will introduce Delegate Danica Roem who will deliver the keynote address. After the conclusion of the keynote, Mr. Beyer will present the Clara Mortenson Beyer Women and Children First Award to Naomi Wadler.
Delegate Danica Roem represents the 13th District in the Virginia House of Delegates. She is a 33-year-old step-mom, lifelong resident of Prince William County, and the former lead reporter of the Gainesville Times. Delegate Roem’s inspiring and transformative campaign gained national and international attention. Her victory was secured by sticking to the issues that matter most to her constituents, and never shying away from standing up for justice.  As the first out transgender woman elected to a state legislature, she is blazing a new and unique trail.
Naomi Wadler, 11, organized youth protests at her school in the aftermath of the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida earlier this year. Her subsequent address to crowds at the March For Our Lives in Washington D.C. became an international sensation. Beyer first met Wadler at his Alexandria town hall on gun violence, held weeks after the Parkland shooting.
After the presentation of the Clara Mortenson Beyer Award, Megan Beyer, the former Executive Director of President Obama’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, will moderate the plenary panel, Making History in Virginia with the ERA, with insightful perspectives on the history of the ERA and its future from Lynda Johnson Robb, Delegate Jennifer Carroll Foy and Bettina Hager.
Lynda Johnson Robb is a chairwoman, advocate for literacy, and the eldest daughter of President Lyndon Johnson. Ms. Robb chaired President Jimmy Carter’s Advisory Committee for Women that promoted women’s equality in American policy and culture. Delegate Carroll Foy currently represents the 2nd House District, part of Prince William and Stafford County, and is a public defender, lifelong Virginian, and foster mom. Bettina Hagar is the DC Director and COO of the ERA Coalition and Fund for Women’s Equality.
Following this, breakout sessions will be held on the following topics:
Starting a Movement – Mobilizing Support and Driving Solutions
Michelle Millben – CEO and Founder, MGMC Enterprises LLC. 
Kim Anderson – Executive Vice President, Democracy Alliance 
Jennifer Herrera – Virginia Chapter Leader, Moms Demand Action
Miriam Gennari – Environmental Advocate
Gender and the Supreme Court—Understanding the Impact on Women’s Issues
Jill Morrison — Executive Director Women’s Law & Public Policy Fellowship Georgetown University
Rebecca Buckwalter-Poza – Journalist
Emily Martin – Vice President for Education & Workplace Justice, National Women’s Law Center
Conference participants have the opportunity to choose which of the breakout sessions to attend after the plenary concludes.
This event is free to the public. Attendees must register online here or by contacting Rep. Beyer’s District Office at (703) 658-5403.

Dear friend, 
As someone born-and-raised in western Wisconsin, I am proud to work every day on solutions for the issues that matter most to our communities.
Medicare Open Enrollment is Around the Corner From October 15 to December 7, all Wisconsinites with Medicare can change their Medicare health plans and prescription drug coverage for the following year to better meet their needs.  If you have questions about signing up or want to talk through your options with a trained professional, call 1-800-MEDICARE or visit Medicare.gov. My office can also help connect you with the right person to find more information about plans.
Fighting for Wisconsin Workers and Farmers Earlier this month, the President announced an updated North American Free Trade Agreement, better known as NAFTA. I agree that American workers, farmers and families need an updated NAFTA agreement for the 21st century. The trilateral deal announced is a step forward in this process, but now it’s time for us to come together to discuss the outstanding issues that remain.
Going forward, we need to demand the highest possible labor and environmental standards, lift tariffs hurting Wisconsin, and keep the pressure on the President to get the best deal for America’s Dairyland with both Canada and Mexico. I will continue working with my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee to ensure our farmers and producers get the best deal possible, and markets stay open and accessible.
Here to Help My office is available to help you work through issues with government agencies and departments. This includes getting copies of service records, receiving benefits, and cutting through government red tape. You can reach the office by calling 1-888-442-8040 or visiting kind.house.gov.
Sincerely,

NEWS 
ISSUES 
Dear Friend, 
We recently learned that the Administration is shuttling hundreds of migrant children overnight to a tent city in Tornillo, Texas. In response, I wrote Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar requesting more information on these midnight runs, and whether HHS plans to open other temporary shelters for migrant children.  
I also visited the South Texas Family Residential Center this week in Dilley, Texas to follow-up on a letter I led the Hispanic Caucus in asking the Department of Homeland Security for answers following reports that an 18-month-old died from an infection she contracted in this facility. 
We must continue to shed light on the issue of minors held in detention, and reuniting all those children who were separated from their parents as part of the Trump Administration’s zero-tolerance immigration policy. I joined MSNBC’s Ari Melber this week to discuss the latest on immigration. 
Federal Grants for San Antonio 
Congrats to the Education Service Center Region 20 for the $500,000 grant from U.S. Department of Education to improve childhood literacy.  
Congrats to San Antonio College for the $68,000+ grant received for cybersecurity education.  
Congrats to VIA Metropolitan Transit who received $6M from the U.S. Department of Transportation to advance efforts to grow and service VIAtrans fleets.  
Congrats to the University of Texas San Antonio and Northwest Vista College for the $1.5 million in federal funding from the United States Department of Education for the Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program.  
Honoring Veterans in San Antonio 
It was an honor to present medals to World War II United States Army Veteran, Private First Class Milton Sauceda. I am grateful for his service to our nation. 
￼￼ 
Team Castro also attended the Unaccompanied Veteran Burials of US Army Veterans, Mr. David Morales and Mr. Fred Council Jr. On behalf of the San Antonio community, we thank the two Veterans for their service to our great nation.
￼￼ 
Community Outreach 
It was great to sit down with University of Houston-Downtown students in San Antonio to discuss matters surrounding urban Latino communities. I also joined UnidosUS to discuss the Republican tax bill’s harmful effects on San Antonians and the 100+ children who remain separated from their families as part of the Administration’s brutal immigration policies.
￼￼ 
District Updates 
Team Castro joined the University of Texas San Antonio’s Cyber Threat Defender Tournament over the weekend, where students ages 11 and up competed in a cybersecurity-based card tournament; attended the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Luncheon Featuring Dr. Mike Flores, new Alamo Colleges District Chancellor as he laid out his vision for the District in the coming years; and attended the San Antonio’s Single Member Districts Celebrating Equal Representation and a Civil Rights Pioneer discussion at St Mary’s University in remembrance of the first anniversary of the death of Choco Meza among other events around the district.
￼￼￼ 
Foreign Affairs 
Upon Nikki Haley’s resignation as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, I believe the President should be picking a replacement that is a seasoned diplomat and can navigate the United Nations and U.S. diplomacy well. Watch my full interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer here. 
I am also deeply disturbed by the mysterious disappearance of Saudi Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey this week. I joined my colleagues on Capitol Hill in a bipartisan, bicameral letter to the President urging him to raise this issue with the governments of Saudi Arabia and Turkey and for the United States to offer assistance in the investigation. You can also listen to my BBC Newshour interview here.  
As Congress continues to address issues that directly affect San Antonians’ daily lives, I want to hear from you. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or questions for me by calling my office at 210-348-8216 or reaching out online through my website, castro.house.gov.

Montanans Should Have More Say Than Illegal Immigrants
￼
Image: ICE.gov
What’s New:  During a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing this week, I pressed the nominee to lead the Census Bureau to support including a citizenship question in the upcoming 2020 Census. This sensible question would provide a simple breakdown of how many citizens and noncitizens—including illegal immigrants—we have in our country, which we currently do not know. Having this basic information is crucial to ensuring proper representation in Congress and proper allocation of federal resources.  Why It Matters:  The Census is conducted every ten years to count the number of individuals living in the United States for the purposes of representation in the U.S. House of Representatives and the distribution of taxpayer dollars to states and localities.  It is common sense for a sovereign nation to know how many citizens and noncitizens are in the country. Unfortunately, it is the total population of the states – including the millions of people here in our country illegally – that is used to make these determinations. That means the Census counts an illegal immigrant hiding in California the same as a hardworking, taxpaying citizen in Montana.  I believe citizens in Montana should have more say in Washington, D.C. than illegal immigrants harboring in sanctuary cities across the country. It makes no sense why a state like California that harbors millions of people here illegally is rewarded with additional representation in Congress and taxpayer resources at the expense of more rural states like Montana. That is rewarding illegal behavior.  What’s Next:  April 1, 2020 is the official date of the Census. Rest assured, I will continue fighting for Montanans to ensure taxpayer dollars are distributed fairly and that the citizens of this country, not illegal immigrants, are properly represented in Congress.   Survey:  
Do you support including the citizenship question in the 2020 Census? 
Yes
No

October 11, 2018 
Fighting Human Trafficking & Funding Alzheimer’s Research 
 


Dear Neighbor,
Recently, the House passed two important bills to fight sexual assault and human trafficking. H.R. 6847, the Preventing Child Exploitation Act of 2018, contains harsher penalties for repeat sex offenders and offenders that fail to register or provide important information to law enforcement. It also extends the statute of limitations for victims of sexual assault as minors. This ensures that that survivors of sexual assault can rightfully seek justice. 
Unfortunately, human trafficking is a big business, and human traffickers generate roughly $150 billion in illegal profits per year. Much of that money moves through our financial and banking system undetected. H.R. 6729, the Empowering Financial Institutions to Fight Human Trafficking Act of 2018, would allow nonprofit organizations to help financial institutions better identify those who are moving around dirty money. Houston has the highest number of trafficking victims nation-wide, and I will continue to do everything in my power to fight modern-day slavery at home in Houston and worldwide. 
Another legislative victory for communities across the nation is the largest-ever funding increase for Alzheimer’s and dementia research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). More than 5 million Americans are living with this disease and by 2050 this number is projected to rise to nearly 14 million. Because of the recent increases in NIH funding – something I have fought to increase every year I’ve served in Congress - scientists can now work at a more rapid pace to advance our knowledge about the disease, explore ways to reduce risk, uncover new biomarkers for early diagnosis and drug targeting, and develop new treatments. I’m committed to continuing my work in Congress to increase funding for scientific and medical research and to implement policies that improve access to these critical services.
It is an honor and privilege to represent you and Texas in the United States House.
Sincerely,   ￼  John Culberson

Dear Lindsey,
  I believe we have a solemn responsibility to protect our natural environment against degradation and destruction. The impact of human activity on the environment is no longer in doubt, the only question is whether we will summon the collective will to mitigate or reverse the damage. On Monday, the Untied Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report indicating that the world has only 12 years to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit global warming to moderate levels. The report details the particularly dangerous consequences we will face if we don’t act: extreme food shortages, more frequent and extreme wildfires, continued rise in sea levels, and refugee crises around the globe.  
North Carolina faces particularly significant risks from the impact of climate change. Current and projected impacts for our region indicate additional increases in sea level, greater intensity of hurricanes and storms, heightened spread of diseases, and habitat alterations – especially along our coast.
The scientific evidence linking climate change to human activity is beyond dispute, yet despite progress in recent years, the current administration, along with the help of congressional Republicans, have severely damaged hopes of any comprehensive strategy for mitigating or reversing it.  Moving forward, it is clear that we need ambitious solutions, such as a carbon tax or ‘cap and trade’ policy that will dramatically reduce carbon emissions and incentivize clean energy practices.
As you may know, during the Obama administration, the House passed legislation with my strong support to adopt a “cap-and-trade” system to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but the measure died in the Senate.  Undeterred, the Obama administration also adopted new regulations limiting emissions from vehicles, power plants, and other sources, and negotiated the most sweeping international climate agreement in history, the Paris Climate Agreement. 
Unfortunately, from day one, President Trump has employed a scorched-earth approach to environmental policy, empowering climate deniers and anti-environmental extremists within his administration to systematically dismantle these accomplishments. I cosponsored a resolution along with 181 colleagues in the House condemning President Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris accords, an agreement signed by every country in the world. Equally concerning was his decision to roll back critical, common-sense regulations such as the Clean Power Plan, the ban on offshore drilling along the Outer Continental Shelf, and his relaxation of rules governing vehicle emissions.
As a member of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC), I helped lead the effort to oppose President Trump’s decision to re-open the Atlantic Ocean to seismic testing and offshore drilling, and even co-introduced a bill, the Safe COAST Act, to protect offshore drilling safety regulations from interference by the Trump administration. Additionally, as our state’s only member of the Appropriations Committee, I have advocated for robust funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), supported additional funding and research for the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and last year was instrumental in ensuring that the Department of Interior’s (DOI) Climate Science Centers remained open and funded in order to continue conducting important studies on how to adapt to the impacts of climate change. 
We cannot afford to ignore the threat of climate change any longer. I will continue working in Congress to pursue responsible policies that protect our environment, curb human activities that contribute to climate change, and mitigate the impact it has already had on our communities. As Congress continue to debate these issues, I will appreciate knowing of your views.   
Sincerely, 
￼

Rep. Blum Hosts 2nd Public Event to Combat Opioid Crisis
Dubuque & Cedar Rapids Awarded Grants to Aid Crisis
After hosting an extremely productive Opioid Conference this past July focused on law enforcement efforts, Rep. Blum is planning a second conference on October 17th in Waterloo-- this time focused on health care. 

The conference will be held on October 17, 2018 from 5-7PM at the Iowa Veterans Museum (503 South Street) in Waterloo and will feature a legislative update from Rep. Blum, Keynote Speaker Ann Saba, MPH, Communications and Research Specialist, Injury Prevention and Research Center, University of Iowa, and a panel of area health professionals. 

This year, Congress has passed over 60 opioid bills. Last month, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  awarded over $1 billion in grants to combat the opioid crisis. This funding includes specific grants to Cedar Rapids ($285,000) and Dubuque ($198,250) through the Expanding Access to Quality Substance Use Disorder and Mental Health Services (SUD-MH) awards. The SUD-MH awards support health centers in implementing and advancing evidence-based strategies that best meet the substance use disorder and mental health needs of the populations they serve.

Congressman Blum commented, “In addition to the millions of Americans dealing with an ongoing opioid addiction, there were 314 deaths in the state of Iowa caused by opioid overdose in 2016. I have worked with my Democrat and Republican colleagues in Washington, D.C. to pass legislation that activates assistance from the federal level. Still, there is more that we can do, and I will be hosting my second Opioid Drug Conference on October 17th to identify potential solutions and discuss the issue on a community level.”

October 11, 2018 

I wanted to take a moment and talk about a subject I know is of great importance to you: health care and how much it costs. 
As your Congressman, I am pursuing bipartisan solutions to lower costs, improve the quality of care, and expand coverage.  We need to stabilize the marketplaces so that families in Northeastern Pennsylvania have reliable access to health care.  I believe that Congress must explore policies that have been able to successfully keep costs down in the most innovative U.S. states and in other countries.
This year, I brought together local health care providers, insurers, small business owners, and community leaders in our district for a health care roundtable to help identify solutions that will work for the people of Northeastern Pennsylvania.  There is still more work to be done to guarantee reliable, affordable health care for everyone.  We must secure the critical protections provided by the Affordable Care Act and address the legitimate concerns of those still being left behind by our country's health care system.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pursue improvements to the ACA.

Dear Friend, 
Arizonans know Washington is a mess, and they expect our leaders to stop the political games and get things done for everyday families. I recently worked across the aisle to cut through the dysfunction and pass three bipartisan bills through the House of Representatives. These are real solutions that fight human trafficking, protect our country from weapons of mass destruction, and help Arizona veterans pursue homeownership.
Here are some highlights:
I co-introduced the Improving Strategies to Counter Weapons Proliferation Act, with Congressman Scott Tipton (CO-03) to help choke off financing for terrorist organizations and rogue states engaged in weapons proliferation.
I helped pass the Protect Affordable Mortgages for Veterans Act, with Republicans Lee Zeldin (NY-01) and Claudia Tenney (NY-22). I was the lead Democratic cosponsor of this bill to make a critical fix to existing law that helps Arizona veteran homeowners save money and pay off their mortgages, all while ensuring they remain protected from shady lenders.
I also worked across the aisle to pass the Empowering Financial Institutions to Fight Human Trafficking Act of 2018 through the House. The bill empowers qualified nonprofits to share information and report potential human trafficking and money laundering activities to financial institutions so that they can freeze assets and stop traffickers in their tracks.  Click here to watch my floor speech.

10/10/18 18:24,State of Emergency Expanded for Hurricane Michael,"￼

 Dear Friends,
Hurricane Matthew is nearing landfall and will be moving north toward Georgia in the coming hours. The hurricane was upgraded this morning to a Category 4 as it approached the Florida panhandle, and Governor Deal expanded the state of emergency in Georgia to include 16 additional counties, bringing the total up to 108 counties in Georgia.
￼  
The 108 counties under emergency declaration are: Appling, Atkinson, Bacon, Baker, Baldwin, Ben Hill, Berrien, Bibb, Bleckley, Brantley, Brooks, Bryan, Bulloch, Burke, Butts, Calhoun, Camden, Candler, Charlton, Chatham, Chattahoochee, Clay, Clarke, Clinch, Coffee, Colquitt, Columbia, Cook, Crawford, Crisp, Decatur, Dodge, Dooly, Dougherty, Early, Echols, Effingham, Elbert, Emanuel, Evans, Glascock, Glynn, Grady, Greene, Hancock, Houston, Irwin, Jasper, Jeff Davis, Jefferson, Jenkins, Johnson, Jones, Lamar, Lanier, Laurens, Lee, Liberty, Lincoln, Long, Lowndes, Macon, Marion, McDuffie, McIntosh, Miller, Mitchell, Monroe, Morgan, Montgomery, Muscogee, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Peach, Pierce, Pulaski, Putnam, Quitman, Randolph, Richmond, Schley, Screven, Seminole, Stewart, Sumter, Talbot, Taliaferro, Tattnall, Taylor, Telfair, Terrell, Thomas, Tift, Toombs, Treutlen, Turner, Twiggs, Upson, Ware, Warren, Washington, Wayne, Webster, Wheeler, Wilcox, Wilkes, Wilkinson and Worth counties.
We are praying for Georgia and our neighboring states as Hurricane Michael makes impact. Governor Deal, the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and our first responders, businesses and communities are taking precautions. 
We urge all Georgians to remain vigilant and heed officials’ advice as the storm makes landfall and progresses northward. We remain in close communication with Governor Deal, and Senator Perdue and I will work together in the Senate and do all we can to support preparedness, response and recovery efforts. We’ve written to President Trump urging expedited emergency resources to aid counties in Georgia expected to be impacted by Hurricane Michael.
Please take this time to prepare, hunker down and please follow the advice of all officials in the hours and days ahead. Resources that may be helpful are included below.
Additional Georgia hurricane resources can be found at the links below:
	•	View up-to-date emergency declarations from Governor Deal here .

Dear Friend,
It's deeply troubling that our service men and women might return home from battle only to take their own lives because they are tortured by something they experienced during their service. I asked the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) how they are working with the Department of Defense (DOD) to curb veteran suicide during a meeting of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.

I was joined by the Somers family from Coronado, who lost their son, Daniel, to suicide after he suffered post-traumatic stress (PTS) following his service in Iraq. They are now tireless advocates for fixing and reforming the broken health care system at the VA.

Increasing Collaboration
￼
Watch my remarks here.
The National Director of Suicide Prevention for the VA said they would like more information from the DOD about risk factors for suicide. The VA could identify mental health issues sooner if they had access to information about servicemembers’ promotions, disciplinary action, and family support systems.
I also asked what kind of outreach was being done for veterans with other than honorable discharges. Only 115 servicemembers nationwide are enrolled in suicide prevention programs specifically tailored to them, and the VA agreed more outreach was needed.  

Fighting for San Diego Veterans
San Diego has the third largest population of veterans in the country, many of whom are battling mental health issues. Veterans who have experienced homelessness in the last year are particularly at risk, with suicide rates almost double those of veterans without a history of homelessness. We’ve made progress with the HUD-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program, which assists San Diego veterans in their search for affordable housing, but there is still work to be done.
I will continue fighting for mental health care and homelessness services for San Diego veterans and will work with both the VA and the DOD to find solutions that ensure we don’t lose another veteran to suicide. 
Sincerely,

￼

Friends, 
As we move into the fall months and embrace the colder weather, I wanted to let you know what I’ve been working on. We have good news in the fight to combat the opioid epidemic, and I have also introduced legislation to help Ohio veterans.  
First, the House and Senate passed H.R. 6, the most significant congressional action against a single drug crisis in history. It’s now heading to the President’s desk and should be signed into law any day. The legislation includes my bill, the INFO Act. Read more below on how the provisions in the legislation will help turn addiction and overdose trends around.
Also, after meeting with members of my Veterans Advisory Group recently, I learned that some Ohio veterans had missed the window to appeal claims denials because delivery of their notification was delayed. It is completely unacceptable that a veteran could lose their ability to appeal a claim because of bureaucratic mistakes. I introduced legislation, the Veterans Right to Expediency Act, to fix this issue by requiring all claim denials be sent by certified mail. Sending these notifications by certified mail will make sure that veterans are made aware of their claim outcomes in a timely manner.
Speaking of veterans, it’s always a moving moment when Flag City Honor Flights make their way to Washington so veterans can see the monuments dedicated to their service and sacrifice. My staff was there on the National Mall to greet these American heroes. Thank you to all of our veterans for everything you’ve done for our great nation.
An update on recent happenings:
 In Congress
Tax Reform 2.0 Will Continue Economic Momentum
Since the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we’ve seen our economy take off. From record-low unemployment numbers (3.7% overall unemployment, the lowest in 49 years; 3.6% unemployment for women, the lowest in 65 years; and five months of unemployment below 4% this year) and rising wages to sky-high optimism among small businesses and manufacturers – tax reform is making a real difference in people’s lives.
I recently joined my colleagues in passing three pieces of legislation known as “Tax Reform 2.0” to build on this momentum by making the tax relief for small businesses and individuals permanent. Tax Reform 2.0 also includes new policies to help Americans save or start a business.
Tax Reform 2.0 makes permanent provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that: -Lower Tax Rates -Double the Child Tax Credit for Families -Double the Exemption for the Death Tax -Provide the First Ever Paid Family Leave Tax Credit
According to the non-partisan Tax Foundation’s analysis, this will create 1.5 million new jobs, increase wages by 0.9%, and increase GDP by 2.2%. Ohio families are seeing more money in their pockets, American business are growing, and workers are getting jobs – let’s keep the good news going.  
Asking the Experts About the Increase in Deaths Due to Pregnancy-Related Complications
It is very concerning to know that the United States has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the developed world. This is particularly scary for soon-to-be-mothers and new moms who live in rural areas that lack OBGYN services. I was able to ask March of Dimes President Stacey Stewart about this problem in a recent Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health hearing.  Stewart said many “maternity care deserts” that require women to travel to receive pregnancy care, and the closing of hospitals in rural areas, has been well documented and affect the quality of care women are able to receive. 
In addition, both Stewart and Dr. Lynne Coslett-Charlton, an OBGYN, said there is a significant impact of the opioid misuse crisis on maternal mortality, and solutions to improve these rates from mental health professionals are critical. You can watch my questions here. I'll continue to use my position on the Energy and Commerce Committee to find solutions to decrease maternal mortality rates and keep Ohio mothers healthy.  
Guardian of Small Business Award
I was honored to be named a “Guardian of Small Business” by The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation’s largest small business organization. Small businesses create two out of every three new jobs and are the engines of our economy. 
I earned the award based on my 100% pro-small business voting record, and I'll continue to support legislation that helps Ohio’s small businesses and their employees. Because of new policies that decrease regulations, eliminate government red tape, and reduce taxes on small businesses, we’re seeing small business growth and increased job creation.   
Ensuring Our Energy Grid is Safe From Cyberattacks
Keeping our energy grid safe from cyberattacks is a serious national security issue, and one I don’t take lightly. Recently, I questioned a Department of Energy (DOE) official who is charged with heading up grid cybersecurity efforts about what is being done to modernize and upgrade the nation’s energy infrastructure. 
I asked Assistant Secretary Karen Evans at an Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing to talk about the work DOE is already doing to improve coordination between the agency and the private sector to identify and promote cyber-secure products that keep our grid safe. Evans explained that DOE has just begun a pilot program to improve communications between DOE and the private sector.    I’ve already introduced two bipartisan bills to improve this coordination and give the agency the tools needed to upgrade our energy infrastructure and protect our grid from cyber attacks.   
Around the District 
FEMA Grant for Local Fire Departments
I met with Sylvania Township Fire Chief Michael Ramm and other Chiefs from Lucas County recently to discuss a FEMA grant they received that will purchase updated radio equipment for eight area departments. The FEMA grant will help offset costs for equipment that will go a long way to help the men and women in their departments communicate, and better serve the public. Thank you to our first responders for all you do to keep our communities safe.  
Military Service Academy Night
We had a big turn-out of high school students and their family members at an informational meeting at Owens Community College in Findlay. It was inspiring to see so many students interested in attending an academy and serving their country. 
The students were able to talk with representatives from all of the military service academies and find out about the application process. I always look forward to meeting with our country’s future leaders and wish them all the best of luck as they work towards their goal.   Touring Penta Career Center  For the first time in our country’s history, the number of available jobs is greater than the number of people looking for work (6.3 million unemployed with 6.9 million job openings at the end of May). That means there is tremendous opportunity for Ohioans to begin careers – in high-paying fields – if they have the right skills and education. In Northwest and West Central Ohio, we’re blessed to have a number of excellent career centers that help prepare students for the jobs of tomorrow.   I recently toured Penta Career Center in Perrysburg Township to see the programs they have in place to educate students to enter the workforce including welding, fire safety, and advanced manufacturing.  I also spoke about my support of the Strengthening Career and Technical Education (CTE) for the 21st Century Act, legislation which was signed into law recently. The legislation makes a number of key reforms to career and technical education including encouraging better partnerships with employers and local business leaders and streamlining the application process for CTE programs.

 INFO Act Included in Final Opioid Package
Ohio has been especially hard-hit by the opioid crisis with overdoses continuing to rise to record levels in 2017. After hearing from people affected by this crisis, I've worked to find solutions. I authored the Indexing, Narcotics, Fentanyl, and Opioids (INFO) Act after hearing from those on the front lines about difficulties they were having obtaining available funding and needed information.  The INFO Act was recently included the final opioid package negotiated between the House and the Senate and is now on its way to the President's desk. In fact, the Washington Examiner named the INFO Act as one of the 4 key provisions included in the final opioid bill.  The INFO Act will help health care providers, advocates, law enforcement, and local governments by creating a one-stop-shop for communities to find resources and information to combat this epidemic. With nearly $7 billion being made available to combat this epidemic in recent legislation, the INFO Act will help ensure that funding ends up in the hands of the people that can make the biggest difference. 
 
Sky-High Optimism for American Manufacturing 
Ohio's 5th Congressional District is home to more than 60,000 manufacturing jobs. When American manufacturing is doing well, it means Northwest and West Central Ohio are doing well. According to a recent survey by the National Association of Manufacturers, 95.1% of manufacturers have a positive outlook for their companies – an all-time high.   But what does this mean in real terms for the workers and small business owners that make up our manufacturing sector? 
We heard from manufacturers at a recent subcommittee hearing I chaired which included Nikki Moyers, VP of Operations at Perrysburg’s Jerl Machine. Hearing from these manufacturers, it's clear that pro-growth policies like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are making a difference for American businesses and their employees. Nikki told us about the impact that tax cuts are having for Jerl Machine which includes higher wages and bonuses for their workers, and more opportunities for their company to take on new business. 
Jerl’s story is just one of many successful companies around Northwest and West Central Ohio, but it paints a picture of the real impact that a booming economy can have. You can watch her opening statement here.

From the Hill to the Mountains
Defending the Postal Service Against Privatization
I was proud to co-sponsor a Senate resolution opposing the privatization of the United States Postal Service (USPS). Under the previous consolidation implemented by the USPS under the Post Office Structure Plan (POST) in 2012, 478 post offices around West Virginia had their hours drastically reduced to as little as two hours per day. Given that the POST Plan was undertaken after significant backlash against the previous proposal to close thousands of post offices around the country, it stands to reason that nearly the nearly 500 post offices affected by this plan would be vulnerable to closure if USPS were privatized.  
In West Virginia, especially in our rural communities, we understand the importance of our post offices. In many small towns, they are the lifelines of their communities and a way to stay connected. They are more than just places to send and receive mail. I will continue defending rural communities across West Virginia and that includes fighting the privatization of the postal service.

Lewis addresses opioid epidemic

Dear Lindsey,
Our country is facing an unprecedented opioid epidemic. Addiction affects millions of individuals and families around the country, and sadly most of us know someone who has been affected by this crisis. Since coming to Congress, I have supported numerous initiatives and even introduced my own piece of legislation in an effort to help our communities stop this crisis.
This spring, I introduced a bill that would direct the Department of Labor to establish an advisory committee on opioids and the workplace. We must comprehensively study and analyze the ways in which addiction affects the lives of those afflicted, and I believe we all must look to how workplaces play a role in this. Many workplaces want to help support their employees, but do not know the best practices or proactive steps to take to help prevent or address addictions.
I’m thankful to have worked across the aisle with Congressman Matt Cartwright (PA-17) on this bill to help address the harmful effects of opioid abuse in the workplace and take proactive steps to see what actions employers can take to address affected employees. 
Additionally, I recently voted in favor of H.R. 6, The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, as it passed the House. This bill is the most significant congressional action against a drug crisis in history and will help support treatment, recovery, and prevention efforts in our communities as well as taking steps to address the growing threat of fentanyl. It also removes barriers in Medicare and Medicaid to help individuals with substance use disorders.
While we make great progress with this bill, I also believe we must do a better job in treating these addictions like the medical issue they are and not solely a criminal issue. That is why I will continue to work toward criminal justice reform that helps low-level, non-violent drug offenders get back on the right track and reduce their likelihood of recidivism by utilizing drug courts and treatment programs. 
We have made great progress in addressing this crisis, and I look forward in continuing to help address opioid addiction.
As I work on this and other issues, I always like to hear directly from you.  Please share any thoughts you may have through my website, and sign up for my e-mail newsletter for the latest updates from Washington, D.C. and around the district. You can also stay on top of my work by following my Facebook and Twitter pages. Please feel free to call my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-2271 or my local Burnsville office at 651-846-2120 with any comments or for assistance with a federal agency.

Sincerely,

Dear ,
In August, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) launched a year-long study that will ultimately determine whether or not to allow oil drilling and fracking across 1.6 million acres of public land, including in our own backyard. Once again, the Trump Administration is attempting to sell off our public lands to enrich private corporations. 
￼
 Rep. Carbajal Tours the Carrizo Plain National Monument

I invite you to join me for a community event TOMORROW, October 11th, at the Santa Barbara County Courthouse to speak out against the Administration's plans to expand oil drilling and fracking on the Central Coast.
RSVP to let me know you're coming!  Despite the magnitude of this proposal and its impact on our community, BLM only gave residents 30 days to share their concerns. I believe this is insufficient time for Central Coast residents to make their voices heard. You can submit a comment through my office by clicking here.  
￼ 
 

IMPROVING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
 Skyrocketing rent on the Central Coast has unfortunately forced some of the most vulnerable members of our community out, or put them at risk of poverty and homelessness. I'm fighting for federal resources that ensure every hard-working individual on the Central Coast has access to a safe and affordable place to call home.   Read more: People of All Incomes Deserve a Home by Rep. Salud Carbajal (Independent)

 Rep. Carbajal attends Johnson Court groundbreaking in Santa Barbara

On Monday, I attended the groundbreaking ceremony for Johnson Court, an affordable housing unit for homeless veterans in Santa Barbara. I'm excited about the new opportunities created by similar developments for struggling families, veterans, and seniors. 

STRENGTHENING OUR PIPELINE SAFETY
 It has been nearly a decade since Congress passed the Pipeline Safety Act, and yet the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has still not enforced rules requiring automatic shutoff valves on new pipelines or strengthened leak detection standards.   The disastrous Refugio Oil Spill in 2015 spilled thousands of gallons of crude oil on our coastline, and raised questions about PHMSA's ability to properly oversee pipeline safety laws. Last week, I wrote to the Appropriations committee urging them to include funding in this year's spending bill that directs PHMSA to finalize critical pipeline safety standards.
￼
 Read the full letter here. 


CREATING RENEWABLE ENERGY OPPORTUNITIES ON THE CENTRAL COAST
 As our community faces the impending challenges of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant's decommissioning, one of my priorities is securing federal resources that would offset the closure's impact on San Luis Obispo County's economy.   Last month, my colleagues and I passed bipartisan legislation directing the Department of Energy to study funding sources available to assist communities, like ours, who are facing the challenges of a nuclear power plant's closure.   With this significant challenge also comes an opportunity to designate the Central Coast a renewable energy hub. That's why I introduced the Energy Opportunity Zones Act earlier this year, which would create and expand tax credits for renewable energy business development in regions impacted by nuclear power plant closures.

￼
Great news out last night >> President Trump announced his administration will take steps to approve year-round E15.  
As many of you know, I've been putting tremendous pressure on the administration to make this move - and it's paid off. We're getting results. Under the president’s direction, the EPA will now begin the rule-making process that would allow for 15 percent ethanol blends to be used throughout the year – a market we’ve been unable to tap because of federal regulations. 
￼ 
President Trump and I have had many conversations about the expansion of E15. He knows where I stand, and that I wouldn't give up on this issue until we made it right for farmers in South Dakota and for consumers who are demanding more affordable, homegrown fuels. I am grateful that he has followed through on this promise to the American people. 
Have a great day!

Confirming Justice Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the United States Supreme Court 
I voted to confirm Justice Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court because of his 26 years of distinguished public service and his reputation as a superior jurist, lawyer and teacher. It would be fundamentally unfair and a dangerous precedent not to confirm him because of an uncorroborated alleged sexual assault 36 years ago. I reviewed six FBI reports between 1993 and 2018, where 150 people were interviewed about Justice Kavanaugh, and in every case the interviewee was asked, do you know of any incidence of alcohol abuse? And the answer in every case was no. I also reviewed the seventh background check involving Justice Kavanaugh, which was conducted earlier last week. It confirmed that the only person who remembers the incident Dr. Ford alleges is Dr. Ford, including the four others she said were present, each of whom stated under penalty of felony that it didn’t happen or that they don’t remember any such incident. Senate Democrats have treated Justice Kavanaugh as innocent until nominated. They have victimized him and Dr. Ford and their families. They have diminished the United States Senate and its confirmation process by their embarrassing irresponsibility. I was glad to vote to confirm Justice Kavanaugh to the Court last week.
￼
I met with then-Judge Kavanaugh on July 26 and was impressed with his intelligence, his temperament, and his character.
 
￼
I joined Chuck Todd on Meet the Press on Sunday to talk about my vote to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh. I said: “It’d be hard to have public confidence if you go through an inquisition like he did arranged by the Democrats. If you read the 6 FBI investigations of him over 25 years and see, not just the bad things that were not said about him, but the remarkably good things that were said about him, you would be very glad he’d be on the Supreme Court. And it would be fundamentally unfair to allow people to make accusations against someone and simply by doing that, destroy their reputation and their opportunity to serve in public life.” You can watch here.
 
Republican Congress Getting Results for Tennesseans:
	•	Last week, the United States Senate passed “landmark” opioid legislation I sponsored that is now headed to President Trump’s desk to become law. This legislation will create an environment where states like Tennessee can fight back against our nation’s most deadly public health epidemic, which took more lives in our state last year than car accidents.
	•	The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee I’m a member of approved legislation I sponsored, called the Restore Our Parks Act, that will cut in half the maintenance backlog in the 417 National Park Service sites -- from the National Mall in Washington to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to the Grand Canyon to Yosemite -- so future generations can enjoy the outdoors.
Important news from this past week:
	•	The Senate passed and the president signed into law legislation that included my proposal to ban cell phone calls on commercial airplanes. Imagine nearly two million passengers, hurtling through space yapping their innermost thoughts while you travel restrained by your seat belt and unable to escape. Keeping phone conversations off commercial flights may not be enshrined in the Constitution, but surely it is enshrined in common sense.
 
Bill to help Tennesseans fight the opioid crisis is headed to the president’s desk 
Last week, the Senate passed legislation I sponsored that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called “landmark” opioid legislation, and the bill is now headed to President Trump’s desk to be signed into law. Last year, more Tennesseans died from opioid overdoses than were killed in car crashes. The opioid crisis is ravaging our Tennessee communities, and Congress has taken a big step to help Tennessee fight back. Here are 5 ways this bill will help Tennesseans: It will help reduce the influx of deadly illegal drugs at the border, like fentanyl; extend support for Medicaid patients seeking treatment for substance use disorders from 15 to 30 days; help increase services for babies born in opioid withdrawal; and help our state reach out and intervene early in the lives of Tennessee children who have experienced trauma. This bill will also spur the development of a non-addictive pain killer. There are 100 million Americans living with some pain, and there are 25 million who really hurt because they have chronic pain -- they need help, and we need more effective medicines and treatments for pain. A non-addictive painkiller could really be the ‘Holy Grail’ of solving the opioid crisis.
Congress is also backing up important policies like these with federal dollars -- $8.5 billion has been appropriated for fighting the opioid crisis since March.
I look forward to President Trump signing this important legislation into law so we can create an environment so that everyone -- governors, mayors, justices, counselors, law enforcement, doctors, nurses and families -- can succeed in fighting the crisis.

Legislation to help fix backlog in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is one step closer to becoming law 
Last week, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee I am a member of approved the Restore Our Parks Act -- legislation I’m sponsoring that could cut in half the nearly $12 billion deferred maintenance backlog in our national parks over the next five years. This legislation could do more to restore national parks than anything that has happened in the last half century, and the reason we need to restore them is so Americans can enjoy the 417 sites -- from the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to the Grand Canyon to Yosemite -- for generations to come. The bill will cut in half the nearly $12 billion deferred maintenance backlog in our parks and prevent situations such as with the Look Rock Campground on Chilhowee Mountain in the Smokies, which once served 5,000 families a year, but has been closed for repairs for five years. The bill has the support of President Trump, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, and more than 100 groups. Approval of this bipartisan bill in Committee puts it one step closer to becoming law, and it is my hope that Congress is able to pass our proposal to help restore our parks this year.
Read more on why this legislation is so important to our state:

Senate committee passes bill to fully fund program that helps preserve Tennessee’s great outdoors
Also happening in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last week, we reported out a piece of legislation that would permanently reauthorize and fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which has provided Tennessee over $73 million for the state grant program; $92 million for federal land acquisition; and $33 million for the Forest Legacy program within the state. The Land and Water Conservation Fund has played a large role in protecting Tennessee’s outdoors for over 50 years. In 2015, funding from the Land and Water Conservation Fund helped complete efforts to conserve a nearly 10,000 acre tract of land, known as Rocky Fork, in the Cherokee National Forest in East Tennessee.

New Tennessee State Museum will help future generations grow up knowing what it means to be a Tennessean 
￼
I had the privilege of speaking at the opening of the new Tennessee State Museum in Nashville last Thursday. Forty years ago, I walked across Tennessee in my campaign for governor, 1022 miles from Maryville to Mountain City to Memphis. My walk took six months. Today, at the new Tennessee State Museum, you can walk across the state in 30 minutes and get to know the state pretty well. Our children need to learn American history and Tennessee history, so they can grow up knowing what it means to be an American and a Tennessean. Learning history helps to understand what is happening today and helps to navigate tomorrow. This magnificent new Tennessee State Museum is full of our stories. This museum will give Tennesseans a chance to take a walk through our state -- and I recommend it.
 
Keeping phone conversations off commercial flights may not be enshrined in the Constitution, but surely it is enshrined in common sense 
This past week, the Senate passed and the president signed into law legislation that includes my proposal to ban cell phone calls on commercial airplanes. This proposal directs the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations to prohibit cell phone calls during commercial flights. Stop and think about what we hear now in airport lobbies from those who wander around shouting personal details into their phones -- now imagine nearly two million passengers, hurtling through space yapping their innermost thoughts while you travel restrained by your seatbelt and unable to escape.

Congratulations to the six Tennessee Schools that were named National Blue Ribbon schools this year by the U.S. Department of Education. I am proud of the hard work our teachers put in every day to provide Tennessee students with a top-notch education.
 
Urging an end to tariffs on steel and aluminum 
The Trump Administration announced last week a new trilateral trade agreement -- the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Updating NAFTA makes sense, but I want to make sure that it also means the end of steel and aluminum tariffs among the United States, Canada and Mexico. This trade agreement is an opportunity to implement the President’s zero tariff goal. NAFTA’s zero tariff provisions have helped to nearly double the number of Tennessee auto jobs, which are one third of all our state’s manufacturing jobs. The cars and trucks Nissan makes in Tennessee and Mississippi are 70 percent steel. The price of steel is up 40 percent since January because of tariffs. It doesn’t take a math major to figure out what will happen to sales, revenues, profits and wages if we keep piling tariffs on top of tariffs.

Poll: E15
Hoosiers,

Yesterday, President Trump announced that he will be directing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to allow the year-round sale of E-15 (gasoline mixed with up to 15% ethanol). For too long, unnecessary federal restrictions hindered access to this clean and affordable fuel. Allowing the year-round sale will reduce our dependence on foreign oil, lower costs for families at the gas pump, help grow demand for Hoosier corn farmers, and support the economy of rural America.

Question of the Week: Given this announcement, do you support President Trump's efforts to ensure America's energy independence and reduce our reliance on foreign oil?

[_] Yes.
[_] No.
[_] I don't know.
[_] Other (share your thoughts).

￼ 
BREAKING NEWS: EAA SOUTHERN STORAGE RESERVOIR AUTHORIZED
Lindsey - 
Thanks to everybody who fought this fight with us: the EAA Southern Storage Reservoir has been authorized by Congress. 
The House has voted to pass this bill, the Water Resources Development Act, twice. And just now, the Senate voted 99 to 1 to send it to the President's desk to become law. It was a landslide! 
There are 9 sections I wrote in this bill, including authorizing the EAA Southern Storage Reservoir and redoing the regulation schedule (LORS) that determines when discharges happen. You can read all about it here. 
After years of hard work, passing this bill will help us send the water south and cut discharges! Now, our fight continues for funding and changing the Army Corps' priorities to account for public health and safety. 
Our fight is not over, but today is a momentous move in the right direction. Thank you!

Tax Reform 2.0 Passes The House
New hope and new optimism!
House Republicans decided to bet on the American people when we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  - letting families keep more of their hard-earned paychecks and helping small business owners invest in their workers and their company. The results have been incredible -- more jobs, bigger paychecks and historic Main Street optimism -- and we want to keep that momentum going.

Recently, the House passed Tax Reform 2.0 - three pieces of legislation meant to build on the results of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Each bill focuses on a specific way to further help our working families and small business owners, and you can learn more about each one below. 
￼
LEARN MORE
PROTECTING FAMILY AND 
SMALL BUSINESS TAX CUTS ACT
This first bill will lock in the individual and small business tax cuts, helping families and small businesses thrive. The Tax Foundation has estimated that making these tax cuts permanent will create 1.5 million new jobs and increase GDP over 2%. 
READ MORE »
￼
LEARN MORE 
FAMILY SAVINGS ACT
This second bill will help more middle-class American families and younger workers save for key life events like retirement, education and unexpected emergencies by expanding access to new and existing savings vehicles. Helping our families save money ensures they are prepared for anything life throws their way.
READ MORE »
￼
LEARN MORE 
AMERICAN INNOVATION ACT
This third bill will help entrepreneurs move from the kitchen table to main street and beyond. With a renewed focus on innovation and entrepreneurship, it will help these risk takers create jobs, invest in their communities, and continue strengthening America’s economy.
READ MORE »
It's so exciting to be part of changing the culture in Washington. Never again will we wait 30 years to fix our tax code. American companies have to think of new ways to stay competitive every day, and it's time that Congress does everything we can to foster an environment that helps our economy grow, puts working class families first, and allows our U.S. businesses to compete and win around the globe!

Dear Friend, 

It is a privilege to serve you in Congress.  

One of my highest priorities is to ensure that the economy is thriving and providing good jobs for you and your kids. In September, the U.S. unemployment rate sank to 3.7% -- the lowest since 1969 and on top of that wage growth has hit a 17 month high. Economists are predicting we will continue to see record low unemployment continue in the months to come. As our economy continues to boom and businesses thrive due to deregulation, it’s the American worker who will get to reap the reward. You can read more about it here. 

Over the past 21 months, I have made over 400 official visits throughout the 7th District to meet with the people of Central Virginia. 

I enjoyed talking to the students of Massaponax High School in Spotsylvania about economics and much more. The next generation has an important role to play in the future of our country, and it is important to encourage our students to be active in their communities and government. As a former educator I know how crucial it is for our students to have the opportunity to ask questions which is why as your representative, I make time to visit schools throughout the 7th District. 

￼

I had a great time at the Virginia Cooperative Council meeting and hearing from farmers about how we can better support them.

          ￼    ￼

                                                 ￼

We owe so much to our EMS personnel. The work they do everyday to save lives at the risk of their own deserves our praise and gratitude. It was my privilege to thank the Chesterfield Fire and EMS officials last night at their Annual Awards Ceremony.

                             ￼      ￼
  
                                                
    ￼

Recognizing History in the 7th District
Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Orange County, VA should take pride in its rich, meaningful history. From its inspiring beginnings to becoming a pillar in its community, it is an honor to recognize this special church community and give it the acknowledgement it is due. You can read my press release on Mt. Zion Church by clicking here. 
                                 
           ￼    ￼
            
Protecting Furry Friends 
I am proud to be a co-sponsor of H. Res 776 which would recognize the first Saturday of October as National Animal Rescue Day. Already, our nation’s animal shelters secure forever homes for over 3.2 million animals every year, but there are still more than 1 million animals who end up being euthanized. There are more furry friends out there that need permanent, loving homes, and a national campaign will help.

￼

10/10/18 12:15,Rounds Report: President Announces Plan to Allow Year-Round Sales of E-15," 
 
￼
 
     
 

Rounds Report: President Announces Plan to Allow Year-Round Sales of E-15  October 10, 2018
Yesterday, President Trump announced that gasoline mixed with 15 percent ethanol—E-15—will be sold year-round. Previously, sales of E-15 were banned in most states annually between June 1 and September 15, which includes the country’s busiest driving months.
Allowing year-round sales of E-15 will not only increase markets for South Dakota producers, it will increase consumer choice at the pump. South Dakota is a leading state in corn ethanol production. As the market for ethanol increases, the market for corn will grow, resulting in more jobs and increased revenue for South Dakota’s corn farmers. At a time when farmers are already struggling due to a decrease in farm income and trade uncertainty, providing year-round sales of E-15 is an opportunity to give our farmers a much-needed boost.
 As a strong supporter of corn ethanol, I welcome yesterday’s announcement.

￼ 
EAA SOUTHERN STORAGE RESERVOIR VOTE TODAY!
Lindsey - 
Great news: last night the Water Resources Development Act cleared the last procedural hurdle. That means the final vote on the EAA Southern Storage Reservoir is today at 11:30 a.m. 
Fixing our water issues is without a doubt the most important priority for our community. We know people are getting sick, animals are dying and the environment is being absolutely demolished. 
That's why writing this bill has been my top priority. Working together, our community has fought hard for sections that I got inserted into the bill like the southern storage reservoir and a re-write of the Lake Okeechobee Regulation Schedule (LORS) that determines when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is authorized to discharge water. 
The U.S. House of Representatives passed our bill twice with broad bipartisan support, but the Senate has been dragging their feet for months. That's why I recently implored Mitch McConnell to act, telling him our community is literally dying while he refused to bring the bill up for a vote. 
Today, we finally get that vote. You can watch it live with me at approximately 11:30 a.m. on my Facebook page. Its been a long road fighting together for this bill, so all I've got left to say is: let's send the water south!! 
WATCH LIVE HERE AT 11:30 AM

Dear Friends, 
Last week, we cemented a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court for decades to come. I am glad the Senate ultimately confirmed Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, despite the divisive political tactics from Senate Democrats. Tactics which betrayed a woman's trust by forcing her into the political spotlight against her will in an attempt to destroy the reputation and character of a qualified defender of our constitution. I am deeply disappointed with the political nature of this process and pray we can come together again as a country.

United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) 
President Trump announced he has successfully renegotiated NAFTA, creating the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). I quickly applauded the Trump administration for bringing our close ally Canada into the fold to reach a trilateral agreement that expands market access for our exporters to further grow our economy. There is no doubt that we need improved trade agreements for the 21st century to promote the best interests of America’s small businesses, farmers, and workers. Now, this agreement goes to Congress to approve and ratify. I look forward to reviewing the agreement in full so we can ensure robust trade for Texas and the country.

Public Safety Officer of the Month 
I was honored to be recognized by Tomball Police Chief Billy Tidwell as the 'Public Safety Officer of the Month.' I look forward to continuing our work together in keeping our local communities safe, especially on the issue of human trafficking. Earlier this year, President Trump signed by Blue Campaign Authorization Act into law. This legislation will better equip the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to partner, educate, and coordinate efforts and intelligence sharing on multiple levels. It will provide resources to help deter, detect, and mitigate instances of human trafficking in our country. It will also safeguard victims and help raise public awareness of the threat human trafficking poses to our communities.

My Bill to Counter Illicit Travel to the U.S. 
Last week, I introduced H.R. 6997, the Repatriation Assistance Act. This legislation gives the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) the authority to provide financial support to foreign governments so they can return individuals who pose a national security threat to the United States. 
Known or Suspected Terrorists, wanted criminals, and other bad actors are exploiting illicit pathways throughout our hemisphere and racing towards our border. These individuals pose a serious threat to our national security and to the security of the countries they travel through. By empowering DHS with this authority, our foreign partners will be able to better identify, detain, and transport these dangerous individuals back to their country of origin. This legislation will extend our borders and increase our homeland security by addressing the threats well before they reach U.S. soil.
You can click here to learn more about this legislation. 
Updated Terror Threats 
The United States and our allies have courageously fought terrorists on the battlefield and dismantled ISIS’ self-declared caliphate. Yet the terror group’s enduring ability to inspire, recruit, radicalize, and plot online still remains a very real threat. Ultimately, victory requires a long-term, sustained commitment to countering its ‘viral’ capabilities, while also taking the fight to them wherever they are.
I released a follow-up report on virtual terror efforts entitled, Terror Gone Viral 2.0, to capture the scope of ISIS’ activities by providing a high-level examination of ISIS-linked plots and attacks targeting Western countries, including the United States.

Friends, 
As you may know, yesterday afternoon Governor Ivey issued a State of Emergency in preparation for Hurricane Michael. The declaration was issued in anticipation of the damage Hurricane Michael could potentially cause in our state. Please be safe and heed warnings. Follow Alabama Emergency Management Agency for timely updates.   JUSTICE KAVANAUGH CONFIRMED 
Brett Kavanaugh is a conservative, experienced jurist who I believe will be a strict constitutionalist on the Supreme Court. I am pleased that the United States Senate voted to confirm him this weekend, and I am confident he will serve the Court and the American people admirably. 
You can watch his confirmation ceremony here.  
COVINGTON REGION HONOR FLIGHT VISITS DC 
￼ 
The Covington Region Honor Flight was in Washington on Friday! This amazing program provides free trips to Washington, D.C., for veterans to visit sites like the World War II Memorial, Arlington National Cemetery, and the Korean and Vietnam Memorials. My staff had a great meal with the group Friday night. I hope they had a memorable and enjoyable trip!     UNEMPLOYMENT HITS NEW LOW 
￼ 
According to the September jobs report released last week, unemployment hit its lowest point in nearly 50 years — yet another sign that our pro-growth policies are helping American workers and our economy.   You can read more here.     OCTOBER IS BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH 
￼ 
October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Did you know that about 1 in 8 women in America will develop invasive breast cancer? During my time in Congress, we have taken action to help survivors and recognize those who are still bravely fighting this terrible disease. I am continually inspired by the many personal stories I have heard from the people I represent. I hope that we will spend this month refocusing our commitment to work towards a cure.   FIGHTING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC 
While the news of the day and partisan bickering often distract from the issue, it is important that we remember our nation is in the midst of an urgent public health epidemic that is ravaging virtually every community in this country. Hundreds of thousands of lives have been cut short by opioid addiction and abuse in recent years. Last year alone, more than 72,000 Americans lost their lives due to complications from drug overdose. Of those fatalities, nearly 50,000 were related to opioids.   In Congress, we have made great strides towards addressing this tragic epidemic that is gripping the State of Alabama and the entire country, and we recently made even more progress by passing H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. This bill authorizes critical funding to assist states in combatting the opioid crisis, expand patient access to addiction treatment, and improve the detection of importation of illegal drugs, including fentanyl. H.R. 6 has passed both the House and Senate and now awaits President Trump’s signature. I am eager to see it become law.   In order to fight this battle with the aggression it requires, we must be unified and coordinated in our efforts. Action must be taken by leadership in local communities, in state governments, and in the federal government. I am glad that in Congress, this fight has garnered the widespread support it deserves. American lives depend on all of us, and our work is far from being complete. I’m eager to see President Trump sign H.R. 6 into law, and I will continue to support efforts to combat the opioid epidemic on behalf of Alabama’s Second District.   You can read my weekly column about this legislation here.   
You can stay up to date on my work in Congress by following me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.          It is an honor to serve you in Congress. Please never hesitate to let me know if there is a way my office can be of assistance.   Sincerely,

MILITARY & VETERANS UPDATE - September 2018
￼
Meeting with Lieutenant General Jack Weinstein.
TOP STORY
On Wednesday, September 26th, I met with Lieutenant General Jack Weinstein, the Air Force’s senior officer for strategic deterrence and nuclear integration—including the Minuteman III missiles currently dispersed across Montana, and the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent that will replace them in the mid-2020s. We also had a chance to discuss the new MH-139 helicopter that will replace the Vietnam-era UH-1N Huey. As a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I was pleased to see these, and other key Montana priorities included in the DoD Appropriations Bill signed into law by President Trump on September 28th.  SUPPORTING THE MILITARY, VETERANS, AND THEIR FAMILIES  n Labor Day, September 3rd, Colonel Karen Lloyd, USA (ret.), Director of the Veterans History Project attended the Crow Fair’s 100th celebration at Crow Agency to meet with Native American veterans and listen to their stories. Over the past four years, I’ve worked with Colonel Lloyd to preserve and make available personal interviews of Montana’s veterans in the Library of Congress. As Colonel Lloyd aptly notes, Native Americans are one of the few groups in American who welcomed Vietnam Veterans home with dignity and respect; and yet are underrepresented in the Library’s collection. I was pleased to invite Colonel Lloyd for this important endeavor.
￼
Assembling care packages for spouses of deployed service members.
On Wednesday, September 5th, I was honored to join representatives from the United Service Organizations (USO) on Capitol Hill to assemble care packages for the spouses of deployed service members. In May, the USO kicked off The Salute to Military Spouses, a six-month spotlight on military spouse contributions and challenges. Thank you spouses for your service to our country!
On Wednesday, September 12th, I had the pleasure of meeting with Tom Johnson, Commander of VFW Post 10010 in East Helena and newly appointed Legislative Representative for the Montana Veterans of Foreign Wars. We discussed ongoing challenges across the VA Healthcare System and upcoming changes under the MISSION Act.  We Will Never Forget
￼
Meeting first responders at the 9/11 Memorial at City College in Billings.
Earlier this month, our nation paused to remember the thousands of American lives lost and the courageous response by thousands more to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. I was honored to join first responders, veterans, students, and families at the 9/11 Memorial at City College in Billings on the 17th anniversary of that fateful Tuesday morning.

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend,  Governor Scott has declared a state of emergency for 35 counties in Florida, most of which are in the Second Congressional District, as Hurricane Michael moves towards the Panhandle. At this time, we are urging all those who reside in evacuation zones to leave immediately. This is the strongest storm the Gulf Coast has experienced in decades and could be catastrophic for the area.  The National Weather Service (NWS) suggests taking the following steps before the storm:  1. Prepare a hurricane emergency kit with water, food, flashlights, batteries, a first aid kit, and more.  2. Create and review your family emergency plan – where you will go in the event of an emergency, how you will stay in contact with each other, and more. 3. Stay up to date on the weather and understand the meanings of the National Weather Service’s watches and warnings.   The NWS has published this Hurricane preparedness guide that you may wish to review. For updated information on Hurricane Michael and how to prepare, please visit the websites below:  National Weather Service: www.weather.gov  National Hurricane Center: http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/  Ready.gov: http://www.ready.gov/  Federal Emergency Management Agency: http://www.fema.gov/   Florida Division of Emergency Management: http://www.floridadisaster.org  Florida County Emergency Management: http://floridadisaster.org/counties   Thank you for your attention to this important matter. Please be safe and be prepared.     Sincerely, ￼  Neal Dunn Member of Congress

 Job Surge
Dear Friends,

From record-low levels of unemployment to rising wages to record highs in consumer confidence, this Republican-led Congress has put in place legislative efforts that are producing real, positive results. In just two years of working in tandem with President Trump, we have helped create almost four million new jobs nationwide – bringing hope and opportunity to the State of Georgia.

With lower taxes and fewer burdensome regulations, we are putting the American people first, while spurring new business innovation and economic growth. On Friday, I joined more than a thousand people and the economic development offices of Newton, Greene, Jasper, Morgan, and Walton counties for the second annual Regional Job Fair in Covington. The sheer number of people who participated and the way that our community came together simply blew me away. With more than 60 employers present, I’m proud to see that Georgia is brimming with job openings, and this event is just another example of the growth and prosperity sweeping our Nation. To read more about the job fair, check out this great article from the Covington News. You can also watch my Facebook Live video from the event here.

Trading Places
It’s good news like the announcement of last week’s United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that has already sent our economy skyrocketing and will continue to inspire confidence in the future. I applaud President Trump and Trade Representative Ambassador Lighthizer on reaching a new trilateral trade agreement with our closest trading partners. My staff and I will continue to review the details of the agreement to make certain it benefits industries vital to Georgia’s economy, such as agriculture and manufacturing. The role of Congress in ratifying trade deals is one that I take very seriously, and I will be examining this package very carefully to ensure that 10th District priorities are reflected in it.
 
Applications Due Tomorrow
Attending a United States Service Academy is a life-changing opportunity for young people in the 10th District and across the country, and I’m honored to nominate exceptional candidates from our community each year. The men and women who attend these schools go on to serve our Nation as future military leaders. For students seeking a nomination to one of our service academies, my office’s deadline is tomorrow! 

As part of the application, my office will need a current photograph, academic transcript, standardized test results, candidate fitness assessment, and three recommendation forms submitted electronically to GA10Noms@mail.house.gov by tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. 

I am excited to start reviewing the submissions of this next generation of young leaders. Their call to service is inspiring and commendable. If you have any questions or concerns, I encourage you to reach out to my Academy Director, Carolyn Dallas, at Carolyn.Dallas@mail.house.gov.

Weather Alert: Hurricane Michael
With severe weather on the horizon, Governor Nathan Deal has declared a state of emergency for much of Georgia, including Baldwin, Glascock, Hancock, Jefferson, Johnson, Warren, and Washington counties. 
Because potential power outages, flooding, and wind damage are expected soon, don’t wait a moment longer to prepare. Here are five basic hurricane preparedness tips from ready.gov:
	1.	Know where to go. If you are ordered to evacuate, know the local hurricane evacuation route(s) to take and have a plan for where you can stay. Contact your local emergency management agency for more information. 
	2.	Put together a go-bag, including a flashlight, batteries, cash, first aid supplies, medications, non-perishable food items, water, and copies of your critical information if needed. 
	3.	If you are not in an area that is advised to evacuate and you decide to stay in your home, plan for adequate supplies in case you lose electricity and water for several days and are not able to leave due to flooding or blocked roads.
	4.	Make a family emergency communication plan and monitor local radio and TV stations for updated emergency information. 
	5.	Many communities have text or email alerting systems for emergency notifications. To find out what alerts are available in your area, download the FEMA mobile app. 

By taking commonsense steps to prepare for severe weather, we can help ensure the safety of our families and ourselves during emergency situations. Please keep our fellow Georgians – and our neighbors in Florida and Alabama – in your thoughts and prayers. As always, my team and I are here to help. Please do not hesitate to call one of my offices if we can be of assistance:

Supreme Court News
On Saturday, the Senate advanced Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the next Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. After one of the most exhaustive background checks and politically contentious confirmation hearings in memory, I applaud my colleagues for confirming a justice who has been proven to have the integrity, judicial temperament, and dedication to the law required to serve on our Nation’s highest court.

Throughout this process, Senate Democrats repeatedly moved goalposts in their efforts to delay and obstruct. Accusations of sexual misconduct are very serious, and the Senate did its due diligence in pausing proceedings in order to further investigate these claims. All victims of sexual assault deserve justice, compassion, and for their voices to be heard. At the same time, our system of justice – and society as a whole – are founded upon the idea that the accused are understood to be innocent until proven guilty, and there was simply no corroborating evidence to support the claims made against Judge Kavanaugh. Furthermore, the Article II ""Advice and Consent"" authority of the Senate was never meant to be weaponized for such raw partisan purposes. Abandoning either of these foundational principles would create an unprecedented crisis for our republic and for Americans of all political persuasions.

What should have been a professional, non-partisan approach to investigating serious claims became an embarrassing display of partisan vitriol by Senators determined to oppose any nominee of President Trump.

I’m glad the high court has gained a brilliant jurist and devoted defender of our Constitution — and our entire country is better off for it. Congratulations again to Justice Kavanaugh and his family on this well-deserved appointment. I am confident he will serve honorably, as exactly the kind of jurist our founders envisioned. 

The Week Ahead
In addition to meeting with folks at home, I look forward to attending the grand opening of Shire’s state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Social Circle this coming week.   As always, I’m honored to represent you in Congress, and my team and I are here to serve each and every one of you.

Hundreds line up for Regional Job Fair Rockdale Newton Citizen – 10/6 Over 1,200 citizens gathered at Georgia Piedmont Technical College on Friday for the 2018 Regional Job Fair co-hosted by U.S. Congressman Jody Hice (GA-10) and the Newton County Office of Economic Development. “Our goal is to connect local talent with businesses so that they can land jobs and continue to work towards individual and communal success,” said Hice. “Whether looking for a fresh start or just beginning a career, this is the place to be. I wholeheartedly believe that the 10th District is a special place, and I’m particularly proud of this community and the regional partnerships that have helped to ensure that the I-20 corridor is a great place to do business and a powerful force in Georgia.” But before opening the doors to the hundreds of job seekers lined up outside, Hice and Ronnie Johnston, Covington mayor wanted to give a “hats-off” to all the businesses and individuals involved.
Battlefield land grants program moves forward in U.S. House News-Reporter – 10/4 Congressman Jody Hice, a member of the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee, praised the committee’s passage of H.R. 6108, the Preserving America’s Battlefields Act. The bill reauthorizes the Battlefield Land Acquisition Grants Program, a successful dollar for-dollar grants program that protects the preservation of Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and Civil War battlefields.
4th local REACH cohort commits to excellence Union-Recorder – 10/2 Numerous elected officials and distinguished community members took turns at the podium congratulating this year’s REACH scholars while pledging their support to them moving forward. U.S. Congressman Jody Hice was not present but did send field representative Daniel Lentz, who revealed at the ceremony that the local scholars’ names had been entered into Congressional record, which was something Floyd Griffin admitted to being a little jealous of. “I’ve done a lot of things in my 74 years,” stated the retired Army colonel, state senator, and former mayor of Milledgeville, “and my name has never been entered into the books of Congress. Here you are in the eighth grade and today your name is entered into the ledgers of the United States House of Representatives. That’s amazing.”
Blunt introduces bipartisan legislation to preserve Missouri, U.S. battlefields Farmington Press – 10/4 The Preserving America’s Battlefields Acts would increase the authorization of the Battlefield Land Acquisition Grants Program to $20 million a year, including up to $2 million a year for the restoration and interpretation of high-priority battlefields sites, helping to transform these sites into historic tourism destinations. Companion legislation, H.R.6108, has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by U.S. Rep. Jody Hice (Ga.).

Thune Joins President Trump for Announcement on Approval of Year-Round E15 Fuel Sales
 
Sen. Thune, a longtime member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, joined President Trump at the White House for today’s announcement that the administration will initiate a rulemaking process to permit the year-round sale of E15 fuel (15 percent ethanol-blended fuel) in the United States, a win for consumer choice and energy security that Thune has sought for 11 years, including significant and ongoing engagement with the current administration.
 
“After spending more than a decade advocating for higher blends of ethanol, I want to thank President Trump for upholding his commitment to America’s farmers,” said Thune. “Using homegrown resources like ethanol to keep America’s economy moving forward is a common-sense, true win-win solution.""

On the Hill 
Johnson votes to confirm Kavanaugh to Supreme Court 
On Saturday, the Senate voted to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's nomination for the role of associate justice on the Supreme Court. Prior to casting his vote in support of the nomination, Senator Johnson said, ""The presumption of innocence is the backbone principle to America's system of justice. By all accounts, Judge Kavanaugh is a highly qualified jurist and has led an exemplary adult life as a husband, father and member of his church and community. The uncorroborated allegations against him as a youth - revealed only at the end of the confirmation process - do not overcome the presumption of innocence or detract from Judge Kavanaugh's lifetime of dedicated public service. That is why, having reviewed his lifetime of achievement - and having spent an additional five hours reviewing the supplemental FBI report - I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court."" 
Senate passes Johnson bills 
A key bill sponsored by Senator Johnson was included in the final Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill passed by the Senate this week. The Preventing Emerging Threats Act ensures the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice have the necessary authority to protect important buildings and sites when a security risk is posed by an unauthorized drone. ""By including the Preventing Emerging Threats Act in the FAA reauthorization bill, Congress has provided law enforcement authorization to counter the malign use of drones. This is a necessary first step in addressing the growing threat posed by drones in the hands of terrorists and criminals,"" Senator Johnson said after the bill passed.
In addition to the FAA package, the Senate also passed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act. Senator Johnson led the effort in the Senate to pass CISA, which would rename the Department of Homeland Security's National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and would streamline functions.
Medicaid maximization schemes 
Continuing his oversight to root out waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid, Senator Johnson sent a letterto Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma and a letterto Comptroller General Gene Dodaro of the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The letters seek information about state Medicaid funding schemes that may be costing federal taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars or more.
""At a time of rising federal deficits and increased federal Medicaid spending, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should closely scrutinize these schemes,"" Senator Johnson wrote to Administrator Verma.
Making Government Function 
The Senate continued to process executive branch nominations, including positions in the Consumer Protection Safety Commission. Senator Johnson also introduced a bill to amend the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 to improve the orderly transfer of executive power. The bill is currently in Senator Johnson's committee, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
Coming Up 
The Senate continues to work through executive branch nominations. Senators will also consider appropriations bills, the opioids package conference report, and a water infrastructure bill.

Dear Lindsey:
This past week, the Republican Party of President Trump hit a new low by confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. I have heard people from across our district and across the country expressing their outrage at this process and the current situation in Washington.
We will be hosting a town hall this month in Richmond where I will talk about what is happening in Washington, DC, and I will take your questions. Details are below. We hope to see you there!
Richmond Town Hall Tuesday, October 23, 2018 6:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. Lovonya DeJean Middle School Multipurpose Room 3400 Macdonald Avenue Richmond, CA 94805 Doors Open at 6:00 p.m.
Please RSVP by visiting https://desaulnier.house.gov/town-hall-rsvp, or contact my offices in Walnut Creek or Richmond for more information about the event.
MARK'S STATEMENT ON THE CONFIRMATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH
""This is a transformative moment in our history where women are speaking out and taking great risks to make their voices heard. While our Constitution and its subsequent amendments guarantee equality for women, we as a country have yet to fulfill that promise. Unfortunately, some people want to go back in time. They believe that an ""enlightened"" world of white males is what makes this country great.  Today, a black mark in our history was made by a President who forcefully elevated to the Supreme Court a man who was not properly investigated, committed perjury before the U.S. Senate, and has neither the moral character nor judicial temperament to be a judge in any court in the United States of America.  In times like these, things do not come easily - they come with a struggle, but we cannot let our voices be silenced. This is a country that should inspire merit irrespective of gender, ethnicity, or sexual preference. We must keep fighting for justice, equality, and a better America.""

MARK'S LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Aviation Safety Measures Signed into Law:
We are pleased to announce that four of our safety measures to help prevent runway accidents were signed into law on Friday as part of the bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for the next five years.  As a frequent flyer, I feel fortunate that our nation's air travel system is safe and the number of accidents have steadily declined in recent years. However, the recent rise in near-miss incidents across the country has given us reason to pause and evaluate if we are doing all we can to prevent accidents before a catastrophe occurs. Our safety provisions will address some of the challenges that contributed to high profile close calls and are a step in the right direction. Regardless, there is still more work to be done, and we are currently drafting legislation that will address remaining gaps in aviation safety. To learn more about our safety measures, click here.

Dear Lindsey, 
Supporting Those Struggling in the Opioid Crisis 
On Friday, I joined leaders in healthcare, education, nonprofits, and government to give remarks at the Dartmouth Opioid Collaborative Forum in Concord, where we discussed the impact of the opioid crisis on children and families and how to identify children who need help. In addition to passing legislation that provides support to children who are struggling, it’s so important to educate people about the signs of a child in need of assistance. I look forward to sharing the insights I heard at the Forum with my colleagues as we continue our work to combat this public health emergency. 
￼
Speaking at the Dartmouth Opioid Collaborative Forum on Friday 
On Wednesday, I joined my co-chair of the Bipartisan Heroin and Opioids Task Force, Congressman Tom MacArthur, in applauding the final passage of bipartisan, bicameral, and comprehensive opioid legislation by the Senate. Congressman MacArthur and I have spent this Congress developing policies and crafting an agenda to better serve our communities. Our measures bolster support for education and prevention, expand treatment and long-term recovery, as well as law enforcement and interdiction efforts. These were addressed in this compromise bill and will soon make communities in New Hampshire more resilient against the opioid crisis. Passage of this legislation shows that when Republicans and Democrats come together to tackle issues facing our constituents, real progress and solutions are made. 
Helping Veterans Get the Care They Need 
I introduced the Enhancing Veterans Experience with Telehealth Services Act (eVETS) last week to improve veteran access to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment via telemedicine. This introduction comes less than a week after the Department of Veterans Affairs reported an alarming surge in the suicide rate among veterans. In rural communities in New Hampshire, the nearest VA facility can be an hours’ drive away, deterring many from obtaining help. By rapidly expanding the VA’s offering of telehealth to these areas, I hope to address obstacles that have kept far too many veterans from receiving care. 
Standing up for New Hampshire's Small Businesses 
On Wednesday, I signed on as a cosponsor of H.R. 6824, the Online Sales Simplicity and Small Business Relief Act. This bipartisan legislation was introduced by Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner as a response to the Supreme Court ruling in June on Wayfair v. South Dakota, and it would provide relief to retailers with more limited revenue by exempting them from collecting sales tax for other states. It would also put a reasonable timeline in place for when larger businesses are responsible for collecting. I’m pleased my colleagues on both sides of the aisle put politics aside and introduced this much needed check on the scope of Wayfair v. South Dakota, and I will continue to advocate for small businesses by fighting unfair and unnecessary tax regulations. 
Hearing from You 
As always, please do not hesitate to reach out to my Washington, DC office at 202-225-5206 or my Concord office at 603-226-1002 with any questions, concerns or ideas you have. Thank you for everything you do to make our state such a great place to live. I hope you have a good rest of the week!

Dear Friend,  Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to read about some of last week’s highlights here in Texas.  POTUS Announces A New Trade Agreement With Mexico & Canada   Last week, President Trump announced that the U.S. reached an agreement on a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). I am currently reviewing the details and I hope this agreement will mean a renewed, long-lasting deal that benefits all Americans and creates an even stronger economy through free trade between our three nations. In Texas alone we have two million trade-related jobs with 380,000 of those jobs depending specifically on trade with Mexico. Trade is the backbone of our economy and it is crucial that America enters into beneficial trade agreements with other countries.  Supporting Local Small Businesses   It was great to visit with some Brazoria County small businesses at the Alvin-Manvel Chamber of Commerce Business Expo and Taste of the Town. Events like this give me firsthand knowledge of how DC actions impact small businesses. It helps me convey their concerns to my colleagues in Washington. Small businesses are the job creators that keep our economy strong, employing many of our friends and neighbors and providing important goods and services to our community.  ￼  Rep. Olson and local real estate agents    Hearing From Fort Bend County Superintendents  At a recent Fort Bend Chamber event, I received an important update on the state of our local schools directly from superintendents from some of our Fort Bend County school districts. It was helpful to hear about the excellence, growth and diversity of our county’s schools from Lamar CISD Superintendent Dr. Randle, Fort Bend ISD Superintendent Dr. Dupre and Stafford MSD Superintendent Dr. Bostick. While education is primarily a local issue, it’s important for me to understand if any federal issues are impeding local success. Working together, we can maintain local control of education issues and improve access to a quality education for our students. I appreciate the great work of our local educators and will continue working closely with them on behalf of our students. ￼  Stafford MSD Superintendent Dr. Robert Bostick discusses the growth of Stafford MSD   I’m honored to represent you in Congress.

10/9/18 17:37,September Highlights from the House,"￼

 
Welch Bill Cracking Down on Medicaid Fraud Advances   At the Vermont State House last month, Peter unveiled his bipartisan legislation to combat Medicaid fraud and abuse. The Committee on Energy and Commerce recently approved his bill, sending it to the full House of Representatives which is expected to pass it this fall. “Medicaid provides vital health care services to over a third of Vermonters, including low-income seniors,” Peter said. “This bipartisan initiative will empower state attorneys general to crack down on bad actors exploiting Vermonters, while ensuring Medicaid remains an efficient and effective program.”  Combatting the Opioid Epidemic      Last month, the House approved a bipartisan package of bills to combat the opioid epidemic ravaging communities in Vermont and across the country. Included were several bills authored by Peter that will increase funding for the Medicaid Health Homes program, attack the root causes of overprescribing in the Medicaid and Medicare programs, educate seniors on alternatives to opioids, and fund National Institutes of Health (NIH) research into non-addictive drugs for pain management. While supportive of the package, Peter decried the lack of a more comprehensive approach to combatting this public health epidemic. He has repeatedly called for a full-scale opioids Marshall Plan that would provide significant resources to those working on the front lines.  Another Round of Tax Cuts for the One Percent? Welch Says No   In remarks on the House floor during debate on a second package of tax cuts for well-off Americans, Peter expressed his strong opposition. “This has nothing to do with the so-called entrepreneurial economy. This has to do with a Congress that has no conscience, that doesn’t stand up for everyday people and say we want policies that let you have a chance.” 
￼ 

WATCH HERE
Nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court   After listening carefully to both Dr. Ford’s and Supreme Court nominee Judge Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Peter urged the President to withdraw the nomination. “Dr. Ford is courageous, credible, and authentic. I believe her. Judge Kavanaugh’s testimony revealed that he does not have the temperament or regard for the truth required to serve on the nation’s highest court. I do not believe him, and the Senate should not confirm him.”   Winooski Main Street Revitalization    Joined by Senators Leahy and Sanders, Peter announced a package of loans and grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development totaling over $8.5 million for upgrades to Winooski’s drinking water and wastewater systems. The infrastructure upgrades are a key element of the City’s plan to revitalize Main Street north of downtown. “We fight hard for these resources in Congress precisely so that cities and towns like Winooski can use them to realize their vision for what they want their community to be,” Peter said in a joint statement with Senator Leahy and Senator Sanders.  Welcoming New Americans   Peter participated in an inspiring naturalization ceremony at the Vermont State House for 40 new American citizens hailing from 23 countries. He spoke of the importance of immigrants to our country’s successes and rich cultural fabric. “America was built on the efforts of hard working immigrants who have made valuable contributions to our culture and economy throughout history.”

10/9/18 17:32,Preparing for Hurricane Michael,"￼

October 9, 2018 
 Dear Lindsey,  
Today, Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency for 92 counties in Georgia, including all 17 counties in Georgia’s First District, ahead of Hurricane Michael. Now is the time to ensure you, your family, and your friends and neighbors are prepared. 
To be better prepared for a storm, you should consider: 
	•	Updating your disaster kit. Make sure to have a three-day supply of non-perishable food and bottled water, a battery-operated radio, a flashlight, extra batteries, cash, medicines, a first aid kit, pet foods, and important family documents.
	•	Knowing your evacuation routes and prepare options for overnight lodging. Storm surge can sometimes cut off evacuation routes, so do not delay leaving if an evacuation is ordered for your area. If you encounter floodwaters, remember – turn around, don’t drown.
	•	Developing an emergency communication plan, which includes the telephone number of a family member or friend outside the area—a point of contact—in the event of separation when a storm hits.
	•	Downloading the FEMA mobile app for a customizable checklist of emergency supplies, maps of open shelters and recovery centers, disaster survival tips, and weather alerts from the National Weather Service. The app also enables users to receive push notifications reminding them to take important steps to prepare their homes and families for disasters.

10/9/18 17:31,Good News,"A message from US Senator Todd Young
￼ 


I proudly cast my vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday. Hoosiers care deeply about the Constitution and want justices who apply the law as written, not impose their own policy preferences. Judge Kavanaugh clerked for Justice Kennedy and was hired to teach at Harvard by Justice Kagan. As a D.C. Circuit Judge for the last 12 years, he has carried out his duties faithfully and consistently. Through his more than 300 opinions, 36 hours of testimony, and thousands of pages of documents, he has shown he is committed to preserving liberty. 
The accusations leveled against Judge Kavanaugh were serious and needed to be investigated. Judge Kavanaugh and his accuser were each afforded the opportunity to tell their stories to the American people. Following that, the FBI investigated the claims as requested. During this scrutiny, and six previous background investigations, none of the accusations were corroborated in any way.   Hoosiers expect results, and we have more work to do to ensure all Hoosiers can meaningfully participate in this growing economy. I’m hopeful we can now move beyond the heightened rhetoric and political gamesmanship we have seen over the last several weeks and resume working together in a bipartisan way to deliver results for the American people.

Spreading Some Joy: “We Need More Bettys in this World.” 
Great news from Betty Alexander in South Bend. Betty received thank you notes from both President Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump for her handmade quilt. I’m so glad I was able to help deliver it to the White House. Fox News reported on Betty’s story: “Indiana woman says she 'never gave up hope' that Trump would get American flag quilt” 
After being interviewed about her quilt for the South Bend Tribune, Betty's story caught the attention of Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana. Young's office was able to connect with Alexander, and the senator received the quilt on Sept. 13 for delivery to the White House.  ""Betty was just an absolute sweetheart,"" Young told Fox News on Wednesday. ""It was clear that she invested a lot of time in this. She took great pride in not just her craft, but also helping others.""  Young said efforts by himself and staff members show how public officials are still highly accessible to their constituents and are prepared to ""go above and beyond the call of duty.""  ""I think most of us appreciate that spreading some joy right now is a good thing for the country,"" Young told Fox News.""

Meeting with Top UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen 
Last week, I met with Lise Grande – the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen – to discuss the world’s worst humanitarian crisis and what steps must be taken to prevent millions of people from starving to death. Currently, more than eight million Yemenis are on the verge of starvation. Our humanitarian principles and our national security interests demand that we utilize all available leverage to eliminate obstacles to humanitarian relief and end the civil war.

 New Airmail Museum in Fort Wayne 
Last week’s vote to pass the FAA reauthorization will benefit Hoosiers, and the safety and security of air travel. Included in the bill was my bipartisan legislation to designate a national airmail museum in Fort Wayne. This is excellent news for Fort Wayne and I look forward to seeing this project move forward.  For more on the National Airmail Museum Act and how it will highlight Smith Field airport’s important role in history, click here.  Six Young-Led Opioid Bills Head to President 
The opioid crisis is one of the most urgent health emergencies we face today. Congress has taken steps to help curb this epidemic by appropriating billions of dollars, and now passing the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. This comprehensive legislation includes the six provisions that I helped introduced or co-led.   While this is a significant accomplishment, more work remains. I will continue working with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure we are doing everything possible to tackle this public health emergency.  Social Media Recap

One More Thing Before You Go...   
I am a proud cosponsor of the bipartisan resolution to designate October 2018 as `National Employee Ownership Month' which recently passed the Senate. Supporting our employee-owned Hoosier businesses is important for our communities and workers.

Thank you for the continued privilege to serve you in the U.S. Senate. My mission is to fight on behalf of Hoosiers and the interests that are unique to our state. I look forward to working with you, and sharing our progress, in the days ahead.

News from Representative Gary Palmer
￼
Dear Friend,  I hope October is off to a good start for you and that you are enjoying a bit of cooler weather and fall football. In the past few weeks there has been much to vote on and discuss. I’m glad for this chance to update you on the work my colleagues and I are doing in Washington. I will be in the district until mid-November meeting with mayors and other local officials, as well as visiting local businesses and attending fall festivals. I hope to see you. As usual, if my office can assist you in any way, please contact us.   Thanks for reading, Gary Palmer 

LEGISLATIVE NEWS
 
Tax Reform 2.0: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) has continued to benefit the American people since its passage in December 2017. Last week, the House took another step to lower tax burdens and enhance the economy, passing legislation to make permanent many of the changes and benefits of the TCJA. I have heard from many of you in the Sixth District about how the TCJA has increased your take-home pay, allowed you to save more for college expenses, and given you more flexibility with your monthly living expenses. I even heard from one husband that the increased take-home pay has allowed him to take his wife out to dinner. These new measures in this bill would bring more benefits like these to the American people. 
	•	H.R. 6760 – Protecting Small Business Tax Cuts Act: This bill would make permanent several TCJA tax benefits, including tax rate changes for individuals, limits on tax deductions and mortgage interest, and amounts that can be exempted from state and gift tax.
	•	H.R. 6757 – Family Savings Act: This legislation would increase the flexibility of families and young people’s ability to contribute to Universal Savings Accounts, Individual Retirement Accounts, and various educational savings plans. 
	•	H.R. 6756 – American Innovation Act: New businesses are currently able to deduct approximately $5,000 from their startup expenditures, but this bill would allow an increase in that deduction amount to as much as $20,000.
  
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN ASKING ABOUT 
Every week, my office receives hundreds of phone calls, emails, and letters from constituents like you. I always appreciate you taking the time to write to me about your concerns and issues of importance to you. I want to highlight two of the most popular subjects you’ve been contacting me about.
Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh: Brett Kavanaugh’s recent confirmation process to the Supreme Court and the allegations against him of sexual misconduct by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford have dominated the news cycle over the past few weeks. Amidst the many discussions on this topic, I will add that I do not personally know Justice Kavanaugh or Dr. Ford, so I cannot know for sure what may have happened 35 years ago. Only they can know that for sure. But I do know this – our justice system is based on the assumption of “innocent until proven guilty” and on the right to due process. If we lose sight of that, I fear for the future of our country and our ability to self-govern. I also fear for victims of assault if we continue to use their claims for political ends and do not let our justice system investigate them properly. I think it has become clear that Dr. Ford’s allegations are being weaponized without real concern for her personally, and if this becomes a pattern, legitimate cases will likely be ignored in the future and not given proper consideration. As a father of two daughters and a son, I feel strongly that women should be able to report incidents and that those accused are afforded Constitutionally guaranteed due process of law in order to prove their innocence or guilt in these cases. 
Fall Omnibus Bill: Ensuring that our military has the funding and predictability it needs to keep this country safe is a top priority for me, which is why I supported the House’s Defense appropriations bill earlier this summer. Notwithstanding, I could not vote for the recent $855 billion funding package that, while funding the military, fails to deliver on our promises and continue to send us down an unsustainable fiscal path.
Defense spending should be voted on separately, not held hostage for domestic spending. This is especially so when the bill ignores several measures that would have moved President Trump’s agenda through the appropriations process. Among many other problems, this omnibus bill does not fund the border wall, and it failed to enact pro-life reforms that were included in the House bill, such as blocking funding for Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. Indeed, several organizations, including the March for Life, wrote the President in opposition to the bill because “[The bill] includes no provisions to get taxpayers out of the abortion business.” 
I wholeheartedly support our military and have voted to fully fund our men and women in uniform, but our national debt is also a severe threat to our national security. Years of wasteful spending have driven the national debt above $21 trillion and we should be working to eliminate deficits. I remain committed to restoring the fiscal health of America while also not holding our military hostage.
  
IN THE DISTRICT 
 
Renaming and Dedication of Meadowbrook Post Office: It was an honor to be part of the dedication ceremony that officially renamed the Meadowbrook Post Office Station to the “Lance Corporal Thomas E. Rivers Jr. Post Office Building.” Lance Corporal Rivers was a Hoover native who was killed in action in Afghanistan on April 28, 2010. I was proud to have a small part in honoring and remembering him through this dedication.
￼ 
Mayors' Luncheon: I periodically host a lunch for the mayors from around the Sixth District to hear from them about the needs of their cities and towns. At our last meeting we had Kenneth Boswell, the director of the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, as our guest speaker. He made an excellent presentation on various programs that could benefit the mayors’ different cities, and we found it helpful and informative.

10/9/18 17:10,Principal of the Year,"￼
October 9, 2018
Dear Friend,
October is National Principal Month. A couple weeks ago, it was an honor to meet with and congratulate Aztec High School Principal Dr. Warman Hall, who was recently named the New Mexico Principal of the Year. We are all grateful for his leadership in bringing his school and community together to recover from a tragic shooting late last year. Aztec High has increased academic achievement, which is truly a credit to Dr. Hall.
￼
PHOTO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich meets with Aztec High School Principal Dr. Warman Hall and his wife, Anjee, to congratulate him for being named New Mexico's Principal of the Year, September 25, 2018.
When Dr. Hall visited my office in Washington, we talked about what he is doing to collaborate with principals around the nation. He and his wife, Anjee, a music teacher at McCoy Elementary School, are both great examples of how New Mexico's educators can inspire our kids and help the next generation of New Mexicans grow and thrive. 
I will never stop believing in the boundless potential of New Mexico's children. But we need to do so much more to support our educators and families. Investing in education is the key to unlocking our state's economic potential. Students and teachers across our state are counting on us to improve our education system from early childhood all the way through higher education and beyond.
In just the last month, I was proud to support a major education funding bill that increased federal investment in Title I grants that provide extra academic support to help students--particularly those in high-poverty K-12 public schools--meet college and career-ready state academic standards. I've introduced the Degrees Not Debt Act to give more low- and middle-income students the opportunity to attend college without taking on student loan debt. And I continue to call on legislators to invest a sustainable portion of our state's Permanent Fund in early childhood education.
I will continue fighting for our educators so they have all the resources, training, and support they need to help our students succeed. 
Sincerely,
￼

10/9/18 16:41,Prepare for Hurricane Michael,"￼

 Dear Friends,
We have learned time and again that preparedness saves lives. Hurricane Michael is picking up speed and strength as it approaches the Gulf Coast, and it has the potential to affect Georgians. I urge all Georgians to be vigilant, stay updated and heed the advice of state and local officials and please take advantage of this window of time and the many available resources to prepare. I will be working closely with Governor Deal, the Georgia Emergency Management Agency and the Federal Emergency Management Agency as the storm approaches landfall. As always, Senator Perdue and I will work together in the Senate and do all we can to support preparedness, response and recovery efforts.
Based on the latest forecast for Hurricane Michael, Governor Nathan Deal has issued an emergency declaration for 92 Georgia counties at the time of this writing. The emergency declaration is effective for seven days and makes all state resources available to local governments and entities within the impacted area of the hurricane. For the most up-to-date information from the governor’s office, please continue to check www.gov.georgia.gov. 
The 92 counties under emergency declaration are: Appling, Atkinson, Bacon, Baker, Baldwin, Ben Hill, Berrien, Bibb, Bleckley, Brantley, Brooks, Bryan, Bulloch, Burke, Calhoun, Camden, Candler, Charlton, Chatham, Chattahoochee, Clay, Clinch, Coffee, Colquitt, Cook, Crawford, Crisp, Decatur, Dodge, Dooly, Dougherty, Early, Echols, Effingham, Emanuel, Evans, Glascock, Glynn, Grady, Hancock, Houston, Irwin, Jeff Davis, Jefferson, Jenkins, Johnson, Jones, Lanier, Laurens, Lee, Liberty, Long, Lowndes, Macon, Marion, McIntosh, Miller, Mitchell, Montgomery, Muscogee, Peach, Pierce, Pulaski, Quitman, Randolph, Richmond, Schley, Screven, Seminole, Stewart, Sumter, Talbot, Tattnall, Taylor, Telfair, Terrell, Thomas, Tift, Toombs, Treutlen, Turner, Twiggs, Upson, Ware, Warren, Washington, Wayne, Webster, Wheeler, Wilcox, Wilkinson and Worth counties.
If you have not already done so, now is the time to prepare for tropical weather and plan where you will go if a watch/warning is issued in your community. Be familiar with evacuation routes, have a family communications plan, keep a battery-powered radio handy and have a plan for pets. Visit www.ready.gov or www.listo.gov to learn these and other preparedness tips for hurricanes and tropical storms.
Additional Georgia hurricane resources can be found at the links below:
	•	View up-to-date emergency declarations from Governor Deal here.
	•	View updates from Georgia Emergency Management & Homeland Security Agency here. 
	•	Download the Ready Georgia app for weather alerts and emergency preparedness tips. 
	•	Follow Georgia 511 for real-time traffic information. 
	•	Learn what to do before, during, and after a flood here.
	•	Report power outages by contacting your power provider. The two main providers in Georgia are:

Congressman Paul Cook, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, issued the following statement applauding the announcement that the U.S., Mexico, and Canada had reached agreement on a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA):

Chairman Cook: “I want to commend President Trump, President Peña Nieto, and Prime Minister Trudeau on successfully reaching an agreement to modernize and strengthen the North American trade relationship. The United States benefits when we place workers first, raise our standards of transparency, and level the playing field to enhance competition. In the days ahead, I look forward to reviewing the USMCA text and working with our friends in Mexico and Canada to continue building an even stronger North America.""

Vigilance key to hurricane safety
Dear friend –

With Hurricane Michael approaching the Florida Panhandle and its effects being felt along the Gulf Coast, NOW is the time to make preparations to protect your family and home from the storm. While Pinellas is not currently in the direct path of the storm, heavy rainfall is expected and there is potential for dangerous storm surge. Creating a plan in advance can reduce stress and help families make quicker and safer decisions – saving time when it counts. 

           ￼
            Rep. Crist helps residents load sandbags prior to Hurricane Irma.
Pinellas residents can click here to sign up for Alert Pinellas emergency notifications, and visit the Pinellas County Emergency Management website for updated information on evacuation orders, area shelters, and other local resources. You can also visit Ready.Gov for helpful resources to create your emergency checklist, update your evacuation plan, and review hurricane and flooding safety tips to avoid danger in the case of potentially hazardous storm effects from Hurricane Michael. The National Weather Service provides up-to-date weather alerts and advisories to help you stay aware of any potentially damaging winds, flooding, or storm surge.

Stay connected, stay informed, and stay safe. 

God bless,

10/9/18 15:46,Watch Live: Senate Vote on Southern Storage Reservoir,"News from Congressman Brian Mast
￼ 
BIG NEWS TO SEND THE WATER SOUTH
Lindsey - 
The Senate is voting tonight on the last procedural move before final passage of the Water Resources Development Act. 
This is the bill that's been my top priority since I got to Congress. I secured a spot as Vice Chairman of the Water Resources and Environment Committee specifically to work on this bill, and I wrote 9 sections that are now in the bill, including authorizing the EAA Southern Storage Reservoir and redoing the regulation schedule (LORS) that determines when discharges happen. 
It's really hard to overstate the importance of these votes this week for our efforts to send the water south! The House has already passed this bill twice, and it wasn't hyperbole when I told Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that our community was literally dying while the bill languished in the Senate. 
I'll stream the Senate vote tonight live on my Facebook page at approximately 5:30 p.m. so we can watch together. If the procedural vote passes tonight, the final bill could get a vote as early as tomorrow.

October 9, 2018
Hello everybody, 
Fall has arrived!  I love this time of year! The leaves are turning!  Football season is cooking!  The baseball playoffs are in full gear (maybe next year, Mariners!). And, the Kilmers are getting ready for pumpkin carving (and, admittedly, have already had our first pumpkin pie of the year).  
In addition to sports season, it’s also theater season, with all of the Kilmer women participating in The Secret Garden at CSTOCK. Tess was “Colin,” Sophie was a “dreamer girl,” and Jen played “Mrs. Winthrop.” I even got a chance to step on stage for a few minutes! Thanks to Palmer Scheutzow and the CSTOCK team for inviting me to make a cameo last weekend as Major Shelley. Believe it or not, I made it through all three of my lines (though I’m planning on sticking to my day job).
￼ 
It’s been a busy couple of weeks in DC with Congress passing some major pieces of legislation that will directly affect our region. 
Here are the highlights:
Getting things done for our region 
Congress recently passed a couple bills that include some of my top priorities and will directly affect folks in our region. 
For example, Congress just sent the president a bill to fund the Departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services and Education for the next fiscal year.  
Through my role on the Appropriations Committee, I helped secure funding for Navy facilities like the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, and $2 million towards new technologies that will reduce the amount of noise the Navy’s fighter jets make when they train in our region.  
The bill also included funding to help communities address the opioid crisis, and a whole lot more which you can read about here. 
I also secured an important provision in the recent Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act. This is the bill that funds maintenance at the nation’s airports and sets rules that govern everything from flight safety to how much leg room you have when you fly. 
My amendment requires the FAA to consider community emergency response needs when it decides how much funding an airport receives. In towns like Port Angeles and rural areas across the country, our airports are often the fastest way to get help during a natural disaster like an earthquake or a forest fire. But, if the FAA cuts the amount of funding our airports receive, it can mean shorter runways. And shorter runways mean larger planes that bring help in emergencies can’t land.
My amendment will protect our rural airports in communities like Port Angeles where our runways are the lifelines when the next natural disaster strikes. They also support local jobs which strengthens our region’s economy. I’m going to keep building on these efforts for our region. In fact, these past couple weeks I have introduced three different bills! 
Supporting Efforts to Teach Young People New Skills 
Some of the K-12 schools in our region are doing amazing work to prepare students for careers.  Career and technical education programs and pre-apprenticeship programs can open the doors of economic opportunity for kids. In fact, a few months back I learned about an inspiring partnership between Tacoma’s Stadium High School, local health care providers, higher education institutions and others to offer a new Health and Medical Academy. 
I recently introduced a bill to support similar efforts. The Compete for the Future Act of 2018 will create a prize competition for successful youth and pre-apprenticeship programs.  
This is about making sure young people all over our region and the country can learn skills to land great jobs. You can learn more about this bipartisan bill here. 
Looking Out for Our Veterans 
I believe if you serve your country, it should have your back. After a recent Government Accountability Office report found weaknesses in the way the Veterans Health Administration oversees more than 799 of it's outpatient clinics, I introduced bipartisan legislation that will help ensure facilities like the currently-under-construction Silverdale VA clinic live up to the standards our veterans deserve.  
Among other things, the bill requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to update the standards that every Community Based Outpatient Clinic (or CBOC) is supposed to meet for its operations. The bill also directs the VA to regularly develop and disseminate best practices on operating CBOCs so veterans get the best care possible. You can read more here. 
Protecting Puget Sound 
And finally, I’m giving you a sneak preview on something I’m announcing later this week.  
According to the Puget Sound Partnership, stormwater runoff is the largest source of pollution in the Sound. 
A new study from WSU came out last week that identified tiny bits of car tires that have washed into streams throughout the region as a prime suspect in the deaths of coho salmon as they swim upstream to spawn. 
I’m introducing a new bill that will lead to more green infrastructure projects (like permeable pavement and rain gardens) that mimic nature and slow down (and clean!) the flow of stormwater before it reaches the Sound. 
The problem is even worse during downpours. When it rains really hard, stormwater flows so quickly into our sewers and at such a high volume that it overwhelms sewage systems. That means, in addition to carrying everything from our roadways - brake dust, motor oil, wiper fluid, and tire pieces - stormwater can also carry human waste into the Sound. 
In addition to being really gross, this is really bad for the salmon, really bad for orcas, and really bad for the tens of thousands of jobs that are counting on a healthy Sound.  
I’ll have a lot more on this over the course of the next week or two. Stay tuned! 
Working For You 
That was a lot...But as always, the best part of this job is being able to travel across the region working for you.  
Thanking Those Who Served 
Over the weekend, I hosted a pinning ceremony to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War. This pinning ceremony is a small way for our community to do something the nation didn’t do 50 years ago - say thank you to those who served. It was an honor to pin 63 veterans and thank them for serving our nation.  
￼ 
Making New Connections 
I had a great time visiting recently with folks at the Islamic Center of Tacoma. I enjoyed the lively conversation, and was happy to give an exciting update: The Protecting Religiously Affiliated Institutions Act has been officially signed into law! Every American deserves to be able to gather and practice his or her faith, and the bipartisan effort to pass the bill is a good reminder that Democrats and Republicans can - and must - continue working together to find common ground. Thanks for hosting me!
￼ 
Kilmer At Your Company Derek with Your Delivery  
Many of you know I regularly host Kilmer at Your Company visits. Last week I visited a UPS distribution facility in Bremerton and then did a ride-a-long with one of their drivers.  It was cool hanging with my new friend Ron for what I’m going to call Derek With Your Delivery. 
We delivered packages to some really interesting businesses in Kitsap County including Grundens, which makes foul weather gear for professional fishermen; Kickee Pants, which makes some very stylish (and soft) baby clothes out of bamboo; and the Benik Corporation, which makes neoprene products like the sleeves and braces you see your favorite athletes wearing. 
￼ 
Supporting Our Fisheries 
Finally, last week, I participated in a roundtable in Ilwaco to discuss challenges facing our fisheries.  Part of the reason I serve on the Appropriations Committee is to advocate for some of the investments that are so vital to local jobs in the fishing industry - everything from the Pacific Coast Salmon Recovery Fund to Mitchell Act funding that supports hatchery production. It was valuable to hear from those whose livelihoods depend on catching fish or crab or on harvesting shellfish. Thanks to everyone for sharing!
￼ 
That’s all for now! I’m looking forward to seeing you throughout the region this October!  
As always, it’s an honor to represent you.
Derek

Congresswoman Beatty Holds Central Ohio-Mauritanian Listening Session 
U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) recently convened a meeting with members of Central Ohio’s growing Mauritanian community, nonprofits, national experts, and other local leaders to discuss the plight of area families facing the threat of violence, slavery, and death because of the Trump Administration’s latest immigration move.
Unfortunately, the White House has reversed course and terminated a deferral program that provided protection to nearly 70,000 Mauritanians who fled their homeland following a two-year war that broke out in 1989. These refugees are now a class of stateless Afro-Mauritanians that human rights groups and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) say are enslaved in their homeland by the lighter-skinned Arab Maghreb ruling class.
“I strongly oppose any attempt at tearing these families apart and sending parents, grandparents, and children back to a life of bondage or even worse,” Beatty said at the listening session. “Our community is vibrant and stronger because of them, and their plight is another example of why Congress must take immediate action to fix our broken immigration system.” 
During the roundtable discussion, Beatty heard individual stories and asked for input from those in attendance to identify next action steps. In addition, she highlighted her leadership in circulating a congressional letter urging Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to immediately halt ongoing deportations, pledged to hold a follow-up event and meet with affected Central Ohio families.
“Thank you for your commitment and hard work on behalf of Central Ohio Mauritanians.” Beatty continued, “Today, is an important first step in supporting these hardworking families who want little more than the opportunity to raise their children free from violence and persecution. I promise to continue working with all of you to help find a workable solution to this growing crisis.”  
More than 3,000 Mauritanians (the largest such community nationwide) live in Central Ohio, raising families, working and paying taxes, and contributing mightily to the entire area.

10/9/18 14:09,how tax reform is helping families in Eastern Washington,"
 
￼


Hello, 

Did you know that tax reform is providing real results for Eastern Washington? Our economy is booming and optimism is soaring. Here are a few ways the people and businesses in our community are benefiting from these pro-growth, pro-family policies: 
	1.	Take-home pay is increasing for families of all income levels. 
	2.	We doubled the standard deduction so more of what you earn is tax free.
	3.	We doubled the Child Tax Credit to help families with the cost of raising children.
	4.	Jobs are being created and unemployment is at the lowest rate in nearly a half century, including 12,000 new jobs right here in Eastern Washington.
	5.	Wages are rising -- the largest increase in a decade. Wages have increased in every Eastern Washington county between 3-9%.
	6.	My provisions in tax reform expanded ABLE accounts so people with disabilities can explore the workforce, find a job, and reach their full potential. 
	7.	We expanded 529 accounts to help parents save for education and provide more school choice.
	8.	Tuition waivers for graduate students are still tax free.
	9.	Because of tax reform, businesses are expanding parental and sick leave benefits to give parents more flexibility and time with their children.
Tax reform is working to improve people's lives in Eastern Washington, and it's growing middle-class bank accounts. Republicans are closing loopholes, lowering rates, and giving you more economic confidence and security. As a result of our pro-growth and pro-family policies, Eastern Washington is Better Off Now. 
Thanks, ￼ Cathy McMorris Rodgers Member of Congress
P.S. The average household in Washington's 5th District will see a tax cut of 13 percent and an increase in take-home pay of more than $17,000 over the next ten years. Click here to learn more.

10/9/18 13:42,What you need to know about REAL ID,"News from Representative Tom Emmer
￼

Dear Friend, 
As the leaves and the temperature continue to fall, I am enjoying my time in our beautiful state. I have had a great few weeks at home in Minnesota’s Sixth District, and I look forward to my upcoming travels around the district over the coming weeks.  
While I continue my travels throughout the district, and through conversations with my district staff, a recurring question was posed: Will I be able to travel with my Minnesota license? As the REAL ID change has been taking effect throughout the country, many Minnesotans have been left uncertain if their current license would be sufficient for domestic travel. 
What is REAL ID?  
The federal government was set to enforce the 2005 Real ID law in January of 2018. The 2005 Real ID Act was a law passed that modifies U.S. federal law as it relates to security, authentication, and procedure standards for state driver's licenses and identity documents, including various immigration issues pertaining to terrorism. Essentially, it changed the federal standards for state-issued driver's licenses and non-driver identification cards, leaving each state to work to become compliant with federal standards. 
Currently, Minnesota has an extension for REAL ID enforcement, allowing Federal agencies to accept driver's licenses and identification cards from Minnesota at Federal facilities, nuclear power plants and federally regulated commercial aircraft until March 1, 2019. 
For more information, read ""Ask A Trooper: Real ID what is it?” by clicking here. For information on what you need to apply for a REAL ID, click here.  
Can I apply for a REAL ID in Minnesota now?  
Minnesota began issuing REAL ID compliant state licenses this month, October 2018. Apply here!  
For information on what you need to apply for a REAL ID, click here. 
How much does this cost?  
If your current drivers license is not expired, you can pay $2 for a renewal up to 17 months before expiration, $4 for a renewal 18-29 months before expiration or $6 for a renewal more than 29 months before expiration. 
Is it mandatory to acquire a REAL ID compliant ID?  
The federal compliant REAL ID driver license or ID card is optional. If you have a valid U.S. passport or U.S. passport card, military ID, or other federally approved identification, you may use those as your form of identification to board a domestic flight or enter certain federal facilities.  
Will I be able to travel without a REAL ID?  
Minnesotans will be able to use their standard driver's license or identification cards for federal purposes until March 1, 2019. After that date, a REAL ID-compliant license or identification card or another acceptable form of identification will be required to board a domestic flight or enter a federal facility. If you do not wish to upgrade to the REAL ID, you may use an enhanced drivers license, a valid U.S. passport, and other acceptable forms of identification for commercial flights as listed on the TSA's website. 
For any questions on becoming REAL ID compliant, my office is always happy to assist you with finding the resources you need! Call my district office, or stop by for a visit.

￼
As you may have seen, President Trump reached a preliminary deal on a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement last week. I’m hopeful this is another step toward greater stability in trade.
For the last year, I have been pressing President Trump and U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer to finalize an agreement that works better for South Dakota agriculture – and finalize it quickly. We have met on several occasions to discuss the dire situation producers are in as a result of poorly negotiated trade deals and the changes needed.
I am pleased the pressure we put on this administration has resulted in a preliminary deal. I will be reviewing the details of this agreement closely, but I’m optimistic we are headed toward an agreement that treats South Dakota agricultural goods more fairly, expands market access, and sets unprecedented standards for science-based sanitary and phytosanitary measures. I will continue weighing in with the Trump administration as this process advances, but I’m hopeful we’re on the cusp of a better deal for American manufacturing and agriculture.
Let me know if you have any questions. I’m happy to help.

Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Spurs Growth in Good-Paying Jobs and Commerce Throughout the Northland 
￼  Like many communities throughout the Great Lakes region, the City of Duluth is seeing significant long-term economic benefits from the $300 million the federal government invests every year in the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI).  
Dear Friend,  
Cleaning up the environment helps grow our economy, create good-paying jobs and improve everyone’s quality of life. With that in mind, our ongoing battle to stop the President’s proposed cuts and fully fund the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) at $300 million a year got a big boost last week.   According to a new study by the University of Michigan, every federal dollar we invest to clean up Lake Superior, along with its tributaries and shorelines, will generate about $3.35 billion in economic activity for Duluth and the Arrowhead by 2036.   The study noted that many of those benefits are already evident throughout our region – increased tourism, rising home and property values, and fast-growing commercial development just to name a few. In Duluth for example, the proliferation of waterfront hotels has spurred a 4.4 percent increase in leisure and hospitality jobs over the past decade, along with a doubling of tourist tax revenue.   The study further pointed out that in the Duluth-Superior area alone, GLRI funding has helped pay for dredging 300,000 cubic yards of contaminated sediment, the cleanup and restoration of 257 acres of wildlife habitat, and the creation of 350 acres of new habitat along the once badly contaminated St. Louis River estuary and harbor. Across the Great Lakes, hundreds of similar GLRI projects are cleaning up decades-old pollution, restoring shorelines, wetlands and wildlife habitat and battling invasive species.   Clearly, if the President were really serious about creating more good paying jobs here in the Northland, he would be asking for more money to fund the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative – not asking Congress year after year to zero it out. Rest assured I will continue to help lead Great Lakes Democrats and Republicans alike to ensure that not one dime of GLRI funding is ever eliminated.  
We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email. 
Sincerely,  ￼ 

Abandoning Science, EPA Takes a Step Back into the Dark Ages 
￼  The Administration’s policy of making it more and more difficult for the EPA to do its job starts at the top - as our old friend, Pulitzer Prize winning Minneapolis Star Tribune cartoonist Steve Sack, pointed out in this 2017 gem featuring the President and former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. 
The New York Times is reporting that former coal lobbyist and now acting Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Adam Wheeler has decided to drag the EPA further back into the Dark Ages by eliminating the Office of the Science Advisor. 
Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta currently holds this senior post, created to advise the Administrator on the latest science and research supporting health and environmental regulations. She’s an expert on the risks of chemicals to human health, and has worked at the EPA since 1981, according to the agency’s website.   Of course, facts and science are the best weapons we have in the battle to protect our planet and its precious environment for generations to come. And medical research and science has helped double the life expectancy here in America over the past few generations. Those simple truths have proved inconvenient for the President and GOP leaders in Congress who are determined to roll back rules and regulations that have prevented their friends in the fossil fuel industry from recklessly degrading and destroying our air, land and water to make themselves even richer than they already are.  As the old saying goes, “Everybody’s entitled to their own opinions, but no one is entitled to their own facts.” Facts don’t go away simply because powerful people choose to ignore them – endangering human health and our environment in the process. We need to be expanding - not abandoning - science and the search for truth to benefit humankind.  

U.S. Should Be Supporting - Not Undermining - Ethanol and Biodiesel Production 
Nolan joins in urging House leaders to extend tax benefits for the industry 
￼  Ethanol adds about 63 cents to the value of every bushel of Minnesota corn and soybeans used to produce it. 
With farm income at a 12-year low, Minnesota ethanol – which adds 63 cents in value to every bushel of corn and soybeans used to make it – can be a lifesaver for hard-pressed farmers and Minnesota's farm and rural economy. In fact, ethanol production accounted for 28 percent of Minnesota’s entire corn crop last year – 415 million bushels. And, according to a recent study prepared for the Minnesota Biofuels Association, ethanol and other biofuels support some 18,100 good-paying, full time jobs across our state.  
That’s why I’ve joined numerous other colleagues in urging House leaders to ensure that the 2019 federal budget agreement contains a multi-year extension for tax incentives benefit farmers, truck drivers, and consumers within the ethanol and biodiesel production chain.   Across farm country, ethanol can be a powerful weapon to help offset economic retaliation by China and other trade cheater nations angry over US–imposed tariffs and taxes. But first, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) needs to implement and support strong renewable fuel standards (RFS) – not undermine them.   Under the current President, EPA has been helping the already incredibly profitable fossil fuel industry get even richer by granting “hardship” waivers to oil refineries, allowing them to reduce the amount of bio-fuels they are required to blend into gasoline. That needs to stop.   In fact, we should be expanding the sale of higher ethanol gasoline blends. That’s why I have joined many of my colleagues in cosponsoring the Consumer & Fuel Retailer Choice Act (H.R.1311) to allow for year-round sale of E-15 fuels.    Minnesota is leading the way in the use of E-85 fuels. According to the Minnesota Bio-Fuels Association, Minnesotans had used a record 29.9 million gallons by the end of May 2018 – a 57 percent increase in sales over the 19 million gallons sold during all of 2017.   The Minnesota Bio-Fuels Association provides some highlights illustrating ethanol’s remarkable contributions to our state. Ethanol:   • Makes up just under 13% of all the fuel used in Minnesota.   • Supports some 18,100 good paying, full time jobs in agriculture, manufacturing      and energy.   • Contributes $2.17 billion to Minnesota’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) every year.  • Adds $1.5 billion to Minnesota’s annual household income.   • Pays $192 million in state and local taxes every year. 

Federal Judge Rules Lawsuit Against the President for Accepting Foreign Payments Can Proceed 
Nolan and 199 Other House Democrats accuse the President of violating the U.S. Constitution by doing business with foreign governments without Congress’s consent 
￼  A view of the lobby of the lavish hotel the President owns just a few blocks from the White House. Foreign governments have reportedly spent tens of thousands of dollars on rooms, food and entertainment at the facility, profiting the President financially without the consent of Congress, and in violation of the U.S. Constitution.   
In direct violation of the Constitution, the President has personally profited by accepting payments from foreign governments for rent, food, and entertainment at his lavish Washington, D.C. hotel – and these deals must stop. That’s the contention of the lawsuit I recently joined 199 other Members of Congress in filing in federal court – and last week, Federal judge Emmet Sullivan ruled that we have legal standing to sue, and our case can proceed.   By way of background, our lawsuit is based on the Constitution’s emoluments clause, which prohibits presidents from taking payments or gifts from foreign governments without the consent of Congress. This is the first time the Clause has been tested in court in more than 200 years.    “The Clause requires the President to ask Congress before accepting a prohibited foreign emolument,” Judge Sullivan wrote, noting that if our allegations are true, “the President is accepting prohibited foreign emoluments (payments) without asking and without receiving a favorable reply from Congress.”

10/9/18 12:55,"News from the 10th: School Safety, LGBTQ Equality, Veterans Breakfast and More","News from Congressman Brad Schneider 
￼

￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ 
￼
￼
￼
￼

Dear Friends, 
I am excited to be working in here at home for the whole month of October, giving me a wonderful opportunity to visit with neighbors throughout the district.  Last week I visited several local schools from elementary to high school. I’m always impressed by the questions asked by our young people at these events, and the students at Big Hollow Elementary (Ingleside), North Chicago High (North Chicago), Prairie Elementary (Buffalo Grove), Viking Middle (Gurnee), and Murphy Elementary (Round Lake) were no exception. It was in the midst of these school visits that I learned Mundelein won a grant to improve school safety – including a program I introduced to allow schools to install panic buttons. I’ll continue working with all our area schools to ensure they have the resources needed to keep our students safe. 
￼ 
  
This week’s newsletter also has details about new legislation I introduced to address the deadly “Charleston Loophole” in our gun laws, and how I led more than 100 of my colleagues urging the Administration to reverse its discriminatory new visa policy targeting the partners of LGBTQ diplomats. 
Lastly, I’m excited to announce that a month from today on Friday, November 9, I am hosting a breakfast to honor all Tenth District veterans on the start of Veterans Day weekend. Find details below and please RSVP to attend! 
  
$260,000+ TO IMPROVE SCHOOL SAFETY IN MUNDELEIN 
Last week, I was thrilled to announce the award of $262,699 to the Village of Mundelein to improve the safety and security of local schools. 
The Mundelein Police Department will use the funds to create secure entry vestibules and install panic buttons with direct access to the dispatch center at both Mundelein High School (District 120) and the middle and elementary schools in District 75.  I was proud to introduce the bipartisan legislation with Rep. Mike Bost that created the panic button grant program, and am gratified to see these security measures already benefitting communities in our district. 
Learn more on our website. 
  
LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS “CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE” IN BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM 
  
￼ 
Did you know that hundreds of thousands of firearms are sold annually before the results of a federal background check – and that this is perfectly legal?  
That’s because gun dealers and other federal firearm licensees (FFLs) may automatically go forward (“default proceed”) with the sale of a firearm if an FBI background check is not completed after three business days. Equally troubling, the FBI has no way of knowing if the sale was made unless they eventually complete the background check and then contact the dealer.
I’ve long supported legislation introduced by my colleague, Rep. Clyburn, to permanently close this loophole, but unfortunately the NRA has stalled that effort. Last week, I introduced legislation because there are commonsense, incremental steps we can take today to ensure the default proceed sale process is safer and more transparent, such as requiring FFLs to first report to the FBI when they sell a firearm to someone whose background check was not completed, and directing the FBI to prioritize completion of those background checks.
“Default proceed” sales have a deadly history. Despite a previous arrest, Dylann Roof was sold the handgun he used to kill nine churchgoers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston under such a sale because the FBI could not acquire his relevant court records within three business days. 
We in Congress have the power to save lives, and I will continue urging my colleagues to find the courage to act. 
Learn more about this legislation on our website. 
  
SPEAKING OUT AGAINST DISCRIMINATORY LGBTQ VISA POLICY 
Last week, I led 119 Democratic Members of Congress urging the Trump Administration to reverse its recent decision to impose cruel and discriminatory visa requirements on the same-sex partners of LGBTQ diplomats.
Earlier this month, the State Department began implementing its policy to no longer issue diplomatic visas to the same-sex unmarried partners of foreign diplomats, and officials and employees of international organizations like the United Nations and World Bank. All current same-sex unmarried partners must now present proof of marriage by December 31 or risk potential deportation.
The Trump Administration’s new policy places a heartless burden on the service of LGBTQ diplomats and undercuts our American values of equality and acceptance. A mere 13 percent of UN member states have legalized same-sex marriage, and requiring diplomatic couples to marry could put individuals at risk in their home countries. I urge Secretary Pompeo to reconsider the ramifications of this policy and return to the previous visa system that respected the dignity of partners in same-sex relationships.
Learn more and read the full letter on our website. 
  
PLEASE JOIN US FOR OUR ANNUAL VETERANS BREAKFAST – Friday, November 9

Your September Recap 
From Rep. Rod Blum
President Trump promised our country he would do the tough thing politically and renegotiate our trade deals that were not favorable to us and he is delivering. With Canada and Mexico as Iowa's #1 and #2 trading partners*, this new trade agreement is good news for Iowa -- and for farmers, manufacturers, and agribusinesses throughout the country. I look forward to reviewing the specifics of this trade deal in the near future.

Eastern Iowa knows that I am a relentless advocate in making sure our interests are represented; the patience we have demonstrated will pay dividends for our industries and family farms as trade deals are made more favorable to our interests.

 In the District
A beautiful day to walk in the Alzheimer's Walk for a Cure in Cedar Rapids with my friend Richard Bice. 
￼
￼
Congratulations to Transamerica in Cedar Rapids for breaking ground on your new 61,000 sq ft addition. 3,000 of my constituents will benefit from new amenities and modernized workspaces through this investment. This economy is roaring! 
￼
￼
Love to see my office making a difference for constituents in the First District- Great job to Sonia in my Cedar Rapids office for seeing this case through to a successful end.
￼
￼
Sat down with doctors from Medical Associates of Dubuque to better understand how to fix the broken healthcare system. All agreed Obamacare was not the solution. I’m proud to support common sense improvements so we can take care of those in need while also lowering cost for all!
￼
￼
Questions on workforce from Dubuque Chamber of Commerce members. My solution centers on reforming welfare and immigration to meet the workforce needs of the many jobs in my district. Unemployment claims are at a 49 year low—great news, but need workers to sustain the MAGA economy! 
￼
￼
Congratulations to Iowa Heartland Habitat for Humanity in Cedar Rapids for uniting volunteers from places like Whirlpool and AmeriCorps to deliver quality housing for those in need. Exceptional work you are all undertaking.
￼
￼
                                            
 In Washington, D.C.
Great to meet with Star Rupe- the newly appointed CEO of Goodwill Northeast Iowa to discuss workforce development in Iowa & creating solutions to work towards sustainable and productive living for vulnerable populations like ex-convicts and those struggling with substance abuse.
￼
￼
I attended Ambassador Stanley Kao’s Letter of Intent Signing Ceremony between the 2018 Taiwan Agricultural Trade Goodwill Mission & U.S. Soybean Exporters to confirm the solid ag & trade relations between the 2 countries & renew the $1.56 billion purchase of U.S. Soybeans.
￼
￼
A great honor to be awarded the Tax Fighter Award for my voting record of supporting limits on taxes & in keeping with the principles, policies, and objectives of Ronald Reagan.
￼
￼
As we move forward towards reforms to expand health care options and make coverage more affordable, I am committed to ensuring those with pre-existing conditions are protected
￼
￼
Met with the Rock Island District of the USACE to thank them for funding for Cedar Rapids and discuss other projects along the Mississippi River important to northeast Iowans. 
￼
￼
Great to have Director of Eastern Iowa Airport, Marty Lenss as a witness for our House Small Business Committee hearing to discuss the impact of the aviation workforce shortage on small businesses. 
￼
￼
An honor to receive the Fueling Growth Award 2018 from Growth Energy. I am committed to supporting the biofuels industry!
￼
￼
As we work toward a solution to make healthcare more affordable and accessible for Americans, I am committed to protecting those with pre-existing conditions-- regardless of further amendments, or repeal of, the Affordable Care Act (ACA). 
￼
￼
Great to have my friend Iowa State Senator Mike Breitbach from Strawberry Point, IA in town!
￼
￼
Proud to introduce the bipartisan Clean Slate Act with Rep. Blunt- Rochester A common-sense reform: Those who served their prison sentence for a non-violent/sexual offense can have their records sealed, upon petition, so they may re-enter the workforce & become productive members of society.
￼

 Constituent Corner
Congressman Blum recently received a weekend call from a family scheduled to travel abroad for a reunion. Two of the son's passports were expired and the family didn’t realize this. Rep. Blum's staff worked throughout Sunday preparing their documents for when the passport office opened on Monday. Within 3 hours new passports were issued and the family was on its way. 
￼
From the people of the 1st Congressional District of Iowa, “Thank You for Your Service!” to Mr. Daryl Griffith who served in Korea.
￼
￼
A grateful nation thanks Mr. Robert Headley Jr (deceased) for his service in Vietnam. An honor to present Robert’s sister, Mary Jo, his service medals at my Dubuque office.
￼
￼
Last April, Kaleb Cook of Robins, IA was honored in Washington, D.C. for his outstanding community service by The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards. They are now beginning the search for more top youth volunteers in Iowa. Apply here! http://spirit.prudential.com


In the News
Incomes Rise Nationwide at 4.2% (Iowa at 5.1 %!) Annual Rate due to reduced regulations and tax cuts reigniting the economy AND wage increases.
￼
￼
Congrats to @northerniowa ranked #2 Midwest public school!
￼
￼
Last week Republicans voted to make tax cuts permanent for individuals
-Taxpayers with incomes under $50,000 will see their share of the total federal tax burden drop from 4.2% to 3.9%.
-Those with less than $10,000 in income will see their taxes slashed by more than half.
￼
￼
The benefits share of total compensation is at an all-time high of 31.7%. Cash bonuses unrelated to job performance reached a record high of 7.6% of total benefits in June. Tax reform has enabled hundreds of firms to offer bonuses, better benefits, and pay increases!
￼
￼
Consumer confidence index rose to 138.4 this month from 134.7 in August— its highest level in about 18 years! No doubt due to people keeping more of their hard earned money rather than giving it to DC bureaucrats to spend for them!
￼
￼
Americans spend almost TWICE as much on taxes than food and clothing combined. Government keeps growing - and taxes are never enough.
￼
￼
This is the opposite of draining the swamp.
￼
￼

Thank you for reading my September recap and have a blessed October!

Best, 
￼
Rod Blum

Tax Reform 2.0
 
 
Last year, Republicans in Congress worked with President Trump to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that implemented pro-growth and pro-family tax cuts for Mississippi families.

Since we've reformed our tax code we've seen millions of Americans receive bonuses, companies investing back in the United States, small businesses expanding, and unemployment decreasing. Since late 2017, the number of jobs in Mississippi has increased by the thousands and we've achieved our fourth lowest unemployment rate ever recorded - 4.8%! These numbers are great and are a result of the hard work that we've accomplished through tax reform. 

Republicans want to continue lowering taxes and build on the economic successes we've already seen. As a result of this success, House Republicans passed a bill to lock-in the recently passed tax cuts, Tax Reform 2.0. This bill is estimated to create millions of more jobs, boost wages, and increase GDP for the long haul by locking in the individual and small business tax cuts that were included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 

I was proud to support this legislation because I believe you should keep the money you earn, not give it to the government. 

Supreme Court 
I am extremely pleased with the Senate’s decision to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the United States Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh has an excellent record of defending our constitution and upholding our American laws. The Democrats put him through one of, if the not the most, grueling confirmation processes in our nation’s history. Not confirming Judge Kavanaugh would have been a huge loss and would have paved the way for further obstruction and destruction of this institution and our country by Senate Democrats. However, Judge Kavanaugh showed tremendous strength in the face of adversity and continued to prove his unyielding commitment to serving our country. 

Securing our Maritime Border
I had the opportunity to meet with the Commandant of the Coast Guard Admiral Karl L. Schultz and the Vice Commandant Charles Ray to discuss the importance of securing our maritime border through the use of ships such as National Security Cutters built at Ingalls as well as other necessary resources. I was glad to secure funding for the 12th National Security Cutter in the most recent House Appropriations Homeland Security bill.

Dear Friends,
Over the last few weeks we have made important progress in rebuilding our military, reforming our tax code, taking care of our veterans, and combatting the opioid epidemic.  Below you can find more information about some of the bills Congress has passed since this summer.
Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019
The President signed legislation to give our men and women in uniform the resources they need to defend our country, on time for the first time in a decade.  One or two bills cannot repair our military fully after years of neglect, but this bill will make a real difference. 
Highlights: 
	•	Continues to rebuild our military by boosting base funding, ensuring our armed services have the resources they need around the world, and provides funds for equipment procurement;
	•	Increases funding for readiness programs to make sure our warfighters are prepared for the missions we ask them to do;
	•	Updates our military for the future of warfare;
	•	Improves end strength by providing sufficient funds for our military personnel and pay;
	•	Includes funding for the Defense Health Program, which cares for our troops, military families, and retirees; and
	•	Makes steps toward reforming the Pentagon to ensure taxpayer dollars are well spent.
District Highlights: 
	•	Sheppard Air Force Base:  The bill appropriates funding for an increase in end strength of the Air Force and a 2.6% pay raise consistent with the FY19 NDAA.  It provides funding to address the readiness crisis including; increased flight hours, equipment upgrades, and depot maintenance.  It also provides funding for the care of our troops, military families, and retirees.    
	•	Bell:  Close to $2.4 billion is appropriated for Bell’s V-22 Osprey and helicopter programs, including the procurement of 13 new Ospreys and 25 new H-1 helicopters.
	•	Pantex: We also passed the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, which provides $44.46 billion for Fiscal Year 2019 (FY19) and provides funding for the Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Energy (DOE), and our nation’s nuclear weapons security programs.
	◦	Provides $11.1 billion for nuclear weapons activities, which supports operations at Pantex;
	◦	Includes $24 million for the Material Staging Facility at Pantex, which is the same amount authorized in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA); and
	◦	Gives the Army Corps of Engineers $7 billion for ports, waterways, and flood protection infrastructure.
VA Mission Act
The VA MISSION Act was signed into law in June.  This bill will help ensure that veterans have access to the care they need with an updated VA program and a process that is efficient and timely. These men and women have put their lives on the line for our freedom, and they deserve the best care when they return home.
Highlights:
	•	Combines the VA’s community care programs into one cohesive program;
	•	Updates or realigns VA medical facilities;
	•	Expands the VA’s post-9/11 Caregiver program to all eras; and
	•	Includes funding for the Choice Program and permits family caregivers to receive support.
Opioid Package
The House and Senate passed the final version of H.R. 6, the “SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act.”  This bill combats illicit and synthetic drugs crossing the borders, encourages the development of new non-addictive painkillers, improves prescription drug monitoring, and continues to fight the opioid crisis in our country.
H.R. 6 also includes provisions I authored that mirrors the ""Synthetic Abuse and Labeling of Toxic Substances (SALTS) Act,” which I introduced again earlier this year.  These provisions amend the Controlled Substance Act (CSA) to specify factors to be considered in determining whether a controlled substance was intended for human consumption.  Currently, synthetic drug producers, manufacturers, and sellers can easily skirt regulations by simply adding a “not for human consumption” label on their product.  Law enforcement and health officials are able to prosecute the sale of similar drugs and substances, but the law does not cover substances with that label.  These provisions close that loophole. 
I have held roundtables with local law enforcement, educators, and public health and medical officials in our area to discuss the problem and possible federal action.  This provision was a result of those meetings.
A big part of the problem is that young people and parents are not aware of the serious side effects of these poisons.  These drugs invoke dangerous behavior and cause irreparable damage to the health of those who ingest them. 
Tax Reform 2.0
Since tax reform was signed into law in December, we have seen jobs created, growth in our economy, and hardworking Americans keep more of the money they earn.  This September, the House passed three more tax reform bills that continue to take steps forward for our economy and our country. 
Highlights:
	•	Permanently extends tax reform provisions that currently expire in 2025, including:
	•	Allows individuals to deduct their medical expenses if they exceeded 7.5 (instead of 10 percent) percent of their adjusted gross income through 2020;
	•	Creates a new Universal Savings Account (USA) to offer a fully flexible savings tool that families can use at any time;
	•	Gives flexibility to also use education savings to pay for apprenticeship fees to learn a trade, cover the cost of homeschooling, and help pay off student debt;
	•	Allows families to access their retirement accounts on a penalty-free basis to use as they see fit when welcoming a new child into the family, whether by birth or adoption. And allows families to replenish those retirement accounts in the future;
	•	Makes the 20 percent deduction for pass-through business income permanent;
	•	Allows new businesses to write off more of their initial start-up cost;
	•	Allows start-ups to expand by bringing in new investors without triggering limits on their access to tax benefits like the R&D credit for activities conducted in their early years; and
	•	Helps local businesses provide retirement plans to their employees.
FAA Reauthorization

The House and Senate have both approved the ""FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018,"" which reauthorizes the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) disaster programs at the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).  This bill updates aviation infrastructure, ensuring that airports are safer for travelers.  In addition, the FAA would have to set minimum dimensions for passenger seats required for safety within one year of the bill’s enactment.  It is also important to note that this bill does not privatize air traffic control (ATC).
If you have questions, concerns, or suggestions about these or any other issues please visit my website, contact me by phone, letter, e-mail, or on Facebook.  It is important that the people of District 13 know what we are doing in Washington for them, and that we continue to hear from you.  
As always, I appreciate hearing from you.

10/9/18 9:12,Leveling the Playing Field for Trade,"News from Congressman Dan Newhouse
￼  
Leveling the Playing Field for Trade 
￼ 
Last week, an agreement was reached on the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) to modernize NAFTA. The USMCA is outstanding news for America's farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers. Under this deal, Central Washington wheat farmers gain fair treatment, and dairy producers gain greater access to the Canadian market. American workers need a level playing field, and President Trump kept his promise to renegotiate NAFTA with that goal. I applaud the work of President Trump and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in successfully pushing to modernize the trilateral agreement with our closest trading partners. I attended the President's announcement at the White House Rose Garden. You can watch here. 
Listen to Locals on Shoreline Transfer 
￼ 
Click here to watch KAPP-KVEW's coverage. 
I joined members of the Tri-Cities community to discuss the ongoing proposal to reconvey part of the Columbia River shoreline currently owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. I have encouraged public meetings like this, so all corners of the community have the opportunity to engage, ask questions, share concerns, and be included in the decisions being made at the federal level. Kennewick, Richland, and Pasco pay to maintain these shoreline lands. Local tax dollars operate the public parks and amenities along the waterfront, and these communities deserve to have these shoreline lands under their local control. So long as we can assure that all voices have the opportunity to be part of this community effort, I will continue to work to get it across the finish land. You can learn more about the reconveyance here and learn more about the progress being made in Congress here. 
Workforce for the Future 
￼ 
The Tri-Cities region is one of the fastest growing economies in the state, and there are many jobs that need skilled workers to fill them. It is important that the local workforce has the proper training to take advantage of these opportunities. I had the opportunity to attend Connect Tri-Cities in Kennewick, which is an annual event that brings together employers, job seekers, educators, labor groups, tribes, and veterans to build and develop strong future employees.  
Results for Local Businesses 
￼ 
At the West Richland Chamber of Commerce monthly luncheon, I was able to connect with business owners and community leaders to discuss their priorities in Congress. There is a lot of work being done to encourage small business growth and investment, and I am pleased to see optimism and positivity among Central Washington businesses. Stability and certainty are vital for business owners as they plan to invest in their communities or expand their services. I am proud to be able to deliver permanent tax cuts for individuals families, and small businesses by voting to support the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018.  
Spurring Economic Development 
￼ 
The Columbia Gardens Urban Wine & Artisan Village is a fairly new attraction in historic downtown Kennewick that is bringing together Washington's famous wine industry, local producers, artists, culinary experts, and sellers. I toured the still-developing location to see how the Port of Kennewick is encouraging tourists and locals to spur a revival of the area. The Village features a beautiful Latino Heritage Mural, and Columbia Basin College will use the space to jump start their new culinary program. I appreciate the opportunity to see one of the Tri-Cities' latest economic development projects. 
Encouraging STEM  
￼ 
I met with the FIRST LEGO League FOG Buster team from Richland, and they demonstrated their Funnel Interceptor project. The FOG Busters are utilizing their STEM education and skills to think like innovators, working to develop solutions to real-world problems, and they were one of only 20 teams worldwide to make it to the International Global League competition. Their project was designed to separate great from soap before it gets to the sewer lines, saving pipes from clogging. It is inspirational to see these brilliant young minds at work, and it gives me hope that our future is in good hands. 
The Highest Award 
￼ 
It was an honor to join the President as he awarded the nation's highest distinction, the Medal of Honor, to U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Ronald J. Shurer II from Washington state. Sergeant Shurer served as Senior Medical Sergeant in the Special Forces in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. He and his team were engaged by enemy fire, and Sergeant Shurer bravely fought to treat, stabilize, evacuate, and protect his fellow brothers in arms. He was honorably discharged in 2009 and began his career with the Secret Service as a Special Agent. Our entire state and nation salute Shurer's bravery with the highest award. Learn more about Sergeant Shurer here. 
Thank you for reading this e-news update. It is an honor and privilege to serve you in Congress.

The Washington Rundown 
After a highly criticized consideration process, the United States Senate voted to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Last week, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 302, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, which included $1.68 billion in disaster relief.  $1.14 billion of this funding will support North Carolina’s recovery efforts from damaging winds and flooding caused by Hurricane Florence, including resources to rebuild housing and infrastructure. 
Butterfield Convenes Meeting on Hurricane Florence Recovery  
Last Monday, Congressman Butterfield convened a meeting with state officials to discuss the inclusion of small, women-owned, and minority-owned businesses in Hurricane Florence recovery efforts.  Butterfield thanked officials for their diligent work as our state continues to recover, and urged them to utilize more of these businesses to help recovery efforts.

Reps. Butterfield & Sewell Examine New Voting Rights Report 
In September, Congressman Butterfield and Congresswoman Terri Sewell (AL) held a hearing in Washington, DC with commissioners from the United States Commission on Civil Rights to examine their latest report, An Assessment of Minority Voting Rights Access in the United States.  
The Report identified many of the same barriers to minority participation in voting that Congressman Butterfield has been fighting against since the Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted core protections in the Voting Rights Act.  The report shows how states across the country have enacted laws to change voting procedures that wrongly prevent certain citizens, namely minorities, from having equal access to the ballot box.  These measures include: strict voter ID laws, early voting changes popular with minority groups, and challenges to voter eligibility.  The release of the report is timely as North Carolinians will vote in November on a constitutional amendment that would require voter ID in the state.  Republicans in the General Assembly passed a law to add the proposed constitutional amendment to the November ballot.  The proposed amendment to the North Carolina Constitution comes a year after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider an appeal by North Carolina Republicans to reinstate their strict voter ID law after Federal judges struck the law down because it was unconstitutionally discriminatory and targeted African American voters “with almost surgical precision.”

Last Week in Congress
Unemployment Rate Falls Again - Now Lowest Since 1969
￼ ￼ Click here to read more from CNN Business
Thanks to the economic growth being driven by tax reform, the unemployment rate hit its lowest level in 49 years - nearly half a century. Last month, the unemployment rate fell to 3.7%, and now there are even more jobs available than the total number of unemployed Americans. The economy has averaged an increase of 208,000 jobs per month in 2018 – exceeding the average monthly jobs growth of the last two years. The last time the roaring American jobs market was this strong, astronauts were still going to the moon. I am proud to be working on policies that are creating economic opportunities for every single American.

U.S. Announces New Trade Deal with Mexico and Canada
￼ ￼ Click here to read more from the Washington Post
Last week, the United States, Mexico, and Canada struck a new trade deal to replace the 25 year old agreement known as NAFTA. The new deal, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA is the result of more than a year of negotiating between the three nations, and would make major changes with regard to agriculture, automobile manufacturing, intellectual property protections, digital trade provisions, and also includes new policies on environmental standards and fair labor practices. USMCA will create more balanced, reciprocal trade that supports high-paying jobs for Americans and grow the North American economy.
The new agreement will benefit Kansas farmers and ranchers by allowing greater access to Canadian and Mexican dairy and poultry markets, in addition to creating a more even playing field for wheat farmers in Kansas and across the country. Under the modernized agreement, all other tariffs on agricultural products traded between the United States and Mexico will remain at zero. In addition, the deal improves trade rules on automobiles, intellectual property, and other key trade items.

Down Syndrome Awareness Month
￼ Team Yoder with Rachel Mast
Team Yoder and families went out for a fun dinner Sunday night at Olive Garden and surprised our friend and hostess Rachel Mast for Down Syndrome Awareness Month. Rachel was running the show at the Olive Garden and greeted us with a big smile. We are very proud of you, Rachel!
Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with organizations like the National Down Syndrome Society, Down Syndrome Guild of Greater Kansas City, and Inclusion Connections, and I've gotten to know a lot of remarkable people like Rachel Mast. When I was first elected to Congress, Jonathan, Jawanda, and Rachel Mast of Olathe came to me, shared their story, and advocated for policies that positively impact the lives of people with Down syndrome and their families. Together, we passed the ABLE Act into law, which helps families with children with special needs have the chance to save for a future of independence through tax free savings accounts.Their story shows that the voices of real people are heard in the halls of Congress. Thank you to Rachel and her family, and every person who advocates for legislation to help those with Down syndrome fulfill their dreams – I will continue to do my part in Congress.

Federal Investment in Kansas Career and Technical Education
￼ Kevin observing a teacher and student at Gardner Edgerton's ATC
Making sure Americans have the tools and training required by 21st century jobs is an important factor in the continued growth of our economy. Recently, the House voted to pass a spending bill which will increase funding for the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, the primary source of federal funding for states to develop academic, career, and technical skills of secondary and postsecondary students. The impact of this legislation directly benefits our local community colleges and public school districts who receive these funds including the Gardner Edgerton School District.
Last week, I visited Gardner Edgerton School District High School’s Advanced Technical Center (ATC), which offers advanced courses in auto collision, welding, carpentry and culinary arts. This career and technical education is a great opportunity for students to learn about jobs in fields that are currently hiring and many students leave with certifications to work immediately. The teachers I met during the visit are professionals in their fields and passionate about teaching these skills to the next generation. I saw firsthand what the students are learning – and was particularly impressed by the students building decks, repairing cars and welding. All the slots are full at ATC, and there is a waiting list. Students enrolled in the ATC programs are doing better academically in other classes as well. Thank you to Superintendent Pam Stranathan and Coordinator of Student Services Melissa McIntire for your vision and leadership for this new program and facility only in its 2nd year. 
￼
Employee Townhall at Design Mechanical
￼ Kevin speaking to employees at Design Mechanical
I appreciated a chance to join an employee town hall at Design Mechanical in KCK. I listened to their comments and took questions on trade, immigration, the economy and prioritizing civility in Congress. It was great to hear what's on the minds of small business employees in the Third District right now, and I enjoyed our productive discussion.
￼
Overland Park Rotary Club
￼ Kevin with OP Rotary President Mike Tracy
It was great to be back at the Overland Park Rotary Club last week hearing about amazing research happening at Children's Mercy. It was also nice to see old friends and greet past President Jim Courtney and current President Mike Tracy. The Rotary motto of ""service above self"" is a guiding principle for me, and I am always honored to join other Rotarians who are committed to service as well.
￼
Yoder Receives Champion of Small Business Investing Award
￼ Kevin with SG360 employees
I enjoyed visiting the Lenexa headquarters of SG360, a local business that is working to “Keep it Clean” all across the country. We talked about the important role SG360, and all small businesses, play in driving our booming economy. While there, I was also honored to receive the Champion of Small Business Investing Award from the Small Business Investor Alliance, a leading trade association working to promote competitive markets and increased opportunities to invest in small businesses. I strongly support the partnership between the U.S. Small Business Administration and private companies that finance local businesses like SG360 who provide the jobs and services that are so important to our local and national economy. I will continue to work to ensure that small businesses have the tools and resources they need to expand and support our growing economy.
￼
KU Edwards Campus
￼ Kevin with KU Vice Chancellor David Cook
Last week, I enjoyed a visit to the KU Edwards Campus in Overland Park. Thanks to Vice Chancellor David Cook for meeting with me and sharing the exciting news that this fall semester enrollment at KU Edwards campus increased 12.5 percent from one year ago. We discussed the needs of students and our work in Congress to support student financial aid programs like Pell Grants, which I used to put myself through college at KU. These programs are critical for students in our District and can often be the deciding factor on whether a student can afford college. Recently, I voted in favor of restoring year-round Pell Grants, allowing students to use these funds for summer classes and enable them to finish their degrees more quickly and decrease student loan debt. In September, I’m also proud to have voted in favor of the Fiscal Year 2019 Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations bill, which increased the maximum annual Pell Grant per student to a new record-high level.
￼
National Coffee with a Cop Day
￼ Kevin with Acting Deputy Chief Sonta Wilburn and Officer John Lacy
I participated in National Coffee With A Cop Day with the Overland Park Police Department at their Coffee with a Cop event at LaMar’s Donuts and Coffee to encourage communication between law enforcement and the public. Thank you to our local police who put their lives on the line each day to keep us safe.
￼
Fairfax Festival in KCK
￼ Kevin with Tony Privitera, Melissa Clark, and Mike Martin
It was great to be at the annual Fairfax Festival at Kaw Point Park in KCK, with fantastic views of the river and downtown. The event featured awesome music, food, and local history. The Fairfax Industrial District is home to over 120 businesses and is an important part of our local economy. I’m proud to represent the Fairfax industrial area, and thanks to Melissa Clark from the Fairfax Industrial Association (FIA) for her invitation and leadership.
￼
Coffee with Small Business Leaders
￼ Kevin speaking with the combined chambers
Last Friday I joined a multi-Chamber coffee including the Chambers of Commerce of Gardner Edgerton, Louisburg & Spring Hill at Shawnee Mission Health in Overland Park. It was great to hearing from small business owners about their experiences with this strong economy. The National Federation of Independent Business's Optimism Index is at an all-time high point, and that optimism was certainly reflected in the conversations I had with Third District small business owners last week.
￼
Annual Advice & Aid Banquet
￼ Kevin speaking at the Advice and Aid Banquet
On Saturday evening, Brooke and I attended the annual Advice & Aid Pregnancy Centers banquet in Overland Park. This amazing organization helps women and their families, during crisis and beyond. Thank you to Ruth Tisdale for your leadership and everyone who attended.

NEWS FROM WASHINGTON AND ACROSS WEST TEXAS
Dear Friend, 
I had the opportunity to visit with many of you in Seminole, Big Spring, and Lubbock last week. From honoring a few of our fallen heroes to meeting with educators and community leaders, it is easy to see why the good people of West Texas are the finest in the nation.
Fair Trade 
With the new United States–Mexico–Canada (USMCA) Agreement, President Trump has delivered on his promise to renegotiate NAFTA in a way that works better for American workers, manufacturers, and agriculture producers. I believe in the extraordinary value of open markets, but the rules of trade must apply to all partner nations in a fair and reciprocal way. The main reason Canada and Mexico were willing to agree to new terms is simply this: we have a president who negotiates from strength and won’t fold under political pressure.
￼ 
Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh
Justice Kavanaugh was more thoroughly vetted than any Supreme Court Justice nominee in recent history, and I am pleased that the Senate confirmed him to the High Court. While the nature of the allegations were serious, they all remain completely unsubstantiated and uncorroborated. I am relieved that we still have a majority of Senators who believe in due process and the presumption of innocence. 
The personal attacks by some have reached an all-time low and, unfortunately, Justice Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford were both victims of this process. Justice Kavanaugh is eminently qualified, has unimpeachable character, and will appropriately render decisions based on the Constitution and Rule of Law - not on a political or policy agenda.
In spite of the drama and damage done in the process, I am pleased that Justice Kavanaugh has been confirmed and the Constitution will be restored to the High Court. My most heart-felt congratulations to my friends, Brett and Ashley - two of the most exceptional people I know. Justice Kavanaugh will be a fair, informed, and objective justice with the highest fidelity to the Constitution and Rule of Law. See here for a few more thoughts on his confirmation.  
￼ 
West Texas Warriors 
Rural America contributes the best of the best men and women in our armed forces – many have called West Texas home. This week it was my profound honor to be with the people of Big Spring and Lubbock to pay tribute to three of our fallen soldiers, Specialist Robert James ""RJ"" Volker, Petty Officer Mark Russell Cannon, and Specialist Geoffrey Golden Johnson. Their service and sacrifice has ensured our nation’s freedom and security. RJ, Mark, and Geoffrey are West Texas Warriors, and it is our duty to never forget them and to always strive to be a nation worthy of their sacrifice. 
￼ 
New Lubbock VA Clinic 
I’m excited about the partnership between the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Texas Tech Health Sciences Center to provide thousands of veterans throughout West Texas with the highest quality of care. Veterans represent the best of our country, and they deserve the best from their country. Read here for more on VA’s announcement to award a new lease for a replacement for the Outpatient Clinic in Lubbock, Texas. 
As a member of the House VA Committee and throughout the 115th Congress, we have passed legislation and conducted oversight over the Department of Veterans Affairs, holding them to the highest of standards. The VA’s action to award new leases to facilities across the nation reaffirms their commitment to serving our veterans.
Growing Communities 
With a growing economy comes the confidence for our communities to invest in new projects that expand opportunity and improve quality of life for our citizens. Because of pro-growth policies supported by this Congress and administration and the hard work of the American people, business is booming and our communities are flourishing. 
It is exciting to see our local economy right here in Big Spring thriving. I was glad to be a part of the Big Spring Industrial Park Rail Project grand opening with Mayor Larry McLellan, the Big Spring Economic Development Corporation, the Big Spring Chamber of Commerce, and others that made this initiative possible. Big things are happening in Big Spring! 
￼ 
Future Leaders 
Our education systems are best run at the state and local levels. The more we pull the heavy hand of the federal government out of our schools, the more freedom they will have to do what’s best locally. It was good to visit Seminole High School and see how they are paving the way for our next generation of leaders. 
￼ 
Please know, it is an honor to be your representative. Feel free to reach out to my office and let me know how I can best serve you.

Dear Lindsey, 
An estimated 126 million women are missing from the world population due to gender-based violence, neglect, sex-selective abortions, and infanticide. It is heartbreaking when the lives of young girls are valued less than the lives of young boys, and Congress must stand up against the promotion of violence against girls around the world. That is why I along with Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA) introduced the Stop Gendercide Act of 2018. Violence against women and girls has led to skewed sex ratios in certain national and sub-national populations. In these populations, there is evidence that heightened demand for women can make them more vulnerable to human trafficking crimes, child marriage, and exploitation. This legislation will give the U.S. government, partner nations, and civil society the information they need to better respond to changes in human trafficking patterns driven by discriminatory environments.  Because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed last year, the average family in Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District is saving an additional $3,700 a year. Now, the House has voted to make those tax cuts permanent. Before coming back to Missouri, I voted to pass Tax Reform 2.0, a comprehensive package for Missourians that protects middle-class and small business tax cuts, promotes family savings, helps local businesses provide retirement plans for their workers, and advances the next generation of entrepreneurs in America. It includes a doubled Child Tax Credit, the first ever Paid Family Leave Tax Credit, and expanded 529 education accounts that cover apprenticeship fees, the cost of homeschooling, and can help repay student debt. Tax Reform 2.0 creates a new baby savings mechanism which allows families to access their retirement accounts penalty-free upon welcoming a new child and to replenish those accounts later on. It also creates a new Universal Savings Account to offer a fully flexible savings tool that families can use any time they choose. 
￼
￼

Last week, President Trump announced the new North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which includes the Wagner Language to uphold the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA). This new agreement creates more balanced and fairer trade for American workers. It stimulates U.S. manufacturing by supporting domestic vehicle and auto parts production, and sets new standards for agricultural biotechnology, a key industry here in Missouri’s 2nd District. The USMCA also modernizes IP standards and protects American innovation, and increases market access and stability for American farmers while providing a strengthened environment for food manufacturing and rural jobs across Missouri.

Importantly, I have worked with U.S. trade negotiators to guarantee this agreement includes specific language upholding my recently enacted law, FOSTA, to help stop the online sex trade here at home and now throughout North America. It was my pleasure to speak with Ambassador C.J. Mahoney about continuing to work together on U.S. trade agreements to reflect America's position on fighting human trafficking. The Wagner Language allows our trading partners to enact domestic laws that enable victims to sue the websites that facilitate the sex trade and empower law enforcement at all levels—federal, state, and local—to protect their communities. I hope that USMCA guides legislatures across our continent to enact strong laws that protect victims and dismantle the online sex trade.

￼
￼

While in the district, I had opportunities to meet with Colonel Michael Holland of the Army Reserve, JDRF patient-advocates, and attend the swearing-in ceremony for Ballwin Police Department Officer Shannon Schaper. I’m tremendously thankful to represent a community of such talented individuals who work hard every day to provide for a better tomorrow!

Kansas Common Sense  October 8, 2018
Hello,
 
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
 
Confirming Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court
After full consideration of all facts presented, I voted this weekend to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States. Judge Kavanaugh is an extremely well-qualified nominee with a deep respect for the Constitution. His intellect and experience in the legal field will serve the Supreme Court well.
However, when someone comes forward with allegations of abuse or misconduct, they deserve to be heard. I appreciated that the Judiciary Committee took these allegations seriously and was committed to being transparent and following the precedented and necessary procedures to best evaluate these claims – including the decision to request that the administration instruct the FBI to conduct an additional FBI supplemental background investigation.
I commend Dr. Ford for telling her story before the nation, and inspiring others to come forward. Judge Kavanaugh also deserved the opportunity to defend his character, and he categorically denied these allegations. Throughout this process, I have been deeply saddened by the treatment of both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh – and their families. 
After the supplemental FBI background investigation was delivered to the Senate, I carefully reviewed the FBI’s report, as well as the findings from the independent prosecutor. No witness named by Dr. Ford or Ms. Ramirez corroborated the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. And there was no new information or evidence provided in the report that changed my earlier plan to vote for Judge Kavanaugh. 
Long-Term FAA Extension Takes Flight!
After years of negotiations, on Wednesday the Senate passed a five-year extension to the Federal Aviation Administration’s authority – this bipartisan, bicameral legislation is welcome news for travelers, aerospace manufacturers and industry innovators alike. Not only does this reauthorization elevate the over 40,000 Kansans who make a living manufacturing, operating and servicing the aircraft industry, but it includes important provisions I championed to close the aviation skills gap and to bring more women into this field.
Additionally, this extension does not include any misguided proposals to privatize our nation’s air traffic control system. ATC privatization threatens access to airspace for all but the largest cities with largest airports, causing significant harm to the long-term economic viability of rural America. I will continue to advocate instead for proposals that provide greater protections for the general aviation industry and small airports nationwide that are so critical to connecting Americans in rural communities with the rest of the world. Overall, this legislation will make airline travel smoother, safer and more transparent for all Americans.
Click here for more on the numerous wins for Kansans in this reauthorization. 
Reviewing the New U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement Over the past year and a half, I have expressed directly and repeatedly to President Trump, Ambassador Lighthizer, Secretary Ross and my colleagues in the Senate that we need more trade, not less. I have been clear that both Canada and Mexico – Kansas’ top two export markets – must be part of any final agreement. I appreciate the administration working to make certain these markets remain available to Kansas farmers, ranchers and manufacturers, providing them some much-needed certainty. 
Once the president signs the agreement, it will be up to Congress to consider and vote to approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, most likely next year. However, today, farmers and ranchers are breathing a sigh of relief as the announcement brings greater certainty at a time when producers are facing extended periods of low commodity prices. Agricultural conditions in our state – due to drought, commodity prices, and the uncertainty of export markets – are a significant challenge. Simply put, we produce more in this country than we can consume and we need export markets so we can continue to sell our goods and commodities. I will further analyze the details of this agreement, but this announcement is clearly a positive development. Watch my Senate floor remarks on what this agreement means for Kansas here.  
Holding My Subcommittee’s Fourth Hearing on Protecting Olympic Athletes from Abuse As the chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee with jurisdiction over the health and safety of amateur athletes, I convened my fourth hearing as part of our ongoing investigation into systemic failures to protect athletes from abuse within the Olympic movement. On Wednesday, the subcommittee heard testimony from and posed questions to the executive leadership of USA Swimming, USA Weightlifting, USA Bobsled and Skeleton, and US Figure Skating regarding policies that have already been implemented to prevent and report abuse and what changes still need to be made to provide a safe environment for amateur athletes. 
We were honored to be joined by survivors of abuse from multiple sports in the audience who continue to lend their stories and their voices to these important issues. I remain dedicated to continuing the bipartisan approach that this subcommittee has taken in its comprehensive investigation. In consultation with law enforcement, survivors and advocates, I will work closely with my Senate colleagues to identify meaningful reform in the best interests of athletes and their families. To watch my questioning, click here. 
 ￼
Securing Amtrak’s Commitment to Maintain Southwest Chief On Wednesday, I questioned in the Chief Operating Officer of Amtrak in a Senate Commerce Committee hearing, where I again expressed my disappointment in Amtrak’s handling of ensuring service on the Southwest Chief rail line – in recent months, Amtrak has put forth a misguided proposal to break up hundreds of miles of the Southwest Chief passenger rail line, swapping buses for trains. This proposal was unacceptable to me and the many Kansans who rely on the Southwest Chief, and I proposed an amendment that would forbid Amtrak from implementing such a proposal. This amendment passed the Senate in August, and is still waiting on a final vote from the House of Representatives. 
However, at this week’s hearing, Amtrak committed to continuing operation of the Southwest Chief as-is through the end of Fiscal Year 2019. This is a positive development for the riders who rely on this rail line, but there is still much work to be done. Amtrak has still not committed to honoring its $3 million pledge for track improvements, nor has it guaranteed continued service after FY’19. I will continue working with my colleagues and Amtrak to make certain the Southwest Chief continues to offer communities in Kansas – and along the entire passenger rail route – the service they need. 
 ￼ 
Honoring the Women of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion I am delighted that on Wednesday, the Senate unanimously passed my resolution honoring the women of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion. These soldiers were members of the only all-black, all-female battalion to serve overseas during World War II. The unit trained at home, and served in England and in France where they sorted and routed mail for millions of American servicemembers and civilians. 
A memorial, with a planned dedication this fall, will honor the battalion at the Buffalo Soldier Memorial Park on Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. I’m proud to see our nation continue to take measures like these to recognize these women and patriots, and the sacrifices they endured decades ago. This Senate-approved measure and the construction of a memorial at Fort Leavenworth will increase awareness of these brave soldiers’ service to make certain the Battalion and their sacrifices for our nation are not forgotten. 
Participating in a Senate Commerce Hearing on Rural Broadband On Thursday, I participated in a Senate Commerce Committee hearing entitled, “Broadband: Opportunities and Challenges in Rural America,” where we discussed the Committee’s ongoing efforts to assess the progress of broadband deployment to rural communities, with particular emphasis on the efficacy of the broadband deployment programs within the Federal Communications Commission’s Universal Service Fund and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Utilities Service. As Congress seeks to continue its mission of closing the Digital Divide by bringing high-speed broadband access to rural America, I will continue to prioritize timely deployment and related economic development in Kansas. Watch the full exchange here. 
￼ 
Speaking with the Kansas Chamber in Washington, D.C.
On Thursday, I joined members of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce during their annual Congressional visit to Washington, D.C. During our meeting, I offered updates on work I’m doing in the Senate and my priorities Congress, including judicial issues, the recently-passed FAA Reauthorization and the positive impacts it will have on Kansas, ongoing trade disputes and the recently-announced USMCA agreement, nominations in the Senate, as well as various economic and business policies. I also fielded questions from the group on issues important to their work. The Kansas Chamber of Commerce reaches many Kansans across the state and their work to support small businesses and create a pro-growth environment has benefitted communities of all shapes and sizes. I’m proud of our partnership and I look forward to working with them well into the future.
￼
Keynoting the Associated General Contractors of Kansas Legislative Dinner On Sunday, I gave the keynote address at the Associated General Contractors (AGC) of Kansas’ Legislative Dinner. During my remarks,  I discussed a number of items that I’m making progress on specifically related to the AGC's work. This included topics ranging from technical and career education, workforce development, trade and tariffs, veterans’ healthcare, tax cuts and regulatory relief. Thank you to AGC of Kansas Executive Vice President Mike Gibson for the invitation and Ben Hutton for the kind introduction. Thanks also to State Senator Dan Kerschen, State Representative Joe Seiwert and State Representative Jack Thimesch for joining me.
￼ 
Kansas Listening Tour Stop in Cowley County Thank you to the many Cowley County residents who took time to visit with me during my townhall meeting in Arkansas City on Monday. During this meeting, we discussed veterans' healthcare, the implementation of the VA MISSION Act, tariffs and ongoing trade disputes, Social Security and the need to work together and find common ground, both in society and in Congress. Thank you to Dan Deener and the Ark City Rotary Club for opening up their meeting to the public and for arranging my visit.
 ￼ 
Touring the Winfield Cotton Gin Prior to my townhall meeting in Arkansas City, I was in Winfield to tour the Winfield Cotton Gin and meet with members of the Southern Kansas Cotton Growers Cooperative. Recently, they've experienced both an increase in automation at the gin, as well as a growth in the amount of cotton being grown by area farmers. During this visit, I toured their facility and heard first-hand from members of their cooperative about challenges they’re facing during an increasingly hard time for our producers, especially related to weather and ongoing trade disputes. We also discussed the importance of agriculture research, and I offered an update on the Farm Bill. Thank you to Rex Friesen for arranging my visit and leading the tour of the gin, and to the many Southern Kansas Cotton Growers and local producers who were able to join our discussion. 
 ￼ 
Now Accepting Spring Internship Applications My own interest in public service was sparked by an internship for Kansas First District Congressman Keith Sebelius in 1974. As an intern, I had the chance to learn firsthand how a Congressional office operates and how the legislative process works. I am proud to be able to offer this same opportunity in my Senate office today, where I have interns year-round working closely with my staff on behalf of Kansans.  Applications for internships in my Washington, D.C. and Kansas offices for Spring 2018 are due next Friday, October 19. Congressional internships are open to qualified undergraduate and graduate students who have an interest in public service and have achieved academic excellence. Click here for more information. 
Honored to Serve You in Washington
It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard. 
Please let me know how I can be of assistance. You can contact me by email by clicking here. You can also click here to contact me through one of my Kansas offices or my Washington, D.C., office.

I wanted to share another update with you regarding the Fourth Annual Women’s Conference and Forum: “Breaking Through: Women Work For Change.” This year, I am proud to announce Alexandria’s Naomi Wadler will receive the Clara Mortenson Beyer Women and Children First Award for her advocacy in support of gun violence prevention.

Wadler, 11, organized youth protests at her school in the wake of the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida earlier this year. Her subsequent address to crowds at the March For Our Lives in Washington D.C. became an international sensation. 

I first met Naomi at my Alexandria town hall on gun violence, held weeks after the Parkland shooting. I am thrilled to welcome her back to speak to constituents about her experience as an activist, and to impart her wisdom to people who want to work for change. I doubt that anyone who heard her speak at my town hall in March has forgotten her inspiring words about the need to stop gun violence. Naomi is a prodigy of advocacy, and I look forward to continuing to learn from her next month at our Annual Women’s Conference in Arlington.

We first created the Clara Mortenson Beyer Women and Children First Award while I was an Ambassador to Switzerland in 2011.  It is named after my grandmother, who is credited with convincing the Roosevelt Administration to appoint Frances Perkins, the first female Cabinet Secretary in the United States. My grandmother served as Secretary Perkins’ right hand, working on child labor issues. She was the first woman appointed as US representative to the International Labor Organization in Geneva.

This year's conference will be held at Founder's Hall on October 13. Registration and additional information are available here.

Dear Friend, 

One year ago, our lives were thrust into turmoil by the most destructive fire our state has ever seen. As we reflect on that night, we remember the everyday heroism of our friends and neighbors, the bravery of our first responders who rushed into danger to keep us safe, and kinship displayed as our community helped each other recover.

The last twelve months have not always been easy, but over and over I have been so proud of the dedication our community has shown in lending a hand to those who need it and pitching in as we rebuild. From teachers turning their classrooms into evacuation centers and greeting each person with a friendly smile, to neighbors offering hot meals to firefighters and law enforcement at the end of a long day, to local and state officials working around the clock, the service you have provided each other is truly inspiring.

I know that our work is not over. We must continue providing the support the survivors need and I am hard at work fighting for every single federal dollar we can bring to bear on this effort. Know that I will not stop working to help our community recover and come back even stronger.
If I can ever help or if you have any questions, please know you can always call my office. 
Sincerely,
￼
Mike Thompson
Member of Congress

Dear Friend, 
Yesterday, Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate and sworn-in as the newest Associate Justice to the United States Supreme Court.  
Although I do not directly participate in the Supreme Court confirmation process as a Member of the House of Representatives, I believe Justice Kavanaugh is a humble, intelligent, and qualified judge who will safely guard the Constitution. 
I congratulate Justice Kavanaugh on his confirmation and commend President Trump on a successful nomination.  
  
A NEW US-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE DEAL 
This past week, President Donald Trump announced a new trilateral trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. 
The announcement coincided closely with National Manufacturing Day, a day to recognize our nation’s rich heritage of building and innovation. It is certainly no secret that the number of manufacturing jobs in our country has diminished over the last few decades, but under the Trump Administration, our unprecedented economic growth, due in part to historic tax reform and the rollback of burdensome government regulations, has provided the opportunity for more manufacturing jobs to be brought back to the United States, creating good wages and new opportunities for millions of Americans.  
I congratulate President Trump on the announcement of reaching a new trilateral agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico to replace NAFTA. I look forward to carefully analyzing the text of the deal and working with the Trump Administration to ensure this proposal benefits America's farmers, businesses, and consumers.

I am pleased with everything this Republican Congress, working with President Trump, has accomplished.  I am delighted by the first-rate services my office has provided constituents. Since I’ve been in Congress, my staff and I have worked hard to provide our constituents and community with respected and principled representation. Since 2017, our office has been pleased to recoup more than 5.5 million in compensation, pension or retroactive payments for constituents upon the favorable completion of their claim or appeal.  
Assisting those who have a matter that involves a federal agency or whose claims have gone beyond the expected time frame for processing; booking tours for constituents who are visiting DC; and responding to emails, letters, and calls is taken seriously at my office. While we cannot guarantee a favorable outcome or compel an agency to decide an issue contrary to established rules and regulations, we can be a connection between you and the federal agency to confirm your claim has not slipped through the cracks. If you need assistance with a federal agency issue, please call our district office at (352) 241-9220.

Constituent Corner
A constituent from Belleview received his permanent orders from the U.S. Military stationing him in Japan within the next few weeks, but his wife had not yet received her no-cost passport. The constituent and his wife were concerned that they would not be able to travel to Japan together and contacted my office for assistance. We sent an inquiry and learned that the passport had been processed and would be available for pick up. The constituents were thankful for our assistance in the matter. 
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.

Legislative Update 
Approximately 115 Americans die every day due to Opioid addiction. Providing law enforcement, the healthcare industry and local communities the tools to combat this crisis has been a priority of the U.S. House of Representatives. In June, the House passed H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act to advance treatment and recovery initiatives, improve prevention, protect our communities, and bolster our efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl. Last week, the Senate passed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act and it will now go to President Trump.
The passage of this bill follows the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and 21st Century Cures Act in 2016, which I cosponsored. Visit www.OpioidCrisis.gop for more information.

 Bucks County Receives Federal Workforce Grant
￼   
Here in Bucks and Montgomery County, substantive training and apprenticeship programs are integral to good paying jobs. I was pleased to announce a U.S. Department of Labor grant for the Bucks County Workforce Development Board alongside Commissioner Rob Loughery, BCWDB Director John Flanagan, and Bucks County Community College President Dr. Stephanie Shanblatt. This award allocates $1.7 million to provide education and work-based learning opportunities to dislocated workers in Bucks, Montgomery, and Philadelphia counties.

Saracini Aviation Safety Act Heads to President
￼ 
Earlier this year, I joined Ellen Saracini and Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) to demand Congress act on the Saracini Aviation Safety Act. 
This week, the Senate passed a bipartisan FAA reauthorization that included the Saracini Aviation Safety Act to strengthen our air travel framework and keep our nation safe. Through the tireless efforts of Ellen Saracini, Rep Josh Gottheimer, and Senator Pat Toomey, the Saracini Aviation Safety Act is finally headed to the President’s desk. By requiring all new commercial aircraft to have secondary cockpit barriers, this bipartisan agreement seeks to prevent our airliners from being hijacked again. We will continue to fight alongside Ellen Saracini until all current passenger aircraft contain secondary barriers.

Defending Social Security and Medicare

I appreciated the opportunity to listen to the concerns of the community at The Solana Doylestown. I am absolutely committed to defending the dignity of our seniors. I am actively working to protect and strengthen Medicare and Social Security.

These grants are a tremendous opportunity for those dedicated public servants in Bucks and Montgomery County.

Hi Friends, 
Each year, I select a family in Texas’ 4th District to honor as “Angels in Adoption.” This offers a way to highlight their impact on children through adoption or foster care.  
Last week, I had the privilege of recognizing this year’s honorees – Angela and Samuel Coston of Texarkana – at my office in Washington, D.C. 
The Costons have impacted many lives through a foster care ministry they founded called “For the Sake of One.” Their ministry aims to help encourage foster families through the difficulties of fostering by providing an array of programs and services to foster children, foster parents and case workers.  
 ￼ 
Rep. Ratcliffe congratulates Angela and Samuel Coston in Washington, D.C. 
On top of taking children into their own home, the Costons’ ministry has brought together many kind-hearted individuals and organizations in the community to help improve the lives of very deserving young people. I’m looking forward to the ongoing positive impact they will have in the years to come.
Sincerely, 
￼  John Ratcliffe U.S. Representative for Texas’ Fourth District

Tenney’s Bill, Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act Passes Senate, Headed to President’s Desk 
On Wednesday, my bill, H.R. 5723, the Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act of 2018 which was included in H.R. 6, passed the Senate and is now headed to the President’s desk to be signed into law.   Often, an addiction to opioids begins with a prescription for pain management. My bill, the Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act works to identify and roll back barriers that have inhibited the use of non-opioid alternatives to treat pain. I look forward to President Trump swiftly signing this important legislation into law and helping to put an end to this epidemic that tears families apart. 
Tenney Holds Press Conference with Local Officials Announcing Disaster Declaration for State of New York
On Thursday, I was joined by John Finch-Commissioner of Public Works, Gordon Kniffen-Supervisor to the Town of Kirkwood, Kevin McManus-Deputy County Executive and the Broome County Emergency Services to announce the Trump Administration’s actions granting a Major Disaster Declaration to seven counties in Upstate New York that experienced unprecedented rainfall and flash flooding from August 13-15. We outlined how the funds will provide critical assistance to municipalities impacted by the recent flooding. 
On September 21, 2018, I sent a letter urging the President to support New York State’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration in response to flooding caused by heavy rainfall in August 2018. You can read the letter here.  
Extreme levels of rainfall along with severe flash flooding, caused significant and costly damage to homes, infrastructure, and small businesses beyond the response capabilities of state and local governments. The major disaster declaration provides the much-needed support to ensure our communities in Broome, Chenango, and Tioga counties can address these costs and mitigate against future flooding.
￼ 
Tenney Visits First Ward Senior Center
On Thursday, I visited the First Ward Senior Center to highlight the unique challenges facing the senior citizen community. Throughout recent months, I have visited senior centers to discuss issues impacting seniors throughout the 22nd District, including Social Security and Medicare.  
It was great to tour the First Ward Senior Center and sit down with residents to discuss the issues that impact Upstate New York seniors, particularly Social Security and Medicare. While there, I discussed the many ways our office can provide assistance to seniors in navigating the federal government’s bureaucracy. It is important our senior’s voices are heard, and I will continue my advocacy in Congress to protect and strengthen Medicare and Social Security.
In Congress, I have fought to strengthen and preserve Social Security and Medicare. I voted in support of the Protecting Seniors’ Access to Medicare Act (H.R. 849). The bill passed the House with bipartisan support. 
Tenney: USMCA will Benefit Upstate Dairy Farmers
 Unfair trade deals have long disadvantaged local businesses and in particular local family farms, the backbone of our Upstate economy. Early reports of a modernized trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada offer welcome news for Upstate dairy farmers. The United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement (USMCA) ensures greater access to the Canadian dairy market and the elimination of the Canadian Class 7 milk pricing scheme, a critical priority for which I have long advocated. I look forward to further reviewing the pillars of the agreement over the coming days and weeks.  I have also led the charge against the negative impact of the Canadian Class 7 milk pricing scheme. Rep. Tenney recently led a New York delegation letter to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer emphasizing that the elimination of Class 7 should be a critical priority in any North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiation.  
Tenney Announces $536,000 GEAR UP Grant Awarded to MVCC
This is welcome news for students and families across the Mohawk Valley. GEAR UP will provide critical funding to ensure our students are prepared to enter the next step of their education and succeed. The team at MVCC leads the way in working alongside our local employers providing students with access to training and key programs that will prepare them to be successful in our workforce locally. Partnerships like this give our students a leg up, ensuring our leaders of tomorrow are equipped with the knowledge and tools they need to be successful well beyond high school and college.
The grant is designed to increase the number of low-income students who are prepared to enter and succeed in postsecondary education. GEAR UP funds are also used to provide college scholarships to low-income students.
Mobile Office Hours
On Wednesday, our staff held mobile office hours in Cortland and Norwich. During mobile office hours, staff from our district office were available to provide assistance to constituents facing issues with federal agencies, specifically the Social Security Administration.   Mobile office hours help us bring the wide range of constituent services our office offers to communities across the 22nd District to increase accessibility and give constituents an opportunity to meet directly with experienced casework staff. Most commonly, our constituents face issues with the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Social Security Administration. Social Security is an important program that seniors in the 22nd District rely on, and I’ve been a leading voice in working to preserve and protect Social Security benefits for all New Yorkers. That’s why our office is hosting mobile office hours to ensure seniors have access to the important Social Security benefits they need and rely on.  Overall, our office has worked with 1,120 constituents and helped recover over $172,000 in benefits. If you are having trouble with a federal agency, from problems with Social Security and Medicare benefits to obtaining a passport or questions about the Veterans Administration, our office is here to ensure you get the answers you need. 
USDA Announces Farm to School Grant Program Applications  
The FY 2019 Farm to School Grant Program Request for Applications (RFA) is now open to applicants. Due to additional funding made available to the Farm to School Grant Program through the FY 2018 Omnibus Bill, the Office of Community Food Systems(OCFS) seeks to award approximately $7.5M in FY 2019 funding. 
The RFA closes December 4, 2018, 11:59pm ET. Late applications will not be accepted. USDA anticipates releasing award decisions in late spring or early summer of 2019. 
Applicants should carefully review the RFA, including grant eligibility requirements, found in sections 3.0 through 3.3 of the RFA. More information can be found in the Farm to School Grant Program Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Guidance Document. OCFS will also conduct webinars with important information regarding how to prepare a complete and competitive grant application. Recordings of these webinars will also be made available online for those who cannot participate in person. All of these resources can be found on the Grant Applicant Resources page. 
Assistance With Grants And Letters of Support
Whether you’re a fire department in need of new equipment or a community organization looking to grow, our office can assist you in navigating the federal grant process. By working with the Congressional Research Service, we can help find grants that may be appropriate for your needs. In many cases, we may even be able to furnish you with a letter of support. To find out how we can assist you in the grant process, contact our New Hartford District Office at 315-732-0713.

It was an honor to present President Sean Fadale with a certificate of congratulations at the groundbreaking of the Community Memorial Hospital’s Family Health Center in Hamilton, NY. The hospital opened in 1952, and currently employs almost 400 people! 
￼ 
It was great to tour Matco Electric and see firsthand how the work they do benefits people throughout the 22nd District. While there, I learned that as a direct result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Matco Electric gave every employee a raise. Businesses like Matco Electric are proof that providing desperately needed relief from the failed ‘tax and spend’ status quo is the most effective way to improve and grow the economy. Upstate New York depends on small businesses and because of tax reform, these businesses can invest, grow, hire more staff and purchase new equipment.
￼ 
This October, it is important we raise awareness about the threat breast cancer poses to both women and men. Studies show that 1 in 8 women across the nation will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime and more than 268,670 people in the United States are diagnosed each year. 
Whether it’s wearing pink to raise awareness, or offering support to someone who is fighting the disease, let's all join together in the fight to end breast cancer.

Trump Administration Secures Deal to Replace NAFTA
Besides being our North American neighbors, Canada and Mexico are two of the largest international markets for products made in Mississippi.  These export markets, as well as others around the world, are a significant generator of jobs and economic growth in our state.  According to the most recent numbers available, Mississippi exports were directly responsible for more than 51,000 jobs.  Last year, the value of these goods totaled $11 billion. 
As the world grows more connected, it is important to get America’s trade deals right.  President Trump has made it a priority to ensure that U.S. businesses and American workers are not hurt by unfair trade practices.  His campaign promise to redo the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a bold effort to fix the shortcomings of the 24-year-old deal.  After more than a year of negotiations, the President has delivered results.
Gains for U.S. Agriculture, Manufacturing
The new pact, formally titled the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), still needs to be ratified by all three countries.  In the United States, Congress will have an opportunity to approve the agreement.  I will continue to take a close look at USMCA and work with Mississippians to ensure the agreement maximizes our state’s potential.  
So far, there seems to be plenty in the deal that lawmakers from both political parties should like.  Overall, a strong trilateral agreement with our North American partners offers certainty to farmers and manufacturers, reaffirming the United States as a place for business investment and job creation.  More specifically, USMCA would encourage the domestic production of automobiles and auto parts.  It would give U.S. farmers greater access to Canadian markets, making sales of American-made dairy, eggs, and poultry more competitive there.
Additionally, U.S. innovators – who continue to seek solutions for the world’s most pressing problems – would have more protections over their intellectual property, thanks to the deal’s extension of copyrights and patents.  USMCA addresses digital trade and online purchases, recognizing the sharp growth of the Internet economy since the terms of NAFTA were set in 1994.
Safeguards on U.S. Intellectual Property
When it comes to protecting America’s trade interests, the Trump Administration’s tough stance extends far beyond this continent.  The President has not shied away from confronting China about the stealing of U.S. intellectual property.  In late March of this year, the United States Trade Representative released the findings from its investigation on these dishonest trade practices.  The report estimated that China’s theft of U.S. intellectual property could cost as much as $600 billion annually.  Such practices are unacceptable, and USMCA is a signal to China that the Administration is committed to safeguarding American ingenuity.
After a slow economic recovery, Americans are finally witnessing positive economic growth and low unemployment.  Keeping “Made in America” goods and services competitive in world markets can help advance these encouraging trends even further.  USMCA is a welcome step toward modern, equitable trade deals for our farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and innovators.

October 7, 2018
Greetings,
On Saturday, I proudly voted with a bipartisan majority of my Senate colleagues to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. He has proven to be a qualified nominee throughout his time on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and has a strong record of defending the Second Amendment, safeguarding the separation of powers, reining in the unchecked power of federal agencies, and preserving our precious religious liberties. Despite Senate Democrats’ efforts to delay and derail his nomination, we successfully delivered on our promise to the American people to confirm strong constitutionalists to the Supreme Court.
As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on The Constitution, I convened a hearing on Tuesday examining the threats to religious liberty within the United States and by oppressive regimes worldwide. Our nation has a rich tradition of religious liberty. But across the globe, people suffer under tyranny. Their stories are heartbreaking and must be told. The persecution of communities of faith precedes the erosion of all freedoms, and Americans must remain vigilant to ensure religious liberty is protected here at home. Watch the powerful hearing here.
I was also pleased the Senate took a stand for all Americans this week and passed a bill I voted for in September to address the ever-growing opioid crisis within our country. Too many families across our country, including my own, have been hurt by our country’s opioid epidemic. Millions of lives have been lost to the opioid crisis. The bill provides support for state efforts to combat drug addiction and funding for research on new non-addictive treatments. Further, this bill enforces stricter laws requiring the U.S. Postal Service to restrict shipments containing fentanyl from entering our country. I look forward to President Trump signing this bill into law.
This week, I was pleased the Senate passed the FAA reauthorization bill, which included my bipartisan Commercial Balloon Pilot Safety Act. Two years ago, tragedy struck Lockhart, Texas when a hot air balloon crashed. Since then, I have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure commercial hot air balloon operators receive medical certificates to enhance safety precautions.
Countless hardworking teachers, first responders, law enforcement officials, and other public servants devote their time and talent to our classrooms and communities. But unfortunately, the current Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) has not always served our public servants fairly. That’s why I recently introduced the Equal Treatment of Public Servants Act with Reps. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) and Richard Neal (D-Mass.), to replace the current WEP with a fairer formula based on their work history and to ensure our public servants receive the Social Security benefits they deserve for their service to our communities.
The entire State of Texas continues to stand shoulder to shoulder with our fellow Americans in North and South Carolina who are recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Florence. As the Lone Star State continues to rebuild from Hurricane Harvey and the south Texas flooding, we must also take all steps necessary to prepare our homes and families for any future weather event. For those seeking preparedness information and resources, please refer to the federal and state resources listed here.

￼
Hello Friends,   With a schedule change in Washington, I will be using October as a district work period in Arizona. I look forward to staying in the Grand Canyon state to meet with constituent groups and discuss how this Congress has made great changes for Arizonans. If you would like to schedule a meeting with me, please email Schweikert.Scheduling@Mail.House.Gov   
￼   Legislative Update   Healthcare Legislation  I wrote an op-ed article with Congressman Webster (FL-11) to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a health insurance Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program.   
According to Kaiser, 10% of the sickest individuals account for nearly two thirds of population health spending (graph below). This means that healthier individuals are covering the costs of a small number of high cost patients. This is especially true in the individual ACA marketplace because there is a smaller insurance pool for these costs to be allocated, as opposed to the large group or private market where costs can be disbursed over a larger number of people – the cost exposure to any one individual is limited.    ￼ Graph from Kaiser showing the percentage of sickest individuals and health spending. 
The Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program gives insurers the ability to recoup the extraordinary costs of their highest cost patients without resulting in higher costs for healthier individuals participating in the marketplace. The Program seeks to ensure individuals have access to affordable health insurance at the lowest possible rates, whether they have a pre-existing condition or not.
H.R. 7003 offers predictability to the individual marketplace for individuals and insurers and, over time, gives states the ability to manage the program based on their own needs. This is a proven model to provide affordability and stability to the health insurance marketplace.
 Blockchain Legislation  Last week, I introduced two blockchain related bills that will increase Congress' support and knowledge for implementing blockchain technology.   H.Res. 1108 seeks to increase research and show Congress’s support for an “innovation friendly” regulatory approach of blockchain technology. We hope that this resolution will increase the support and growth of the technology’s implementation in the public and private sector, to improve overall privacy, transparency, and efficiency.
H.R. 7002 will amend the E-SIGN Act to confirm the applicability of blockchain to electronic records, electronic signatures, and smart contracts. We believe that this bill will provide clarity to the application of existing law during a time when several states have already enacted conflicting legislation regarding the validity of electronic signatures, records, and smart contracts using blockchain. This clarification will enable the technology to grow and reach its potential.  
Both H.Res. 1108 and H.R. 7002 include the NIST standard for the definition for blockchain. We look forward to increasing awareness about the potential and validity of blockchain technology. 

￼

Speaking at a Congressional Blockchain Caucus briefing, as I am one of the Co-Chairs of the Caucus. 


I am greatly honored to serve you in Congress, 

Sincerely, 

￼

Walker Weekly Report
With another successful week in North Carolina, we are working hard to make a difference. Both at home and in Washington, we’re making strides on issues that matter to you and your family. From tax reform and government accountability to issues facing our community like human trafficking and opioid addiction, I am proud to report progress on all fronts.
While we have been working hard to keep our economic success rolling – delivering what is now the lowest unemployment rate since 1969 – we have also been fighting for hope and opportunity in our North Carolina communities struggling with the opioid crisis. I was proud to be a part of the effort to pass the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act to help turn stories of tragedy into triumph. I am pleased that President Trump will soon be signing this legislation into law.
This week, we honored our Community Heroes of the Month, celebrated the manufacturing sector and it’s impact on our North Carolina economy, and saw a former Ft. Bragg soldier receive our nations most prestigious military honor.
Keep reading for the full update. Have a blessed week.  Sincerely, ￼ Mark Walker

HIGHLIGHTS
￼
Honoring Abolition NC Founders as Community Heroes of the Month for Work Combatting Human Trafficking
Cambre Weller and Chelsea Spohn are dedicated to helping our community be stronger and safer. Together, Cambre and Chelsea founded Abolition NC – an organization dedicated to fighting human trafficking. Through this, they have strived to make a difference for countless lives. Cambre’s background as a Guilford County Schools curriculum developer became a natural path for her role in leading Abolition NC’s prevention awareness program. Chelsea’s background in social work has her uniquely skilled to support and mentor survivors.
Human trafficking is one of the greatest injustices of our time, destroying, enslaving and exploiting human life. Together, through continued legislative efforts and community organizations like Abolition NC, we can continue to raise awareness of this issue and work together to end it.
People like Cambre and Chelsea keep us all inspired to make a difference and dedicate ourselves to our community. I am touched and impressed with their heartfelt efforts to fight this injustice on the front lines.

Celebrating National Manufacturing Day and Our Successes in Technical Education and the Economy
Friday, on National Manufacturing Day, manufacturers across North Carolina opened their doors to students, encouraging our next generation of builders and thinkers. 
Manufacturing is vital to our future and employs more than 10 percent of North Carolinians. That’s why I am proud to have led the charge to help the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act become law. This legislation freed up $71 million for North Carolina’s manufacturers to reinvest in our community and people. This is the most of any state in the nation.
Builders and job-creators should not be punished for hiring and investing in our communities. With the MTB Act, North Carolina can continue to lead the nation in manufacturing and economic growth. It has been my priority to reform the system with transparency and accountability and we have done that with success. In the Sixth District, employers such as Syngenta of Greensboro and Glen Raven Inc. of Alamance County, as well as their employees, have already begun to feel the fruits of our hard work. This relief will help North Carolina’s manufacturers free up their resources, hire more employees and grow overall business in our local communities.
Our efforts for manufacturers coupled with our reforms to help small businesses are leaving people better off to pursue the American Dream. Our legislative efforts in the House have led to unemployment at record lows and job openings at record highs while wages are rising and employer benefits are expanding.

Former Ft. Bragg Soldier Ronald J. Shurer II Receives the Medal of Honor
This week, Ronald J. Shurer II was awarded the Medal of Honor for valor by President Trump at the White House. As a former Ft. Bragg US Army Special Forces Medical Sergeant, Shurer displayed exceptional patriotism when he braved enemy fire to save fellow soldiers. While he and his team were engaged in heavy combat in Afghanistan, he treated a wounded soldier and then fought his way back to a group of four more injured members of his Green Beret team. After treating and stabilizing the group, he evacuated them down a mountainside while using his body to shield them from enemy fire.
This award of valor reminds us of the everyday patriotism and sacrifice of all our military families that call North Carolina home. Our offices and staff are anxious to hear from our military families on any issue they face. We are committed to assisting our veterans and active military members.
In July, the House passed a defense bill to give troops the largest pay raise in nine years while also providing newer and safer military equipment. This legislation invests almost $250 million in military construction at North Carolina bases like Cherry Point, Camp Lejeune and Fort Bragg, to assist the brave efforts of soldiers like Shurer.
We thank all members of the military for their sacrifice and service.

Dear Friends, 
I had a special guest and good friend of mine in town this week, UK Member of Parliament, Rehman Chishti, who represents Gillingham and Rainham in the United Kingdom. We met last year through the State Department's British American Parliamentary Group (BAPG) exchange program, where a Member of Congress and a Member of Parliament are paired together to collaborate and visit the area each other represents.   The United States has a special relationship with the United Kingdom, and by partnering and sharing ideas, we can better strengthen our friendship as we work together on bilateral trade, education, and other important issues.  We had a productive week traveling around central Arkansas, meeting with veterans, students, firefighters, and more. Here are some of the highlights. 
￼

Hearing from White County’s Heroes 
￼
I held the 20th meeting of my Veterans Advisory Council in Beebe on Wednesday. It was an honor to visit with the men and women of White County who have served our country and talk with them about their needs and how my office can help them access the benefits they've rightfully earned.

Spending Time with Bright Arkansas Students 
￼
Since coming to Congress, I have made it a priority to visit schools across central Arkansas to talk with students about their future plans and share important lessons I've learned in the public and private sector. On Thursday, MP Chishti and I visited with students at Episcopal Collegiate School, Immaculate Conception Catholic School, and North Little Rock High School's European History class. We kicked off the visits with the 8th grade class from Immaculate Conception singing happy birthday to MP Chishti. I left these visits confident that the next generation of leaders will continue to lead this country in the right direction.

Honoring Fairfield Bay's Patrolman Fultz 
￼
Patrolman Lyle Fultz with the Fairfield Bay Fire Department is a true hero! He placed his life on the line to save a resident of Fairfield Bay by answering at a residence. When he heard a cry for help, he discovered an older gentleman was trapped inside the residence on fire. Patrolman Fultz entered the smoke-filled building and rescued the older gentleman and pulled him to safety. It was great to join Fairfield Bay Mayor Paul Wellenberger in congratulating him! 
What an honor to witness Patrolman Fultz receiving the well-deserved Regional Officer of the Year Award for the Northwest Region at the Law Enforcement Summit hosted by Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge.
Advocating for Long-term Health of Buffalo National River 
￼
Algae growth has plagued our nation’s first national river and one of Arkansas’s most prized rivers, Arkansas’s Buffalo National River, which is why Congressman Womack (R-AR) and I sent a letter to the National Park Service this week, advocating for its long-term health. Not only is the Buffalo National River the ultimate icon of the Natural State, it is an essential economic engine for the Ozark region. I am committed to taking additional action to ensure the Buffalo National River is protected and preserved for future generations.

Keeping Our Neighborhoods Safe
￼
I visited with the Fairfield Bay Fire Department that was awarded $150,000 from FEMA through the Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program. I supported their grant application and am excited they were awarded with these critical funds. I am thankful for the men and women of Fairfield Bay who risk their lives to protect their neighbors. With the new breathing apparatus, they'll be able to better perform their job while keeping them safer from the hazards they face daily.

Seeing the New Fairfield Bay Hotel and ""Tiny Homes"" Project 
￼
I enjoyed being in Fairfield Bay, touring the site of the new hotel and the new ""Tiny Homes"" project - both of which will support economic growth of the town and increase tourism. The progress on these two projects is a great testament to the strong leadership of Fairfield Bay Mayor Paul Wellenberger, Van Buren County Judge Roger Hooper, and the tight-knit Fairfield Bay committee that has worked tirelessly to ensure its long-term success.

Thank you for taking time to keep up with the work I'm doing on your behalf. If I can be any assistance to you or your family, please reach out to my office at (501) 324-5941 or Hill.House.Gov.

Working to reinstate safer oil-by-rail standards
The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) finalized a proposal to revoke an important safety requirement for trains carrying oil and other hazardous material last week. That was the wrong decision. With trains already carrying oil through the Columbia River Gorge, we should be working to reduce the chance of an incident – but this action goes in the opposite direction. 

While I understand there are costs associated with this requirement, safety must remain paramount when it comes to transporting hazardous materials through our communities which is why I am currently developing legislation to reinstate the stronger safety requirement. 

I have consistently supported enhanced safety measures for crude-by-rail, including championing the Fire Department Proper Response and Equipment Prioritization Act (FD PREP Act) which directs FEMA to make grants that give firefighters the tools and training to respond to derailments of trains carrying crude oil a high priority. She also successfully fought to include $221 million for federal rail safety operations to improve the safety of grade crossings and the movement of crude oil in the funding package that passed earlier this year. 

You can read more about this important issue here. 

ASSISTING SOUTHWEST WASHINGTON RESIDENTS

Ms. Joyce Eastwick of Underwood reached out to our office because she had been waiting on her retirement orders from the Department of Navy, without which, she could not receive payments or medical benefits. 

After our office reached out to the Navy and got them all the necessary information, a retroactive paycheck was sent to Ms. Eastwick within a week. Additionally, the Navy sent Ms. Eastwick her long-awaited retirement orders, with information on how to obtain a retired ID card and sign up for Tricare. Ms. Eastwick is now receiving regular retirement payments.

October 7, 2018   Dear  @gmail.com,  I was pleased to hear that yesterday afternoon Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate and sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts as the 114th Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.  
I believe Justice Kavanaugh is the right man for a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land. As a federal judge for more than a decade he based his judicial opinions on the original meaning of the Constitution, and he has shown in more than 300 decisions that he will defend our system of federalism, checks and balances, and separation of powers.  
While I did not have a say in his confirmation process as a member of the House of Representatives, I commend Senate Republican leaders for their tireless efforts to fill not just two Supreme Court vacancies this session of Congress but an impressive number of other judicial vacancies as well. 
In fact, while the Senate confirmed 55 of President Obama's appeals court appointments in eight years, they have already confirmed 26 appeals court judges nominated by President Trump. This will have an impact on the federal judiciary for decades to come.  
Thank you for reading.

 Kavanaugh Confirmed



On Saturday, the Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.
Despite Democrats’ search and destroy tactics, Justice Kavanaugh proved over and over he will serve on our nation’s highest court with distinction.
He has proven throughout his career that he has the experience, the temperament, and the impartiality this role requires, and I look forward to seeing him on the Court.

From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:
Good Afternoon,
This week in Congress, I joined Congresswoman Karen Bass in the introduction of the bipartisan H.R. 7012, Supporting Kinship Connections Act.
￼
Ensuring Success for Foster Youth
Every child deserves to grow up in a healthy, safe, and loving home. H.R. 7012 would amend the Social Security Act to provide grants to develop and enhance or evaluate kinship navigator programs. Kinship navigator programs assist grandparents and other relatives who take primary responsibility for the care of children who need safe and stable placement. This legislation will help caregivers in finding and utilizing programs and services to meet their own needs and the needs of the children they are raising.
US Reaches Trilateral Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada
￼
The Trump Administration announced that the United States, Mexico, and Canada concluded negotiations for a modernized trade agreement, known as USMCA. Prior to USMCA, the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) had not seen any major changes to its structure in 25 years. By making good on a pledge to renegotiate NAFTA, the Trump administration, led by Ambassador Lighthizer, has ensured that our trading partners will be held to the same standards as the United States. It has also ensured those that the manufacturers, farmers, and other industries in our country can count on a fair platform with which they can trade on. I look forward to reviewing USMCA, especially regarding its impact on dairy farmers.
US Employment Rate Falls to 50-Year Low
In September, the US economy added 134,000 jobs and the unemployment rate fell to 3.7% -- the lowest level since 1969. This good news is a result of a conservative initiative to improve the tax code and promote pro-growth policies that will ensure all Americans continue to reap the benefits of a booming economy. I will continue to advocate for policies that improve the economic well-being of the constituents of PA-10.
Celebrating American Manufacturers 
On Friday, I had the pleasure of visiting Videon for National Manufacturing Day. While touring their facility in State College, I learned a great deal about Videon’s work in developing solutions for consumer electronics. American manufacturers are the backbone of our economy and it is companies like Videon that drive American production and innovation. Thank you to all who stand behind the goods and services made in America.
FTC and DOJ Return a Record $505 Million to Consumers Harmed by Massive Payday Lending Scheme
It has come to my attention that some constituents in PA-10 have received checks from the Federal Trade Commission and are concerned about its legitimacy. After speaking with the FTC, they confirmed that over one million refund checks have been sent to those affected by a payday lending scheme operated by AMG Services.
For more information about the FTC’s case, click here or call 1-866-730-8147

News from Representative Bradley Byrne
  
￼
ABOUT BRADLEY | HOW CAN I HELP | CONTACT BRADLEY | WANT TO RECEIVE MY UPDATES?
￼

Dear Lindsey, 
The circus is over, and a good man will be joining the Supreme Court. The Senate has made the right choice for our country. Judge Kavanaugh has a clear record as a thoughtful jurist who respects, understands, and will defend our Constitution. Those who have worked with him over the years and know him best strongly defend his record as a good man who loves his family and our country. I applaud the Senators who helped support the nomination, including Alabama Senator Richard Shelby. This ridiculous spectacle is now over, and our nation will be better off with Judge Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court.
Our Booming Economy 
￼ 
On Friday, we received even more exciting news about our ever growing economy! The Department of Labor issued last month's jobs report which showed the lowest unemployment rate since 1969. This shows that the “resistance” can’t stop our conservative, pro-growth policies from working. We aren't stopping here, though. I promise to continue working to advance policies that grow the American economy and create good-paying jobs right here in Alabama. 
Around the District 
￼ 
I kicked off the October District Work Period this week by spending time catching up with folks in Southwest Alabama and letting people know what I’ve been up to in Washington. On Thursday, I had the opportunity to speak to students at the Alabama School of Math and Science in Mobile. We discussed the continued importance of STEM education to our ever evolving workforce. We are fortunate to have such a high quality school in the heart of Southwest Alabama. Also on Thursday, I joined Sean Sullivan live on FM Talk 106.5 for an update on everything from defense funding to the Kavanaugh confirmation. Click here to listen to the interview! I look forward to spending more time around Southwest Alabama over the next few weeks. 
Keeping our Children Safe 
I am very pleased to report that the City of Mobile, the Alabama State Law Enforcement Agency, and the Alabama State Department of Education have all received $1.6 million in grants from the Department of Justice to support school safety throughout Southwest Alabama. I was proud to support increased funding for school safety grants earlier this year, and I am thrilled to see that Alabama will benefit from the funds. With these grants, state and local officials will have more resources for school safety training, mental health training programs, and school violence prevention. I appreciate the Trump Administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions for their help in securing this critical funding for our region.
A 21st Century Workforce 
￼ 
On Monday, I led 83 of my House colleagues in sending a bipartisan letter to Department of Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta calling for the modernization of the joint employer standard under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The current FLSA regulations were written roughly 70 years ago in 1958 and 1961 using language from bulletins dated 1939 and 1940. The FLSA’s joint employment requirements need to be modernized to limit needless lawsuits against small businesses. We must continue to advocate for greater protections for Main Street America and make sure our workforce is brought into the 21st Century.

On Friday afternoon, members of my staff in D.C. helped welcome Alabama veterans to our nation’s capital as part of an Honor Flight. Thank you to these proud veterans and all those who have served! I also want to share my deep appreciation with all the sponsors and those who helped make this special trip possible.
What’s Ahead 
I’m back in Southwest Alabama until early November, so there will be a lot of opportunities for you to come out and hear what we’ve been doing here in Washington this year and what work there is still to be done. Next week, I’ll be doing an interview Tuesday night with Armed Alabama Radio to give an update on our ongoing efforts to protect the Second Amendment, and I will also be talking with the Semmes Chamber of Commerce to discuss advancements we’ve been working on for small businesses here in Southwest Alabama. To keep up with my schedule and for more information on the work I’m doing in Washington for you, make sure to follow me on Facebook and Twitter!

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend,

Today, Governor Scott will declare a state of emergency for the Florida Panhandle as we continue to monitor Tropical Storm Michael. As this storm continues to move towards Florida, the National Weather Service (NWS) suggests taking the following steps in preparation:

1. Prepare a hurricane emergency kit with water, food, flashlights, batteries, a first aid kit, and more. 
2. Create and review your family emergency plan – where you will go in the event of an emergency, how you will stay in contact with each other, and more.
3. Stay up to date on the weather and understand the meanings of the National Weather Service’s watches and warnings.

Click here for more information. 

This week, I spent time traveling the Second District, worked with a bipartisan coalition of members of Congress to improve school safety, and addressed a growing problem facing our veterans.

￼ 
On Tuesday, I visited with the Tallahassee Kiwanis Club. I was able to give an update on the work I am doing in Washington and answer questions. We discussed the improving economy and addressed what Congress can do to continue spurring job growth. Just this week we learned that September was a record month for raises and jobless claims dropped to a 49-year-low. 

Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh 
On Saturday, the United States Senate voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh as our newest Supreme Court Justice. It was a great day for the Constitution and Rule of Law in the United States. Americans spoke loud and clear with the election of President Trump and he has kept his promise to nominate constitutional conservatives with outstanding judicial records to the Supreme Court.

Thank you to President Trump and the United States Senate for remaining resolute and just in your support of Judge Kavanaugh. Congratulations to our newest Associate Justice of the Supreme Court – Judge Brett Kavanaugh.

Fighting For Our Veterans 
On Monday, USA Today published a troubling article detailing the mass cancellations of more than 250,000 radiology orders at VA hospitals across the country. Over the last decade, the VA has dealt with scandal after scandal as we witnessed veterans dying on long waiting lists and being denied the care they have earned. These actions are completely unacceptable. As the Inspector General carries out his investigation, I will be working with the VA and my colleagues in Congress to address these issues. While our local VA hospitals in North Florida are not included in this investigation, I have already instructed my staff to look into whether these are systemic issues that plague veterans in the Second Congressional District of Florida. I am committed to addressing these issues to ensure that our veterans are receiving timely and quality care.
Click here to read the USA Today article. 

Improving School Safety
This week, I joined Senator Marco Rubio and a bipartisan coalition of members of the House and Senate in urging Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to create a central authority to help school districts seeking to improve safety features within new and existing schools. The letter urges Secretary DeVos “to ensure tight coordination and collaboration of effort among all federal agencies that are working on different aspects of school safety in order to eliminate duplication, redundancy, and waste of valuable resources.”  We are taking concrete steps in Congress to improve school safety through increased funding for mental health, collaboration with law enforcement, and training students and educators on how to identify and prevent future acts of violence.

Marco Rubio Leads Group Of Lawmakers Asking Betsy DeVos For Help With School Safety 

   Constituent Casework Corner  After being prescribed the same medications for over a decade, a veteran could not understand why all of a sudden the Department of Veterans Affairs was not shipping his medications to him in a timely manner. For several months, the veteran would spend hours on the phone to get the prescriptions mailed, however, this month they never came. After contacting my office, we were able to work with the Department of Veterans Affairs to have the veteran’s prescriptions mailed overnight. Along with an apology, the veteran was given the direct contact information of who he can immediately contact in the future if this ever happens again.

Statement on Judge Brett Kavanaugh
I will be voting to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States. His sterling academic credentials and outstanding legal record, which includes 12 years of exemplary service as a judge on the second highest court in the nation, make him exceptionally well qualified to serve as the Supreme Court's next Associate Justice.
Judge Kavanaugh's long career of public service displays a remarkable fidelity to the Constitution and understanding of the proper role of a judge. He is an impartial jurist who treats everyone fairly and decides cases neutrally on the basis of the law and not a preferred policy or outcome. Further, Judge Kavanaugh understands that changes to the law must be made by the American people, acting through the democratic process, and not by unelected judges. His record gives me great confidence that he will discharge his duties on the Supreme Court intelligently and faithfully.
I have long held that when considering judicial nominees, objective qualifications are more important than partisan politics. For example, although I knew I would disagree with many decisions made by then-Judge Sonia Sotomayor, her intellect, experience, and integrity clearly qualified her for the Supreme Court so I supported her nomination by President Obama. Unfortunately, during Judge Kavanaugh's nomination process, some abandoned this sensible standard. Today, the worst possible claims about a nominee are considered disqualifying by some, despite the absence of any corroborating evidence, because they disagree with the nominee's judicial philosophy.
Sexual assault is a terrible crime that is sadly far too prevalent in our society. We need to take seriously allegations of sexual assault, while at the same time providing due process to those who are accused of misconduct.
As this confirmation process concludes, my sincere hope is that all of my colleagues will seek to do the important work of restoring trust and civility in politics. The advice and consent role of the Senate for nominees would be a good place to start.
￼
￼
The Proposed New NAFTA
This week, the White House announced an agreement between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
There were concerns that Canada would not join this agreement, so their inclusion is a constructive development. Converting NAFTA to a bilateral agreement just between the U.S. and Mexico was always a nonstarter in Congress and would have dramatically undermined the benefits from our current, longstanding continent-wide free trade zone.
While this proposal improves some elements of the existing NAFTA, such as strengthened IP rights, increased market access for U.S. dairy processors, and a new chapter on digital trade, other provisions diminish NAFTA's economic benefits and create needless uncertainty.
Specifically, I am concerned about the proposal's new expiration date; weakening of protections for U.S. investors; new arbitrary wage mandates on auto imports; side deals establishing quotas on automobile and automobile parts imported from Mexico and Canada; and a failure to eliminate section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum.
I will closely review the text of this proposal to see whether the proposed changes, on balance, enhance or weaken the enormous economic benefit we have derived from the original agreement. I also plan to work closely with my colleagues to explore how we may correct some of the agreement's flaws through the required implementing legislation.
￼
￼
An Important Step in the Fight Against the Opioid Epidemic
Congress took another important step forward in fighting the horrendous opioid crisis by overwhelmingly approving the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act.
This legislation, which includes four provisions I authored or coauthored, provides significant assistance to aid treatment, prevention, and law enforcement.
Notably, one provision I wrote plugs a glaring hole in the Medicare program by ensuring doctors are actually notified if their patient has previously overdosed before writing them another opioid prescription.
Click here for more details about the provisions I added to this important legislation. It now heads to the president for his signature.
In an effort to aid local communities battling this epidemic, the U.S. Department of Justice awarded two federal grants to Beaver and Carbon Counties to support efforts to provide alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent offenders of drug-related crimes. Programs that offer treatment to nonviolent offenders can help mitigate the social cost of this epidemic and address the underlying problem of addiction. With a crisis of this magnitude, I'm pleased to have supported these federal grants.
￼
￼
Honoring the 'Lost 74'
On June 3, 1969, the USS Frank E. Evans collided with the Australian aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne during a training exercise. As a result of the collision, 74 American sailors were killed. Since the sailors perished outside of the designated Vietnam War combat zone, their names were never added to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
This week, I introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) directing the Secretary of Defense to add the names of those brave sailors to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
For too many years, these 'Lost 74' have been denied the honor given to service members who lost their lives during the Vietnam War. It is long overdue that we recognize their sacrifice. I hope my Senate colleagues will move swiftly to approve this measure.
￼
￼
Reauthorizing the FAA
This week, the Senate approved a five-year reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Included in the legislation is my bipartisan proposal to protect the traveling public from a terrorist who rushes the cockpit by requiring new commercial aircraft to have a ‘secondary' barrier. This lightweight wire-mesh gate is installed between the passenger cabin and cockpit door. During times in flight when cockpit doors are opened, the secondary barrier can be locked into place, blocking access to the flight deck.
This crucial measure would never have passed Congress without the work of Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick, and most of all, the tireless efforts of Ellen Saracini, whose husband, Victor, was the captain of United Flight 175 when it crashed into the south tower of the World Trade Center.

Meet Richard | How Can I Help You? | Issues | Media Center | Contact Me





Friends, 
 
We’ve all heard the phrase, “Bad news travels fast.” That seems like the case these days. In fact, a reporter once told me the news doesn’t report on planes landing. I guess no one would read a story with the headline, “Plane Successfully Lands at Charlotte Douglas.” 
 
That’s why I’m very happy to see folks here in North Carolina report on good news that really matters.
 
Last week, WSOC-TV Channel 9’s headline read, “Senate sends President Trump bipartisan opioids bill.” This comprehensive, bipartisan package will help get to the root of the opioids epidemic that’s ravaging communities across the country, including many right here in North Carolina. The package includes three of my bipartisan bills to help get unused opioids out of medicine cabinets and off the streets. While this might seem minor at first glance, it’s a huge issue – did you know over 70% of heroin addictions begin in the medicine cabinet? And that as many as 92% of patients don’t use their full opioid prescription? Making sure we safely dispose of opioids before they fall into the wrong hands is a critical step in solving this national problem.
 
As your voice in Congress, I’ve worked to combat the opioid crisis for years, and I’m proud to be a leader on this front. My bipartisan legislation has been applauded as one of “the most important opioid bills in the House” and legislation that “could make a more serious difference.” This isn’t a partisan issue – it’s an American one, and I’ll continue to work with my colleagues, President Trump and local leaders to stop the deadly cycle of opioid addiction.
 
In the Fayetteville Observer, another headline last week read, “Trump signs spending plan, avoiding government shutdown.” Representing Fort Bragg, the epicenter of the universe, I was proud to not only support this critical funding bill, but also to have my amendment included to provide more training for our Special Forces. Overall, this bill provides $17 billion to our military to increase training for our troops and improve warfighter preparedness. And it gives out troops a well-deserved 2.6% pay raise – this is in addition to another pay raise last year.
 
The Charlotte Business Journal also reported, “Ivanka Trump talks higher education, workforce pipeline during Mooresville visit.” As Senior White House Advisor, Ivanka joined Congressman Ted Budd and me at the NASCAR Technical Institute to discuss job training. As a former trustee of Rowan-Cabarrus Community College, I know these programs are some of the best avenues we have to train workers for jobs in high-demand fields that would otherwise go unfilled. That’s exactly why I’ve made this a top priority and worked with the Trump Administration to transform our career and technical education system. We’ve made incredible progress – especially with the recent signing of the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (H.R. 2353). I will continue to work to close the skills gap and help equip workers with the tools they need to get good jobs.
 
Last, but not least, the News & Observer reported last week, “Washington sends $1.7 billion to the Carolinas in Hurricane Florence aid.” Getting responsible disaster relief funding was truly a bipartisan effort. This is just the first installment to help families in North Carolina rebuild and I’m glad to see this bill head to President Trump’s desk to be signed into law.
 
You see, if you look closely, there is a lot of good news out there. We’ve taken major bipartisan steps on issues that impact our daily lives, and we’ll continue to do so through the end of this year and beyond.
 
 
Until next week,

Kavanaugh Confirmed to Supreme Court
This week, the Senate confirmed Justice Brett Kavanaugh to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The Senate’s constitutional responsibility is to provide advice and consent to the President on his nominee, and the Senate fulfilled that responsibility.
Democrats made it clear they would stop at nothing to block President Trump’s Supreme Court pick before Justice Kavanaugh was even chosen as the nominee. Despite these attempts, Justice Kavanaugh has proven himself to be a fair, impartial and qualified jurist, who will continue his distinguished record of service for years to come.
His qualifications speak for themselves. He is a Yale undergraduate and law school graduate, a Harvard Law School professor, and has been a Judge on the District of Columbia’s Circuit Court of Appeal for the last 12 years. As a judge, he decided more than 300 cases, with 10 opinions adopted by the Supreme Court. Justice Kavanaugh is as qualified as they come, and I look forward to his years of continued service to our country on the Supreme Court of the United States.

Trade, Tax Reform Fix
Congressman Warren Davidson has been working in Ohio since Congress is not in Session. 
On Monday, President Trump introduced a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada. Davidson said he looks forward to reviewing the new agreement to see how it might impact Ohio families and American companies. He said he’s happy Canada is part of the agreement, but that as long as tariffs are included, the agreement is far from completed. The new trade agreement is subject to approval by Congress.
On Tuesday, Davidson and Congresswoman Martha McSally (AZ-02) led a group of 56 lawmakers in a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan and Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, urging them to bring legislation to the House floor to fix the ""retail glitch."" Fixing this issue will let restaurants and retailers on Main Street take full advantage of the expensing provisions in the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. Read the press release here. 
On Wednesday, Davidson was invited to share his viewpoints about the latest trade deal with Mexico and Canada on Fox Business News with Melissa Francis. Watch the full interview below.  
On Saturday, Davidson congratulated Justice Brett Kavanaugh on his confirmation to the Supreme Court.

More Good News



Since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we’ve seen consumer confidence go up, small business optimism rise, unemployment at record lows, and millions of job openings. A recent study shows that wage growth has hit a 17 month high and they are going to continue to grow. This month's Department of Labor job report once again brought great news for our economy. This time they reported that unemployment is at the lowest rate it has been since 1969. Click here to learn more about how tax reform is helping improve lives right here in North Carolina and all across the country.

Appealing For Disaster Relief for May's Severe Storms in NC-10



In May, severe storms, flooding, and landslides caused significant damage that our Tenth District neighbors are still recovering from. Below are the images from when I visited some of the areas impacted by these storms back in May. This past week, I joined with my colleagues Senator Richard Burr and Senator Thom Tillis, to send a letter to FEMA Administrator Brock Long regarding Governor Cooper’s appeal for a major disaster declaration. If this appeal is granted, it would make it easier for those impacted to receive the help and assistance they need to recover from these deadly storms. Click here to read the full letter.

Ending the Opioid Crisis



The opioid crisis has caused pain and suffering in communities all across the country including here in western North Carolina. Last week, the House voted on a bipartisan, bicameral bill that addresses all sides of this devastating crisis from addiction prevention to providing resources for law enforcement and families as they combat this crisis in their communities and in their own homes. Click here to read my statement on last week's passage. This week, the Senate voted to send this important bill to the President's desk and President Trump released a statement highlighting the significance of this bill in ending opioid addiction. Click here to read President Trump's statement on the SUPPORT Act. Learn more about what else the House has done to combat the opioid crisis—courtesy of the House Energy and Commerce Committee—by clicking here.

What I Have Been Reading



'Bravest officer I've known': South Carolina officer killed was 30-year veteran of the force

WCNC 

Our law enforcement officers put their lives on the line to keep our communities safe. We were reminded of the sacrifices they make this week in South Carolina. Please join me in praying for the Florence County Sheriff's Office, the Florence Police Department, and the families of Officer Terrence Carraway and the others wounded in this tragedy. 


Canada, US confirm new deal with Mexico updating NAFTA

Fox Business 

When running for President, Donald Trump committed to renegotiating our trade deals so that they actually benefit American consumers and workers. With this week's announcement of the United States Mexico Canada Agreement on Trade, President Trump has followed through on that promise. I’m confident the USMCA will correct the errors of NAFTA and truly work for the people and industries here in western North Carolina.

On Friday, we celebrated the innovators, the entrepreneurs, and the workers that make manufacturing such a vital part of our communities. Gaston County joined in the celebrations with tours of the local manufacturers and by honoring the over 20,000 people employed by the manufacturing industry in the region.

South Carolina Strong 
 
 
Wednesday night's shooting in Florence was devastating. The day after the shooting, we headed to Florence to show our support for everyone impacted by this senseless tragedy. It was one of the most heart wrenching days I've experienced as your Congressman. We visited injured officers in the hospital and prayed with their families for strength, healing, and comfort. We also joined hundreds of people at a vigil honoring Sergeant Terrence Carraway. Words cannot describe our emotions as the community remembered this father, husband, officer, mentor and friend. I'm incredibly thankful for the outpouring of support and love as our community heals together. We are South Carolina strong.

Florence Relief Updates 
 
 
All eight counties in the Seventh District- Chesterfield, Darlington, Dillon, Florence, Horry, Georgetown, Marion, and Marlboro- have been granted Individual Assistance and Public Assistance from FEMA. You can register with FEMA by applying online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov or by phone at 1-800-621-3362.  By registering with FEMA, you may qualify for federal disaster assistance such as help paying for rent or a temporary place to live as well as financial awards for essential home repairs or other disaster related needs not covered by insurance. If you have a homeowner's or flood insurance policy, file your insurance claim immediately before applying for disaster assistance. 

Additionally, President Trump signed the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 into law on Friday. This legislation includes $1.68 billion in Community Disaster Block Grant – Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funding for Hurricane Florence Recovery that I led my colleagues in requesting. I will work to ensure this initial down payment is followed by a comprehensive funding package to address the long-term recovery and resiliency needs of those impacted by the storm.
 

 
Disaster Recovery Centers Open
 
 
Disaster Recovery Centers and Business Recovery Centers are open across the Seventh District. At these centers recovery specialists from FEMA, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), and state agencies will be available to help you fill out your disaster relief applications and assist you with finding recovery resources.

Lowest Unemployment Rate Since 1969 
 
 
September's job report showed sustained economic growth and a strong labor market fueled by pro-growth tax cuts and regulatory reform. The unemployment rate fell to 3.7% and 134,000 jobs were created. When we say that our economy hasn't been this strong in decades, we aren't exaggerating. Do you know the last time the unemployment rate was this low? 1969 - the same year that Neil Armstrong walked on the moon and the same year that “Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye"" was the number one song in the country. With last week's vote on Tax Reform 2.0, we are committed to locking in the benefits of tax cuts for families and businesses in South Carolina and across the country!

Applauding Trump on NAFTA Deal

I applaud President Trump for delivering on his campaign promise to strike a new deal with Mexico and Canada – a feat many claimed impossible. The 36th Congressional District is a hub of international trade and is the second largest exporter in the State of Texas. Though I have long had concerns with certain provisions of NAFTA, with trade such a vital part of our economy, it is imperative any trade deal does not significantly disrupt existing economic sectors and fulfills the President’s promise to reform the deal in the best interests of working Americans.

Congress now must review and vote on USMCA, and I pledge to carefully evaluate this deal before the vote to ensure it is good for Texas and America. I also want to seize this opportunity to resolve the Loadmaster issue and ensure a fair resolution by PEMEX and the Mexican government. President Trump’s policies have spurred our economy to its best performance in decades, but we are not finished yet. I look forward to continue working with the President for the benefit of the people of Texas.

Updating the Woodville Rotary Club
On Wednesday, I was able to attend the weekly Rotary Club meeting in Woodville where I gave its members an update from Washington. We discussed the crucial need to secure our nation's borders and fix the broken immigration system that has let our country down for decades. The safety of American citizens must be put first as we continue our journey back to greatness. Now that our economy is flourishing and our military is being rebuilt to be stronger than ever before, I think we are well on our way!

In Case You Missed It
The House voted last week to make tax cuts permanent, a move an analysis from Congress' Joint Economic Committee says will provide the most benefit to low- and middle-income earners. I was proud to vote for this legislation to help Americans keep more of their hard-earned money on a lasting scale.

I met the winners of the 30th Annual Beauty Pageant Competition: (L to R) Young Miss Pasadena Rodeo Laela Salazar, Jr. Miss Pasadena Rodeo Ashlynn Cooper, Teen Miss Pasadena Rodeo Ariel Chamberlain, and Miss Pasadena Rodeo Bethany Mills. 
￼

A highlight was meeting World War II veteran Mario Saladino and his daughters Gena Saladino Dowell, Denise Saladino Michalak, and Carrie Saladino McBroom (all pictured above). My father also served in the second World War, and I am so thankful for the great men and women and their families who sacrificed so much to protect our freedoms.

NASA Celebrates 60 Years 
 This week, NASA celebrated their 60th Anniversary on October 1!

NASA’s historical achievements have inspired generations and positioned the United States as the undisputed leader in space, and I look forward to continuing my work in Congress to support and advance NASA’s mission.

The 7th Annual Washington A Man of Prayer Ceremony 
Washington A Man of Prayer is a ceremony that celebrates the inaugural of our first President, George Washington, and the first act of the First Congress.

On April 30, 1789, after being sworn in on the steps of Federal Hall in New York City, the new President, the Supreme Court, and Congress proceeded a few blocks to Saint Paul’s Chapel. This is the little chapel that miraculously survived unscathed during the 9/11 attacks, even though it is positioned between the Twin Towers.
￼
While in session, they offered dedicatory prayers for the new Republic in Divine Services.
￼
I, along with many of my House colleagues, had the opportunity to pray over the nation at this ceremony last week.

October 07, 2018 
Dear Friend, 
 
Before we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act last December, it had been over 30 years since our tax code was updated. Now, we’ve taken the first steps in making sure that won’t be the case again.
 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has already been transformative for the American economy, and we want to keep it that way. We’re seeing a surging job market, the lowest unemployment rate in years, and record optimism among small business owners. Now we’re building on these efforts and taking the next step with Tax Reform 2.0 to ensure that our economy continues to grow for years to come.
 
The House recently passed 3 pieces of legislation: the America Innovation Act, the Family Savings Act, and the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act. Together, these bills expand on the positive impact tax reform has already had on our economy by allowing new businesses and entrepreneurs to write off more of their initial start-up costs, simplifying retirement saving for families, and making permanent many of the tax-saving provisions that benefit North State families – such as doubling the standard deduction and the child tax credit. What about the lowered individual tax rates for low-income and middle-income families? Tax Reform 2.0 makes that permanent too. We’re delivering on the promise to enable hard-working families to keep more of the money that they earn – where they can decide how to spend it for themselves.
 
Thanks to tax reform, we’re watching the economy improve right before our eyes, and these most recent efforts will help ensure that it continues to improve.
 
Veterans
 
I had the opportunity of speaking during the opening ceremony for the first annual Plumas County Veterans Stand Down in Quincy, CA. The event was hosted by the Plumas County Veterans Collaboration and aimed to provide resources for local veterans, with 45 exhibitors on hand to provide information – including local, state, and federal agencies, nonprofits, medical professionals, barbers, and local businesses.
 
￼
Rep. Doug LaMalfa delivering a speech during the opening ceremony of the first annual Plumas County Veterans Stand Down.
 
The first district is home to many veterans, and the first annual Plumas County Veterans Stand Down is an effort to involve the community in providing them with the resources they need but may not be aware of. If you served in the military or are one who volunteers to support our veterans, functions like these help connect them with the services available, and I was honored to take part.
 
￼
Rep. LaMalfa Attended the Gold Star Family Luminary Initiative with the North Valley Blue Star Mothers. 
 
On Gold Star Mothers and Families Day, I was honored to join the North Valley Blue Star Mothers at Chico City Plaza to help honor service members we've lost while on active duty. The Gold Star Family Luminary Initiative was a wonderful event filled with prayer for our fallen soldiers and their families.
 
Oroville Dam
 
The President recently signed into law the Energy and Water appropriations bill, which included language that requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to conduct an independent inspection and review of the Oroville Dam facility. I pushed for an independent forensic investigation last year, and I strongly supported the inclusion of this language in the E&W appropriations package before voting to pass it in the House.
 
The language included in the bill states that:
 
“FERC shall require the licensee of Oroville Dam to request the United States Society on Dams to nominate independent consultants to prepare a level 2 risk analysis, consistent with the Commission's guidelines, for use in conducting the next Part 12 safety review of Oroville Dam, currently scheduled for 2019. FERC shall ensure the independence of the nominated consultants from the licensee.”
 
The previous forensic report raised many concerns with regards to the safety and design of the Oroville Dam, but I believe a completely independent investigation is required in which there are no current or former employees of DWR involved. That could be a conflict of interest, and ensuring that this process is thorough is absolutely necessary when it concerns the involvement of federal dollars and the safety of nearby residents.
 
Sincerely,
 
￼

THE SCALISE CAPITOL REPORT
Economy Keeps Booming!
This month's jobs report delivered more amazing news showing our Republican pro-growth policies are working. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.7 percent, the lowest since 1969, and more than 230,000 new jobs were added across the country. American families are able to keep more of their hard-earned dollars, and business growth is leading to more jobs and a growing economy. The positive results of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are clear. I hope the Senate will act soon on Tax Reform 2.0 so we can keep this growth going. 

Touring Local Schools with Sec. Betsy DeVos
Friday, I visited two outstanding New Orleans schools with Dept. of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. We visited the Edward Hynes Charter School and the New Orleans Military & Maritime Academy to see how we are providing top-notch education here in Louisiana. I enjoyed hearing from the teachers, students, and principals on just how much they love their school, the learning environment, and their plans for the future. 

￼
Cadets at NOMMA showed Sec. DeVos and I a project where they learned the physics of buoyancy.

￼
During my visit to Hynes Charter School, I sat down with social studies students as they worked on a Louisiana history project. 
Recovering from Hurricane Florence This week, I visited the districts of my colleagues Reps. David Rouzer and George Holding in North Carolina to see first-hand how Hurricane Florence impacted their state and how the state is recovering. Having weathered many strong storms ourselves in Southeast Louisiana, we know the many challenges families and individuals face once recovery begins. I was grateful to offer any help I can as North Carolina begins to rebuild.  
￼ Rep. Rouzer and I spoke with local volunteers on the recovery process. 
 
It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more information please visit my website, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook pages.

Friends,  From confirming our next Supreme Court justice and introducing legislation to boost West Virginia’s tourism economy to passing a landmark bill that addresses our nation’s opioid epidemic and another to improve air travel and our airports, the Senate had a very productive week.  Click here or the image below to learn more about a few of these accomplishments, and keep scrolling for additional updates from this week. 
￼ 
Confirming Our Next Supreme Court Justice  After a long confirmation process and careful consideration, I was proud to cast my vote to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh yesterday as our newest U.S. Supreme Court justice. 
￼ 
Click here or the image above to watch Senator Capito announce the final cloture vote count on the motion to proceed on Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation. 
Since President Trump announced his nomination, I’ve been consistently impressed with Judge Kavanaugh’s commitment to upholding the Constitution as written; respecting the rule of law; and being a good husband, father, and public servant. That’s why I was supportive of him throughout the confirmation process. Given all of the facts that were presented and the numerous conversations I had with Judge Kavanaugh myself, I am firm in my belief that President Trump made the right choice in nominating him, and yesterday’s vote was an important acknowledgment of that. Click here for my full statement and additional material related to Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation.

#DrugFreeWV Update  Earlier this week, the Senate voted to deliver historic opioid relief for West Virginia and the entire nation. The groundbreaking, comprehensive legislation we sent to President Trump’s desk this week will help deliver critical funding to states hit the hardest like West Virginia. It will also provide support for families, infants, children, and law enforcement, taking a real all-hands-on-deck approach to addressing both the causes and consequences of the drug crisis. Most importantly, it includes critical provisions—many of which I worked hard to secure in the final bill—that will help so many West Virginians struggling with the consequences of this devastating epidemic.  Prior to voting on this bill, I spoke on the Senate floor about West Virginia’s key role in shaping this legislation and the provisions included that are based on legislation I introduced or led as a co-sponsor. Click here or the image below to watch the full speech, and click here to read my full statement on this important legislation. 
￼ 
Improving Airports and Air Travel  This week, I was proud to vote for legislation I helped draft that reauthorizes the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for five years, the longest FAA reauthorization since 1982. Our West Virginia airports employ hundreds of people and bring millions in revenue into our state, and this legislation provides critical support for those airports. It also modernizes air travel to make it easier, safer, and more secure for West Virginians and Americans across the country. Additionally, the legislation will help improve customer experience, enhance efforts to combat human trafficking, and deliver supplemental funding to assist those affected by Hurricane Florence as they work to recover. Click here to read my full statement on the bill and learn more about how it will benefit West Virginians.   How Can We Help?  Whether you need help with a casework issue or have a question about scheduling a meeting at one of my offices, my staff and I are ready to assist you.

Breaking the Gridlock
Dear Friend:
I continue to work hard for our congressional district through October and I appreciate you letting me bring this brief update.  In the United States House of Representatives, there is simply too much power, in too few hands, with too little getting done for the American people and that is why I joined a bipartisan caucus call “Problem Solvers.” We are made up of an equal number of Republicans and Democrats who have come together to try to bridge the partisan divide in Washington, D.C.  “Breaking the Gridlock” is an opinion piece that I recently wrote about the reforms that are supported by our Problem Solvers caucus that, once implemented, will help the U.S. House of Representatives work in a more bipartisan basis to solve problems from immigration reform to health care reform-- both topics that have a strong bipartisan consensus but, under the current rules, never make it to the floor for a vote.   On Tuesday, I joined my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to introduce H.R. 7022, titled, “Homes for our Heroes Act.” This bill is designed to increase accountability and transparency at both the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) on how they operate a joint housing voucher program known as HUD-VASH to help homeless veterans.   After years of effort, a project using this program will soon begin construction to provide homeless veteran housing on the grounds of the Anschutz Medical Campus close to the new VA hospital.  On September 28th, the House unanimously passed H.R. 5791 and H.R. 5792, naming two U.S. Post Offices after law enforcement officers who were recently killed in the line of duty. The first U.S. Post Office is located at 9609 South University Boulevard in Highlands Ranch and is named after Douglas County Deputy Sheriff Zackari Spurlock Parrish, III and the second U.S. Post Office, located at 90 North 4thAvenue in Brighton, will be named after Adams County Deputy Sheriff Heath McDonald Gumm.   H.R. 5791 and H.R. 5792 are now on their way to the Senate and I will press to get these bills across the finish line before the end of the year. It is important that we never forget the ultimate sacrifices of both Deputy Parrish and Deputy Gumm.  As always, I invite you to stay in contact with me via my website, facebook or twitter account. It's an honor to represent you in Washington, D.C.
Sincerely, 
￼

October 7, 2018
Dear Friend,  
I had another busy week working on your behalf.  I was proud to help secure millions of dollars of your federal tax dollars to improve our community.  These funds were distributed last week.  Additionally, I visited local businesses, met with constituents and worked to advance legislative priorities.  Please be assured I will continue to do everything I can to make progress on the issues that are most important to you.  
Please continue reading for a brief recap of my efforts on your behalf last week! 
Facilitating Continued Economic Success 
A new analysis shows that the average increase in take home pay per household in my district will be over $18,000 over the next ten years.  This impact to my constituents is one of the main reasons I voted to make the tax cuts permanent last week.  I know you can really use this extra money in your pocket.  
￼ 
The same analysis shows that over 71,000 new jobs will be created in Florida over this same time period.  We are already seeing record low unemployment rates, and these newly created jobs will create more economic opportunity for my constituents.  
￼ 
Manufacturing is an important segment of our economy.  Last week, I had the opportunity to visit a local manufacturer, MasterCut Tools in Safety Harbor.  This small business has been operating locally for over 30 years and ships its endmills and burs all over the world. 
￼ 
The visit was perfect timing because last week we recognized National Manufacturing Day. Manufacturers across the country and across the street use this day as an opportunity to inspire and recruit the next generation of leaders within the industry.  As we celebrated the spirit of entrepreneurship and pride in products that are made in America, we remain mindful that sustained growth in this sector is only possible if we address the skills gap that exists in the workforce.  
￼  
While the national and state economy is still booming, some local business owners are experiencing significant hardship due to the recent red tide.  Low-interest Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) are now available to Florida small businesses, small agricultural cooperatives, small aquaculture businesses and private nonprofit organizations affected by the red tide algal bloom beginning Nov. 1, 2017.   Applicants may apply online using the Electronic Loan Application (ELA) via SBA’s secure website at DisasterLoan.sba.gov or calling 1-800-659-2955.    Additionally, due to the negative impact some are experiencing from Red Tide, I was pleased to support increased funding in our most recent appropriations bill that will assist with the clean-up and research into the causes and best treatment of this harmful bloom.  
Promoting Positive Health Outcomes 
After questioning senior officials from some of the largest drug distributors this past May about their lack of safeguards to prevent the sale of opioids to pharmacies that have a history of suspicious orders, I was pleased to support a provision in our recently passed opioid bill (Section 3271 of H.R. 6) that will improve data sharing between stakeholders and provide criminal and civil penalties if a distributor fails to report suspicious orders and keep accurate records.  We must hold those who exploit the suffering of others and are worsening this crisis  accountable for their corrupt behavior. 
I was also proud to fight for the $2 billion increase in funding for research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in our most recently adopted appropriations bill. As Moffitt Cancer Center leadership points out, these funds are critical for advancing important research that will save lives. 
Last week, the American College of Cardiologists recognized my ongoing efforts to improve health care outcomes for all patients as it honored me with the 2018 President’s Award for Distinguished Public Service. Among many public health initiatives I spearheaded, and for which I was selected to receive this prestigious award, is the Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act. This important legislation addresses the need to invest in continued research to assist the millions of Americans living with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD). This vital legislation passed the House in February of this year and awaits final action in the Senate. Better data leads to better research. This bi-partisan initiative is about giving hope to families who have suffered and improving the quality of life for millions of Americans by investing in life-saving research. I am honored to receive this prestigious award from such a prominent key stakeholder group, in part, because of my work on this legislation. I encourage my Senate colleagues to do the right thing on behalf of sick kids and join me in this fight by sending the bill to the President’s desk as quickly as possible. I also look forward to continuing to partner with the American College of Cardiologists on a variety of other important initiatives that will improve health care outcomes for millions of Americans.
￼ 
October is Breast Cancer Awareness month. As we celebrate the courage of all those who have survived their battle against this disease, we remember those who have been taken too soon. I remain hopeful at the promise of a cure and continue to fight for increased funding of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as its critical research will help us attain that goal.
￼ 
Strengthening our Community 
It was my pleasure to work with a bipartisan group to help secure an increase in funding for programs designed to secure affordable housing, supportive services and the redevelopment of communities across the nation. The Community Development Block Grant, Emergency Solutions Grant and HOME grant are vital initiatives that serve our most vulnerable populations. The local governments in my district have just been awarded approximately $19.4 million in federal funds to help achieve these important goals. Examples of projects and programs that have been funded locally through these initiatives are: Meals on Wheels, Homeless Navigation Centers, Domestic Violence Shelters and substantial neighborhood renovations. Each local government determines how best to maximize the federal dollars in order to meet the unique needs of its population. Pasco received approximately $4.0 million, Pinellas approximately $5 million and Hillsborough approximately $10.4 million.
￼ 
A special thanks to FCC Commissioner Carr for joining me at our top notch 911 call center in Pasco last week.  Sheriff Nocco, Administrator Biles and the entire Pasco emergency operations/first responder team do an excellent job.  It was great to showcase their effort.  As a member of the Subcommittee on Technology and Communications which has jurisdiction over the FCC, I appreciated the meaningful discussion on infrastructure security, emergency preparedness, seamless operation during challenging conditions, and continued funding of operations.  Thank you to all who are working to keep our community safe.  #Pascoproud 
Keeping Kids Safe 
Over $1.2 million in federal funding will be coming to Tampa Bay to improve school safety. Hillsborough and Pinellas counties will each get approximately $500,000. These funds are part of a $70 million grant program to bolster school security, educate and train students and faculty, and support law enforcement officers and first responders who arrive on the scene of a school violence incident. I co-sponsored the STOP School Violence Act, which authorized this new grant program as part of an effort to help students and teachers reduce exposure to risks, prevent acts of violence, and quickly recognize and respond to violent attacks. Earlier this year, I spoke directly to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions about these much-needed funds and my legislation, the PROTECT KIDS Act, which would authorize even more funding to help school districts hire more school resource officers. Additionally, I advocated directly to the Attorney General for Pasco to receive approximately $200,000 in funding to help enhance safety and improve crisis communication between stakeholders in the event of an emergency. These funds were also approved last week by the Department of Justice.  I was proud to join this bipartisan, bicameral initiative to ensure that all federal agencies are working together to keep our kids safe.

News from Representative Bucshon 
￼ 
MEET LARRY     CONTACT     SERVING YOU     MEDIA     LEGISLATION     INDIANA'S 8TH 
Fellow Hoosier,
September was a busy month both at home in Indiana and in Washington D.C. Here are some highlights of recent action in Washington and of my visits around the Eighth District. Meeting directly with Hoosiers to hear about the issues important to you helps me do my job in Congress!
Improving Our Infrastructure
Our water infrastructure is vital to the economic success and prosperity of our nation. This is especially true for Southwest Indiana which is bordered by two major rivers, the Wabash and Ohio Rivers. The America’s Water Infrastructure Act makes important investments that will set in motion improvements to our ports, inland waterways, locks, dams, flood protection, and other critical water infrastructure.
I supported the America’s Water Infrastructure Act (S.3021) which included my bill, the Promoting Hydropower Development at Existing Nonpowered Dams Act (H.R. 2872) when it passed the House by a unanimous voice vote.  

￼
The Promoting Hydropower Development at Existing Nonpowered Dams Act cuts through the red tape and instructs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to create an expedited permitting process that will result in a final decision on an application in two years or less. Hydropower provides benefits in the form of jobs, economic investment, improved public health, and resource conservation. It’s also a great source of American-made energy. In the Eighth Congressional district alone, there are six non-powered dams that could be modernized to produce clean energy. Video of my speech on the House floor supporting this legislation can be found here.
Walking to End Alzheimer’s
On September 17, I attended the 2018 Walk to end Alzheimer’s event in Terre Haute. In remarks to the crowd I highlighted my support for recent efforts to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health that will help support research to end this disease. It was encouraging to see the community come together for a great cause. 

￼
Service Academy Day
I hosted my 2018 Fall Academy Day on September 22 for young Hoosiers wanting to learn more about the United States Service Academies, the application process, congressional nominations, and the everyday life of a Service Academy Cadet from actual Academy representatives. An important part of my job is nominating qualified Hoosiers to attend our Service Academies so they can learn to become the leaders that will one day defend our freedom and run the greatest military on Earth.
Tax Cuts & Jobs Act Working For Hoosiers
Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and regulatory relief, job creators are investing more in hardworking Hoosiers. This is evident here in Evansville at The Home Depot where entry level hourly wages have been increased as a direct result of these policies. Thank you for showing me around your store and introducing me to a great group of Hoosiers. 

￼
Visiting Hoosier Healthcare Providers
I toured the Genoa Healthcare Pharmacy in Evansville. They are a leading example of patient centered care; from their discrete building for patient comfort, to hand loaded monthly peel pack medications that have led to a 96% medication adherence rate, they are leading the way. 

￼
Visiting Hoosier Researchers
I toured the Heeke Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, in Dubois County, a branch of the Purdue University Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. They perform testing for wide range of veterinary diseases, animal autopsies, bacterial cultures, and blood testing for important poultry diseases. They played a critical role in the avian flu outbreak in Dubois county. 

￼
Ensuring Access to Clean Water for Hoosiers
I visited Patoka Lake Regional Water and Sewer District, organized in 1975, that provides water or treats wastewater for eleven Southern Indiana counties, including the communities of Dubois, Celestine, Schnellville and St. Anthony. They serve over 31,000 households and over 100,000 people. 

￼
Meeting with Hoosier Farmers
I had the opportunity to participate in a #ShopTalk18 with the Indiana Corn Growers Association and Indiana Soybean Alliance in Washington, IN. Speaking with Hoosier farmers, I was able to discuss important agricultural issues such as trade and the Farm Bill. 
￼
USDA Rural Development Symposium
My office partnered with USDA Rural Development and other federal and state agencies to present a symposium on federal resources of importance to area counties and rural communities. My thanks to Gibson General Hospital for hosting this informative program in Princeton. 
￼
Fighting Poverty in Indiana
I met with the United Way of the Wabash Valley in Terre Haute. They presented information that was gathered from their ALICE program. Together local, state, and federal governments can come together to address generational poverty. Visit www.unitedwayalice.org/ to learn more. 

￼
Improving Health Outcomes for Hoosiers
I recently visited Valley Professional Community Health Center in Clinton, Indiana. They were the recipients of portions of a $400 million federal grant that is being used to expand their health center and addictions counseling. Thank you, Terry Warren, CEO, for showing me the plans for your new health center. 

￼
Meeting with Young Hoosiers
Talking with students is one of my favorite privileges as a Member of Congress. I want to thank Sullivan Middle School’s social studies and civics classes for having me speak. Their questions were thoughtful and engaging! Keep up the good work. 
￼
Keeping American Safe with Stronger Biodefense
An important part of ensuring our national security and protecting Americans in the 21st century is ensuring our nation is adequately prepared to prevent – and respond to – large-scale public health emergencies that arise from a disease outbreak, bioterror attack, or chemical incident. The Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act will bolster our emergency preparedness infrastructure by providing and improving the available resources to train health care professionals for possible pandemic outbreaks, continuing to develop our national stockpiles of vaccines and medical equipment, and establishing new advisory groups focused on protecting our highly vulnerable populations like senior citizens and those with disabilities.
I supported the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018 (H.R. 6378) when it passed the House by unanimous voice vote. 

￼
Working to Lower Prescription Drug Costs
When a person purchases medications at the pharmacy they probably don’t think that their insurance co-pay could actually end up costing more than simply paying cash for their prescription. Contracts between pharmacy benefit managers and the pharmacy can include a so-called gag clause that prevents the pharmacist from telling a patient that they may be able to pay a lower price if they don’t use their insurance. This is wrong, and Americans should be able to make an informed decision about the best way to pay for their medications.  The Patients Right to Know Drug Prices Act would ban the strangle-hold gag clauses in these contracts that prohibit pharmacists from informing patients of their payment options – using their health insurance or paying out of pocket – and take a small step forward in promoting greater price transparency that can help patients save money when purchasing prescription drugs.
I supported the Patients Right to Know Drug Prices Act (S.2554) when it passed the House by unanimous voice vote. 
￼
Supporting Hoosier Small Businesses
It was an honor to be awarded the NFIB Guardian of Small Business Award. I will continue to champion crucial issues for the success of small business like tax cuts and regulatory reform. 
￼
Funding America’s Military
One of the most important responsibilities the Constitution directly charges the federal government with is providing for our nation’s defense. This important funding builds on the work I have accomplished with my colleagues in the House over the last two years, to reverse the dangerous decline in military readiness due to chronic underfunding. Furthermore, it is the first time in a decade that Congress has sent the Defense Appropriations bill to the President’s desk prior to the start of the fiscal year. In fact, combined with funding for nuclear security activities and military construction funding provided in another appropriations bill that was just signed into law, this will mark the first time in twenty years that the Defense Department will have all of its activities funded prior to the start of the fiscal year, providing our nation’s military the certainty it needs to make decisions. This bill also invests in key health and workforce development programs to ensure America is competitive on the global scale.
I supported H.R. 6157 which would fully fund our military and other key programs when it passed the House and was sent to President Trump’s desk by a bipartisan vote of 361-61.
Meeting with the Indiana Chamber of Commerce
I met with constituents from the Indiana Chamber of Commerce. We discussed important legislative topics like trade and infrastructure reform that affect Hoosiers across the state. I will continue to champion these issues and work to promote a pro-business and pro-growth agenda in Congress. 
￼
Fighting the Opioid Epidemic
I voted for the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6) when it passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 396-14.
The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act will help our struggling communities to combat the opioid crisis by focusing on improving care for those who have opioid use disorder, and preventing opioid misuse and addiction. This comprehensive legislation, negotiated and agreed upon by both chambers in a bipartisan manner, will help states like Indiana combat the growing opioid epidemic. It will give hope to families and it will save lives.  Included within H.R. 6 is Section 2002,Comprehensive Screenings for Seniors, which is a revised version of the, Opioid Screening and Chronic Pain Management Alternatives for Seniors Act (H.R. 5798) that I introduced. This section will update the Welcome to Medicare Initial Assessment to require a physician to screen for opioid use, the potential for abuse, provide information on non-opioid alternatives, and to provide a referral if needed to a pain specialist physician or qualified non-physician practitioner. According to HHS OIG, in 2016, 1 in 3 Medicare Part D beneficiaries received a prescription opioid, and about 500,000 beneficiaries received high amounts of opioids.
As a physician, I believe it is vital to support initiatives that will help to prevent seniors from misusing or becoming addicted to opioids while managing their chronic pain. One of the ways to address the opioid crisis is to prevent Americans from becoming addicted in the first place. By screening seniors as they enter the Medicare system, we can use this milestone as an opportunity to address their concerns and manage their chronic pain while reducing risks associated with opioid use. As opioid use disorder continues to increase among older Americans, our seniors need to understand the risks of opioid use and discuss with their physicians the best course of treatment. 

￼
Tax Relief Bills for Hoosiers
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has had a tremendously positive impact on the American economy. Today, we have one of the most competitive tax codes in the world – wages have increased, the economy grew by more than 4% in the last quarter, and for the first time, there are more available jobs than there are people looking for work. Unfortunately, because Washington Democrats did not support the tax cuts, we must now pass additional legislation that will make the tax cuts for middle-class families and small businesses permanent. This is important because small businesses are the backbone of America and a strong middle-class means a strong, sustained America.
I supported multiple tax relief bills, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act (H.R. 6760), the Family Savings Act (H.R. 6757) and the American Innovation Act (H.R. 6756) when they passed the House on September 28. 

￼
Coffee with your Congressman
I held a Coffee with your Congressman event in Spencer on September 29. Thanks to everyone who stopped by. 
￼
Working with First Responders
I visited an infant and child safety event in Owen County (Spencer). The event included information from law enforcement on child safety and finding missing children, from EMS on proper infant sleep practices and from an Indiana Conservation officer on ATV safety. The information provided to parents was excellent!

Friends,
I hope you all enjoyed your week. Let's hope the Indians can turn things around tomorrow as the series shifts to Cleveland.
Great Lakes Economic Update
Protecting the Great Lakes is not a political issue, but a necessity. I have met with residents and local stakeholders - I know firsthand that the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) is a results oriented program that continues to drive Northeast Ohio's economy. 
A new report released by the Great Lakes Commission demonstrates that investing in the Great Lakes via the GLRI promotes economic growth and improves the quality of life for Northeast Ohioans. By cleaning up toxic hot spots, controlling invasive species, restoring wildlife habitat, protecting wetlands, and reducing the impact of harmful algal blooms, the GLRI returns more than 3-to-1 in additional economic benefits across the region. 
The regionwide impact of the GLRI continues to grow by leaps and bounds and I look forward to fighting hard with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue to preserve and protect our lakes by supporting this important program. 
￼
National Manufacturing Day 
Friday was National Manufacturing Day. Manufacturing is a key pillar of Northeast Ohio's economy, accounting for over $100 billion of Ohio's economic output and employing more than 12.5% of the Buckeye workforce. As Co-Chair of the Buy American Caucus, my priority is protecting and promoting manufacturing jobs in our great state. 
￼
In honor of National Manufacturing Day, I attended the 2018 Lake County Manufacturing Expo. What a great way for our students to learn about manufacturing opportunities in OH-14. Thank you to Alliance for Working Together Robobots, the City of Mentor, Mentor Public Schools, Willoughby Eastlake Schools, and Lake Shore Compact. 
￼
￼
Thank you to all of the hard-working manufacturers in OH-14!
2018 Wetland Conservation Achievement Award 
I was honored to receive the Ducks Unlimited 2018 Wetland Conservation Achievement Award Wednesday night in Novelty. Growing up in an active sporting home, I developed a passion for conservation that continues to this day. 
I will continue to advocate for wetland conservation programs like the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund and the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative in Congress. 
￼
Coffee with the Cops 
I was glad to spend my Wednesday morning with the Bainbridge Township Police Department discussing challenges facing local law enforcement and how we can work together to address these challenges. Thank you for welcoming me to your monthly ""Coffee with the Cops"" meeting. I appreciate all that the men and women in blue do to keep our communities in OH-14 safe. 
￼
￼
Guardian of Small Business
Thank you to the National Federation of Independent Businesses for recognizing me as a Guardian of Small Business!
From day one, small business job creation and economic growth have been top priorities of mine. Small businesses employ 2.2 million Ohioans, making up 46% of Ohio's workforce. I'll continue to champion legislation to help these Main Street businesses in OH-14 succeed.

TAX REFORM 2.0

Last week the House passed Tax Reform 2.0 with my support. Tax Reform 2.0 is a package of three bills to continue the momentum of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 

Thanks to tax reform and pro-growth policies, Georgians are better off now than they were under our old complicated and burdensome tax code. Our economy is booming, workers are receiving pay raises and bonuses and Americans are keeping more of their hard-earned money. Additionally, the unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent in September - the lowest rate since 1969. 

First, the House passed the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act which makes permanent the individual and small business tax cuts currently in the new tax law. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimates this move would create 1.5 million jobs and raise long run GDP by 2.2 percent. 

Next, Tax Reform 2.0 also includes the Family Savings Act. This bill bolsters the use of 529 education savings accounts, creates new Universal Savings Accounts to offer flexible savings tools for families, and allows families to access retirement accounts penalty-free when welcoming a new child into the family. 

Finally, the American Innovation Act will help brand new businesses write off more of their initial start up costs, remove barriers to growth and encourage new innovation. 

Tax reform is already working to help Americans from all walks of life achieve the American Dream and I will continue supporting policies to ensure this continues. 

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CLXXXII

Monday, October 1, 2018:  Yesterday, I traveled to Raleigh, NC, as I was honored to speak to members of the North Carolina Mutual Wholesale Drug Company (Mutual Drug) at their annual conference held at the Raleigh Convention Center.  Serving independent pharmacies in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, Mutual Drug is owned and managed by pharmacists.  Having the opportunity to bring this group of about 400 pharmacists up to date on issues pertaining to our profession was truly a pleasure.

Rep. Carter at the Midwife Group Women’s Health & Birth Center 
This morning I’m in Savannah as I have the chance to tour the Midwife Group Women’s Health & Birth Center and learn more about the great work they do here.  This state-licensed and nationally accredited facility has been in operation for over 30 years providing mothers with a safe and comfortable place to give birth and is the oldest free-standing midwifery practice in the State of Georgia. Believing that birth is a social event and a normal part of a woman’s life, the facility provides a comfortable birth setting that is “low-tech” but “high-touch.”  Afterwards, I head to my Savannah district office where I meet with my friend Bruce McCartney to discuss veteran issues.  Bruce, a veteran himself who served our country during the Vietnam War, is very active in the veteran community and stays up to date on veteran issues.  Next, I meet with representatives from Preferred Materials, a leading supplier of asphalt, concrete and paving services in the area as we discuss infrastructure initiatives in Washington.  Afterwards, I meet with Kathy Moore, who is a Registered Nurse and has a strong interest in the opioid epidemic, as we discuss the opioid legislation that we passed in Congress last week and that now awaits the President’s signature.  My next meeting is with Paula Kreissler with Healthy Savannah and Joel Smoker, CEO of the YMCA, as they bring me up to date on their strategies and activities.  After meeting with John Hauber to discuss law enforcement issues including defensive tactics to reduce use of force, I have a TV interview with WSAV in Savannah to discuss Gold Star Wives and the unfair compensation they are receiving from the Veterans Administration.  A link to my interview can be found here.

Tuesday, October 2, 2018:   I’m in Thunderbolt this morning as I have the privilege of meeting with retirees from local union 188.  Founded in 1899 by 27 plumbers and gas fitters, the union now also includes HVAC journeymen and apprentices. 
￼
Rep. Carter visiting Wassaw National Wildlife Refuge
After bringing the group up to date on Washington issues, I have the opportunity to answer their questions and hear their comments.  Next, I head to Skidaway Island where I board a boat with personnel from the US Fish and Wildlife Service and head to Wassaw National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), one of seven refuges under the jurisdiction of the Savannah Coastal Refuges Complex.  Wassaw Island NWR consists of 7,425 acres of wetland and 2,628 acres of upland area and was accepted by the federal government under Deed of Donation from The Nature Conservancy on October 20, 1969, for one dollar.  Upon arriving on the barrier island, we tour the US Fish and Wildlife facilities and then head out on a tour of the island that received approximately 12,000 visitors last year.  The natural, primitive beauty of the island, combined with the vast knowledge of the US Fish and Wildlife Service personnel, makes for a great visit as I learn about projects such as the Caretta Research group that reported approximately 8,000 Loggerhead sea turtle hatchlings and 153 nests by the closeout of the 2018 field season. 

Wednesday, October 3, 2018:  Three years ago, I visited Liberty Elementary School (LES) in Hinesville as they started their STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) program and this morning I am delighted to be back and attend the State STEM Certification Flag presentation ceremony signifying that they have completed this program. 
￼
Rep. Carter reading to students at Folkston Elementary School
Along with Georgia State School Superintendent Richard Woods, this special ceremony includes presentations from students and faculty as well as a check presentation from representatives from Coastal Electric Membership.  I am reminded that currently there are around 2,500 public schools in Georgia and only 60 are State STEM certified and only 2 elementary schools south of Macon are STEM certified - and one of them is LES!  Afterwards, I head to Woodbine in Camden County as I attend the Region 12 Georgia Municipal Association meeting held at City Hall and bring them up to date on Washington issues including 5G deployment. Next, I head to Folkston Elementary School in Charlton County where I have the opportunity to read to a great group of 1st and 2nd grade classes. Next, I head to Waycross in Ware County to meet with constituents before heading to Cogdell in Clinch County to meet with more constituents.

Thursday, October 4, 2018:  After heading to Savannah and meeting with local new car salesmen about issues specific to them, I head to the Chatham County Police Department Graduation/Promotion ceremony held at the National Museum of the Mighty Eighth Air Force in Pooler. 
￼
Rep. Carter at the Chatham County Police Department Graduation and Promotion Ceremony
Under the leadership of new Chief Jeff Hadley, this group of 15 graduates and 9 promotion candidates brings the force to a 95% staff level.  Next, I head to the Richmond Hill YMCA fun club in Bryan County where I read 3 books to the students, including Pete the Cat and Dr. Seuss.  Afterwards, I meet with a group of constituents from Bryan and Liberty counties to discuss issues important to them.

Friday, October 5, 2018:  I’m in downtown Savannah this morning as I have been invited to speak to the American Pilots Association at their annual international convention that is being held here this year.  Savannah’s maritime community, and especially its Pilots Association led by Captain Trey Thompson, is recognized as not only one of the best in the country but also in the world.  Next, I head to Waycross in Ware County where I meet with judicial and law enforcement personnel before heading back to Fleming in Liberty County where I participate in the annual “Clays for Clayton” clay shoot at the 17th South Rod and Gun Club to benefit CURE Childhood Cancer.  Afterwards, I head to the most impressive “Specialty Sports Complex” at Calvary Day School in Savannah where, along with Savannah Mayor Pro-tem Carol Bell, I am honored before the Calvary vs. Savannah Christian football game and I have the opportunity to perform the coin toss.  In what is one of the great high school rivalries in South Georgia, Savannah Christian prevails tonight in a nail biter, 24-21.

A Big Win for Our Dairy Farmers 
￼ 
I recently hosted a roundtable discussion for my freshman colleagues with United States Trade Representatives Robert Lighthizer to discuss our districts' priorities and what needs to be done to support American farmers and manufacturers. 
Great news! This week, President Trump announced his administration reached an agreement with Canada and Mexico that will update the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This new trade agreement, called USMCA, is a big win for our local dairy farmers.
Since President Trump took office, I've been working with his administration to ensure the priorities of Pennsylvania farmers are taken into consideration while negotiations were ongoing. I've spoken directly with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer about Canada's unfair trade practices that hurt dairy farmers in our district. 
The new trade agreement announced by President Trump makes it easier for American dairy farmers to sell their products in Canada. For years, Canada has been imposing tariffs as high as 300 percent on American dairy products -- but that would end with this new agreement.
This outstanding development of opening new markets that benefit our dairy farmers would not have happened without the input I received from constituents and farmers in our community. Together we've been able to shape trade policy that will help farms of all sizes in our district. You can learn more about this important development here.

You can use the interactive map above to see the many different schools, volunteer organizations, manufacturers, and small businesses I've visited since taking office. If you'd like to invite me to visit you or an organization, send me an invitation here. You can also schedule a meeting with me in one of my offices here. 
You can use the map here and by clicking on the image above. 
Since taking office, my staff and I have traveled more than 18,000 miles to meet with constituents. Between all my offices, I've hosted more than 500 meetings with constituents to hear about what's on their mind, and I've participated in 158 events with local businesses, schools, civic organizations, forums with constituents, or community resource centers. You can see all these events using the map. In fact, I've supported more than 65 bills in the House of Representatives directly because of these important meetings -- that's about 1/3 of all the legislation I've cosponsored since taking office.
I'm also extraordinarily proud of the casework my office has been able to complete for constituents. More than 1,800 cases have been completed, and $640,478 has been returned to constituents. The top four federal agencies with which you've requested help are the Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of States, and Department of Treasury.
If you need help with a federal agency, my office can often help to cut through some of Washington's red tape. I'd encourage you to contact my district office at (717) 393-0667 if I can help in any way. 
 
Tax Reform 2.0 
￼ 
House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers visited our district last year to discuss tax reform. We're pictured above at Star Rock Farms in Conestoga, Pa. 
Last week, the House of Representatives passed a series of bills, known as Tax Reform 2.0, that will further improve the federal tax code for American families, small businesses, and entrepreneurs.  
Since tax reform was implemented last year, I've been hearing from constituents about ways to build on that success. I heard that you want and deserve permanent tax relief so you can keep more of your own money for years to come. You should be able to save money more easily, and American innovators shouldn't be held back by outdated tax laws that stifle growth. 
Tax Reform 2.0 delivers these priorities for the American people. Last year's individual tax cuts are made permanent, new Universal Savings Accounts (USA) allow families to decide how to save and spend their money, and entrepreneurs will be able to write-off more start-up costs to make it easier to more from a home office to Main Street.
Our economy is humming. Updating our federal tax code has already resulted in lower unemployment rates, rising wages, a decline in poverty, and an increase in federal revenue. But I want as many people as possible to participate in, and benefit from, our recent economic gains. Tax Reform 2.0 continues to ensure more opportunity is available to more people. 
You can learn all the details of Tax Reform 2.0, including a breakdown of all the bills we passed, here. 
 
Fighting Reckless Government Spending, Demanding Accountability 
Congress recently passed a massive government spending bill with the clock running down towards a government shutdown. I voted against this legislation, and I want to share with you the reasons why.
Congress has been here too many times before - taking government funding down to the wire, spending way too much money, and refusing to make meaningful reforms. In fact, Congress has been in this situation 7 times since I took office in January of 2017. What's the point of having a legislative process if Congress can't take its job seriously and be good stewards of taxpayer dollars? I simply could not vote for more spending, especially with our backs against the wall.
I support several of the provisions included in the spending bill, like funding our military, stepping up our fight against the opioid epidemic, and improving school safety - and I've taken numerous votes to advance each of those priorities. But we can and should do those things in a fiscally responsible manner because that's exactly what the taxpayers expect. This legislation feeds Washington's addiction to spending instead of curbing it, and grows the size of a bloated federal government. The American people deserve better.
I've been working in the House to reform the federal budget process so that it works more efficiently and effectively. You can learn about these budget reform efforts here, and share with me your thoughts on this topic by sending me an email here.

Dear Friends and Neighbors in Oklahoma: 
As I noted in the recent full version of my regular e-newsletter, I want to take a moment to briefly walk you through why I supported the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh today when his nomination was confirmed by the Senate in a vote of 50 to 48. I have also added links to additional resources for more facts and information. There have been so many false stories and accusations, many have asked for the facts to help them decide.    
If you would prefer to listen to my most recent podcast on Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation process, please CLICK HERE, or to watch my remarks on the Senate floor on this process, please CLICK HERE. To read my statement after the vote, please CLICK HERE.  
After President Trump nominated Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court on July 9th, it was my priority to learn more about his judicial opinions, legal perspectives, and the other qualities that would provide advice and consent to a lifetime appointment to our nation’s highest court. I was particularly interested in his perspectives on things like the role of each branch of the federal government, privacy, the First Amendment freedoms we possess, and his commitment to the law. I read several of his legal opinions, his background information, and many articles by him and about him. Judge Kavanaugh has served in the DC Circuit Court for 12 years and heard hundreds of cases, so he has had a long legal history. He also served in the George W. Bush White House, so there were thousands of pages of background information. In fact, before Judge Kavanaugh’s first hearing, his file included more than 480,000 pages of information from his time at the White House, his legal opinions, and articles he had written. That is more information than the previous five Supreme Court nominees combined.   
On July 19th, I met with Judge Kavanaugh in my office, away from the cameras, to ask him about any questions I had from his cases and his background. We talked through the issues I mentioned above; I heard about his family; and we prayed together. I had an opportunity to learn about Judge Kavanaugh’s background and his values. I found Judge Kavanaugh highly intelligent, knowledgeable of the judicial areas of concern I raised, and committed to a fair and equal court. It is the same opinion that I had heard and read from every judge that served with him on the DC Circuit and the overwhelming support that he had from attorneys on every side of the issues that had appeared before him over the previous decade. 
Sixty-Five of the 100 Senators took the opportunity to meet personally with Brett Kavanaugh (all 100 were offered an opportunity). He also met with the bipartisan Judiciary Committee staff, all of the members of the Judiciary Committee, had another FBI background check (his 6th), and participated in private and public hearings.   
As the background work continued, on July 30th, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sent a letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh and one other person of sexually assaulting her in high school to Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Diane Feinstein. Dr. Ford absolutely did the right thing, the right way. Senator Feinstein is the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, and she has participated in 10 other Supreme Court nominations. She knows the process of nominations and background investigations well. But, this time, the assault accusation was not sent to the FBI or to the Judiciary Committee investigator. It was held, and unbeknownst to the rest of the Senate, Senator Feinstein instead recommended Dr. Ford seek legal counsel and wait. 
Judge Kavanaugh’s Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings continued following the normal confirmation process. The Judiciary Committee commenced four days of hearings on September 4. Every American could listen to his testimony, hear questions about his judicial positions, and hear from his character references. Judge Kavanaugh discussed that he believes precedent, not politics should inform the Court’s decision and that in the wake of difficult moral issues before the Court, he would focus on interpreting the law, not making it. Friends and colleagues spoke highly of Judge Kavanaugh, and he was subjected to a battery of questions from all of the members of the Committee, including Senator Feinstein. 
Following the hearing, Judge Kavanaugh and his team submitted answers to nearly 1,300 questions, which represented more than all previous Supreme Court nominees combined. None of the questions submitted pertained to Dr. Ford’s allegations.   
Then, the week the Committee was slated to proceed to a vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination, everything suddenly went into chaos. On Wednesday, September 13th, Senator Feinstein transmitted the contents of Dr. Ford’s letter to the FBI, and for the first time she gave a redacted copy to Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley. On Friday, September 14, The New York Times published an article outlining the allegations but did not name Dr. Ford. In fact, Chairman Grassley did not find out Dr. Ford’s identity until he read the article published on Sunday, September 16 in The Washington Post, at which point he asked the Committee to commence its investigation into the allegations. 
The Judiciary Committee staff immediately began to investigate these serious and significant allegations. They started by questioning Judge Kavanaugh on September 17 and September 25. Committee Democrats were invited to attend the Q&A sessions, which is normal protocol, but all of them declined to attend. Judge Kavanaugh unequivocally denied the allegations and immediately offered to meet with the Committee in any way to clear his name.  
The investigators also spoke to every person who Dr. Ford stated was at the party where she was assaulted and dozens of other people who could have known any information about the event. The investigators requested the records from Dr. Ford’s polygraph, her counseling sessions, and any other documents that she believed would be helpful. The staff also reached out to Dr. Ford’s attorney and made a public statement that they would be willing to meet with Dr. Ford near her home, in private, if she would not like to testify publicly, or she could testify publicly, if she would prefer.  
It is important to note that the Judiciary Committee has a significant amount of power to conduct investigations, especially those of a sensitive nature. They have experienced and professional staff that routinely conduct background investigations for judicial nominees, law enforcement officers, and Executive Branch nominees. The Committee wields subpoena power and can compel witnesses to appear and to testify. And most importantly, giving false statements—whether under oath or not – to Committee members or staff is a violation of federal law and can carry up to a five-year prison term.
The public hearing with Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh was watched by millions of Americans. I was glad Chairman Grassley offered both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh a chance to be heard and a chance to answer a multitude of questions surrounding the serious allegations. It provided me, my colleagues, and all Oklahomans an opportunity to hear and read the testimony firsthand from the two people who were directly involved in the allegations. The Committee and the nation were provided definitive statements by Dr. Ford that the acts were committed by Judge Kavanaugh, and then Judge Kavanaugh gave an unequivocal denial of the allegations or of any sexual assault ever. 
All of the witnesses who Dr. Ford named stated they did not remember any party or assault as Dr. Ford described. The available information presented a “he said,” “she said,” “they said” moment of conflicting information. 
Because the members of the Committee wanted an additional investigation by the FBI, on September 28, the Judiciary Committee voted 11-10 in favor of Judge Kavanaugh's nomination with an agreement to allow the FBI to conduct a seventh investigation into Judge Kavanaugh’s background. During the Clarence Thomas hearings in 1991, the FBI took three days to complete its additional background investigation, so Democratic members of the Committee asked for up to a week to be dedicated to this background investigation. 
The FBI interviewed any witness they considered credible and capable of giving them first-hand information about any sexual assault incident. They chose not to re-interview Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh, since they had already given hours of testimony before the Senate. A background investigation is not a criminal investigation, it is a gathering of facts that the FBI submits to the Senate for their final decision.    
The newest FBI investigation included everyone who Dr. Ford remembered being present at the party, everyone who was on Judge Kavanaugh’s calendar at a party that could match Dr. Ford’s description, Ms. Deborah Ramirez, and a list of people she believed were present at a party at Yale where she was humiliated by someone she believed was Brett Kavanaugh. The FBI commenced a week-long investigation to ascertain witness testimony surrounding the alleged events. The supplemental FBI investigation started on Friday, September 28, and was presented to the Senate at 2:30 a.m. on Thursday, October 4. The completed report was a total of almost 50 pages. All Senators were provided as much time as needed to read through the report and receive a briefing from staff. I spent three hours going through all of the latest documents. Every person interviewed by the FBI either stated they did not know Brett Kavanaugh, did not remember any high school event like what Dr. Ford described, or any college event like what Ms. Ramirez described. Several of the witnesses were life-long friends of Dr. Ford or Ms. Ramirez. 
The previous six FBI investigations into Judge Kavanaugh’s background were also available to me, and they were thorough. Over 150 people have been interviewed by the FBI going back to childhood friends and addresses, college friends and addresses, work associates, people he dated, neighbors, and more. Every person interviewed was asked if Brett Kavanaugh had a problem with drinking or drugs or if there is any red flag in his current or past behavior. Every person interviewed by the FBI stated that they had not seen a drinking problem in Brett Kavanaugh’s past or any behavior that raised an alarm. In addition to the FBI report, every girlfriend who dated Brett Kavanaugh in high school and college has come forward as a character witness for him, and 65 ladies who were around Kavanaugh in high school and early college have also spoken out on his behalf. 
After all the proceedings and investigations, there is simply no definitive evidence that Judge Kavanaugh committed the acts brought forward in the allegations. In the past few days, several people have stated that even if Judge Kavanaugh did not commit sexual assault, he drank too much in high school and college, and he does not have the temperament to be a judge. The problem with those allegations is that every judge who served with him for 12 years recommended him because of his ethics and temperament. Those who know him best, support him, even if they do not agree with him.
I have seen the endless media barrage of new accusations and requests for more delay in the process, I have also had personal conversations with some of my colleagues who frankly told me their strategy to stop Judge Kavanaugh was to find every way possible to delay his confirmation. Just like all of us, Judge Kavanaugh is not a perfect human being, but I believe he is a qualified and suitable candidate for the Supreme Court. 
I also believe Dr. Ford endured a traumatic experience that she has carried with her throughout her life, but there is no corroborated evidence to show that Judge Kavanaugh is the one responsible for what was probably one of the scariest moments in Dr. Ford’s life. 
The questions we must walk away with in all of this are: how do we honor victims of sexual violence, and how do we ensure that accused individuals have a fair process to respond on their own behalf? I find it offensive that some say that if someone supports Judge Kavanaugh, they hate women or don’t believe survivors of sexual assault. That is simply not true. As a former minister and fellow Oklahoman, I believe every survivor needs to be heard and respected. We can and should practice greater civility in how we treat each other, personally, professionally, and, yes, politically. This process of getting to the facts could have been much more civil, and I hope it does not set a new pattern for any future nominee. Our nation needs good people willing to go through a fair process to serve our nation. 
This confirmation process has forced us to face difficult issues that have long been problems for our nation. Our nation has a real problem with sexual assault, underage drinking, and drug use. The events that transpired should motivate parents to sit down with their kids and discuss big issues like alcohol, drug use, appropriate behavior, and how to bring uncomfortable information to people they trust who can help them. It’s a tough conversation, but it’s one that needs to be happen in every family and at every university.   
I pray that our nation can move forward from this process with a better sense of how caustic political conversations should not paralyze the Senate’s vital advice and consent role. I hope this letter offers some insight into the important process of making a yes or no decision on a Supreme Court nominee.

10/6/18 20:53,This is a Dark Day For Our Country,"  
￼ 
  
 

Dear Lindsey, 
This is a dark day for our country.  
Senate Republicans have ignored the will of the people in order to install a far-right justice to the highest court in the land.  
They put a sexual assault survivor on trial and bullied and attacked her for coming forward.
They concealed huge portions of Judge Kavanaugh’s public record, in an effort to prevent the American people from getting a clear understanding of who this man is.
At every turn, they have subverted our democracy and betrayed the public’s trust.  
This vote will have consequences on American families for generations to come.  
Our civil, reproductive, and voting rights are all on the chopping block.   
And, most disturbingly, Senate Republicans have sent survivors of sexual assault a chilling message: politics come before justice in the U.S. Senate.  
I will be forever grateful to the millions of Americans who took to the streets and raised their voices to protect our democracy, especially Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.  
Our country needs you now more than ever. Don’t lose hope -- your voices matter, and they will be heard.  
This is a setback. But it’s not the end of our story.  
We will keep fighting to live up to our values of justice, equality and peace for all.

10/6/18 20:52,Kavanaugh confirmed,"View this e-mail in your browser.

￼ 


  I voted NO. But moments ago, Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court. Like many New Jerseyans, this has left me angry, disappointed, frustrated, and fearful for the future. I'm angry for the survivors of sexual assault who found the courage to tell their stories, and then were told by President Trump and the Republican Majority that we may have heard you, but we will never believe you. I’m disappointed in the travesty of this process, and the willingness of Republicans to endanger the very reputation and credibility of the highest court in the land in order to advance a right-wing agenda. 
I’m frustrated that our nation's progress towards women’s rights, civil rights, LGBTQ equality and so much more could be stalled by a Justice that far right interest groups have groomed to do their bidding. And I’m frightened that women will look at what happened in Washington this past week and return to suffering in silence, or that my own granddaughter may grow up never knowing what it was like to live in a country that guaranteed women’s reproductive rights. 
Today I shudder at the thought of Justice Brett Kavanaugh casting the deciding vote in Supreme Court cases that determine whether the President is above the law, whether Dreamers have a future in this country, whether the right to safe and legal abortion is respected in every state, and whether bans on assault weapons are constitutional.
And yet, I'm resolute.  I am determined.  And yes, I am hopeful. Justice Kavanaugh’s vote is not the only vote that matters in this democracy.  To those who feel tempted by these events to give into despair, who feel that gut punch of hopelessness, I promise you all is not lost.
The burden on all of us to continue fighting for progress just became a little bit heavier. But we can share in that burden together. 
It is up to us to make sure that Dr. Ford’s courage to step forward will not be in vain. It is up to us to empower survivors and speak truth to power. It is up to us to keep up the incredible energy that has been building across this country by young people, by women, by good and decent citizens who know in their hearts that America is better than this, and we deserve better than the likes of power hungry men like Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh.

Rounds Report: Kavanaugh Confirmed   October 6, 2018
Despite a prolonged ‘advice and consent’ process in which our Democrat colleagues went to extreme, unprecedented measures to try and stop his nomination, today the Senate confirmed Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh is immensely qualified to serve as a Supreme Court Justice. During the last 12 years on the D.C. Circuit Court, he has demonstrated a thorough understanding that a judge’s responsibility is to interpret and apply the law and Constitution as written, not based on a judge’s personal views or political motivations. He clearly recognizes the limited authority of each of the three branches of government. South Dakotans – and all Americans – stand to benefit from his judicial approach as he takes his seat on the nation’s highest court.

Congressman Smith's E-news: October 6, 2018 
￼  Thanks to the National Federation of Independent Business for awarding me the Guardian of Small Business Award. I’m proud to support Nebraska's farmers, ranchers, and small businesses through tax reform, trade, and regulatory relief. 
  Reforming the Tax Code and Growing the Economy  Tax reform and reduced regulations have set the American economy on an upward trajectory with growth eclipsing four percent. New jobs have outpaced the labor force, increasing wages and setting off a bidding war for workers in many sectors of the economy. The impact of cutting taxes and decreasing regulation cannot be understated, which is why I helped to produce a second round of reform aimed at small businesses and individuals as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee.   This second round of cuts and reforms, which passed the House during the last week of September, was comprised of three bills, each with a distinct purpose: making individual and small business tax cuts permanent, encouraging families to save more earlier for retirement, and incentivizing entrepreneurship. The Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act will make provisions such as the tax cuts for families and the 20 percent deduction for farmers, ranchers, and small businesses permanent in order to ensure individuals and small business throughout Nebraska enjoy the same benefits as larger corporations.   It also included the bipartisan “grain glitch” fix, which sought to mimic Section 199a treatment of cooperatives under the previous tax code to ensure as many producers as possible see reductions in their taxes. It was a top priority for me to ensure language making this treatment permanent was included in the second round of tax reform. Due to Senate rules which limited certain changes to the tax code beyond ten years, these provisions couldn’t be made permanent in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.    The purpose of the second bill, the Family Savings Act, is to make a number of changes to the laws governing retirement accounts to encourage more families to save for retirement. For example, by allowing families to make a onetime withdrawal for the birth or adoption of a child, families can feel confident saving more because they will also have better access to their own money when they need it most.    It will also make pooled employer plans more feasible, which currently face a number of bureaucratic hurdles, allowing small businesses to join together in order to offer better retirement vehicles for their employees. Further changes include the elimination of age limits for Individual Retirement Account (IRA) contributions as well as exemptions from Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) for accounts with relatively smaller balances.   Finally, the American Innovation Act quadruples the deduction allowed for startup expenses for new businesses from $5,000 to $20,000 and indexes this amount for inflation. It will also allow for losses incurred in the early stages of new businesses to be carried forward in the event of shifts in majority ownership. These changes are intended to help more ideas develop from concepts and ideas into viable businesses to create jobs and strengthen our economy.  This second round of reform is important to ensure as many Americans as possible benefit from lower rates and simplified compliance. As always, any changes to our tax code should allow the American people to keep more of their paychecks in order to spend or save their dollars in ways only they know best. I’m proud to have done my part to guide these bills through the process, and I appreciate everyone who attended my tax roundtables throughout the Third District to contribute to the discussion.

October 6, 2018
The U.S. Economy is Roaring
This week, the Federal Reserve provided its outlook on the state of our nation’s economy. The positive report shows continued growth and optimism. Here are a few highlights from the report:
	•	Unemployment is the lowest in almost 50 years
	•	Consumer confidence is at a 17-year high
	•	The holidays are right around the corner, and sales are expected to be nearly $720 billion
	•	Unemployment filings dropped by 8,000 indicating an increase in jobs in the labor force and continued economic growth
	•	U.S. factories are producing more “Made in America” products with 2.3% growth — the largest in nearly a year. Manufacturing is 12% of the U.S. economy and critical to the success of Georgia and the country
A strong economy means more jobs and greater opportunity for all. With lower taxes and the rollback of onerous regulations, President Trump and Congress are working together to put the American people first and create more opportunities for every American.
Opioid Legislation Headed to the President’s Desk
The U.S. House and Senate worked together to address the opioid epidemic by passing The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6). In an extraordinary show of bipartisan support, hundreds of lawmakers in both the House and Senate collaborated to bring forward legislation to support prevention, treatment, and recovery for those dealing with addiction. 
Keep your eye out for the legislation to come to President Trump’s to be passed in to law.
Celebration of the Double Tenth
Yesterday, I joined my friends at the celebration of the 107th National Day of the Republic of China (Taiwan), which is recognized on October 10th. The relationship between Taiwan and the state of Georgia is quite remarkable, and I look forward to hearing more about how we can continue to grow together.

Dear Friend,
Choosing our elected leaders in the voting booth is one of our most sacred rights and serious responsibilities as American citizens. Yet some states are now pushing to hand this privilege and civic duty over to people who are in our country illegally, undermining both our electoral process and what it means to be an American citizen...KEEP READING HERE


WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH

￼
Leslie Burchard served our country proudly as a rifleman in WWII but the medals he earned were stolen from him. We had a great turnout for his medal replacement ceremony - it was really special to show Mr. Burchard how thankful we are for his service.
￼
I stopped by the Farmington VFW to help put together care packages with the St. Louis Fisher House, a great organization that helps provide a 'home away from home' for veterans undergoing treatment at the VA.
￼
Congratulations to everyone at Kingston Elementary School for being named a National Blue Ribbon School! They're one of only 349 schools nationwide to earn the honor. Go Cougars!

GETTING THINGS DONE
 Several pieces of legislation I have been working on were either signed into law or took a big step forward in September. 
￼
Learn more about two of these pieces of legislation below or visit my website at perlmutter.house.gov for additional information.  

TWO BILLS LONG OVERDUE
 I’m particularly proud of two pieces of legislation that recently became law.
On Friday, my legislation to require all newly manufactured helicopters to be built with safer fuel systems was signed into law. This is long overdue and too many people have been killed or badly injured as a result of this more than 20-year old loophole. 

Going forward, this will significantly reduce the risk of post-crash fires and help save lives. I want to thank Chris Vanderveen at 9NEWS (KUSA) for his tireless reporting and Karen Mahany for her advocacy on behalf of her late husband, Patrick. Click below to learn more about this issue. 
￼
The other bill is to allow individuals diagnosed with cancer to defer payments on public student loans while actively receiving lifesaving treatment without interest accruing during the deferment period. This will provide desperately-needed peace of mind for those battling cancer. As the Denver Post reported:
The aim of the bill is to help mitigate the financial strains young adults face after being diagnosed with cancer.
Medical expenses coupled with student loan payments can be a “double-whammy” for students, said Ken McConnellogue, spokesperson for the University of Colorado.
Undergoing cancer treatment is not just costly itself, but there are other indirect costs as well, such as housing, transportation, child care and fertility preservation that young adults have to juggle while seeking care, said Kate Houghton, president and chief executive officer of Critical Mass: The Young Adult Cancer Alliance in Washington, D.C. 
 

NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY AWARENESS MONTH 
 As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, one of my top concerns is the security of personal data, especially in light of several recent high-profile breaches. October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month to help make all Americans aware of their digital footprint and provide resources on how to stay safer and more secure online.
Just last week, we learned that 50 million accounts had been compromised due to a hack at Facebook. It is important to take steps to protect your privacy regardless of whether you have been a victim of a hack.
1. Change your password – Create a password that is complex and do not reuse a password from a different site. Create a password that is long in length and contains numbers, special characters, or phrases.   2. Device audit – Audit your devices to see if someone has gained access to your account. You can do this by visiting Facebook’s Security and Login page, under “Where You’re Logged In” you can see a list of devices that are signed into your account and their locations. If you see a device you do not recognize, you can click “Remove.”   3. Two-factor authentication – Facebook offers a security feature that texts a secure code to your phone. You must enter this code after you type in your password. This is meant to make it more difficult for someone to gain access to your account without the code. 
Unfortunately today it’s not a matter of if your personal information has been breached - it’s how many times. The 2017 Equifax breach alone exposed sensitive information of nearly half of all Americans. In response to the Equifax breach and other recent hacks, a few additional steps to help protect your sensitive information include examining all accounts thoroughly and regularly, activating two-step authentication and alerts to know when a change or a charge is made to your accounts, and signing up for credit monitoring. 
For additional resources or assistance, visit the Department of Homeland website or call my office at (303) 274-7944.   

ICYMI - NEW MEDICARE CARDS
 For those currently enrolled in Medicare, new Medicare cards are in the process of being mailed out. The new card will be sent automatically and will include a new, unique Medicare number rather than your Social Security number to help protect your identity. New cards will arrive anytime between April 2018 and April 2019.

Welcome to the weekend! 
Earlier this week, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) responded to my request and approved a grant to fund construction for an East River Veterans Cemetery. 
South Dakota has a proud legacy of military service and patriotism, and this grant will help expedite the process of establishing a peaceful resting place to remember and honor those who have served our country. 
The grant money could be awarded as early as next year, so I’m hopeful we’ll soon have another cemetery in our state to pay tribute to those who’ve dedicated their lives to freedom, patriotism, and American values. 
To all those who have served, thank you.

Friend-
Congress accomplished a great deal of work this September. We passed landmark legislation to combat the opioid crisis. We also sent a government funding bill to the President's desk that delivers on-time, reliable funding for our military for the first time in a decade. These resources will allow our service members to meet current national security threats and plan for the future.   The House also took the first step to build on the incredible economic growth we've seen this year by passing Tax 2.0. This bill would make the tax cuts for working-class families and small businesses permanent, promote family savings, and spur new business innovation.   When I wasn't in Washington working on these critical issues, I was out and about in the First District continuing my work to expand access to rural broadband, promote key workforce development programs, and ensure our service members have the tools they need. Check out some of the visits I had this past month below: 
￼

The Greater Williamsburg Ducks Unlimited Chapter held its 14th Annual Fall Event, where I joined some area Greenwings in activities including coloring, decoy painting, calling tips, and dog handling. Today's youth are the conservationists of tomorrow. 
 
￼

I stopped by Modern Day Marine at MCB Quantico to speak with some our service members. 

         ￼

I spoke at the National Wildlife Refuge Expo about how I worked across the aisle with Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) to pass the Keep America's Refuges Operational Act that authorizes the volunteer programs critical to keeping our refuges up and running. 
 
￼
I dropped off some school supplies and visited with teachers and school officials at Rosa Parks Elementary in Woodbridge. 
￼
I spoke with folks at the Prince William County Chamber of Commerce about the strength of our economy. From record low levels of unemployment to rising wages to record high consumer confidence, the polices this Congress has put in place are working.  
￼
I received the Guardian of Small Business Award from the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). Virginia’s First District has a plethora of small businesses that are critical to the health of our economy, and I'm proud to fight for the policies that help them succeed.  
￼
I toured Diaz Foods Distribution center in Manassas to hear about the role tax reform has played in their business.
￼

I spent an evening with International Association of Fire Fighters Local 3886 to celebrate their 20th anniversary and thank them for their service to our community. 

￼
I joined the Fredericksburg Regional Chamber of Commerce to talk about ways Congress can work alongside states and localities to eliminate barriers to expanding broadband access in rural Virginia. 
￼
I stopped by Brentsville Day in Bristow to talk with the Daughters of the American Revolution.
￼
I spoke with the New Kent Educational Foundation about my work to connect students with good paying jobs through CTE and STEM programs.
￼
I had the pleasure of visiting Rappahannock Goodwill Industries to meet with their CEO, tour the facility, and learn more about their mission and services to folks in our area. 
￼
I heard from the firefighters at Stafford Local 4012 about ways Congress can continue to support our first responders.
￼
I received the ""Guardian of Seniors' Rights Award"" from the 60 Plus Association for my commitment to protect Medicare and Social Security.
￼
I met with the New Kent Chamber of Commerce for a business roundtable discussion to hear from business owners on how I can continue to be a voice for the polices that help our Virginia small businesses succeed.
￼
I stopped by Proclaiming Grace Outreach to hear how they serve folks in New Kent and James City Counties through their food pantry and thrift shop. 
￼
I hosted a Hanover Veterans Forum at VFW Post 9808 to learn more about what issues First District veterans are experiencing and share some of the bills we’ve passed this Congress to expand and improve veterans’ access to their hard-earned benefits. 
￼
I toured Anton-Paar USA Inc in Ashland to meet with employees, provide a Capitol Hill update, and hear how this Congress can continue working to alleviate the regulatory and compliance burden on businesses.  This month's press releases:

October 6, 2018 
Dear Friends,  Given these turbulent political times, it's more important than ever that we remain engaged and knowledgeable of current events.  
That is why I am sharing with you my reading picks for this week.

All the Ways a Justice Kavanaugh Would Have to Recuse Himself
Given his blatant partisanship and personal animosity toward liberals, how could he be an effective member of the Supreme Court?
￼
By Laurence H. Tribe, professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School
Much might be said about Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s possible confirmation to the Supreme Court: in terms of his still only partly disclosed professional record, the allegations of sexual assault and his candor, or lack of it, in testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
But apart from all that — and apart from whatever the reopened F.B.I. investigation might reveal — the judge himself has unwittingly provided the most compelling argument against his elevation to that court. 
His intemperate personal attacks on members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and his partisan tirades against what he derided as a conspiracy of liberal political enemies guilty of a “calculated and orchestrated political hit” do more than simply display a strikingly injudicious temperament. They disqualify him from participating in a wide range of the cases that may come before the Supreme Court: cases involving individuals or groups that Judge Kavanaugh has now singled out, under oath and in front of the entire nation, as implacable adversaries.

The Health 202: Patrick Kennedy shepherded a major mental-health bill into law. Ten years later, big barriers remain.
￼
By Colby Itkowitz, The Washington Post
It was fall 2008 and the economy was plummeting. The financial crisis was the only issue on anyone's mind. 
So, as Patrick Kennedy tells it, he called his ailing father to ask for a favor. 
Kennedy, then a Democratic congressman from Rhode Island, was the lead sponsor of legislation aimed at getting insurance companies to cover behavioral health services in the same way they did physical health. But, with Congress focused on saving the economy, Kennedy saw chances for his bill's passage slipping away. 
The late-Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) had co-sponsored a similar measure in the Senate. The young congressman asked his father to use his goodwill to press colleagues to take up their mental health bill. The elder Kennedy called his friend, then-Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.), who at that moment was the most powerful man in Washington, as the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, to see what could be done. 
And something could: Dodd used Rep. Kennedy's mental-health bill as the vehicle for the bank bailout known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. 
""I'm the sponsor of the largest federal bailout in American history,"" Kennedy said in a recent interview. ""The good news was [mental health parity] passed. The bad news was that no one knew about it because it was overshadowed by the economic aspect of the bill.""

Donna Strickland's long journey from laser jock to third woman ever to win physics Nobel
By Denise Chow, NBC News
The 5 a.m. phone call changed Donna Strickland's life in an instant. 
It was Tuesday, Oct. 2. A representative from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences was on the line from Stockholm calling to inform Strickland, an associate professor at the University of Waterloo in Canada, that she had won the Nobel Prize in physics. 
Strickland, a self-described ""laser jock,"" recalled that it was a surreal moment: ""No one can be ready for such an honor."" 
In winning the coveted award, which she shares with American physicist Arthur Ashkin and Gérard Mourou of France, Strickland became only the third woman ever to win the physics prize and the first woman to win since 1963. Ashkin will receive half of the $1.4 million prize, and Strickland and Mourou will split the other half.

A NEW, MODERNIZED NAFTA President Trump promised the American people a better trade deal with our North American trading partners. On Monday, he delivered on yet another of his promises to the American people by modernizing an outdated and unfair NAFTA. Canada is Oklahoma’s number one customer and I am confident this agreement with Mexico and Canada will benefit Oklahoma farmers, ranchers, workers, manufacturers, and businesses in the future. I fully support the Trump Administration’s efforts to bring home American jobs and look forward to finalizing the agreement under the Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act (TPA). Learn more about the new deal at this link.
HONOR FLIGHT On Tuesday, I was in Washington to greet an Oklahoma Honor Flight at the Lincoln Memorial. Honor Flights allow veterans who have served our nation courageously to come to Washington for the day and pay their respects at the war memorials on the National Mall. It was an honor to be a part of their day and to thank them for their sacrifice.

 AGENT ORANGE EXPOSURE FAIRNESS ACT I joined Congressman Charlie Crist of Florida in introducing bipartisan, bicameral legislation to reestablish the highest level of care for our Vietnam veterans. The Agent Orange Act of 1991 required the Secretary of the VA to recommend new illnesses associated with Agent Orange until the requirement lapsed in 2015. The Agent Orange Exposure Fairness Act simply puts back in place the same recommendation requirements that were in place for 25 years. When it comes to taking care of our veterans, we owe it to them to be proactive rather than reactive. Read more on my website at this link.
NGVAMERICA 2018 PUBLIC POLICY CHAMPION Last week, NGVAmerica presented me with its 2018 NGV Public Policy Champion award. Congress has no business picking winners and losers in the energy industry. I am proud to sponsor the Natural Gas Parity Act to level the playing field for all energy producers and ensure that natural gas vehicles receive fair treatment.  I want to thank NGVAmerica for recognizing me as a 2018 Public Policy Champion, and I look forward to getting this bill across the finish line alongside Congressman Larson.  
￼
BACK IN OKLAHOMA On Thursday, I spent the day in Sallisaw and Van Buren, Arkansas. Thanks to People, Inc., Experian, and Sallisaw Hospital and Pafford EMS for taking the time to meet with me.  
￼
Good to visit with Sallisaw Hospital and Pafford 
EMS about their emergency services in rural OK.
 
￼
Nice to meet with People, Inc. about their work to
provide quality community-based services in Sallisaw.

On Friday, I had the opportunity to speak with students at Miami High School. It’s always great to visit with the future leaders of our communities and I enjoyed their questions.

￼
Thanks to these Miami High School 
students for their questions!


Friday was National Manufacturing Day and I celebrated with Ceradyne, Inc., a 3M Company by touring their plant in Quapaw. Ceradyne, Inc. makes ceramic sand screens, defense protection systems, fused silica, specialty glass, and more.

￼
Thanks for having me!

My final stop of the week was at the Quapaw Nation Fire Department. I enjoyed meeting a few of the firefighters, seeing their equipment, and touring the facility. Many of their team members recently returned from helping the victims of floodwaters in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence in North Carolina.

￼
Thank you to the Quapaw Fire Department for 
your service to the community and country.

STEM Scholars Program Kicks-Off Third Year
Last Saturday we kicked off the third class of STEM Scholars at FONA International. 
STEM Scholars is a youth leadership program I launched two years ago to expose high school students to the exciting possibilities provided by STEM fields. 
This year’s program is made up of 26 incredibly impressive students from all around the 14th District. I joined the STEM Scholars for their first meeting and hands-on learning experience at FONA International in Geneva. STEM Scholars met with experts in flavor chemistry, food science, sensory science, research and innovation as they create all manner of food flavors. The Scholars had an opportunity to learn about FONA, the food industry and the science behind how we taste and experience food.
Over the next year, Scholars will interact with other practitioners in the STEM fields and develop their leadership skills to advance the understanding of how science, math and technology can contribute to their future careers and communities.  
2018-2019 STEM Scholars: Storey Childs, St. Charles East High School  Matthew Cleveland, Sycamore High School Katie Dunteman, St. Charles North High School James Forbis, Warren Township High School Brady Hare, Aurora Central Catholic Hamelynn Harzman, Yorkville High School Ricardo Herrera, Huntley High School Jonathan Hess, Batavia High School Sophia Jedziniak, Yorkville High School Michael Jedziniak, Yorkville High School Sarah Jochum, Rosary High School Madison Karamagianis, Johnsburg High School Paige Klmavicius, Rosary High School Rebeca Marston, Batavia High School Caitlyn Mathews, Mundelein High School Brendan McCluskey, Nequa Valley High School Samantha McGreevy, Oswego High School Teague Merrill, Marmion Academy Oliver Miller, Homeschooled Addy Novak, Batavia High School Neha Rajan, Batavia High School Audrey Schero, St. Charles East High School Aidan Smith, St. Charles East High School Justin Suess, Marmion Academy Willem Vandermeij, Geneva High School 

Hultgren Praises Additional Resources in Opioid Fight
I am pleased to report that $1.5 million in grants have been awarded to the 14th Congressional District by the Department of Justices' Office of Justice Programs. These resources will bolster the DeKalb County Opioid Dependency Diversion Program, in addition to providing the Oswego school system with funding for enhanced safety measures.
It’s all hands on deck in the effort to stem the flow of Opioids and the havoc they reap upon the communities of the 14th Congressional District. Providing additional support empowers local assets to direct a more comprehensive approach to help those who have fallen prey to the false allure of opioid addiction.
The grant announcement came on the heels of the House-passed legislation last week, the annual Health and Human Services Department funding bill that will provide $6.7 billion in additional funding for opioid-related programs.  

Looking Back at Achievements of the FSC in the 115th Congress
As the House adjourns for the fall break, we cannot help but to turn our attention to the last 21 months since the 115th Congress was convened. As a member of the Financial Services Committee (FSC) I can tell you all, we have been busy and there are a lot of accomplishments that I am very proud of.
Here is just a highlight of a few of the great things that came out of the FSC in the 115th Congress: 
	•	Passed H.R. 1511, the “Homeless Children and Youth Act to meet the needs of homeless children, youth, and families, and honor the assessments and priorities of local communities.
	•	Worked to support those recovering from opioid addiction by passing The THRIVE Act which is designed to support transitional housing for individuals recovering from opioid addiction
	•	Played key roles in rollback of harmful Obama-era regulations. 
	•	Passed the most significant pro-growth community banking bill in nearly a generation. 
	•	Ensure America can compete globally with countries like China with policies that help sustain 3% plus economic growth. 

There is Still Time to RSVP for Upcoming Hunger Forum
Our communities have worked to raise awareness of the problem of hunger in our region just as others have sought to bring attention to it on a worldwide level. Although the challenges to overcome hunger are daunting, they are not beyond our ability to confront and in many cases resolve them.
I will be hosting a forum, “Confronting the Scourge of Hunger”, which will focus on the issue of global hunger and hunger as experienced by many in our own region, and approaches to address and alleviate hunger both locally and globally.  
According the Northern Illinois Food Bank, nearly 600,000 people in northern Illinois rely on food pantries and meal programs to feed themselves and their families. I look forward to hearing about constructive approaches to address the scourge of hunger and expert insight into how we as a community, both locally as well as globally, can participate in finding solutions and helping those whose lives are afflicted by hunger.
“Confronting the Scourge of Hunger” 
Baker Community Center in St. Charles Wednesday, October 17th  10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. 
To RSVP for the event, here. 

The US, Mexico and Canada Adopt New Trade Agreement
For more than a year the United States, Mexico and Canada have worked on a renegotiation of NAFTA. Just a few days ago the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) was announced.   I am very excited for our farmers and producers that Canada has joined Mexico and the United States to modernize a free trade agreement which expands markets for our exporters and further allows our economy to grow. I have long called for the move from tariffs to trade agreements and I look forward to reviewing this new trade deal closely to ensure it provides certainty and opportunities for the hard-working farmers of Illinois so they can utilize the fertile soil of the 14th District to the benefit of their family and community. 
I will always work to ensure that the best interests of our farmers and manufacturers are protected. 
In Your Service,  ￼  Randy Hultgren Member of Congress 14th District, Illinois 
Randy on the Issues - Veterans
We must support the brave men and women who have sacrificed so much in the defense of our freedoms and country. I continue to hold forums across the 14th District to hear from veterans & address issues important to them. I re-introduced the Protecting Veterans Credit Act to provide veterans with consumer protections when they receive adverse credit reporting as a result of VA mishandling. I cosponsored and supported the Hire More Heroes Act, which encourages small businesses to hire veterans. I also supported passage of the Veterans Opioid Abuse Prevention Act to assist veterans in their efforts to overcome opioid addiction and the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act that allows homeless veterans to access federal grants to assist in securing housing.

Weekly Review
 



October 1

Funding the Land & Water Conservation Fund: In light of the fact that I went out paddling yesterday morning with a group to Crab Bank, allow me to muse just a little bit more about the issue of conservation and open space. It’s certainly part of the fabric of what makes the Lowcountry special, but frankly it’s part of the fabric of what makes so many areas of our country unique.
But it doesn’t just happen. Our national parks are in place because people were proactive on making them so. The ACE Basin is unique because people like Charles Lane were pioneers in pushing for conservation easements on lands that had been held by Lowcountry families for years.
Where am I going with all of this? I’m going to the fact that yesterday, the Land and Water Conservation Fund expired. That’s a blow for all of us who care about preserving and protecting unique and special places or access to them across our country.
I’ve said it many times now in many different ways, but we live in the craziest of political times. At one level, we see it in things like the Kavanaugh hearing and the media circus that surrounded it. Or at another level, we see it with the termination of funding for the Land & Water Conservation Fund.
Doing so is a remarkable breach of public trust. Click here to read more.

Revitalizing Crab Bank: Let me follow up on the Land and Water Conservation Fund. In this case, let me make it more local and talk just a little bit about what I mentioned yesterday, as I joined a couple hundred others on Sunday morning for a paddle out to Crab Bank in support of the revitalization of the island.
To me, the paddle and the conversations that came with it had less to do with Crab Bank in many ways than it did about two important themes I think all of us need to think about in the Lowcountry.
One, we need to be proactive about saving open space and unique components of what make our part of the world special relative to so many other places out there. It is unique to have a bird rookery in one of the busiest container ports in the United States. Crab Bank represents another little feature to the world of distinct here in the Lowcountry. And not being like any place else has real benefit...not just for the birds on Crab Bank but in the economic engine of what drives our economy as we have a different look and feel to the Lowcountry that brings in tourists and retirees.
Two, it’s about the importance of all of us making our voices heard with things we’d like to see come our way or in this case, stay as part of our coast. It was really neat to see a few hundred folks paddle out to Crab Bank on a glorious morning, and there is a collective voice that goes well beyond our individual voices in the world of politics. We need to be bold, whether it’s speaking up for natural wonders…or against growth in the not-so-wonderful national debt.
This weekend, The Post and Courier published an op-ed I wrote on the importance of conservation efforts in the Lowcountry...addressing Crab Bank as well as the Tri-County Waterfront Park - the park of scale I hope collectively we can bring about on the tip of Daniel Island.

Unsustainable Government Spending and the Debt: I continue to believe that we are walking our way toward the most predictable financial crisis in the history of man. 

I believe that the financial storm that will confront us will be more damaging than the Great Depression. 

I say this because, at that time, people weren't as dependent on their federal government as they are today. 

What people now demand of their federal government - and will demand in a time of crisis - is a quantum leap from what people expected of their federal government in the 1920s. 

We all know that what they came to expect from the government in the wake of the Great Depression was pronounced relative to what it had been in the 1920s, but it still pales in comparison to what people expect and get from their federal government today. When Social Security started, it was but a 1% tax on payroll. Today, it’s over 13% when you combine the employer and employee contributions. Medicare and Medicaid didn’t exist. I could go on with a lot of other examples, but what they all point to is that when this storm kicks off, people are really going to get hurt. 

If you look at the Congressional Budget Office numbers, the federal government has run out of spending room to correct financial difficulty, as they attempted to do in the wake of the 2008 and 2009 financial meltdown. Our Fed has boxed itself in in the same way, given the balance sheet exploded from about $800 billion in size at the time of the 08-09 crisis to over $4 trillion on the balance sheet and a consequent inability to grow at much more than what it is today without sparking inflationary consequences. The same is true with the overall rate environment. We’ve been in a period of declining rates for a long time now, and despite the recent upticks by the Fed, there’s still not a lot of wiggle room in the event a financial storm comes our way. 

I could expand on this in great detail, but I will spare you. It doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t batten down the financial hatches, though. I appreciate the way that many see me as pessimistic or Dr. No on spending, but trust me, there has been a method to the madness, given the way in which numbers have a way of proving themselves over time. 

I spoke on a few of these themes the other night on the House Floor, and for that reason, I thought I'd share the clip below. 

I'd love your thoughts….

Promoting Responsible and Free Trade Act: Tariffs are just a fancy word for taxes...imposed at a country’s border.
I’ve said this multiple times, but it bears repeating...particularly at a time when tariffs or just the threat of tariffs seem to be piling up.
What I find so interesting and relevant about this issue is not whether tariffs themselves are good or bad. (I do take a decidedly free market view of the global trading system, but that’s beside the point here.) What matters here is simply this: the Constitution clearly vests Congress with the responsibility to impose tariffs.
In spite of this, modern history is filled with examples of the executive branch imposing tariffs without Congress’s approval...or even a congressional debate.
This happened in 1971, when President Nixon - under a 1917 law allowing presidents to restrict trade during times of war - imposed a 10 percent tariffs citing the Korean War. Nevermind the fact that the war was never officially declared and had, in any case, ended almost 20 years earlier. President George W. Bush imposed tariffs on steel imports in 2002 under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, which gives the executive broad authority to impose tariffs in several instances - such as when responding to other countries’ unfair trade practices.
Over the years, no matter whether the White House is occupied by a Democrat or a Republican, Congress’ role in tariffs has eroded. Click here to read more.

Opposing Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: In keeping with the conservation theme from earlier this week, I want to circle back on the notion of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge…
Just last week, I did two things to express my opposition to drilling in the Refuge. One, I signed onto a letter authored by Dave Reichert from Washington State and two, I cosponsored a bill introduced by Jared Huffman of California that would ban the administration’s efforts to allow oil and gas activities within the refuge.
These actions are important for three reasons…
One, there is a value to ideas that have been time-tested. This is the case with the moratorium on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The moratorium was put into place by President Eisenhower and it stayed through republican and democratic presidents alike over the last sixty years. When something has been in place for that long through the cross-currents of a whole host of different political perspectives, with perhaps Clinton or Carter on the left and someone like Reagan on the right, we should pause before making a change.
Two, on national policy, we should listen to our grandmother or grandfather as they may have said to us to remember moderation in all things. Click here to read more.

News from Representative Lou Barletta 
￼
 


 
 October 6, 2018  
SPECIAL UPDATE: Providing Economic Security for Pennsylvanians 
For too long, high taxes and overregulation led to millions of jobs fleeing our country, unfair trade deals leaving our farmers and manufacturers at a disadvantage back home, and the federal government taking more and more money out of hardworking Americans’ paychecks.  But I’ve been working with President Trump over the past two years to make sure the American worker and middle class families are no longer forgotten.  
￼
It’s always a pleasure getting to know  
Pennsylvania workers. I’m pleased to report
that the Commonwealth's unemployment
rate has dropped to its lowest since 2007.
In Pennsylvania alone, we have created over 115,000 jobs, and across the United States, millions of Americans have seen increased benefits, wages, and bonuses.  Small business and consumer confidence are at all-time highs, employment is at historically low rates, and jobless claims are the lowest in nearly 50 years.    This new era of American prosperity is a direct result of actions taken by Congress and the Trump Administration to cut red tape, roll back burdensome regulations, and pass the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the most comprehensive reform of our broken tax code in over thirty years.  This landmark legislation, which I proudly voted for, cut individual rates, doubled the standard deduction and child tax credit, and created a 20 percent deduction for small businesses, the backbone of our economy.  It also eliminated disastrous Obama Administration policies that rewarded companies for shifting jobs, profits, and manufacturing plants overseas.  By cutting our uncompetitive corporate tax rate, we have seen hundreds of billions of dollars that corporations left sitting overseas reinvested into in American workers and businesses.  Thanks to Tax Reform, the United States is once again the home to business innovation and prosperity.  To maintain this economic momentum, I voted for three bills last week known as “Tax Cuts 2.0,” making sure American workers can keep more of their paycheck, supporting small businesses, and providing our nation’s seniors with more flexibility and security in their retirement.  
￼
Apprenticeships and Career and Technical
Education programs like the one I toured at  Luzerne
County Community College help ensure workers
have the skills they need to succeed.
On top of making key provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent – such as the doubled standard deduction, decreased individual rates, small business deduction, and enhanced child tax credit – Tax Cuts 2.0 expands 529 accounts to cover the costs of homeschooling and apprenticeship programs, while also allowing parents to withdraw money they have in retirement accounts penalty-free for expenses related to the birth or adoption of a child.   Tax Cuts 2.0 also helps entrepreneurs develop their passions by ensuring they are able to deduct start-up costs for new businesses, while also allowing older Americans to contribute to their retirement account later in life.  Furthermore, this legislation creates new Universal Savings Accounts so individuals and families can save for college, retirement, or a car payment without being taxed.  Since Tax Reform was signed into law, paychecks got bigger, jobless claims got smaller, and confidence is now soaring throughout the United States.  Now, with Tax Cuts 2.0, Pennsylvanian families don’t just get to keep more of their hard-earned money, they’ll have new ways to save it for the future.  I am proud to fight alongside President Trump to provide a renewed chance of prosperity for working families across Pennsylvania, and I look forward to continuing to fight for you and ensure economic security and success for American workers and businesses across the country.  It remains an honor to serve you in the U.S. House of Representatives.  All my best, ￼  Lou Barletta  Member of Congress

Dear Friend,  Early this week I was very glad to hear that Canada agreed to join the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. This effort for an updated NAFTA agreement is beneficial for our workers, businesses, and farmers here in Washington State because 40% of our jobs are tied to trade. I look forward to taking a closer look at the agreement and discussing it with my colleagues to determine whether it meets our objectives. I am optimistic that a strong partnership will continue to create jobs and growth here in America.  Drawing Awareness to Safety on Our Roads  I joined with my fellow Congressional Law Enforcement Caucus Co-Chair, Representative Bill Pascrell, Jr., in introducing House Resolution 1107 supporting the designation of National Secure Your Load Day on June 6th. Each year, thousands of drivers are injured as a result of unsecure loads and road debris on our nation’s highways. In fact, according to a study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in 2016 more than 90,266 incidents were caused by unsecured loads, resulting in approximately 19,663 injuries and 683 deaths. This resolution we introduced honors the lives of those who have been impacted, including the daughter of one of our fellow Washingtonians, Robin Abel. After her daughter was catastrophically injured by an unsecured load, Robin has dedicated her time and energy to raising awareness about these avoidable tragedies. I was proud to introduce this resolution to highlight the need to make our roads safer by securing loads and preventing road debris.

THE FUTURE OF MANUFACTURING
￼
Yesterday was National Manufacturing Day, and I had visited General Stamping & Metalworks in South Bend to help kick off an exciting day in our community.
I am grateful to the South Bend Regional Chamber for this opportunity to speak to some bright young Hoosiers who are the future of this growing industry.
Manufacturing is opening new doors to prosperity and opportunity in our region and across the country.
￼
With the skills these students are learning now, they will be ready to walk through those doors and write the next chapter in American manufacturing.
Northern Indiana is full of businesses of all sizes that make products to sell all over the world. From RVs and boats to military equipment and medical devices, our region has a long tradition of invention and innovation.
￼
It takes incredible skill, hard work, and innovative thinking to keep building American-made products.
I know our next generation is going to do groundbreaking things, and I am so excited to see where the future takes us.
EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS ON MEDICARE ENROLLMENT
￼
Medicare is a sacred commitment we have made to our seniors, and part of keeping that promise is ensuring Hoosiers have all the information they need to secure their benefits. With the Medicare enrollment period coming up, my office is here to help answer your questions.
On October 9th, 10th, and 16th, a member of my staff and a Medicare specialist from Indiana’s State Health Insurance Program (SHIP) will hold “Medicare 101” educational sessions throughout the 2nd District.

Health Insurance Costs are Dropping Under Republican Leadership 
As a physician with more than 30 years of experience and co-chair of the House GOP Doctors Caucus, I am working to ensure every American has access to the health care they need and coverage they can afford. It’s not just a priority for me – it’s been my life’s work. That’s why I’ve stayed committed to repealing Obamacare and replacing it with free-market, patient-centered care. The goal of Obamacare was to provide affordable health care to every American, a goal we all support. Although access to health insurance increased, the law resulted in less choice and higher costs – with too many Tennesseans unable to afford coverage at all. In Tennessee alone, the average premiums on the exchange have risen 176 percent over 10 years, a staggering amount. I have helped lead the fight to bring back affordable health care to Americans, and while we still have a lot of work to do, we are starting to see some positive results.
Since President Trump took office, Democrats have made claims that our proposed reforms will cut off access and result in even higher costs. House Democrat Leader Nancy Pelosi stated, “Republicans will force tens of millions of families to pay more for worse coverage -and push millions of Americans off of health coverage entirely,” and Senate Democrat Leader Chuck Schumer stated, “The Republican plan to cut health care wouldn’t make America great again, it would make America sick again and lead to chaos instead of affordable care.” Well, I’m pleased to report their doomsday predictions were wrong. Just last week U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced at a speech in Tennessee that for the first time since Obamacare was enacted, average premiums are expected to drop nationwide. In Tennessee, rates will drop an average of 26 percent. This is great news. 
What were some of the changes we’ve made? As part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law last year, we repealed the penalty associated with the individual mandate, which required everyone to purchase government-approved health insurance or pay a penalty. To me, this was the most troubling aspect of Obamacare because for first time in our country’s history the government was forcing you to buy a product. Now that we repealed this unfair mandate, Americans can shop for the coverage based on their needs and what they can afford. Free market reforms are designed to spur competition, lower costs and improve quality of care; because of this fundamental idea we are now seeing progress. 
Additionally, I led the effort to repeal arguably the worst part of Obamacare, the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) – an unelected, unaccountable board of bureaucrats that would have been given the authority to propose immediate cuts to Medicare to meet a budget. Those cuts could have resulted in seniors having been denied access to health care services, so I was thrilled when the IPAB was fully repealed in H.R. 1892, the Bipartisan Budget Act 2018, and signed into law on February 9, 2018. 
President Trump has also implemented several Executive Orders to help reduce the regulatory burden and to promote the competition and quality in our health care system. Most recently, his administration put out an executive order to encourage association health plans, which – if done correctly – would allow small businesses to band together to purchase health insurance just like large corporations do. Actions like this will help spur competition and reduce health care costs, and as part of that effort, we will continue to protect those with pre-existing conditions. In each of the past three Congresses I have introduced the American Health Care Reform Act, which fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with expanded access to Health Savings Accounts; includes tax code reforms that encourage choice and competition in health insurance; and promotes greater transparency on cost. There’s no question further reforms are necessary, but I’m hopeful my bill can serve as a platform for future reforms that we consider.  
My door is always open to East Tennesseans. Feel free to contact my office if I can be of assistance to you or your family.

MOMENTUM BUILDS FOR STOP HARMFUL DISCHARGES ACT
￼ 
Lindsey - 
Great news: momentum is building for our Stop Harmful Discharges Act to prioritize public health and safety on the Treasure Coast. 
We're adding co-sponsors to the bill, and just this past weekend, famed water activist Erin Brockovich visited Stuart to help build support for the bill! 
Here's some of what she had to say: 
""It is worth the fight, and I am just warm to my soul to be here, to see legislation introduced, to see Congressman Mast stepping up and doing the right thing. All of the groups, the organizations, the foundations, the people has been an outpouring to save Florida, stop the issue, stop these algae blooms. There are solutions. We need to find them. And we're going to make them happen."" 
And that's all true because this is a team effort, and together, I am absolutely convinced that we can win this fight.

10/6/18 9:01,New NAFTA,"News from Representative Crawford 
￼ 
￼   ￼   ￼   ￼   ￼   ￼   
￼
 New NAFTA
This week there was a lot of attention around the President's announcement of a new NAFTA deal called USMCA. The North American Free Trade Agreement is a 24 year old document between the United States, Mexico, and Canada that hasn't been updated since it was signed in 1994. These nations are wildly different now and any trade deal should be updated to reflect it. 

I'm pleased to see that the President has followed through with his campaign promise to put America first in a renegotiated NAFTA. Balanced, reciprocal trade is essential to building an American Economy that supports high-paying jobs and future growth, and keeps us competitive in the global marketplace. 

I will continue advocating for improved trade partnerships, and for opening new markets to allow American businesses to further expand. USMCA is a victory for Arkansas' economic advancement. With a preset renegotiation schedule, businesses will no longer face uncertainty when making long-term decisions affected by North American trade flows. Arkansas agriculture will benefit from expanded exports to the Canadian poultry market, sustained trading relationships with Mexico, and more favorable treatment of US agriculture technologies. 

FAQ (What folks have been calling/texting my office about this week)

Major Opioid Legislation Heads To President's Desk; Includes McKinley Bills 
The Senate passed major bipartisan opioid legislation this week -- H.R. 6 is now on its way to be signed into law. This is a significant step in the ongoing fight against this epidemic. It will increase access to treatment, improve prevention, and give law enforcement more tools. H.R. 6 includes four bills we have championed.  First is the POWER Act (H.R. 5176), which we introduced with Representative Doyle. It will help reduce repeat overdoses by helping patients get connected with treatment options directly following an overdose.  H.R. 6 also includes the Alternatives to Opioids (ALTO) Act (H.R. 5197) that we introduced with Representative Pascrell. The ALTO Act builds on a successful model used in NJ to encourage alternative pain management in the ER.   Emmett's Law (H.R. 5695) will educate health professionals about information on substance abuse and overdoses they can share with family members.  Finally, H.R. 5628, the Access to Increased Drug Disposal Act was also included. The AIDD Act will improve access to drug disposal programs for leftover Rx medicine. A majority of opioid users become addicted with pills from friends and family, and this bill will reduce the availability.  Click here to learn more  

McKinley Visits Small Businesses in Moundsville
This week we visited with several small businesses in downtown Moundsville to talk about the economy and the challenges they are facing. We stopped in Hometown Floral & Gifts, Ruttenberg's, and several others. Small businesses are vital for our economy and our communities. There continues to be a lot of optimism about things turning around in WV.  Click here to read more

Economic Good News Comes to West Virginia 
This week Governor Justice announced that personal income and severance taxes have provided $120 million in excess of estimates.

Dear Friend, 
This week, new allegations about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh emerged as the FBI undertook a hasty supplemental background investigation that did not even include an interview with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and I expressed my concern about the reputation of both the High Court and the Senate were he to be confirmed. I also  spoke out about unsafe working conditions at a Memphis logistics warehouse, wrote to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in response to the Memphis VA Medical Center being ranked among the nation’s worst for the third year in a row, applauded Senate action on my bill to require the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to set minimum passenger aircraft seat sizes for the safety of the flying public, commended The New York Times for its exposé on the Trump family’s alleged abuse of the U.S. tax system, met with prospective applicants to our national service academies, began offering 2019 U.S. Capitol Historical Society calendars and offered a health tip. Keep reading to learn more about my week and follow me on Twitter and Facebook to see more updates as they happen.

Questioning the Judicial Fitness of Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh 
￼ 
This week, as the FBI reopened its background check on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh for a hurried review, I questioned why the obvious evidence already apparent that Kavanaugh lacks the required judicial temperament shouldn’t disqualify him. It was clear the Majority wanted to rush to confirm him before another scandalous eruption occurred, but my concern was always to preserve the integrity of two fundamental institutions: the Supreme Court and the United States Senate. Both have been damaged in this process but Kavanaugh’s confirmation -- after his display of hyper-partisanship and disrespectful disdain for the process and for the Senate, as well as his evident misrepresentations under oath -- would do long-term harm to the High Court. I continue to hope the interests of the country will prevail and his nomination will be withdrawn. 
Expressing Concerns about Working Conditions at XPO Logistics 
￼ 
Twice this week, I went to the southeast Memphis warehouse of XPO Logistics to talk with constituents who allege that company employees are being sexually harassed and work in unsafe conditions. I also wrote to the company’s CEO with my concerns and notified the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Department of Labor. I will continue to monitor this situation and seek answers. 
Taking Action in Response to Disappointing VA Medical Center Rankings 
￼ 
On Wednesday, I read The Commercial Appeal story detailing the unfortunate one-star ranking – for the third year in a row -- of the Memphis Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). I immediately wrote to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie to ask for his intervention. I also received a detailed briefing on the facility from Memphis VA Director David Dunning. We discussed the existing problems at the VAMC and what more must be done. Director Dunning has been on the job for 14 months and there have been improvements during his tenure, including improved employee morale and declines in mortality rates. Prior to Director Dunning, the Memphis VA had a series of interim directors with no long-term plans.I will continue to demand improvements so that our veterans can receive the level of service they deserve and expect. 
Praising Senate Action on my SEAT Act 
￼ 
On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate voted 93 to 6 to pass the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act containing the Seat Egress in Air Travel (SEAT) Act provision that I introduced with Representative Adam Kinzinger (R-Florida). On Friday it was signed into law. As a senior member of the House Aviation Subcommittee, I worked for three years to pass the measure, which requires the FAA to establish both minimum seat size and distance between rows of seats on commercial aircraft to protect the safety of the flying public. Safety must never take a backseat, much less a shrunken seat, to profits. The safety of the public must be the airlines’ primary concern and this bill now requires the FAA to take it seriously. I’m proud that this measure has been enacted into law and I commend my colleagues for including this important safety measure in the FAA bill.  

Commending an Investigation into Trump Family Tax History 
￼ 
On Tuesday, The New York Times published a lengthy and detailed examination of the alleged tax abuses perpetrated by President Trump and the Trump family.  President Trump claims his father loaned him $1 million that he was required to repay with interest. The Times investigation establishes that Trump was a millionaire by age 8 and in fact received up to $413 million from his father through what may have been fraudulent transfers to avoid estate and gift taxes. The American people deserve to see Trump’s tax returns.    

Meeting Prospective Service Academy Applicants 
￼ 
Last Saturday, I met at the Crosstown High School with prospective applicants to the five service academies – the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Air Force Academy, the Merchant Marine Academy and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. These bright and patriotic students will make us proud should they be admitted to these sterling and very competitive national institutions. 
Offering U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars 
My office will soon have a limited number of 2019 U.S. Capitol Historical Society calendars available. If you would like to receive a calendar, please complete this form on my website. Due to the rules of the House, I am able to mail calendars only to residents of Tennessee’s 9th Congressional District. Please feel free to share this email with other residents of the 9th District who may be interested in receiving one but who do not receive my e-Newsletter. 
Signing Up for “Congress On Your Corner” and this e-Newsletter 

￼ 
I enjoy meeting regularly with constituents in the district and helping get answers for them to questions about dealing with federal agencies. If you are interested in attending one of my “Congress on Your Corner” events, you can sign up here to receive notification as soon as the next event is scheduled. 
For those who haven’t participated in a telephone town hall, it’s easy to sign up for them by using this form.   
If you would like to receive this weekly e-Newsletter, or share it with others, you can do that with this form. 
Weekly Health Tip 
￼  
Each week, I share a health tip in the hope of promoting a healthy lifestyle for residents of the 9th Congressional District. As always, it is best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine or lifestyle. 
October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. One in every eight women will develop invasive breast cancer at some point in their lives.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that women between 50 and 74 get a mammogram every two years, while women under 50 are advised to talk to their doctors about how often they should be screened. For information on free and low-costs screenings, see this resource from the CDC. 
Quote of the Week

“This country has nothing to fear from the crooked man who fails. We put him in jail. It is the crooked man who succeeds who is a threat to this country.” – President Theodore Roosevelt, speech in Memphis, Tennessee, October 25, 1905.  
As always,

On my weekly ""Capitol Hill Report,"" I spoke with Josh Blake of KNEI Radio in Waukon and Terri Queck-Matzie of Successful Farming about the United States, Mexico and Canada Agreement (USMCA), year-round E15 sales and the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be the next Supreme Court justice.  
Q&A:USMCA
Q. How will USMCA improve trade between the United States, Mexico and Canada? Q. What does the USMCA mean for Iowa? 
Quick Links
Judge Kavanaugh has spent 25 years of his career in public service. He spent the last twelve years on the D.C. Circuit, considered the second-most important federal court in the country. Judge Kavanaugh is also a pillar of his community. He serves underprivileged communities, coaches girls’ basketball, and is a lector at his church. It would be a travesty if the Senate did not confirm the most qualified nominee in our nation’s history. I look forward to voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh in the final floor vote.  
More than 100 people in the United States die from opioid overdoses every day. The devastating effects of the opioid epidemic are clear and more has to be done to reduce its impact. This week, Congress sent broad, bipartisan legislation to combat the opioid epidemic to President Trump to be signed into law. This sweeping legislation is a culmination of months of bipartisan work by five committees in the Senate and eight committees in the House of Representatives, including the Senate Judiciary Committee, which I chair.  
Last month, I completed my annual 99 county meetings for the 38th year in a row. At almost every one of those meetings, Iowans asked about the progress Congress is making on a new Farm Bill. I’m not part of Farm Bill negotiations, but actively speak with Members who are. What I’m hearing is troubling, to say the least. It's past due that Congress step up to the plate and pass substantive reforms that will simultaneously help Rural America and taxpayers.  
Senator Joni Ernst and I sent a letter to the Iowa City Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System seeking answers about a report in USA Today saying the VA Office of Inspector General is conducting an audit of appointment cancellations at the Iowa City VA. It’s important to get to the bottom of how many  were canceled in error and what follow-up was or wasn't donel, and why. Accountability is the only way to make sure veterans receive the high quality care that they’ve earned. 
I sent a letter to Secretary of the Air Force seeking answers as to why the 60th Ariel Port Squadron a base in California is purchasing cups that cost $1,280 each. This latest example of reckless spending of taxpayer dollars gives me no confidence that the Air Force is taking real steps to reduce wasteful spending practices. This report also heightens my concern that the DOD Office of Inspector General is not prioritizing oversight of wasteful spending.

As we recessed last week for the last time before the election, I was again honored to be at the White House as President Trump signed another crucial piece of legislation, the defense funding bill to fully fund our troops, on time, for the first time in nine years. 
These bill signings, coming near the beginning and end of my first term in Congress are especially meaningful because they represented two of my most important priorities as Wyoming’s lone representative in the House: rolling back the overreaching federal regulations of the Obama years that targeted Wyoming’s farming, ranching, and energy industries and providing needed resources for the defense of our nation.We have accomplished much during the last two years and we have much work ahead. 
In other news, 
I recently introduced the Grizzly Bear State Management Act, which directs the Department of the Interior to re-issue the rule delisting grizzly bears in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, and prohibits any judicial review of this decision.This year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) determined that, “The population has rebounded from as few as 136 bears in 1975 to an estimated 700 today and meets all the criteria for delisting.” Additionally, USFWS biologists determined the grizzly bear currently exceeds the carrying capacity of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and now occupies more than 22,500 square miles. The decision by a Federal District Court Judge in Montana to re-list the grizzly ignores science, and disregards the important work done by the state of Wyoming to establish an effective grizzly bear management plan. My bill will stop this abuse of the court system and put management of the grizzly back in the hands of experts in Wyoming.
I also introduced the H.R. 6939, the Restoring Local Input and Access to Public Lands Act at the request of Big Horn, Lincoln, and Sweetwater County Commissioners. This legislation lifts the restrictive Wilderness Study Area designations, which Congress never intended to be permanent, in these counties. While the Wyoming Public Lands Initiative is underway in some counties across our state, these three counties opted not to participate in that process and have requested that Congress act to release their WSAs. H.R. 6939 will finally address this long-standing WSA issue and provide citizens and local officials in Big Horn, Lincoln, and Sweetwater counties more authority to determine how best to manage the federal land within their counties. Additionally, over the last few years, federal land management agencies have abused their authority under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act to classify land as having wilderness characteristics then restrictively managing that land based on the agencies’ arbitrary standards without local input, support or any real justification. My bill also ends this deeply flawed practice.
I have heard from constituents across Wyoming in support of this legislation: 
“We want to commend Congresswoman Cheney for bringing this bill. We have lived far too long in Wyoming with these Wilderness Study Areas that were supposed to have been disposed of many years ago. We are supportive of all efforts to get the WSAs moved out of the interim status they have been in. The interest of our members, as ranchers, out on these lands, has been negatively impacted by the WSA designation because these lands have been managed as de facto wilderness. We are very pleased to see an effort to move out of the WSA status and into multiple use management which was the original recommendation of the BLM for many of these areas.” –Jim Magagna, Wyoming Stock Growers Association Executive Vice President 
“Advocates for Multiple Use of Public Lands (AMPL) is pleased to support Congressman Cheney’s Restoring Local Input and Access to Public Lands Act of 2018.  Protecting access for responsible mechanized and motorized recreation on our public lands in Wyoming is of key importance to the citizens of Wyoming and our visitors who enjoy and cherish these public lands.” – Advocates for Multiple Use of Public Lands 
“We, the Lincoln County Commissioners fully support the release of the WSA’s in Lincoln County. We appreciate all the work that Congressman Cheney has done to help us with an important issue.” – Robert King, Chairman Lincoln County Commission 
“I was very pleased when Rep. Cheney was willing to step forward and step up to take on the challenges of these WSAs. I sincerely hope Congress can make the change in Sweetwater county, since roughly 80% of the people I represent depend on the quality jobs that stem from mineral development.” – Wally Johnson, Sweetwater County Commissioner

This week, I had a great time touring the Cheyenne Magpul facility where I had the opportunity to put together PMAGs for our troops. KGWN accompanied me as I met with the hardworking Magpul employees and learned about thework they are doing to support both our armed forces and the local economy in Cheyenne.

The Roosevelt fire in Sublette County has been among the most catastrophic in Wyoming’s history causing widespread destruction with the loss of 55 homes. Thankfully no lives were lost, but the property loss has been tragic. On Tuesday, I had the opportunity to hear about this  situation from county commissioners, state representatives, the USFS, BLM, woodland firefighters, Interagency Fire Task Force, Governor Mead’s office, State Forester, the Wyoming Department of Homeland Security, and most importantly landowners who lost their homes in the fire. I am committed to helping residents recover from this disaster. We must also do more to prevent these fires from happening in the first place. When it comes to forest management and emergency response, one size fits all solutions don’t work in Wyoming. Forest management should be left to the states and I will continue to work on solutions like the Resilient Federal Forests Act to ensure Wyoming’s forests are being properly managed so we can better protect against the threat of wildfire in our state.
On Thursday morning, I had the pleasure of joining Fox & Friends to discuss the Senate Democrats attempt to defeat Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Please watch my full interview below.

Natural Resources Committee
The Natural Resources Committee reviewed several pieces of legislation that focused on improving the Endangered Species Act (ESA). As evidenced by what our state has experienced with the delisting of the gray wolf and now the grizzly, the ESA is clearly not working and must be reformed. States are best suited to manage their wildlife by implementing an approach that is most effective to their landscape and habitat. I proudly voted to approve the EMPOWERS ACT, which requires the USFWS to consult with states before making decisions on ESA petitions, and the Endangered Species Transparency and Reasonableness Act, which requires the USFWS to make scientific data used to make listing determinations publicly available.
Most importantly, the committee considered the Manage our Wolves Act, which is very similar to a bill I introduced last year. This bill hands management of the gray wolf back over to the states by removing protections under the ESA that are no longer necessary. We are fortunate in Wyoming that the gray wolf has finally been delisted, but the wolf is still listed in many other states throughout the country. I voted for this bill and am pleased that it passed out of the Natural Resources Committee, and I look forward to it passing out of the House. 
Rules Committee
My colleagues and I reviewed three bills collectively known as the Tax Cuts 2.0 package to ensure the GOP tax plan continues to help American families put more of their hard-earned money back in their pockets. My colleagues and I voted to send the American Innovation Act to promote business innovation, Family Savings Act to encourage retirement and family savings, Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act, and the American Innovation Act to the House floor, and I was proud to vote for them when they were considered on the House floor on Thursday and Friday. Thanks to President Trump and the tax cuts passed last year, our economy is finally beginning to grow again. These bills will build upon that success and I hope they will be considered and passed by the Senate.
The committee also voted to send to the House floor a resolution that criticizes the City of San Francisco for allowing illegal immigrants to vote in local elections. I supported this resolution and certainly agree that allowing illegal immigrants to vote devalues the voting power of U.S. citizens.
Armed Services Committee
As a member of the Air Force Caucus I was honored to join my colleagues at a meeting with Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson and Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein. We had an important discussion about the future of the Air Force and the importance of our continued investment in order to strengthen our military. Secretary Wilson also discussed the awarding of a contract to replace the aging Huey’s at F.E. Warren. This contract award was an important and long-awaited step towards ensuring the men and women serving at F.E. Warren have the resources they need to accomplish the critical mission of keeping our missile sites safe and secure.   
Visits
￼ 
I had the honor of visiting the terrific new spaces of the University of Wyoming Marna M. Kuehne Foundation Veterans Services Center in Laramie. It’s a great facility that is providing important services and support to the veteran community at UW. Congratulations to the terrific team, thank you for the tour, and, most importantly, thank you for all you are doing for our UW veterans.
 ￼ 
It is always great to be in Cody for the Buffalo Bill Center of the West Patrons Ball. I had the privilege of spending time with some of the wonderful folks from Northwest Battle Buddies and the best VP.
 ￼ 
I had an excellent meeting with several of Wyoming’s superintendents and teachers from across the state whose schools participate in the Impact Aid program. We discussed the ways these funds are implemented to best benefit the students who attend these schools.
 ￼ 
It was great to meet with Brian and Peach Tyrell from Cheyenne, Kevin Ward from Rawlins, Scott Cargill from Gillette, Dick Hammer from Sheridan, and Marsha Allen from the Wyoming Automobile Dealers Association and discuss several important issues facing their industry.
￼  
I want to thank everyone from Wyoming Wranglers who met with me about supporting ongoing initiatives at F.E. Warren and the work their doing to help strengthen the economy of Cheyenne.  
 ￼ 
Thank you, Dale and the Greater Cheyenne Chamber of Congress for hosting the Wyoming delegation on Wednesday. I was honored to provide Dale with a copy of a statement I submitted to the Congressional Record honoring Dale, his great work for the City of Cheyenne and his well-deserved award as Wyoming Chamber of Commerce’s Director of the Year.  
Newsworthy
I encourage everyone to read this article about legislation I introduced to allow our state to properly manage the grizzly bear population. 
“The debate over the first grizzly bear hunts in decades is far from over. Congresswoman Liz Cheney introduced the Grizzly Bear State Management Act yesterday, which directs the Department of the Interior to de-list the Yellowstone grizzly population once again.”

Last week, I introduced bipartisan legislation in the House and Senate to combat our nation’s infant mortality crisis. Congress has finally come together to put an end to infant mortality because in a nation as resource rich as ours, no mother should ever lose their baby.  LEARN MORE


Tax Scam 2.0: A Whole Lot of Nothing

￼
This month, I took to the House to protest the GOP’s latest attempt take from the poor and give to the rich. Tax Scam 2 is more of the same tax breaks for the richest Americans, in exchange for debt, health insecurity, and retirement uncertainty for Main Street Americans.  LEARN MORE

Employee-Owned Manufacturers Meet and Greet 
One week ago, the House passed Tax Reform 2.0. Advancing this important piece of legislation has been one of my biggest goals as a member of the Ways and Means Committee. Tax Reform 2.0 would ensure America’s middle-class workers and small businesses keep more of what they earn, help families better save for their future, and encourage new start-up businesses.
One of the many businesses in the 24th district benefitting from the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is an employee-owned manufacturer that I had the pleasure of meeting with earlier this week to discuss how these reforms are impacting their business and employee wages. By making the individual tax cuts permanent, providing families with the financial tools they need to succeed in the form of expanded savings accounts, and removing stringent and burdensome regulations, we will ensure the American economy remains the most competitive in the world.
￼

￼

Human Trafficking Survivor Tax Relief Act
I introduced the bipartisan Human Trafficking Survivor Tax Relief Act, which would make civil damages, restitution, and any other monetary award given to human trafficking survivors exempt from federal income taxes. Victims of human trafficking should be able to file their taxes without fear of penalty or audit from the IRS. One of the world’s fastest growing crimes, human trafficking remains a serious problem in the United States. While we work to eliminate this heinous crime, we must also find ways to aid the victims and survivors.

Marchant Opioid Bill Passes Congress

The Promoting Outpatient Access to Non-Opioid Treatments Act recently passed both chambers of Congress. This bill ensures there are no financial incentives for prescribing opioids with other treatments available and the inclusion of non-opioid treatments which will combat the opioid epidemic. No person or entity should financially benefit from over-prescribing opioids that take advantage of our friends and family members who rely on pain management medication to complete daily tasks. 

￼


Unemployment Falls to Lowest Level since 1969

For the first time since December of 1969, the US unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent. Our economy continues to strengthen, producing low unemployment and steady wage growth. We're seeing historical economic numbers across the board that can't be denied. There are more jobs than people to fill them and companies are fighting over workers with increased benefits and added perks. 

￼

Constituents, Meetings, Hearings, and Mark-ups

September was a busy month on Capitol Hill. I had the opportunity to chat with constituents about current events and what an average day of work looks like in the halls of Congress. The Ways and Means Committee, on which I sit, held a Mark-up on Tax Reform 2.0 to debate changes and speak of the economic benefits it would bring American families and small businesses. The committee also hosted hearings on securing taxpayer information and how to keep it out of the hands of bad actors. I had the chance to meet with different organizations and advocates raising awareness about various topics including juvenile diabetes and the 10th Annual North Texas Giving Day, an event raising money for local non-profits. I always appreciate listening to constituents and hearing how I can better represent them, and the the 24th District of Texas, in Congress.

Happy Friday -  
What a week it has been - and it's not even over. I'm enjoying my time in Arizona, spending time with family, friends, and constituents. We truly live in the greatest district in the greatest country in the world. I always keep that thought at the forefront of my mind as I strive to serve you to the best of my abilities. Here's a congressional update for this week...
Fix the Phoenix VA 
￼ 
This week, I introduced the Phoenix VA Congressional Oversight Act to finally transform one of the most-poorly run VA hospitals in the nation. This legislation helps the Arizona congressional delegation address some of the challenges that are impeding progress at the Phoenix VA. Our veterans deserve the high-quality service they were promised, and I’m tired of the inadequate results we’ve seen thus far. Read more about my efforts here. 
Confirm Judge Kavanaugh 
￼ 
Today, the U.S. Senate voted to advance the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the U.S. Supreme Court, setting up a final vote tomorrow (Saturday). I firmly believe that Judge Kavanaugh has the integrity and qualifications to serve on the highest court in the land. Please keep our Senators in your thoughts and prayers as they prepare to cast their votes tomorrow.
New Podcast Episode 
￼ 
Given the brutal confirmation fight over the past couple months, I was especially excited to interview Andrew McCarthy, a National Review Contributing Editor and one of the leading voices of reason throughout this process. Click the logo above or this link to listen. This is one episode you’re not going to want to miss out on. 
Guardian of Small Business 
￼ 
Last week, the National Federation of Independent Business gave me the 'Guardian of Small Business' award for my pro-small business record in the 115th Congress. I am grateful to have voted to decrease regulations and taxes to help small businesses in my district - and across the nation - grow and succeed in this thriving economy.
Out in the District 
￼ 
Thank you to Fellowship Square-Mesa for recently hosting me for a tour and town hall. I was excited to meet the residents and talk about the issues important to them. It’s important to travel around this district when Congress is not in session, and I appreciate the feedback from everyone I interact with.
Continued Economic Success 
￼ 
Lots of news today, but I didn't want to miss the early morning report of September's unbelievable unemployment numbers - the lowest these figures have been since 1969. Our pro-growth policies at the federal level are paying dividends around the nation, allowing countless Americans to reap the rewards for themselves, their families and their businesses. We're working to continue the momentum with more regulatory overhauls and Tax Reform 2.0 - stay tuned!
Legislative Update 
￼ 
Great news - four bills in our Endangered Species Act modernization package recently passed the House Committee on Natural Resources! I thank Chairman Rob Bishop and Chairman Paul Gosar for their leadership in moving the Western Caucus ESA modernization package forward. This package is critical for the west and will help millions of Americans around the country by protecting local interests – not special interests. I'm hopeful that my bill, the List Act and the rest of the bills in the package will soon be considered by and pass the committee.

Congressman Courtney visiting Fitch High School in Groton
  Groton Public Schools Awarded $750,000 STEM Grant from the Department of Defense  Earlier this week, Groton Public Schools was awarded a grant for $750,000 from the Department of Defense to increase Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) comprehension. This funding is great news for Groton and it will go a long way to bolster their already impressive STEM curriculum. Education funding from the Department of Defense is particularly important for towns like Groton where the school system serves many military families. Because military installations are tax exempt, it creates a burden on host communities, so these schools rely on the federal government for additional funding. As ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee and a senior member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, I am very happy this grant funds educational programs for our future generations AND supports our military families.

A Manufacturing Pipeline Graduate Returns as Instructor 

This post is part of the Constituent Corner series sharing stories of successful casework outcomes for residents of the Second Congressional District 

Justin Stanley, a marine veteran from Brooklyn, CT represents a shining success for Eastern Connecticut’s manufacturing pipeline. After 4 years of serving his country overseas in Asia, Justin found employment in a variety of jobs back home, but he wanted to find a stable career to support him and his family. Through his local veteran’s representatives, Justin heard about the advanced manufacturing program at Quinebaug Valley Community College (QVCC) and it was there that he discovered what would become his life’s work. 
At QVCC Justin studied manufacturing technologies, graduating after only three semesters and garnering himself an internship at Micro-Precision. Following his internship, he was offered a full-time position as a machinist, where he spent the next 5 years mastering his craft. Now, Justin has returned to QVCC, this time as an educator to show others the path to creating a career in advance manufacturing. 
Justin’s story is like many other graduates of the manufacturing pipeline program administered by the Eastern Connecticut Workforce Investment Board. I helped create the manufacturing pipeline in 2015 by working with Secretary of Labor Tom Perez to secure a $6 million-dollar federal grant to get the program up and running. 
Now, local community colleges help to train students in the skills needed to meet the growing demand of the submarine industry and other manufacturing initiatives in the region. It has been hailed as a model of success for other programs across the country in a wide variety of industries including insurance and health care as well as manufacturing and defense. I am proud to support the work that QVCC and other Eastern Connecticut’s community colleges are doing to provide a high-quality education to their students. 
￼
Fighting to Restore Net Neutrality  
It is not surprising that large telecommunications companies are suing to block California’s net neutrality law because they stand to make a fortune after the FCC repealed federal net neutrality rules earlier this year. The repeal of net neutrality opened the door for broadband companies to institute pay-for-play schemes to maximize profit by throttling internet services for the users of popular websites like YouTube and Netflix. This change will lead to consumers paying more money for the same internet services they previously received. I believe that an internet that favors the deep pockets of big corporations will have a negative impact on small business in Connecticut while driving up costs for consumers. 

That is why I joined my colleagues in both the House and Senate in signing a ‘friend of the court’ amicus brief in support of consumer advocates, tech companies, small businesses and state Attorneys General that are appealing the FCC’s decision. The internet has been a platform for innovation and growth for as long as it has existed, and the decision to jeopardize fair access was an enormous mistake. I will continue to fiercely oppose the repeal of net neutrality, and work alongside my colleagues in Congress to reinstate an open internet.
I hope you enjoyed this snapshot of my work, and as always thank you for taking a moment to read my weekly update. If you have any questions or concerns about the information in this newsletter, you can contact me through my website or by calling my Norwich district office at 860-886-0139.

Dear Friend,   
Right in our neighborhood, in Bellevue, is the United States Strategic Command, also known as USSTRATCOM.  Their mission is to deter strategic attack and, if necessary, deploy strategic forces as the ultimate guarantor of our security and our allies.  It’s a place of highly dedicated, highly specialized professionals, whose grave responsibility is to prepare for war, including nuclear war--in order to deter it.  A long time ago, as a deterrent confidence-building measure, the Russians were invited to view the inner workings of the facility.  Their commander had a hard time believing that he was actually seeing the real command center.
Several decades ago, the world cared deeply about nuclear security and arms control.  Epic negotiations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union took center stage.  The Reagan-Gorbachev summits were imbued with a grandeur and star power that signaled how deeply the world cared about their success.
Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the issue of broad-based nuclear security has largely disappeared from the world’s attention and the front pages of newspapers.  Yet today the challenge of nuclear proliferation is more serious, nuanced, and complicated.  From rising tensions with Russia, to India and Pakistan border disputes, to North Korea’s decisions and Iran’s potentiality, the threat of a limited nuclear war or--with the rise of global jihad--a radiological dirty bomb attack has increased since the Cold War.  Due to these developments, we are projected to be only two minutes away from midnight, according to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists’ doomsday clock, the closest we have been to colossal extinction since the height of the Cold War. 
In Congress, I created the bipartisan Congressional Nuclear Security Working Group to address these concerns.  As a launching point for further engagement, I recently led a discussion with nuclear experts from the Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations, senior government officials, and retired military officers with experience in nuclear policy in complex organizations.  In frank talk, we explored how to better address today’s proliferation challenges through improved coordination of U.S. counter- and non-proliferation efforts.
Here’s the good news.  We’ve been successful in preventing and countering the spread of materials and technologies used to produce nuclear weapons.  These efforts include diplomatic and arms control initiatives out of the State Department, the counter-WMD (weapons of mass destruction) operations of the Defense Department, the non-proliferation endeavors at the Energy Department, and all the quiet work done in dozens of offices and agencies across the government.  Luckily, a certain unity of effort among dedicated professionals has kept us safe.
Here’s the tougher news.  Numerous outside organizations, from independent commissions to the Government Accountability Office, have voiced concern about the level of coordination between these nonproliferation entities and the activities they oversee.  The core question is this: How do we measure success in preventing what did not happen?  Should we do more?  Should we reimagine the threat infrastructure response?
We have recently undertaken a massive effort to modernize and assure the reliability of our nuclear arsenal.  The initiative came out of ongoing considerations by the U.S. Nuclear Weapons Council.  I have proposed a parallel entity called the Nuclear Nonproliferation Council, whose purpose will be to examine what we are doing and give us the highest possible assurance that we are preventing the spread of nuclear weapons technology and materiel.
We must work aggressively to get the possibility of a nuclear event as close to zero as possible.  We have made essential strides towards guaranteeing the reliability of our weapons to ensure deterrence, but we need a corresponding emphasis on preventing new nuclear threats from arising. 
These are not topics any of us want to think about because they are hard and frightening.  Yet the highest purpose of our government is to keep you safe.  To react to a nuclear incident is too late.  
  
  
Sincerely, ￼  Congressman Jeff Fortenberry

Congresswoman Plaskett Responds to Caneel Bay Editorial


One of the true joys I have in being the elected Delegate to Congress from the Virgin Islands of the United States is representing my people who have a proud history of being independent-minded, uniquely resilient, physically and emotionally strong, with an intimate understanding of their history. After the hurricanes of 2017 tore through our home, I consistently highlighted these qualities when speaking to members of Congress and the national media outlets, many of whom continue to be astonished by the fortitude of our people.  

Since the late summer and fall of 2017, my staff — both in the Virgin Islands and in Washington — have fought to make legislative and regulatory changes towards ensuring Virgin Islanders whose lives have been upended by these disasters be entitled to every possible federal benefit to which other United States citizens residing on the mainland can receive in similar circumstances. 

My offices have provided services and fielded requests from many sectors of our community including residents in public housing facilities and farmers whose livelihoods may depend on the territory securing additional support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

We also heard from teachers and students hoping to experience a sense of normalcy in their classrooms after months of uncertainty in their own homes, and small business owners trying to prevent the loss of their life’s work. We have engaged in legislative negotiations, hearings, phone calls, news interviews, and robust debate to facilitate our rebuilding and growth. 

In December of 2017, I introduced legislation in Congress, H.R. 4731, a bill to extend the retained use estate (RUE) for Caneel Bay Resort.  The storms essentially destroyed Caneel Bay; but unlike other commercial businesses that also suffered significant damage, the hotel property is situated on federal National Park Service land with only a few years remaining on a long-term lease agreement. 

Consequently, any decision by Caneel Bay’s ownership — CBI Acquisitions (CBIA) — to secure and invest the capital needed for a rebuild will likely depend on obtaining federal approval for an extension of its lease agreement.

CBIA seeking an extension to the lease agreement is, of course, to obtain sufficient time to recoup the over $100 million investment and financing they—not the Virgin Islands or federal government—would make in rebuilding the property.  

CBIA was already in a five-year negotiation with a federal bureaucracy proven to be unresponsive and unwilling to prioritize a lease negotiation in the Virgin Islands.   

For months, the St. John community has extensively debated and discussed the fate of Caneel Bay and that of H.R. 4731.  I am certain additional dialogue will take place in the near future. St. Johnians and Virgin Islanders have every right to ask questions about issues affecting their island and the potential impacts of those issues on their lives.  

Some people have questioned my motives or the timing for introducing a bill that would seek to assist a business in my district.  First, they stated the bill was moving too fast. Then, some questioned how much the resort was paying in rent. Others then opined the rent was insufficient until they learned the funds were paid to the federal government, not the local government.  Some questioned the term of the lease agreement, the height of the buildings, and the number of rooms to be built.  All are questions that were discussed and negotiated with the resort owner.  

Caneel Bay has been a rare and distinct property that is seen as one of the premier resorts in the region, and for decades, a significant driver of the St. John economy, creating jobs for some and memories for others over the years. Has the resort always gotten it right?  Of course not.  Is there room for CBIA to improve on its future commitment to St. John and its people?  Without question. We have had frank conversations with the owner about this, and the company has admitted as much.

Local media and news outlets have also proffered their perspectives with
varying degrees of factual accuracy, but nonetheless, have attempted to sway the community in one direction or the other.  This is all an expected and integral part of public debate.  This process reflects who we are as Virgin Islanders.  

As an elected federal official, I have a responsibility to ensure everyone can be heard and can appropriately petition the government, particularly in the aftermath of two category-5 hurricanes that ripped homes, families, and livelihoods apart.  But to be clear, one of the tenets of my leadership is to grow a diverse, robust economy for the people of the Virgin Islands, not for a particular individual, special interest group, or a specific private enterprise.  I see the rebuilding of Caneel Bay as a 5-star iconic resort as absolutely critical to the economic stability of St. John and the overall tourism portfolio of the Virgin Islands. 

To state that I would sponsor legislation to give a developer a financial windfall with no benefit to the people of the territory calls into question my moral compass and questions my intellectual ability.  On both counts I take issue.  

I note, with interest, the local news outlet’s elevation of the original owner—Lawrence Rockefeller—to a benevolent patrician to the people of St. John shows the paper’s own callous ignorance or indifference to the complicated history and continued pain endured by many St. Johnians in the creation of the National Park.

When all is said and done, the people of St. John and the Virgin Islands will ultimately determine the outcome of Caneel Bay – not me, not the media, and not any sole elected member of the local or federal government.  

The fate of Caneel Bay resides with the collective voices and actions of the resort employees, vendors, and taxi owners, who will choose to take either an active or passive role in discussions about the future of Caneel and of their capacity to continue providing for their families.  

Make no mistake, the fate of Caneel Bay resides with the decisions of Virgin Islanders and whether they choose to petition the territorial government to elevate this issue as a priority and subsequently a more urgent matter for the federal government as it considers the Island’s ongoing recovery.  

In short, any movement in Congress on H.R. 4731, or lack thereof, can and will only be determined by an engaged citizenry of Virgin Islanders out of concern for their well-being and that of the territory. I challenge all of our people to weigh the cost of silence on this issue, essentially ceding your voice to others who might not represent your best interest.  

I will continue to listen for those voices and continue to work for the collective good of the entire Virgin Islands community.

Leveling the Playing Field for Upstate Dairy Farmers
Upstate dairy farmers have been suffering from limited access to Canadian markets for years, and the creation of the Class 7 pricing scheme only made things worse. Over the last few years, the volume of milk production in Canada has increased, which led both the province of Ontario as well as the national government to create new class pricing structures, Class 6 and Class 7, respectively. These classes apply to ingredients like milk powders and protein concentrates, pricing them at artificially low rates. This results in surplus product being dumped on the global market, significantly disadvantaging upstate farmers.
I am glad to see the U.S., Canada, and Mexico reach a trade agreement that levels the playing field and is a big victory for our local dairy farmers. The new agreement will eliminate the Canadian Class 6 and 7 pricing systems, while also increasing market access for U.S. dairy farmers.  
I have been actively working with local dairy farmers and my Agricultural Advisory Committee to identify the impacts of Canadian pricing on local dairy farms and develop pragmatic solutions to improve the economic situation for our Upstate farmers. I am pleased that many of my recommendations have been included in the new trade agreement.

Advocating for the Safety of our Children on Airplanes
Currently, the emergency medical kits on commercial airlines are not required to have child-sized medical equipment or doses of medicine. On Wednesday, the Senate passed the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorization, which included my provision, the bipartisan Airplane Kids in Transit Safety (KiTS) Act. This would require airlines to update the emergency medical equipment on passenger aircraft with children’s health and safety needs in mind.
At 30,000 feet in the air, families should have peace of mind that in the event of an in-flight medical emergency, the airplane will be equipped with medical supplies suited for children—not just adults.

Kingston Hospital Awarded Federal Funding to Increase Mental Health Awareness
For too long, mental illness was overlooked, and treatment was underfunded. In recent years, we have taken great strides to bolster mental health programs and increase awareness within our communities. I am pleased that the HealthAlliance Hospital, Mary’s Avenue campus in Kingston was awarded over $120,000 in federal funding to continue raising awareness of mental health issues in the greater Kingston area by training key members of the community to identify and respond to those most vulnerable. This funding will allow the hospital to continue to provide dynamic and compassionate care to our neighbors struggling with mental illness.

Upstate New York Receives Major Disaster Declaration
Earlier this week, the Trump Administration granted a Major Disaster Declaration to advance relief efforts in seven Upstate counties, including Broome and Delaware, that were severely impacted by August’s unprecedented rainfall and flash flooding. As local families and businesses face millions in damage costs, this disaster declaration will provide critical support to the dedicated state and local efforts to repair and protect our communities.
In late September, I advocated for this declaration alongside Congresswoman Tenney (R-NY) to help supplement state and local disaster recovery efforts and further assist the impacted residents rebuild and better prepare for future flooding.
More about this disaster declaration can be found here: https://bit.ly/2DS7JO0. 

Celebrating the New Health Quest Medical Practice in Kingston
It was a pleasure to join in celebrating the brand-new, state-of-the-art Health Quest Medical Practice facility in Highland earlier this week. With over 10 care providers, ranging from primary care physicians to cardiologists, the new HQMP medical office offers quality and accessible health care services to the greater Ulster County community.
￼

Meeting with Delaware County's Small Business Community
The many small businesses within our Upstate communities continue to make great contributions to our vibrant local economies. I had the opportunity to speak with many small business owners and employees from around Delaware Co. to learn about their unique products and services at the Delaware County Community & Small Business Expo. Ensuring these businesses and their hardworking employees have the tools to thrive will always be a priority of mine.
￼

Seeing our Upstate Veterans Off on Honor Flight
Our cities and towns in Upstate New York are home to dedicated veterans and servicemen and women. I had the opportunity to meet many local veterans before they embarked on a one-day, expense-paid honor flight to our nation’s capital through Patriot Flight. Honor flights provide area veterans a trip to Washington, D.C. to view the memorials erected in honor of their brave service to our country and are the only opportunity some veterans have to visit their monuments. It was great to see so many Upstate heroes.

Stemming Shipment of Synthetic Opioids is Central to Combating Opioid Crisis
""Matthew Azimi, 36, had overdosed, not in an abandoned house or a dank basement, but in a faculty restroom at a special education high school in the Bronx. He taught there. His students, some of them severely disabled, had just been dismissed for the day."" Mr. Azimi's death was the result of a fentanyl overdose.
Fentanyl continues to cause destruction and pain in communities around the country and in Upstate New York. Both the House and Senate have taken a major step to stem the flow of deadly synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, into our communities by passing a comprehensive opioid package, H.R. 6, that contained provisions of the legislation I championed, the STOP Act. The STOP Act would require advanced tracking data on international packages shipped through the U.S. Postal Service, helping us to better identify and intercept these illicit shipments. 
In addition to the STOP Act, H.R. 6 builds on previous efforts to help our local communities and families that are being devastated by this crisis. This comprehensive package focuses on key areas such as improving treatment for those battling addiction by making available more resources for recovery centers and increasing access to medication-assisted treatment, as well as increasing the opioid-related education for seniors on Medicare Part D. Next stop is the President’s desk to be enacted into law.   Read more about the devastating impact of synthetics here: https://nyti.ms/2Q4Ctgt  Read more about the opioids package here: https://wapo.st/2xXBjfx

Congratulations to SUNY Ulster for Receiving $400k Funding Award
Congratulations to SUNY Ulster for being awarded over $400,000 in federal funding. This grant award will allow the institution to improve their capacity to better serve low-income students by increasing access to student services, enhancing their ability to identify at-risk students, and bolstering advising programs.
SUNY Ulster continues to provide a vital service to countless members of the Hudson Valley community: access to an affordable and dynamic education.

U.S. Labor Market Remains Strong
Last week, we saw the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fall to an almost 49-year low. We must allow this momentum to continue by keeping taxes low and regulations in check. We also need to help ensure workers have the skills and training they need to fill the jobs that are available.

 U.S.-Canada-Mexico Trade Agreement 
The new trade agreement announced this week is tremendous news for our North Country economy, and I applaud negotiators for their tireless work. I have been a strong advocate for modernizing our trade agreement with Canada and Mexico in Congress, and I am pleased that this framework will open up the Canadian dairy markets for our North Country farmers who have been struggling. Canadian trade has supported millions of jobs since NAFTA took effect, and reaching this agreement is critical to the continued success of our region.

Dear Lindsey,
This is Congressman Steve Russell here to give you an update on what we have been up to in Washington over the last few weeks. 
September was a busy month in Congress. We have been hard at work to ensure we are listening to the American people and addressing your needs in ways you’ll see back home.
As some of you may know, Sept. 30 marked the end of the 2018 Fiscal Year. The end of each Fiscal Year means making sure key departments are funded to keep our government running smoothly. These departments help our keep our military operational, provide workforce training, feed the needy and help veterans find employment – and those are just some of the things we voted to support last month.
 
Rebuilding Our Military and Supporting Veterans' Care
I was proud to vote for legislation to rebuild our military and support the Department of Veterans’ Affairs when I supported favor of the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act last month.
This bill provides nearly $87 billion to support the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, an increase of $5 billion above the FY18 level. This money will provide funding for veterans’ health care benefits and help speed up claim processing times for more than 450,000 veterans waiting for compensation they rightfully earned through their service.
Oklahomans know how badly the VA needs our help. More than 287,000 veterans call Oklahoma home and one of our main duties in Congress is to help care for these brave men and women who have served our country, even after they return home. This funding will help us meet veterans’ needs in Oklahoma and will help with construction and renovation of the Oklahoma City VA Medical Center, which serves 48 counties in the state.
 
Combating the Opioid Epidemic
I also supported a historic funding package to combat the opioid epidemic. Opioids have put Oklahoma in a crisis. In 2016, 66 percent of drug deaths in our state were due to prescription or over-the-counter drugs. This number is simply too high.
Congress has set aside more than $6.6 billion to fight and end this crisis. This money will fund recovery programs, treating those who so desperately need our help to survive and overcome this devastating addiction.
 
Reauthorizing the FAA: A Win for Oklahoma
Oklahoma had an especially big win when we passed the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) Reauthorization Act on Sept. 26. This legislation gives the FAA a long-term funding solution which is absolutely vital to stabilize our aviation industry. 
We know how important the aviation industry is to our way of life as Oklahomans. Oklahoma’s Fifth District is home to the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center where more than 6,300 federal aviation employees work and professionals learn how to become air traffic controllers. More than 76,000 air traffic controllers train here each year.
One thing this bill did not include was the privatization of the country’s air traffic control system – and that is a good thing for our community. Privatization would have threatened the national security of our airspace and would have put those 6,300 jobs at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center at risk. 
That’s not all. Passengers also have something to cheer about with the FAA Reauthorization Act – this measure sets minimum legroom standards which means more room for passengers on airplanes.
 
Holding Rogue Government Officials Accountable
I’m still working hard to fight against corrupt government officials and crack down on fraud and waste – which is why I am proud the House passed my bill to hold rogue government officials accountable. Under my bill, the Inspectors General Subpoena Authority Act, inspectors general will be allowed to issue testimonial subpoenas for contractors, grant recipients and former federal employees to carry out their authorized oversight duties.
Compelling former employees to testify during investigations has been an ongoing problem in the Executive Branch. Multiple inspectors general have testified to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform about the need to remedy this issue, since they are currently unable to obtain critical information through these former employees for investigations.
In big bureaucracies like the federal government, it’s not difficult to conceal wrongdoings. It is even easier to conceal those wrongdoings when employees refuse to comply and leave their federal employment behind. This is completely unacceptable and it is our duty as Members of Congress to provide this oversight for our federal government. I’m glad my colleagues in the House agree.
 
George Washington's Counsel for America Today
We all are keenly aware of the partisan divide which seems to be everywhere in our country today. I've been reflecting on this issue lately and took to the floor to ponder what type of counsel our country's first father, George Washington, might have for our nation today. 
I think Washington would tell us to get reacquainted with unity and tell us to come together as a nation, before region, before party before self. It's time for us to put our country before self again so we can inspire, lead, unify and sacrifice. It's time for us to get to work.
Watch my floor speech here. 
That’s what’s been happening lately in Washington. As always, if you need help with any issues, don’t hesitate to call my office and if you need help with any federal agencies, you can make an appointment with my district staff who would be more than happy to help.
It is an honor to represent you in Congress. I hope you have a great weekend.
 
God bless,
￼

October 5, 2018 
Dear friend,  Today President Donald Trump signed H.R. 4, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, and I am proud to say that several provisions I inserted will now become law to help protect communities from wildfires and other disasters and build infrastructure projects in California faster.  My SMART Rebuilding Act provisions will save lives and taxpayer dollars by incentivizing more resilient construction, positioning us to more quickly recover in the future. This bill enables states and communities to build stronger both before disaster strikes by establishing a National Public Infrastructure Pre-disaster Mitigation Fund to improve infrastructure. Additionally, the legislation includes building standard implementation and enforcement as a reimbursable expense in the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Public Assistance program. According to FEMA, every $1 invested in mitigation results in $4 in disaster cost savings for our taxpayers. In the last two years, the U.S. has seen mass destruction from large-scale wildfires to hurricane winds and flooding, costing the American taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars in disaster relief.  In addition to disaster mitigation, the FAA Reauthorization includes Rep. Denham’s provision to reduce the burden of environmental reviews by improving an existing Denham law that established the Program for Eliminating Duplication of Environmental Reviews. Under the program, state laws that are more comprehensive than the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) may preempt federal law, allowing states like California to undertake only one review. This will reduce project timelines and costs, delivering much-needed infrastructure projects faster and more efficiently. The new provision passed in the FAA Reauthorization further improves the process, reducing the period of time when lawsuits can be filed against project review documents from 2 years to 150 days, which is the federal standard for highway projects. The result is less liability for project sponsors and a more attractive program for California. Project reviews take too long, costing American businesses and taxpayers trillions of dollars. With this bill, California will participate in my program that drastically streamlines major infrastructure projects to keep pace with our country’s ever-growing infrastructure needs.  To read my full press release, click here.  Around the District 
￼
This week I spent time with the Modesto and Ceres Police Departments at their “Coffee with Cops” events to build relationships in our community. Great to see so many engaged citizens getting to know our local law enforcement who keep our communities safe every day.  Thank-A-Vet Thursday: Petty Officer 2nd Class William (Bill) Canfield of Manteca This month I honor Petty Officer 2nd Class William (Bill) Canfield, a U.S. Navy Veteran, who served during the Vietnam War. Bill enlisted in the U.S. Navy on Sept. 9, 1961 at age 20 as an Aviation and Nuclear Weapons Storekeeper aboard the USS Princeton LHP5. He participated in the Chu-Lai invasion where his ship served as a launching pad for a Marine battalion and provided support for the ground combat elements to gain a foothold at the beginning of the invasion. For his service, Bill was awarded the Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal and Vietnam Service Medal. Bill is a longtime resident of Ripon and the new commander for VFW post 6311 in Manteca. To watch excerpts from his interview, click on the image below or visit my YouTube channel and official Facebook page.

USMCA
Earlier this week, the administration announced the completion of its revised trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. This trade agreement with our neighbors is great news for farmers and manufacturers throughout Wisconsin who rely on the availability of foreign markets for success. 

Most importantly, the trade deal is good news for dairy farmers in Wisconsin who have struggled significantly over recent months. The deal will allow the US to export the equivalent of 3.6% of Canada's dairy market, up from the existing level of about 1%. Additionally, Canada eliminated its Class 6 and 7 pricing systems which allowed low priced dairy ingredients to undersell United States dairy sales in Canada. 

Overall, the deal gives the United States more access to Canada and Mexico's markets which creates more of a level playing field for American farmers and businesses. I look forward to reading the full text of the deal and examining in detail the benefits it will provide Wisconsinites and Americans as a whole.

Unemployment Rate
Last month, the unemployment rate fell to 3.7%, its lowest level since 1969. The last time unemployment was this low, I was in my freshman year of high school. In addition to the remarkable unemployment rate, average hourly earnings across the country went up 2.8%. 

Less people in Wisconsin and throughout the country are having difficulty finding high-paying job opportunities thanks to a legislative agenda that has promoted pro-growth economic policies. It is so great to see the economy flourishing once again and providing opportunities and relief to Americans across the board.

Although the economy is doing excellently and unemployment rates are at record lows, the amount of jobs added to the economy in September did not keep up with the outstanding pace we witnessed in August. Much of this is still due to a lack of skilled workers throughout the country. While our economy remains strong, there is still work to be done to advance and modernize our workforce in order to ensure continued growth and success.   

Postal Service Update 
The investigation into missing mail from the Neenah-Menasha area in the 6th district remains unsolved. The US Postal Service has been working actively with its operations in the area and its distribution center in Milwaukee to try to find a solution to the problem. My staff has been in contact with the Postal Service and has received updates on the investigation and their efforts. Here's what we know.
	•	The entire Milwaukee Processing and Distribution Center has been searched
	•	The truck driver that picked up the mail from the Neenah Post Office has been interviewed
	•	The employees who handled the mail and unloaded the truck at the distribution center have been interviewed
	•	All facilities within the Lakeland District have been searched and notified of the situation
	•	All trailers at each facility have been searched, including those that only store equipment
	•	The U.S. Postal Inspection Service has been contacted and is now heading the investigation
As we receive more news from the postal service, we will continue to keep you updated on the situation. Feel free to contact my Fond du Lac office with any further questions or inquiries.  

Weekly Roundup 
Last week, the House passed bipartisan legislation to help tackle the opioid epidemic and develop a strategy to resolve the crisis. The bill is headed to the President’s desk and includes my legislation to establish a federal inter-agency task force to further address this issue.

￼

It was such a pleasure speaking with and meeting the team from Green Valley Enterprises. Their organization does outstanding work for individuals with special needs, opening them up to employment opportunities and helping them reach their true potential.

￼

￼

Happy Manufacturing Day! Today, we celebrate the manufacturing industry, the thousands of jobs it creates every year, and the growth and productivity it brings to our prospering economy. This week, I celebrated Manufacturing Day with the individuals from New Holland Agriculture in St. Nazianz.

More disaster aid now available

President Trump signed a major disaster declaration for the Northern Marianas on September 29, making two types of federal assistance available to those adversely impacted by Typhoon Mangkhut. The Individuals and Households Program provides financial help or direct services to eligible individuals who are unable to meet immediate needs and expenses. The Public Assistance Program provides reimbursement grants to the commonwealth and certain non-profits to assist with disaster response and recovery, including debris removal, emergency protective measures, and restoring infrastructure. Additionally, low-interest federal disaster loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration are now available for businesses and private nonprofit organizations to repair or replace damaged assets. Homeowners may also be eligible for SBA loans for certain improvement projects. The first step in seeking federal disaster assistance is to contact the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA Disaster Survivor Assistance staff are on Rota, Saipan, and Tinian at these locations:

ROTA: NMC Rota Instructional Site
	•	Monday, 10/8, through Wednesday, 10/10, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

SAIPAN: Joeten-Kiyu Public Library, Susupe
	•	Saturday, 10/6, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
	•	Wednesday, 10/10, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
	•	CLOSED Sunday, 10/7 through Tuesday, 10/9
 
TINIAN: Department of Commerce Building (near the Municipal Baseball Field in San Jose Village)
	•	Saturday, 10/6 from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. 
	•	Monday, 10/8 through Wednesday, 10/10, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
	•	CLOSED Sunday, 10/7
 
To ensure a fast and efficient application process, FEMA recommends having the following information with you:
	•	Social Security Number (one per household)
	•	Address of the damaged home or apartment
	•	Description of the damage
	•	Information about insurance coverage, if any, including policy numbers
	•	Telephone number
	•	Mailing address
	•	Bank account and routing numbers for direct deposit of funds

Please contact your congressional office if you are unable to receive the assistance you need.
 
 

Veterans on Saipan, Tinian, and Rota had an opportunity to meet and speak directly with the consultants putting together the feasibility study for a Community-Based Outpatient Clinic in the Marianas. I included the study as Section 213 of the VA MISSION Act, Public Law 115-182 and I followed up with the Veterans Administration to request that the study include a site visit in the Marianas. On Tuesday I met with Romanyk Consulting President and CEO Nick Romanyk and Senior Planning and Facility Practice Leader Jeff White, who are here doing the work. Their report to the VA is due in November.   
 

VA social worker arrives

Marianas Veterans’ requests for more staffing at the Veterans Health Administration Office on Saipan were fulfilled this week. Mr. William Moore has come on board as a clinical social worker. I worked with the VA leadership over the course of many months to help make this possible. A retired Air Force Major, Moore served as an embedded Combat and Operational Stress Control officer with the 10th Mountain Division of the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. He has had a leadership role in the Air Force suicide prevention program, as well as programs addressing substance abuse, domestic violence, child abuse, and mental health/life skills. From his duty station on Saipan Mr. Moore will visit Rota and Tinian regularly to provide services there. He is also trained in telehealth so he can provide services to veterans directly in their homes over the internet. And he intends to work with other partner agencies in the Marianas, sharing his experience in suicide prevention. I welcome Mr. Moore to our community.
 

Congress says no to $700 CW fee

The U.S. House of Representatives rejected a Trump administration proposal on September 26 to add a new $700 fee to CW permits in the Marianas. Instead the U.S. Department of Labor will be able to reprogram $8.25 million in unused funds to cover the cost of the new labor certifications required by my U.S. Workforce Act, Public Law 115-218. I worked with the appropriation conference committee to block the new fee—which would double the cost of a CW permit—for several weeks. The decision was part of H.R. 6157, the Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019 and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019, which the President signed on September 28. Other important spending decisions:

	•	$15.9 billion for Title I education grants, $100 million more than FY2018 and means more money for our Public School System as a result of the funding formula change I included in the Every Student Succeeds Act.
	•	Military pay increases by 2.6 percent
	•	$10.1 billion for Head Start, $200 million more than the FY2018 enacted level
	•	$12.4 billion for Special Education Part B State Grants (IDEA), $87 million more than the FY2018 level
	•	Increase in the maximum Pell Grant award by $100 to $6,195
	•	$3.7 billion for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), $50 million more than the FY2018 enacted level
	•	$4.4 billion, a $100 million increase, for programs responding to the Opioid Crisis
	•	$5.6 billion, a $200 million increase, for community health centers
	•	$1.9 billion for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s Substance Abuse Grants
	•	$1.5 billion for SAMSHA’s State Opioid Response Grant
	•	$160 million, a $15 million increase, for Registered Apprenticeship Grants (NMC is a registered apprenticeship program)
	•	$2.8 billion for Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Grants to States The Northern Marianas receives approximately $1.43 million a year in Youth, Adult and Dislocated Worker funding under WIOA.
	•	$1.6 billion for Department of Labor worker protection agencies (including OSHA and the Wage and Hour division, which has done much work in the Marianas in the past year).

Also of note in the Continuing Resolution is the temporary re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act through December 7, although this is not the five-year reauthorization that I support as an original cosponsor of H.R. 65545. I was also an original cosponsor when VAWA was last reauthorized in 2013 and included a provision in Section 201 of the Act that doubled the funding allocated to the Northern Mariana Islands for the Sexual Assault Service Program. Section 809 of that law allowed women, who petition for status as victims of human trafficking or violence, to count the time lived in the Northern Marianas as time present in the United States, so they can more quickly adjust to a permanent immigrant status. Now, more than ever, we are all being made aware of how many lives are damaged by acts of sexual harassment and violence. We have to do everything we can to bring federal resources to bear on prevention, healing, and, where required, punishment.
 

New build-up H-2B rules issued

Contractors on projects related to the military build-up on Guam or in the Commonwealth may now employ workers with H-2B visas that are good for up to 3 years, even if the workers’ jobs are not temporary, as is usually required for H-2B visas. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services issued guidance this week on the new exemption that was included in Section 1045 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, Public Law 115-232. The exemption from the usual requirement of temporariness also applies to nurses and other health professional working in facilities that jointly serve the military and civilians. The policy itself is temporary, applying only to H-2B petitions with start dates before December 31, 2023. 
 

New Form I-129CW now required

Employers petitioning for Commonwealth-Only Transitional Workers are now required to use a revised Form I-129CW, issued on August 1, 2018. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will reject CW petitions submitted after October 1 on I-129CW forms with earlier version dates. Revision of the form was necessary because of the new provisions of the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act of 2018, Public Law 115-218. The Workforce Act raised the number of CW permits available for FY19 to 13,000, 8,001 more than the cap set by the Trump Administration. In addition to more CW permits, the U.S. Workforce Act extends the bar on asylum, the exemption from the H visa cap, and the E-2CNMI investor program another 10 years.
 

100% with a star

Thanks to the Humane Society for recognizing my work to end the trade in shark fins and on other animal protection issues. The Society’s Legislative Fund scored me at 100 percent on their annual report card, released today, and gave me an additional leadership star for the Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act, H.R. 1456. The bill I jointly introduced with Chairman Ed Royce (R-California) currently has 257 cosponsors. It is intended to protect sharks and preserve our oceans' fragile ecosystems. In this Congress I have also supported legislation to block the trade in dog and cat meat, prevent horse slaughter, and prevent the Agriculture Department from issuing licenses to dog breeders whose previous licenses have been revoked or suspended. As a pet owner myself, I believe in preventing animal abuse and support reasonable animal welfare measures.
 
 
 

Apply now for academy nomination

Young men and women from the Northern Marianas interested in an exceptional college education at no cost and committed to serving our country should apply now for a congressional nomination to one of the U.S. service academies. As a result of changes I included in U.S. Public Laws 111-84, 111-383, and 114-92, there are openings for the Marianas at all four academies – the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy, and the U.S. Military Academy – for next year’s incoming class. Attending any of the academies is a unique opportunity to obtain a premier education and an officer’s commission in return for five years of service. As your Congressman, I may make nominations, but the final selection among nominees is made by academy admissions officials. They look for strong grades, high SAT or ACT scores, physical ability, and leadership potential. More information and an application form are available at https://sablan.house.gov/serving-you/academy-nominations, and at your local congressional office. Applications are due on Friday, December 7.
 

Justice awards $1.37M

As fiscal year 2018 closed, federal agencies released billions in Congressionally appropriated funds, including from the Department of Justice:

	•	$906,929 to the Commonwealth Judiciary under the Bureau of Justice Assistance Adult Drug Court Discretionary Grant Program for financial and technical assistance to implement and enhance drug courts and veterans treatment courts that effectively integrate evidence-based substance abuse treatment, mandatory drug testing, sanctions and incentives, and transitional services in a judicially supervised court setting. Funds will be used to implement a data-driven strategy for reaching and expanding the capacity of drug court options and services for nonviolent, high risk/high need offenders.

	•	$238,112 to the Northern Marianas Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence to support the organization’s efforts to end domestic and sexual violence in our islands through community outreach, providing training and technical assistance service providers and responders, and other services. I authored the language in Section 311 of U.S. Public Law 111-320, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act that made the Coalition eligible for a state-share of funding. Prior to the change, the Northern Marianas, Guam, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands had to split one state share.

	•	$150,000 to the Northern Marianas Department of Public Safety from the Support for Adam Walsh Act Implementation Grant Program. The funds will be used to maintain the Saipan sex offender registry, support development of registries in Tinian and Rota, and increase public safety and awareness.

	•	$74,344 to the NMI Criminal Justice Planning Agency from the Formula Grants Program authorized under Title II of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. The program funds local delinquency prevention and intervention efforts, including activities to prevent juveniles from engaging in substance abuse, violent crimes, gang activities, and other delinquent acts, as well as identifying youth at risk of delinquency.
 

$13k for mine safety

$13,000 has been awarded to the Commonwealth Government by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration to fund federally mandated safety and health training for miners. The grant provides for training those working on underground and on the surface, including those employed at surface stone, sand and gravel mining operations. Forty-six states, the Navajo Nation, Guam and the Marianas all received funding.
 
 


While on leave visiting family in the Marianas, Marine Corps Staff Sergeant Jonathan Baza Salas stopped by the Saipan district office this week. Always good to see you, SSgt Salas. Thank you for the visit, and thank you for your service.  
 
 

Former Marianas residents Deanna King and Felisa Arnold visited their congressional office in Washington, DC last week. Thank you, both, for stopping by.

Berkeley Heights Awarded $300K For School Safety
Congressman Leonard Lance (NJ-07) helped secure the federal funds for major school security upgrades in Berkeley Heights.
By Alexis Tarrazi, Patch Staff |Oct 5, 2018 1:43 pm ET 
BERKELEY HEIGHTS, NJ — Berkeley Heights has been awarded $297,673 in federal funds for major school security upgrades, which Congressman Leonard Lance (NJ-07) helped secure through a new law, the STOP School Violence Act.
￼
""Our students must be protected against senseless violence to the greatest extent possible. This grant is great news for the Berkeley Heights community and the students, parents and faculty members who count on our schools to be a safe place. Our students need to feel safe in school to learn,"" Lance said.
The bipartisan STOP School Violence Act will offer law enforcement and school officials the expertise, technology and funding needed to identify and prevent threats, according to Lance. 
""The residents of Berkeley Heights are most grateful of the support of Congressman Lance and his efforts in assisting us obtain this vital STOP School Violence grant. This important federal grant will go a long way for our police department and community in helping secure the safety of our schools and most importantly our children,"" Mayor Bob Woodruff said.
The federal funds are being awarded through the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS). The Student Teachers and Officers Preventing (STOP) School Violence Act,which was passed this year, directs funds for training and security measures for schools to better recognize warning signs and institutes reporting systems for potential threats.
It also creates grant funding to bolster school security, educate and train students and faculty, and support law enforcement officers and first responders who arrive on the scene of a school violence incident.

Friends,  
  
What a week!   On Sunday, at midnight, the 2014 Farm Bill expired. That means 39 important Farm Bill programs lost their funding.   Our producers shouldn’t become the punching bag for political jabs. Compromise is a two-way street.   While extremely disappointed, I do not want to undermine the effort that has been put into the Farm Bill, and I am hopeful my colleagues on the left will come around and drop the “my way or the highway” attitudes and negotiate. I also want to make clear that the differences over SNAP are not what is holding up the work on the farm bill.   On a brighter note, the U.S. and Canada struck a deal in the final hours to secure a modernized NAFTA, now called the USMC deal. Last year Kansas exports to Canada totaled $2.5 billion, so having Canada on board is a huge win for Kansas.   And we end the week hopeful that we will #ConfrimKavanaugh, a tried and true constitutionalist. 
  
  
￼ 
  


ECSTATIC! US-Canada Reach NAFTA 
Deal
 
After more than a year of negotiations, I am ecstatic to see Canada agree to a fair deal and join the U.S. and Mexico in reinstating NAFTA, now called the United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement (USMCA). Last year Kansas exports to Canada totaled $2.5 billion dollars, so having Canada on board is a huge win for Kansas. In total, trade supports 400,000 jobs across Kansas. From day one this administration advocated for fair trade agreements. 

The past year has been hard not knowing what agreement would come out of the administration’s tough negotiations, but rural America had confidence in the President and his trade negotiators that we’d strike a better deal. This agreement will eliminate Canada’s class 7 milk pricing scheme and includes provisions requiring equity in grain grading, two significant wins for Kansas. Kansas dairy is a big winner here, and Kansas farmers and ranchers will see the benefit of this deal for decades.

Breast Cancer Awareness Month
Given that October is Breast Cancer Awareness month, I thought it was an opportune time to mention the efforts taken by Congress to improve the diagnosis and treatment of this horrible disease.   During my time as an Obstetrician-Gynecologist, I, unfortunately, saw a number of patients fighting breast cancer.  In the past 30 years, I have seen us get a better understanding and treatment of breast cancer and beyond due to extensive research and federal support for these studies.   I am proud of the work being done by this Congress to better conditions for our patients – after all, improving our nation’s health care system was a top concern driving my run for Congress.   Read my op-ed HERE

FUN FACT: 
I was 9 years old, in the fourth grade, the last time this nation saw record low unemployment numbers like this. Today the Department of Labor announced that the U.S. unemployment rate for September is 3.7 percent, the lowest this country has seen since December 1969. 
o The unemployment rate for those that graduated high school but did not attend college is the lowest since April 2001.
o The unemployment rate for women matches the lowest rate in 65 years. 
o In August, Unemployment in Kansas was at 3.3 percent. (The September Labor Report will be released on Oct. 19th)

WEEK IN REVIEW
￼
To start off this week's From the Front... I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nation’s capital, including members of the Springdale Chamber, Emma Kinsey of Centerton, Ronald and Anna Hudson from Yelville, Shane Acosta and Rachel Turnbull from Springdale, Mark Snodgrass of Bentonville, Emily Hackerson of Springdale, the Miller family from Eureka Springs, the Wager family from Fort Smith, Joseph and Christina Martin from Bentonville, Jena Ramsey of Centerton, Mitchell Nelson of Centerton, Jim Taylor of Rogers, Chip Blanchard of Russellville, Jason Tennant of Eureka Springs, Derek Eckelhoff of Fayetteville, George Purvis of Eureka Springs, Amanda Daniels of Fort Smith, Terry Bracken of Fort Smith, Greta Barr of Fort Smith, and Patti Cross of Fort Smith. Safe travels back to the Natural State.
￼
Businesses and entrepreneurs are the backbone of our local and national economy. It was great to have members of the Springdale Chamber of Commerce visit my DC office and discuss policy issues and their economic priorities. We talked about infrastructure, tax cuts, regulations, and my work as Chairman of the House Budget Committee. The Springdale Chamber helps empower our community businesses. I welcomed their insights and ideas on ways to grow economic opportunity in our region. When local businesses succeed, neighborhoods and families prosper. I appreciated the Chamber’s time and look forward to our continued work together!
￼
The United States is a global leader. It’s critical that we continue to use tough diplomacy to promote stability and increased security across the world. America first does not mean America alone, and it was a pleasure to welcome members of the Parliament Delegation from Georgia to DC. We discussed the importance of democracy, security, and stability to our nations and the international community.
I also met with members of the American Occupational Therapy Association and spoke about health care issues and ways to improve occupational therapy services in Arkansas. Following my DC meetings, I headed back to the Natural State and spent the rest of the week traveling throughout Northwest Arkansas.
In other good news, it was another strong week for the economy. In case you didn’t see, it was reported that:  
	•	U.S unemployment hit its lowest level since 1969 (LINK)
	•	National wage growth reached a 17-month high and is expected to keep growing (LINK) 
	•	New orders for U.S.-made goods recorded their biggest increase in nearly a year in August (LINK)
Our pro-growth agenda is working and continues to deliver results for the American people. Remember to keep an eye on my website or check out my Twitter and Instagram pages to stay up-to-date with the latest news from the Third District and Washington. 
POLICY UPDATE: TRADE
Modernizing policies to reflect the realities of the 21st century global economy is critical to ensuring our nation’s future prosperity. This week’s announcement of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) represents a significant and positive step forward in improving and updating our trade deals with other countries.
USMCA highlights include:  
	•	Updated intellectual property protections 
	•	Increased agricultural market access for American farmers and ranchers
	•	Advanced support for U.S. domestic vehicle and auto parts production
	•	Enhanced labor protections for workers
By standing up for U.S. workers and negotiating from strength, the Trump administration was able to secure a new trade agreement that will further advance America’s interests and priorities. Importantly, this pact will help level the playing field for Arkansas’s agriculture and business economies, creating freer and fairer markets with some of our most vital trading partners.
Canada and Mexico are the United States’ first and third largest exports markets for food and agricultural products, making up 28 percent of total food and agricultural exports in 2017. These exports support more than 325,000 American jobs, including 110,00 jobs in Arkansas. One-third of Arkansas’s exports collectively go to Canada and Mexico. Additionally, Arkansas exports to Mexico are increasing 3.6 times faster than exports to any other country. This new agreement will preserve our critical relationships with Mexico and Canada, while providing increased security and certainty for industries in Arkansas.
We’ve seen a resurgence in economic confidence and opportunity thanks to Republican pro-growth policies – this trade deal will build on that momentum. Expanding our market access will support American businesses and help create more jobs. I look forward to seeing our farmers, ranchers, and local businesses take advantage of the new opportunities this agreement will create once fully implemented.
Congress is expected to vote on approving the trade deal next year. I will be closely following legislative updates related to USMCA in the coming months.

Dear Friend,
September was a big month.
 
The Senate passed–and President Trump signed–the Labor, Health and Human Services funding bill that invests in combatting the opioid epidemic, strengthens workforce training, and continues year-round Pell Grants. And that’s just naming a few of the good things that are in the bill. 
 
My colleagues and I also passed an appropriations bill that includes the largest pay raise for our service members in nearly a decade and invests in Missouri defense priorities. 
 
The Department of Health and Human Services announced that Missouri will receive $31.5 million in new grant funding to help our communities address the opioid crisis. 
 
And my bipartisan bill with Senator Coons to reauthorize the Victims of Child Abuse Act cleared the Judiciary Committee and is now one step closer to becoming law. 
 
Here are 5 photos from other events in September: 
 
1. West Lake Remediation – I attended the signing ceremony for the final EPA decision on the West Lake Remediation Plan with EPA Acting Administrator Wheeler and Congresswoman Wagner. It was good news for all of the families who have waited decades for a solution. 
￼
2. SkillsUSA – I met students from around Missouri who came to Washington to attend SkillsUSA’s Washington Leadership Training Institute. 
￼
3. National Election Security Summit  – I had the opportunity to speak to Secretaries of States at the National Election Security Summit in St. Louis on the work that’s underway to secure our election infrastructure & protect our democracy. 
￼
4. Juvenile Diabetes Research – I spoke with Judy, Bill, and Marlene, Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation members from the Kansas City area, about how critical medical research is to finding new treatments and a cure for Type 1 Diabetes. I appreciate JDRF’s advocacy to make medical research a priority and I’m proud to support their efforts.
￼
5.  Adoption Advocates – As co-chair of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, and an adoptive dad myself, I know how much joy welcoming a child into your home can bring – and the obstacles many families face when they pursue adoption. Ryan and Tarah Craft faced an uphill battle bringing their daughter Jessica from the Democratic Republic of Congo to their home in Missouri. It was an honor to work with them on that process and to see them again in Washington. Glad to hear Jessica is happy and thriving in her forever home. 
￼

Sincere regards, 
￼

Holding the Federal Government to a Higher Standard
￼ 
It recently came to my attention that the Food & Drug Administration was contracting with a company called Advanced Bioscience Resources, which admitted in a 2016 Congressional investigation that it harvested aborted fetuses from abortion clinics for a low price and then sold their components at more than 500% mark-up. Selling any sort of human body part for profit is prohibited by federal law. We must ensure that our government engages in research that is ethical, and because of this, I led a Congressional inquiry (and was joined by 85 of my colleagues) into the FDA’s contract with this company. I also spoke personally with Health & Human Services Secretary Alex Azar about my concerns that research dollars were being used illegally and that this funding should go to alternative forms of research that advance cures and are life-affirming.
  
I’m pleased to announce that following my conversation, Secretary Azar publicly stated the FDA would cancel its contract with Advanced Biomedical Resources and HHS would conduct an agency-wide review of all research involving human fetal tissue and will explore alternative options. I’m thankful HHS is taking steps to make sure its research meets the highest of ethical standards,  We need to find cures without devaluing or destroying human life.
 
Leveling the Playing Field with Canada, Creating a New NAFTA
 ￼ 
This is an important week in America’s trade dealings with its neighbors. On Sunday night, Canada agreed to join the United States and Mexico in a deal to update the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Mexico previously agreed to a new arrangement with the United States, but Canada had not come to the table until this week.
  
The United States and Canada have long been friendly trading partners. In recent years however, Canada has not been dealing on a level playing field with our country. For instance, Canada had imposed a 241 percent tariff on American fluid milk while the U.S. imposed NO tariff on Canadian liquid milk. Thankfully, Canada is willing to negotiate this trade imbalance. Free trade must be fair trade – for the three countries involved in the new agreement.
  
I have been a vocal advocate for finalizing fair trade deals in an expeditious manner and am pleased with the priority the Trump Administration has given to getting good deals for the American people. I look forward to studying this agreement further and appreciate the President fighting for American interests across the world stage.
 
What’s the Hold Up?
￼ 
In this Congress, we’re still waiting for important federal nominees to be confirmed. We still have unfilled positions throughout the government and multiple district judges who have yet to be confirmed. In fact, this Senate has confirmed the fewest nominees of the past four Administrations. Even Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) stated, “Enough is enough. We need people who are qualified to filled these important positions in our government.” I agree. It’s time for the Senate to finish confirming these important positions.
 
Missouri Task Force 1 Heroes Come Home
 ￼ 
Missouri Task Force 1 comes to the aid of a vehicle in Brunswick County, NC, in the wake of Hurricane Florence. 
The Boone County Fire District’s Missouri Task Force 1 has returned home after yet another successful operation protecting Americans in the wake of natural disaster. Task Force 1 got back to Columbia on Saturday after two weeks of searching for and rescuing victims of Hurricane Florence in North Carolina. During its mission, the task force rescued and evacuated 394 residents and 33 pets. In addition, the teams provided wellness checks on 1,374 residents who remained in their homes and provided assistance to 155 residents. The teams also performed damage assessments on 381 structures. I am so proud of their hard work. 
  
How Tax Reform is Working for You
The tax reform package passed almost a year ago continues to bear fruit. AP reports a Kentucky-based home appliances business plans to add 400 jobs as part of a $200 million investment to expand production at its Louisville operation. Since May, GE Appliances has announced more than $475 million of investment in products, manufacturing, and distribution. GE Appliances President and CEO Kevin Nolan said the tax package played “a big role” in the company’s expansion plans.   There is no doubt that tax reform is still providing wonderful benefits for hard-working Americans. 
 
Weekly Dose of Good News
Confidence and optimism create success – and Americans are experiencing a sense of confidence not seen in a long time. In September, the Conference Board’s measurement of Americans’ confidence reached its highest level in 18 years.   Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at the Conference Board, points to a couple of very strong reasons for that confidence: “Consumers’ assessment of current conditions remains extremely favorable, bolstered by a strong economy and robust job growth … These historically high confidence levels should continue to support healthy consumer spending, and should be welcome news for retailers as they begin gearing up for the holiday season.”

Friend:
This week there has been a lot of attention on the confirmation process of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Senate cleared a procedural vote today setting the stage for a final vote on confirmation on Saturday. As a member of the House, I do not have a vote on confirmation, but I would still like to know where you stand on this important issue.

Should Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh Be Confirmed?

Welcoming Home Brick Residents  

 ￼ 
Yesterday I joined Jersey Shore United, Mayor Ducey, and Councilman Fozman to welcome home Greenbriar residents who were displaced following the devastating flooding in August. 100 homes in the Greenbriar community were damaged and more than 50 were destroyed.  
It was an inspiring day, but also one that was filled with hope—hope for the other displaced Greenbriar residents that soon, they too will also return home. 
To watch a recap of our day in Brick, click here. 
 ￼ 
Thursday’s homecoming wouldn’t have been possible without the tireless efforts of Jersey Shore United, law enforcement, and countless volunteers. I visited Brick immediately after the flooding to review the damage and assist with recovery efforts, and it was gratifying to see the outpouring of support and love from friends, neighbors, and the entire Brick community.  
After the storm, I called FEMA Administrator Brock Long and urged him to deploy any and all federal resources to help the Brick community. This is a vulnerable population as most of the victims are seniors. I will continue working with FEMA to ensure the federal government does all it can to help our South Jersey neighbors in need.

“The American economy is fueled by our small businesses, which is why House Republicans have been committed to passing reforms that benefit Main Street, not Wall Street. I was a small business owner for over twenty years, and remember the times when I worried about rising taxes, bureaucratic red tape, and increased healthcare costs; and viewed those in Washington, D.C. as the problem, not the solution. That’s why I support commonsense legislation that aims to get elected bureaucrats out of the way so our small businesses can thrive.”

In the News: House Republicans press Fed to deregulate large banks
 
 
From Politico Pro: 

House Republicans press Fed to deregulate large banks
By: Zachary Warmbrodt

House Republicans are stepping up pressure on the Federal Reserve to take full advantage of May's landmark bank-deregulation bill, warning that they are uneasy with signals the central bank is sending.

Echoing the angst in the banking industry, 29 Republicans in a letter to Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles said regulators should take ""quick action"" to completely remove several domestic and international firms from rules intended to tamp down on systemic risk.

At issue are banks with between $100 billion and $250 billion in assets, which the new law directed the Fed to revisit for lighter-touch regulation.

""[w]e still have concerns with the Fed's posture on this issue going forward as we are unsure if the Fed is committed to fully removing these firms from regulation as a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) if they do not pose a systemic risk to the economy,"" they wrote.

Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) led the letter. It has signatures from senior Financial Services Committee Republicans as well as Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.), the chairman of the financial services appropriations subcommittee. SunTrust, based in Georgia, is one of the banks that could benefit from the upcoming rule changes.

""[w]e are concerned that you have expressed the intention to further review these firms in order to determine how to regulate them,"" the lawmakers said. ""Due to the fact that there have been no past nor any present findings of systemic risk, we strongly believe that the Fed should take quick action to completely remove these firms, both domestic and international, from all SIFI-associated regulations.""

New Tools and Resources to Fight the Opioid Crisis Support for Ukraine Salute: Wilbur Hoffman Salute: New Jersey Manufacturing Salute: Steve Bolcar   
New Tools and Resources to Fight the Opioid Crisis
Our nation is in the midst of the deadliest drug crisis in its history.  We have reached a point where opioid overdoses claim more than 100 lives a day! Unfortunately, in New Jersey we have seen over 2,000 deaths in the last two years.  We are witnessing so much human potential squandered - people at the peak of their lives brought down as they struggle with addiction.
Last Friday, the House approved H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act. This bipartisan bill will help in our overall efforts to combat the opioid crisis by advancing treatment and recovery initiatives, improving prevention, protecting our communities, and bolstering our efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl from China and other countries.
Over the past year, Congress has been working through a bipartisan and collaborative process to complete this legislation. On June 22, the House passed H.R. 6 by a vote of 396 to 14. On September 17, the Senate passed an amended version of the legislation and on September 28 the House passed a final bipartisan, bicameral agreement on H.R. 6 by a vote of 393 to 8.  The final bill was approved by the Senate on October 3 and sent to the President’s desk.
In addition to the reforms included in H.R. 6, my Appropriations Committee included $6.7 billion in funding to combat the opioid crisis in the recent Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Defense-Labor-Health and Human Services (HHS) appropriations package that was approved by Congress and signed into law on September 28. This HISTORIC level of funding boosts programs that fight, treat, and stop substance abuse, and support access to mental health services. These resources include increased funding for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
I would encourage you to read this report by the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers which details the rising cost of opioid abuse in the U.S.  In 2015, the opioid crisis cost the U.S. roughly $504 billion, or 2.8% of that year's GDP.
For more information on H.R. 6 please visit the following links:

Support for Ukraine
I have long considered Russian aggression against Ukraine’s sovereign territory and its people to be a serious threat against the West.   I have taken a leadership role to ensure the United States provides significant assistance to Ukraine and its people. The FY 2019 Defense-Labor-HHS appropriations package, which I introduced, included $250 million in security assistance to Ukraine, a $50 million increase from FY 2018, for conducting military exercises, providing military equipment, and logistics support.
I was pleased to receive the below letter from the bipartisan members of the Ukraine Caucus supporting my efforts!

Salute: Wilbur Hoffman 
On Saturday, I was honored to participate in the Bronze Medal Ceremony for Chief Water Tender Wilbur F. Hoffman, of Livingston, NJ.  Mr. Hoffman, who recently turned 100, was awarded the Bronze Star by Rear Admiral Scott Jerabek for his heroic actions aboard the USS Hughes in World War II. 
Since August 2017, I have been working with Mr. Hoffman’s daughter Janice and Hopatcong Mayor Michael Francis to ensure the Navy provided proper recognition of Mr. Hoffman’s meritorious actions which saved the lives of hundreds of his fellow shipmates.
The ceremony occurred at St. Peter’s Episcopal Church in Livingston, and was widely attended by Mr. Hoffman’s family, members of VFW Post 2856 and American Legion Post 201, as well as, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Greg Slavonic.
The full citation for Chief Hoffman’s Bronze Medal reads:
“For heroic achievement in connection with combat operations against the enemy on 10 December, 1944.  Chief Hoffman distinguished himself by excellent service while in charge of the forward fireroom when the USS HUGHES was hit by a bomb in an engagement with the enemy off Leyte, Philippine Islands.  By his quick thinking and ingenuity, he kept steam on the emergency feed pump, ensuring water pressure to the firemain.  This enabled the repair party to keep the fire under control and eventually extinguish it.  By his bold actions, courage under fire, and total dedication to duty, Chief Water Tender Hoffman reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.”
 
Salute: New Jersey Manufacturing
Today, we take a moment to recognize the hard work and contributions made by the men and women who work in New Jersey’s manufacturing facilities. Starting in 2012, there has been a growing effort across the nation and in New Jersey to celebrate the success of modern manufacturing on the first Friday of October. I would like to personally thank John Kennedy, CEO of the NJ Manufacturing Extension Program (MEP), and his entire team for leading this important effort!
With over 11,000 firms, 378,000 employees and $45 billion in economic output, manufacturing is an extremely critical and growing component of New Jersey’s economy.  I wish all of our manufacturers continued success!
 
Salute: Steve Bolcar
A fond thank you to Steve Bolcar who retired this week after sixty years of public service in his hometown of Hanover Township.  Steve served Hanover Township as a police officer, rising to the rank of Deputy Chief.  In 1978, he took over as supervisor of Hanover’s school crossing guards, running the program until this day. I wish Steve and his wife Sally all the best in their next chapter!
You can read more about Steve’s distinguished career in this article by William Westhoven which ran in the Daily Record.

Dear Friend: 
Here are some of the ways in which I'm fighting hard this week to keep Lower Hudson Valley communities safe, healthy, and secure: 
	•	Announcing Significant Federal Funding Awards for Rockland and Westchester  
	•	Securing Historic Funding Increases for Child Care and Early Childhood Learning  
	•	Helping a Local Business Owner with the SBA
Announcing Significant Federal Funding Awards for Rockland and Westchester 
This week, I was pleased to announce a number of significant federal funding awards that will greatly benefit residents of Rockland and Westchester Counties, including:
	•	A $545,445 Federal Grant to Expand Opportunities for Hispanic Students at WCC. This grant, awarded through the U.S. Department of Education's Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions (DHSI) Program, will help more Westchester Community College students succeed academically and prepare for the workforce.   
	•	$999,872 in Federal Funding to Assist Victims of Trafficking in Rockland County. I'm pleased that the Center for Safety & Change in New City will use these federal funds to enhance and expand critical services for survivors so that they may achieve safety and stability.   
	•	More than $300K in Federal Funding to Combat Opioid Abuse in Orangetown. With this $300,338 in federal funding, the Town of Orangetown can save lives of those struggling with opioid use by connecting them with the treatment and support services they need.
Securing Historic Funding Increases for Child Care and Early Childhood Learning 
￼ 
Rep. Lowey hosts a roundtable discussion at Riverview Nursey School in South Nyack to announce historic funding increases for child care and early childhood learning.  
I visited Riverview Nursery School in South Nyack to announce historic federal investments for child care and early childhood learning in the Fiscal Year 2019 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education (LHHS) funding bill, which was recently signed into law as part of a spending package. During the visit, I toured the nursery school and participated in a roundtable discussion on the federal funding increases and the advantages of investments in early childhood education. 
	•	Too many families lack access to affordable child care, which only adds to the economic burdens facing families that also include student loans, rent or mortgage payments, and other skyrocketing costs in our high cost-of-living area.  
	•	Quality and affordable child care should not be a luxury. That is why I was pleased to announce that as the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, I have secured historic investments in child care and early childhood learning.   
	•	The work is not done until every child in our community has access to child care and early learning. 
Helping a Local Business Owner with the SBA 
A Westchester business owner won a $35 million bid to do work for the Army, but was afraid the contract would be canceled because the Small Business Administration (SBA) was slow in approving necessary paperwork. I contacted the SBA, the paperwork was approved and immediately released, and the business was able to move forward on the contract.

Dear friends,
On July 9, President Trump nominated Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement, and since that time, the Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Chairman Chuck Grassley, has done a remarkable job conducting the confirmation process to consider his nomination. 
After reviewing the proceedings, including more than 30 hours of testimony from Judge Kavanaugh, and reviewing all witness testimony along with the rest of the record that has been presented throughout the course of Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation process, I will support his nomination.
Any judge on the nation’s highest court should be one who understands and applies the law based on the U.S. Constitution, and I have confidence that Judge Kavanaugh will fulfill these duties accordingly. I’ve based my decision on the totality of the information provided during the confirmation process. Judge Kavanaugh is a talented and experienced jurist, and I am confident he will bring a strong commitment to the Constitution and the rule of law to the Supreme Court. I look forward to voting to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve as associate justice on the Supreme Court. A vote on his confirmation is expected tomorrow (Saturday).
Deal Reached to Modernize NAFTA
On Monday, President Trump announced that the United States, Canada and Mexico have reached an agreement to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement.
When the United States is engaged and proactive with trade agreements, it’s beneficial to our economy, especially in Georgia, which exports more than $12 billion of its goods and services to Mexico and Canada each year. I’m pleased to see that we’ve made headway with both Canada and Mexico to ensure that our countries continue to engage in trade that benefits Georgia farmers, manufacturers and service providers. 
I look forward to reviewing the details of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and evaluating whether it represents an improvement for Georgia.
 ￼
Reauthorizing Federal Aviation Programs
On Wednesday, the Senate passed the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2018, legislation to reauthorize federal aviation programs for five years and modernize airport infrastructure, improve service for passengers, enhance safety and boost aviation industry innovation. 
Georgia is home to the world’s most traveled airport as well as more than 100 national, regional and local airports, nine of which offer regularly scheduled commercial airline service. A five-year reauthorization of our federal aviation programs means a lot for citizens traveling to and from our Georgia airports, and will likewise benefit manufacturers and the industry as a whole. This important legislation includes needed reforms to help improve the flying experience for Americans and give states flexibility to prioritize needs. It also cuts down regulatory burdens for manufacturers and helps keep our airspace safe, which will benefit Georgia’s more than 800 aerospace industries. 
I look forward to President Trump signing it into law soon.
 ￼
Addressing the Opioid Crisis
On Wednesday, the Senate passed significant, comprehensive and bipartisan legislation to address the opioid crisis. The legislation combines previously passed Senate and U.S. House measures authorizing and funding a broad range of tools to fight the opioid crisis.
The Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act, or SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act for short, would address the opioid crisis through prevention, treatment and recovery, support for caregivers and families, safety, medical research, and improved border security measures, in addition to tackling the crisis through the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
This comprehensive opioid legislation is the culmination of months of hard work across committees and in both chambers of Congress, and it is only fitting that is it sent to the president’s desk to be signed in to law during the month of October, which is National Substance Abuse Prevention Month. The opioid epidemic has broken too many hearts and ended too many lives. I’m glad to see Congress move forward to help our states, medical community, first responders and so many who are involved in fighting this epidemic. I urge President Trump to sign this measure into law without delay.
In Other News
	•	On Monday, I introduced the Preserving America’s Battlefields Act to ensure our nation’s living memorials honoring those who fought for our freedoms are protected for current and future generations. This bipartisan legislation would provide for the restoration of battlefield sites across the country, including the one in Chickamauga, Ga., helping transform them into historic tourism destinations. As chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I am committed to honoring the sacred ground where American soldiers fought and died. Coupling investment and initiatives from both the public and private sector will help ensure we are protecting and preserving our most vulnerable battlefield sites.
￼
	•	On Wednesday, I was honored to preside over the promotion ceremony of our very own staffer, Tommy Nguyen, to his new rank as Captain in the Georgia Army National Guard. 
￼
	•	Last Friday, President Trump signed into law legislation to ensure veterans continue to have access to critical programs at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2018 reauthorizes numerous programs and services at the VA for fiscal year 2019, which began on Oct. 1, 2018. The legislation ensures that many important programs, including veterans homelessness prevention, adaptive sports programs for disabled veterans, and workforce training for injured service members, continue to be available. 
	•	Throughout the week, I held a number of meetings with constituents. The right-hand sidebar of our newsletter has a few of these highlights.
What’s on Tap?
The Senate is expected to vote this weekend on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court. On Monday, the Senate will not be in session for the observance of Columbus Day.

Dam 4 Trail in Beltrami Island State Forest
 
Dear Friends,
 
This week, I met with Agriculture Committee leaders from the House and Senate to continue work on the Farm Bill conference report. As we work through the bill, we have found many things that we agree on. While some sticking points remain, I am confident that we will produce a bipartisan report that can be voted on in early November. On Tuesday, I was happy to announce the opening of the Dam 4 Trail section within the Beltrami Island State Forest. I have been working with the community as well as state and federal officials to get this done. I am grateful for our success on this project because I know the new trail will expand access to public land and create recreational opportunities for Minnesotans. I also introduced legislation to address teacher shortages in rural and tribal school districts this week. The Addressing Teacher Shortages Act of 2018 will ensure that rural and tribal schools have the resources they need to recruit and retain qualified teachers.
 
Sincerely,
￼ Congressman Collin C. Peterson
Minnesota 7th District
 
Dam 4 Trail Opening in Beltrami Island State Forest
￼
 
This week, I was pleased to meet with Jack Nelson of the Fourtown Grygla Sportsman Club and Myles Hogenson of the Roseau Lake of the Woods Sportsman Club to officially announce the opening of the Dam 4 Trail section that connects Morehouse Road and Elkwood Road within the Beltrami Island State Forest. This project has been underway for several years, and I am glad we were able to achieve this victory for the area sportsmen who use the forest’s trails.
 
Visit my website to view the press release on the opening.
 
Complete Streets Celebration in Glenwood
￼
 
I was glad to join the City of Glenwood for their Complete Streets Celebration today. The City has worked hard over many years with public and private organizations to enhance and improve the city’s streets. Collective efforts like this can create positive ripple effects in a community and this success is something everyone can be proud of. I am glad federal funds could be utilized to help make this project happen.
 
Bipartisan Progress on the Farm Bill
￼
 
I came back to Washington this week to keep progress going on the farm bill. Chairmen Roberts and Conaway, Ranking Member Stabenow and I pushed staff to have the credit, energy and trade titles closed as soon as possible. We will have more titles closed next week and then will focus on those where we remain further apart, such as the commodity, conservation, nutrition and forestry titles. We aim to close out the bill this month, and vote on it early in November. As for the impact on farmers, major programs like the Margin Protection Program for dairy and commodity programs like Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Control will continue through the end of the calendar year. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program will also continue through the end of the year. Crop insurance and SNAP are permanently authorized and will continue without a new farm bill in place. There are some programs that will pause until we can get a bill done, which is one of the reasons we’re continuing to push forward.
 
2019 Health Insurance Rates
The Minnesota Department of Commerce recently announced final 2019 individual and small group health insurance rates. The rates, which determine how much consumers will pay for their health insurance across plans, mark the second year of stable or decreasing premiums in the individual market. According to the report, Blue Plus and Medica will offer plans in every county in the 7th District except for Meeker, Kittson, Roseau, and Lake of the Woods Counties, where only Medica plans will be available. The average Blue Plus premium will decrease by 27.7% and the average Medica premium will decrease by 12.4%. The Minnesota Department of Commerce also adds that rates in 2019 are 20% lower than they would be without Minnesota’s reinsurance program, which I organized federal support for in 2017. The 2019 open enrollment period begins on November 1, 2018 and ends on January 13, 2019. 
 
As open enrollment approaches, enrollees can explore their options and learn about available tax credits on MNsure.org. This year, individuals earning up to $48,560 per year and families of four earning up to $100,400 per year may be eligible to save on their premiums. 
 
Addressing Teacher Shortages Act of 2018
This week, I introduced the bipartisan Addressing Teacher Shortages Act of 2018 with Congressman Mooney (R-WV) to establish a federal grant program to help school districts recruit, retain, and support teachers. Under the legislation, 25 percent of funds will go directly to rural schools, 25 percent will help recruit teachers in high-need subject areas, and 5 percent will directly benefit Tribal schools. Particularly as fields like STEM and agriculture education increasingly influence the rural economy, it’s important that our schools are adequately staffed to prepare students as they enter the workforce.
 
I am proud that superintendents from the 7th District are confident in the legislation and I thank them for voicing their support. 
 
“Teacher shortage has reached epidemic levels the past several years in Minnesota and nationwide as well,” said Minnesota Superintendent John Cselovski (Sleepy Eye Public Schools). “Finding qualified teacher candidates not just in special education but in all areas and all grade levels. It has been a daunting task to find quality faculty. I appreciate Representatives Petersen and Mooney for offering a solution for this educational crisis.”
 
""The teacher shortage in rural school districts is truly a crisis,"" said Minnesota Superintendent Scott Monson (Marshall Public Schools). “As we've known for many years, hard-working, talented, knowledgeable, and caring teachers are the backbone of any successful school or school district and finding those type of people continues to be a huge challenge. This bipartisan legislation provides opportunities for addressing the shortage with funding to support ideas, best practices, and innovation. I believe it will lead to an increased pool of teacher candidates for school districts to choose from.""
 
Minnesota Air National Guard
￼
Colonel Christopher Blomquist, Lt. Colonel Brian Winter, Lt. Colonel Nathan Aysta
 
On Tuesday, my staff aide Zach Martin sat down with the Commander of the 179th Fighter Squadron and Commander of the 148th Fighter Wing within the Minnesota Air National Guard. Based in Duluth, the 148th Fighter Wing encompasses over 1,000 Airmen and 22 Block 50 F-16 aircraft. In 1995, I nominated Nathan Aysta to the U.S. Air Force Academy. Since then, he served on active duty for 11 years with more than 3,000 flying hours in the F-16 and flown over 70 combat sorties. This year, he led the 179th Fighter Squadron for flying missions in the Middle East. I remain impressed with the expertise and commitment shown by these officers, and their service makes Minnesota proud.
 
Advocating for Biodiesel
I joined a letter which urges House Leadership to provide a multi-year extension of the biodiesel tax incentive, an important policy which boosts our rural economy. Biodiesel adds 63 cents of value to every bushel of soybeans on the front end and lowers fuel prices that truck drivers pay at the back end. During a time when farm income is reaching a decade low, the value added by biodiesel is becoming even more crucial to sustaining major agriculture sectors.
 
Combatting the Opioid Crisis
￼
 
This week, USDA launched an interactive data tool to help community leaders address the opioid epidemic. The Community Assessment Tool integrates substance abuse rates with community demographics to help determine which local actions will combat addiction most effectively. The Community Assessment tool is free to use and open to the public.
 
National Eating Disorders Association

On Tuesday, my staff aide Rebekah Solem met with representatives of the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), including CEO Claire Mysko and former Seattle Mariners catcher and NEDA Ambassador Mike Marjama, who owns a family business in Menahga. Mike shared his personal story and emphasized that eating disorders can affect anyone, male or female. In fact, the group stated that more than 30 million Americans will suffer at some point in their lives from an eating disorder. NEDA focuses on supporting these individuals and their families, raising awareness about eating disorders, and funding research. Among other programs, the nonprofit has developed “The Body Project” program for women and girls and is working on a program for boys and men, called “More than Muscles.”
 
Urging FDA to Reclassify Pulse Crops as “Grain”
￼
 
I signed a letter to the Food and Drug Administration urging them to reclassify specific pulse crops as “grain” to qualify for exemptions from certain regulations required by the Food Safety Modernization Act (FMSA). FDA currently classifies pulse crops like dry peas, lentils, chick peas and dry beans as “fruits or vegetables,” requiring producers of the crops to comply with the human and animal food rules mandated by FSMA. The costs of compliance to these rules are estimated to range from $57,000 to $127,000. 
 
A common-sense reading of the statute shows that pulse crops more accurately fit the description of “grains” as defined by FMSA, and that the label of “fruits and vegetables” does not represent an accurate description of pulse crops, nor does it protect public health in the intent of FMSA. FDA should hear this bipartisan call for the reclassification of pulse crops to support producers and ensure the effective application of FSMA.

National Association of Trailer Manufacturers

Tary Krahenbuhl (MO) and Pat Jennissen (Felling Trailers, SAUK CENTRE)
 
Minnesotan members of the National Association of Trailer Manufacturers visited my office this week to discuss the Administration’s implementation of steel tariffs. Businesses across the 7th District rely on a consistent source of materials to create world-class products, and I am concerned that these tariffs are disrupting important supply chains. 
 
Highway 2 West Manufacturers Association
￼
 
Bemidji State University hosted the Highway 2 West Manufacturers Meeting at the School of Technology, Art and Design. The dean of the school, Dr. Jim Barta, introduced several of the faculty of the manufacturing programs offered both on and off campus. Dr. Kelly LaVenture talked about the human factor in manufacturing and presented a roadmap to employee engagement for increased profitability and employee satisfaction. Manufacturing is very important to the 7th District, and I support efforts to educate communities about the many career paths the industry offers.
 
League of Minnesota Cities
￼
 
On Wednesday, my staff aide Jacki Anderson attended the League of Minnesota Cities annual regional meeting in Fergus Falls. Topics on the agenda included housing, broadband, daycare and workforce. I am encouraged to hear about the innovative ways they are addressing community issues with projects like Ottertail County’s Rural Rebound Initiative. I have worked on bills and initiatives that create new pathways for communities to address these issues. I will continue to identify and support initiatives at the federal level that will help advance solutions in the 7th District. 
 
National Manufacturing Day
￼
 
Today is National Manufacturing Day (MFG Day). It is a day to celebrate the American manufacturing industry and raise awareness of the many career opportunities modern manufacturing has to offer. Manufacturing jobs today are high tech, high skilled and well-paying, yet many businesses struggle to recruit the next generation of employees. MFG Day events help introduce people to career paths in manufacturing with hopes of inspiring them to take part in this rapidly growing industry.

Old Crossing Treaty Memorial in Huot
 
On October 2, 1863, the Red Lake and Pembina bands of Ojibwe signed the Old Crossing treaty, ceding to the US government three million acres of land in the Red River Valley. Senator Alexander Ramsey and Indian Agent Ashley C. Morrill represented the United States; Moose Dung, Crooked Arm, Little Rock, and Little Shell are among the Ojibwe signers. The treaty is named for a ford in the Red Lake River, near Red Lake Falls. A monument would be dedicated at the treaty site, in Huot, in 1933.
 
What’s the Story?
￼
 
Jerome Increase Case founded Racine Threshing Machine Works (later named J.I. Case) in 1842. In 1902, McCormick, Deering and three smaller brands of farm implement manufacturers merged to become the International Harvester Company. The two companies went on to dramatically change the agriculture industry with their innovative machinery. In 1985, International Harvester united with agricultural equipment manufacturer J.I. Case to become Case IH. Case IH has grown a network of more than 4,900 dealers and distributers in over 160 countries. One of their factories is in Benson, where they produce crop control equipment like sprayers and applicators. I display several models of their machinery, and this Case IH hat, in my office in Washington, D.C.

Hoosiers,

Across Indiana, our manufacturers keep our economy rolling, making everything from the cars we drive to our kitchen tables. 

￼

Today is National Manufacturing Day, a day to celebrate generations of Made in Indiana and the hardworking men and women who work tirelessly everyday to advance Hoosier innovations.

Today is also a day to inspire future generations of Hoosiers and expand students' knowledge of the opportunities available in the manufacturing industry, which in 2016, accounted for 28.8% of the total output in the state, employing 16.8% of the workforce.

￼

I recently visited Seymour High School's Owl Manufacturing program, pictured above, to see how they are inspiring the next generation. This program aims to give high school students the skills and tools they need for a successful future in careers in a variety of manufacturing sectors. Click here to read more about the program. 

In Congress, I'm fighting everyday for an economy that will let our local manufacturing industry continue to thrive for generations.

Be of good cheer,

Celebrating Manufacturing Day in Lawrenceburg 
It was such a pleasure to celebrate National Manufacturing Day in Lawrence County, where Craig Manufacturing announced that they were moving operations to the United States. Family owned since 1946, Craig Manufacturing produces custom manufactured solutions for heavy construction equipment. Originally from Canada, Craig has chosen Lawrenceburg, Tennessee to establish their United States headquarters - bringing with them tremendous career and economic opportunities for Middle Tennessee residents and Lawrence County. 

￼
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that we passed in Congress last year has ignited the business community across our nation, and throughout Tennessee. This announcement serves as a testament to the prosperity and opportunity that has resulted from our pro-growth economic policies of lower taxes and less bureaucratic red tape. Thank you to the Lawrence County Chamber of Commerce, Mayor Durham, County Executive T.R. Williams, and Representative Barry Doss for making this investment in Tennessee possible.

I am confident that Craig Manufacturing’s decision to establish operations in America and plant their flag in Tennessee will catalyze the company’s success. It is my pleasure to welcome Craig Manufacturing to the United States, to the State of Tennessee, and to Lawrence County they become ‘Made in America’ but ‘Mastered in Tennessee’.


Screaming Eagle Honor Flight 
Last Sunday, we were delighted to welcome Clarksville-based World War II, Vietnam, and Korean War Veterans to Washington, DC, as part of the Screaming Eagle Honor Flight. Each year these heroes have the opportunity to travel to our nation’s Capital to visit the different war memorials and pay their respects. What an honor it was to meet these storied veterans and thank them for their service and sacrifices to this nation.
￼
Last Sunday’s trip marks the 10th successful mission of the Screaming Eagle Honor Flight. Thank you to the many donors that make this possible, and a special thanks to our veterans. Honor Flights aim to transport America’s Veterans free of charge to Washington, DC, to visit those memorials dedicated to honor the service and sacrifices of themselves and their friends.

Scales Elementary Named National Blue Ribbon School 
On Monday, the U.S. Department of Education recognized 349 public and private schools across the country as National Blue Ribbon Schools for 2018. We’re so proud to have six schools in Tennessee recognized as Blue Ribbon Schools, and particularly grateful to have Brentwood’s own Scales Elementary School receive this honor. These schools are recognized for their overall academic excellence or their progress in closing achievement gaps among student subgroups, demonstrating that all students can succeed at high levels. It is an incredible achievement to earn this blue ribbon, which serves as a symbol of exemplary teaching and learning. Congratulations to Scales Elementary students, staff, and the entire community on your hard work and commitment to excellence in education.


United States - Mexico - Canada Agreement on Trade
This week, President Trump announced a new agreement with Mexico and Canada in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). So many of you have reached out to our office to express how important it is for Tennessee workers, farmers, and ranchers that we maintain, strengthen, and update our nation’s trade laws with our two largest trading partners. I agree with you, and am pleased with this progress. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”) aims to modernize the 24-year-old NAFTA agreement, and re-write provisions for a 21st century digital economy, as well as rebalance the agreement to better serve American business interests. As we begin the process in Congress of reviewing the text of the agreement, we will be paying particular attention to how the deal incentivizes freer markets, fairer trade, and more robust economic growth in North America. We need to increase our ability to sell and export more Made-in-America and Made-in-Tennessee goods and services - whether they be in agriculture, manufacturing, or technology. I look forward to reviewing this agreement and continuing to work with the President and his administration on trade deals that benefit all Tennesseans.


Bipartisan Opioid Package Heads to President’s Desk 
On Wednesday, the Senate passed H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act - a bipartisan landmark package of solutions that will provide critical support to communities in Tennessee and across the country that are struggling with the opioid crisis. It will give those fighting on the front lines new tools to help treat addiction and slow the flow of illicit drugs being imported across our borders.
I was so pleased that two of my bills were included in the final package.  The Stop Illicit Drug Importation Act streamlines and enhances the Food and Drug Administration’s tools to keep dangerous drugs like fentanyl out of the country.  Every day, illicit, counterfeit, or unapproved drugs enter the U.S. supply chain through packages that are processed at International Mail Facilities (IMFs) and pose serious public health threats to people across the country.  These facilities process more than 275 million packages annually, and the FDA has only been able to inspect less than 0.06 percent of the packages that might contain drugs. 
The best way to keep these dangerous drugs off the streets is to keep them from entering the country in the first place, and my bill gives the FDA the tools they need to stop drugs coming in through the U.S. mail.  FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb identified these changes as his #1 priority to help them address the opioid crisis.  
My other bill included in the package is the Medicaid DRUG Improvement Act, which ensures that states have tools in place to prevent opioid addiction for their Medicaid enrollees.  The bill requires states to have a set of minimum standards in place related to the prescribing and use of opioids.  Because of the forward-thinking, work already done by states like Tennessee, this bill does not mandate specific policies but instead gives states the flexibility to determine the best approach for their Medicaid enrollees.  
The IMD CARE Act partially repeals Medicaid’s IMD exclusion, which prevented people with substance use disorders (SUD) from receiving treatment in an Institution for Mental Disease (IMD).  State Medicaid plans now have the option to cover these services for people seeking treatment for a SUD in an IMD for up to 30 days. It is crucial that patients are able to receive the right care in the right setting so they can be successful in their recovery.
The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act boosts resources for law enforcement, ensuring that our first responders have the tools and training they need as they respond to this crisis and work to get these drugs off the streets.  The bill also removes barriers that prevent people from getting the treatment they need to get better. I look forward to President Trump’s signing the bill into law and getting desperately needed resources to those fighting this epidemic in Tennessee and across the country.



A Brand New Tennessee State Museum!
This Thursday, Team Blackburn participated in the grand opening of the new Tennessee State Museum, located right next to the Nashville Farmers Market, on the corner of Rosa Parks Boulevard and Jefferson Street at the Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park. It was a truly spectacular event honoring Tennessee’s great historical legacy, and all those that contributed to making this vision become a reality. The story of Tennessee represents the story of America - and this museum pays tremendous tribute to the rich social, political, economic, and cultural history of Tennessee and those Tennesseans that came before us.

￼
Congratulations and thank you to Governor Haslam, Lieutenant Governor McNally, and the entire Tennessee state legislature for making this happen. We're proud of our history and so grateful that future generations can learn what it means to be a Tennessean.


Yours in Service,
￼

I am grateful each time I have an opportunity to thank our veterans, especially our senior adult veterans, when they finally get to visit the monuments created to honor them and our fallen. This week in DC, we got another opportunity to do just that when OK Honor Flights paid us a visit. 
  
￼
I was honored to be welcomed by the Broken Bow and Idabel Chambers to discuss some of the ongoing challenges businesses face in SE Oklahoma and talk through national issues as well. 
  
￼
It was nice to welcome the folks from the McAlester Stampede to DC this week to discuss some of the national issues and their impact on our friends and neighbors in eastern OK.   
  
￼
I was pleased to visit Broken Bow HS and get a chance to visit with Superintendent Ellisor and Principal Davis.  
  
￼
I was grateful to tour the Hem Saw facility and get a chance to discuss trade and tariffs as well as immigration and education issues facing Oklahomans and their small businesses.   
  
￼
I had the opportunity to tour Tyson Foods in Broken Bow and learn about the extensive operations and employment opportunities at their facility.

It was great to get a chance to connect with the Sac and Fox Nation’s Chief Rhoades when she came to DC this week and attended Java with James. If you’re ever in DC on a Wednesday morning when the Senate is in session, please join us in my office for coffee at 9am! 
Dear Oklahoma Friends and Neighbors, 
This morning, the Senate took a procedural vote to advance the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court. This vote follows an extensive background investigation, three full days of testimony by Kavanaugh under oath in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and lengthy debates and discussions among members of the Senate. After spending hours going through the facts, I remain supportive of Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. I spoke on the Senate floor yesterday about my decision, and I encourage you to take a few moments to hear my reasons. I will provide a detailed follow-up e-newsletter to exclusively discuss Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation process in the days ahead. For now, please know that I take the advice and consent process very seriously, and I appreciate Oklahomans’ feedback regarding this and other federal issues. This has been a politically and emotionally charged process that needs some reflection. CLICK HERE to watch my floor speech. 
I was grateful to be home for a few days in September so I could visit with neighbors in Clinton, Hobart, Altus, Pryor, Idabel, Hugo, Broken Bow, and Claremore. It was a great opportunity to hear from Oklahomans about some of the issues they face in their communities and some of their concerns with the issues facing our nation. I was also happy to work through a number of important legislative items (details below) that affect Oklahomans and our nation. 
UPDATE: Trade 
On September 30th, President Trump announced a new agreement with Canada and Mexico, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on trade, formerly known as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The decades-old NAFTA agreement needed renegotiation to provide clarity on e-commerce, and more markets for our farmers, businesses, and manufacturers. Since Canada and Mexico are the top-two countries for Oklahoma trade, it was important for Oklahoma and the entire nation to finish this well. Congress has a duty to regulate trade with foreign nations, so it is essential that we and the American people have time to review the full agreement and provide full consideration in the Senate. 
My staff and I have worked closely with the White House and Administration officials during the negotiation process with Canada and Mexico to express how important it is for Oklahoma to trade with Mexico and Canada. Now that this agreement is wrapping up, it is important for the Administration to work on expanding our trade to new markets like Asia, the UK, and Africa.  
At the end of September, the White House worked to finalize the US-Korea Free Trade Agreement (known as KORUS), which governs trade interactions between our two nations. We should always seek to put the interests of American workers and American consumers first in our trade agreements. CLICK HERE to read more.

Last month, I taped a podcast to break down the ongoing trade negotiations; CLICK HERE to listen.  
Senate Passes Five-Year FAA Reauthorization 
This week, the Senate passed a five-year extension of the FAA reauthorization to help further the important work of the FAA at places like the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City. The FAA reauthorization also includes my bill, the Federal Acquisition Savings Act of 2018, which will help save taxpayer money on equipment used by federal agencies for activities including agricultural production, construction, and highway maintenance. CLICK HERE to read my statement. 
President Signs Bills to Fund the Federal Government 
I serve on the Senate Appropriations Committee and, along with our counterparts in the House, we passed and the President signed into law 5 of 12 annual appropriations bills required to fund the federal government. Currently, the House and Senate are in the final stages of negotiating the third appropriations package (Transportation-Housing and Urban Development, Federal Services and General Government, which I chair, Agriculture, and Interior), and work remains on funding for State & Foreign Operations, Homeland Security, and Commerce, Justice, Science. On September 28th, President Trump signed a partial Continuing Resolution to fund the government through December 7th. 
CLICK HERE to read my statement after the Senate passed the second appropriations conference committee report to fund Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and the Department of Defense. CLICK HERE to read my statement after the Senate passed the Conference Committee Report to fund Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs.  
UPDATE: Immigration 
We continue to work through national and local issues that need resolution from both legal and illegal immigration. We do not have to solve everything to accomplish something. On September 18th, during a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) hearing, I questioned Acting Customs and Border Protection Deputy Commissioner Robert Perez and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Executive Associate Director Matthew Albence about ways to solve some of the immigration placement issues for children that were created by the Flores Agreement, which limits the length of time immigrant children can be held by the US government.  
Following the September 18th hearing, I introduced the bipartisan Responsibility for Unaccompanied Minors Act, which clarifies that Health and Human Services is responsible for ensuring these children’s safety. I want to curtail illegal immigration, but I also want to assure that individuals in the hearing process are treated with care that represents our values. The bill requires HHS to run background checks before placing children with sponsors, to ensure sponsors provide adequate care for children placed in their care, to ensure the children appear at their immigration court proceedings, and to notify state governments before placing children within their borders. The bill also increases immigration court judges so the Department of Justice can process all immigration cases more efficiently. CLICK HERE to read more.   
For over a decade, HHS has also placed children who came unaccompanied into the country in the homes of adults who are not legally present in the United States. When that happens, often HHS loses track of those children because they and their sponsor do not show up for court hearings or respond to well checks.  
Federal Reorganization and Regulatory Policy 
Numerous times throughout my service in the House and now in the Senate, Oklahomans have shared their ideas with me about ways to make the federal government more efficient. Two longer-term, bigger-picture ideas discussed for years in Congress (though probably not around dinner tables in Oklahoma) are federal agency reorganization and improving our federal regulatory structure. 
During the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs full-committee markup last month, the Committee unanimously passed my bill, The Reforming Government Act of 2018, to give the Executive Branch the authority to reorganize federal agencies and allow the Administration to implement ideas in its proposal, “Reorganizing the US Office of Personnel Management.” 
Last week, the Senate Homeland Security Subcommittee I chair held a hearing to review how the Administration’s regulatory policy has impacted the American economy. Federal regulations, especially those that help protect lives and families, are certainly not unnecessary, but there is a point at which we exceed commonsense in favor of burdensome or excessive. I have worked with my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find ways to provide long-term regulatory stability, which will increase our GDP and prevent a possible economic recession. When any regulation is considered, we should assess the full impact of the rule, consult with state, local, and tribal governments, and hear from small business owners at every step of the process. The information we discussed in last week’s hearing will help ensure we continue to consider bills that provide more clarity to families and businesses directly impacted by federal regulations. To watch the full hearing, please CLICK HERE.  We also explored how to streamline the complicated federal permitting process during the hearing.  Everyone who has ever tried to get a federal permit for construction knows the process is long and expensive.   
Keeping You in the Loop 
	•	On September 13th after a long and difficult construction process, OKC VAMC Medical Director Wade Vlosich announced the grand opening of the parking garage at the center. I am grateful for the improvements to this and other locations that serve veterans around Oklahoma. I am also thankful for the dedicated medical and administrative professionals who work hard daily to serve those who served our nation. The OKC VAMC has made major improvements to their service, and we should all thank them for their important work on behalf of our veterans.  
	•	The City of Tulsa, in partnership with the 1921 Race Riot Centennial Commission, has been chosen as one of 14 finalists from a pool of over 200 cities for the 2018 Public Art Challenge award in a nationwide competition held by Bloomberg Philanthropies. Tulsa was also one of three cities worldwide to receive the Engaged Cities award from Cities of Service. Congratulations, Tulsa!
	•	At the end of September, the Trump Administration announced it would cancel an HHS contract with Advanced Bioscience Resources, Inc. (ABR). Prior to its cancellation, on September 24th, 2018, I joined 16 of my Senate colleagues to send a letter to Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb to express our concern with the FDA’s contract for fetal tissue-based research with ABR. This contract was originally set up by the FDA for the purpose of supplying fetal tissue for research purposes. ABR’s practice of buying and selling baby body parts from children that were aborted at Planned Parenthood clinics was exposed in a series of undercover videos. HHS also announced it would audit other research-based fetal tissue contracts. This is a positive step to protect the dignity of children. However, I believe the act of buying and selling aborted baby body parts must stop entirely. This is the United States of America; we can be and do better. We can ensure we have cutting-edge research while still honoring the dignity of life. There are already ethical alternatives to using fetal tissue, and we should shift federal dollars to making those a viable alternative. 
	•	I, along with Senator Mike Enzi, welcomed the passage of our bill, the Grant Reporting Efficiency and Agreements Transparency (GREAT) Act, out of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The GREAT Act would require the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to create a comprehensive and standardized data structure to cover all data elements reported by recipients of federal awards, including grants and cooperative agreements. Congress should have usable and auditable data from grant recipients in an easy and straightforward format. When an agency spends the money of hardworking taxpayers, everyone should know how and where their money was spent. The GREAT Act streamlines data transparency requirements for grant recipients, which will ultimately make data collection and dissemination to Congress easier and faster. I look forward to full consideration on the Senate floor soon. CLICK HERE to read more.
	•	On September 17th, Senator Orrin Hatch and I introduced the Give Useful Information to Define Effective Compliance Act (GUIDE Compliance Act). The GUIDE Compliance Act would enhance transparency and predictability to the rulemaking process of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (BCFP), The GUIDE Act will provide consumers and providers a strong grasp of the rules issued by the BCFP, including a well-defined understanding of how those rules will directly affect them. This will provide clarity for consumers and help ensure fair enforcement. CLICK HERE to read more. 
	•	In September, the Administration released the National Cyber Strategy to help secure critical networks, effectively deter and respond to bad actors that wish to do our nation harm, and protect the US economy while promoting a free and open internet. It is important for the US to have a cyber doctrine so those who wish to do us harm will face consequences for attacking US cyber infrastructure. To read my full statement, CLICK HERE. 
	•	September 23-29 was Gold Star Families Remembrance Week. On Veterans Day and Memorial Day we honor our veterans and those who gave their last full measure of devotion to our nation. Last week was the time to honor their families. I am grateful to the Gold Star organizations that help our nation lift up these ever-grieving family members of our brave fallen service members. I wrote an opinion piece to honor Gold Star families. CLICK HERE to read the piece. 
	•	This week, the Senate overwhelmingly passed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which improves access to care for victims of opioid addiction. This bipartisan legislation is an important step to help address our nation’s devastating struggle with addiction to opioids. We can and should balance the need to adequately treat pain with successfully treating and eliminating opioid addiction in our nation.

Unemployment at Record Lows

Today, the Labor Department made the announcement that the unemployment rate, at 3.7%, has reached its lowest level since 1969. When President Trump took office, the unemployment rate was 4.8 percent. Since then, the economy has added more than 3.8 million jobs. And to top it off, average hourly wages have risen by 2.8%. 

This is huge news for all the Texas families who have been working hard to make ends meet. This news from the Labor Department is proof that our tax reform package is creating jobs and spurring economic growth. I'm glad to give families across the country the financial freedom they deserve.


Last Chance: Student Opportunities

The Congressional Youth Advisory Council (CYAC) offers high school students an excellent opportunity to learn about government, collaborate and discuss various topics with fellow high school students, and provide service to the 11th Congressional District. This year, students can complete 100% of the application online, including a personal essay and two letters of recommendation. The application, which can be found here, is due October 6th. 

Each year, Congress hosts the Congressional App Challenge (CAC), a competition for high school students to highlight the value of computer science and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education. I am very excited to extend an invitation to all high school students in my district to participate in the 2018 App Challenge. Students can choose to work on their own or in teams of up to four students to create an app on any topic for mobile, tablet, or other computing devices on a platform of their choice. More information, including registration instructions, can be found here. 

One of my greatest honors as a U.S. Representative is nominating young men and women to our military service academies. Young men and women who are interested in attending a military service academy will need to submit their application for a nomination, which can be found online here. All applications must be received at the San Angelo office by Oct. 12, 2018. 

You can learn more about these opportunities, and others, here. 



As always, you can follow me on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.

SERVING YOU  |  MEDIA CENTER  |  LEGISLATIVE WORK  |  OUR DISTRICT
 
October 5, 2018
 
 
Dear Friend,   Today, I participated in a discussion on the Innovative Materials in American Grid and Infrastructure Newly Expanded (IMAGINE) Act of 2018 with stakeholders including Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti, the Rhode Island Marine Trades Association, the University of Rhode Island, the Composites Alliance of Rhode Island, the American Composites Manufacturers Association, and Rhode Island transportation and composites leaders. This legislation was first introduced by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse in the Senate, and I was an original co-sponsor of the companion House bill.   The IMAGINE Act of 2018 would create various grant programs which would encourage the research and use of innovative construction materials and techniques for transportation and water infrastructure projects. Investments made through this legislation would lead to projects that are safer, longer-lasting, and more cost-effective.  Infrastructure around our country is crumbling due to years of a lack of investment. We need to utilize forward-thinking methods and innovative materials which will allow us to rebuild our infrastructure with improved resiliency, maintainability, sustainability, and safety. 
￼   One Year Ago   This Monday marked the tragic one-year anniversary of the mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 58 people dead and more than 800 injured. It was the worst mass shooting in modern American history where a man used a “bump stock” to run through more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition in 10 minutes, leaving concertgoers terrorized and offering a clear example of the urgent need to put policies in place to reduce the threat of gun violence.  Gun violence is one of the most pressing public health crises our country is facing. Children, criminals, and those with serious mental illness should never have access to a firearm. We need to do everything that we can to limit their ability to obtain these weapons.  As Vice Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, I continue to fight for common sense gun safety laws, having introduced and co-sponsored numerous pieces of legislation such as the Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018, as well as a bill that would prohibit the 3-D printing of plastic firearms.   I continue to remain appalled that even after the many tragedies our country has suffered – from what happened in Las Vegas to Orlando to Newtown – the GOP still refuses to bring any proposals to the floor for a vote or take any action to reduce gun violence. They have actually attempted to weaken gun safety laws when gun violence in the United States is reaching unprecedented levels.   It is imperative that we devote the resources necessary to stop this epidemic. We all need to stay engaged and fight for common sense gun reform by raising awareness about gun violence in our country and working toward common sense measures can be taken to impede the devastating effect these weapons can have.  NAFTA 2.0   On Monday, the Trump administration announced its revised NAFTA proposal, now known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Any new trade agreement made by the President needs to raise American wages, stop the outsourcing of jobs, and include strong enforcement measures for labor and environmental protections. President Trump campaigned on those promises and now we will have the chance to find out whether his actions match up to his rhetoric on trade. I promise to closely scrutinize the administration’s proposal. I also look forward to meeting with Rhode Island stakeholders in the days to come to discuss USMCA’s impact before it is considered in Congress.  TPS-Journey4Justice Rally   We all need to stand together in solidarity against the harmful and unfair actions the Trump administration continues to take against immigrant communities currently protected under existing law.   On Monday, I joined The Alliance for Social Transformation, Lieutenant Governor McKee, Mayor Elorza, Mayor Diossa, State Representative Tobon, Councilman Figuero, and many community leaders to rally in support of the thousands of families affected by the Trump administration’s change in policies for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) individuals.   The current immigration system in the Unites States is failing. The system cannot meet the demand of individuals attempting to become citizens or legal residents. The reason TPS is in place is to offer protection to individuals from countries affected by armed conflict or natural disasters. These are people who, due to conditions in their country, are unable to safely return home and have nowhere else to go – oftentimes having lost everything while fleeing from violence. Once here, they contribute greatly to our culture and the fabric of our country by bringing their art, music, customs, values, and traditions.   The repeated attempts to dismantle these protections is shameful and it goes against the principles upon which our country was founded. We cannot give in to the fear and hatred that today passes as political rhetoric.   Fixing our immigration system will allow millions of our neighbors to come out of the shadows and contribute to society. As a member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I have been proud to co-sponsor bills such as the USA Values Act of 2017, the American Promise Act, and the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 2018 which are immigration reforms that respect basic human rights and strengthen the relationship between the United States and other countries.   We need comprehensive immigration reform, and a critical part of that is protecting and strengthening TPS. As a global leader, we must remain committed to helping others and offering protections to those who need it.   As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns, please call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov.  You can also click here to follow my work on Twitter.  Warm Regards, ￼  David Cicilline Member of Congress

Dear Friend,  According to the Associated Press, 80,000 Americans died from the flu and its complications last winter, the highest number of deaths in 40 years.  The best way to prevent the flu is to get vaccinated on a yearly basis. Flu vaccines have been shown to prevent illness, doctors’ visits, and hospitalizations and can be life-saving. Those that are vaccinated and still get the flu often have milder symptoms.

The Hill Report   A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions Week of October 1- October 5, 2018
As the father of a son with a pre-existing condition, Down Syndrome, I know firsthand the importance of protecting patients with special medical needs from discrimination. In my healthcare plan, I made sure to preserve patient protections, especially ones to prevent anyone from discriminating against patients with pre-existing conditions. To cement these protections, I proudly introduced a resolution to ensure that patients with pre-existing conditions are protected from the erroneously high costs and the limited options they are experiencing now under Obamacare. I am glad to lead my colleagues in this effort to fight for those who need it most and ensure their access to affordable and high-quality healthcare. Read more on my widely supported resolution here. 
￼ 
October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. More importantly, it is an opportunity to highlight breast cancer prevention, education, and individuals and groups that are working hard to find a cure. In fact, one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in their lifetime. For this very reason, we must continue to support research efforts so that one day we can finally defeat this disease and live in a cancer-free world. 
For the past two years I have proudly joined my colleague Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY) in leading an effort to generate funds for breast cancer research through the Breast Cancer Awareness Commemorative Coin Act  (Public Law 114-148). Earlier this year, I proudly joined Congresswoman Maloney, Senator Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) President Myra Biblowit, Acting Deputy Director of the U.S. Mint David Croft, and Breast Cancer Survivor Melissa Miller to celebrate the launch of the Breast Cancer Awareness Commemorative Coin program at the U.S. Capitol. The coin will be on sale for the remainder of 2018. If you are interested in purchasing a Breast Cancer Commemorative Coin from the U.S. Mint, click here. Again, all profits will be paid to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) for the purpose of furthering breast cancer research.  Breast cancer kills more than 40,000 women and men in the U.S. every year. This heartbreaking disease has taken the lives of far too many of our wives, mothers, sisters, family members, and friends, but with this new coin, we can hopefully raise millions of dollars for research to defeat breast cancer once and for all.
Events in the District 
Episcopal School of Dallas’ AP U.S. Government Class  This week, I had the pleasure of visiting the Episcopal School of Dallas’ AP U.S. Government class to share what I do as their Congressman and as Chairman of the House Rules Committee, which is best known for establishing the terms and conditions of debate on the House floor, including most importantly determining the amendments – if any – that are made in order for a vote. Seeing the students engage with North Texas leaders is a testament to why we need to continue fighting for the best possible future for our children and future generations. 
￼  Congressman Sessions visiting an AP U.S. Government class at ESD.  
National Night Out On Tuesday night, I participated in the City of Richardson’s 28th Annual National Night Out, a national campaign designed to heighten crime prevention awareness, strengthen police-community partnerships, and send a message to criminals letting them know that neighborhoods are organized and fighting back.  I visited three different block parties with the Mayor of Richardson Paul Voelker and Richardson Police Chief Jim Spivey.  It was a great night of backing the blue and speaking with members in the Richardson community. 
 ￼
￼
SoldierStrong Reception   On Thursday I was delighted to speak at the SoldierStrong reception in Dallas. This incredible organization has a mission to improve the lives of men and women of the United States Armed Forces through opportunities like scholarships for returning veterans and rehabilitation technology to assist the veterans with recovery. Our nation owes a great debt to our veterans and I will continue to work hard to ensure that my colleagues and I pass common-sense legislation to ensure our veterans and service members are receiving the best possible benefits and care.
￼
 ￼
 Mental Health Awareness Initiative  Earlier this week, I organized a roundtable and facilitated a discussion about the mental health struggles facing the North Texas Community.  This discussion originated from concerns brought to me by the Director of the Dallas VA, Dr. Stephen Holt, and the introduction of the Veteran Resource Center’s new Stop One Campaign, a suicide prevention program.  I was pleased to sit down with city, state and mental health care communities leaders who have a vested interest in not only stopping the stigma associated with mental health but finding real world solutions.  I found the conversation to be very helpful and informative and I look forward to a continued dialogue.

House Passes Rep. Taylor's Bill, H.R. 5075, the Ashanti Alert Act
￼  Rep. Taylor speaks on behalf of the Ashanti Alert Act with the parents and family of Ashanti Billie 
On September 25th, I had the privilege of meeting with Ashanti Billie's parents, family, and friends to commemorate the legacy of Ashanti on the day of the passage of my bill, H.R. 5075, the Ashanti Alert Act. This bipartisan bill passed in the House of Representatives that evening, which brings the bill one step closer to being signed into law by the President later this year.   
The Ashanti Alert system establishes an alert network to help local and regional law enforcement efforts to search for missing adults between the ages of 18-65. This system would use a wide array of media outlets - such as commercial radio stations, television stations, and cable television - to broadcast information about missing persons. It also sets a minimum standard for issuing alerts if the person suffers from a proven mental or physical disability; if law enforcement believes physical safety is endangered; or if they believe their disappearance may not have been voluntary. The Ashanti Alert also integrates with the Blue Network instead of AMBER so that information about missing adults and children are kept separate. This ensure that law enforcement efforts are not duplicated, which could mean the difference between locating a person and saving them.
I want to thank Representatives Smith, Raskin, and Ciciline for their support and leadership on this bill, and extend my deepest sympathies to the parents, family, and friends of Ashanti Billie for their loss. Although Ashanti is no longer with us, her legacy will live on in this legislation and give law enforcement all across the country the tools they need to locate missing adults in danger. 
Here you can watch my additional remarks on the Ashanti Alert Act on Headline News.  

  
Rep. Taylor Recognized as the Congressional Legislator of the Year 
￼  Rep. Taylor accepted the Congressional Legislator of the Year plaque from MG John P. McLaren 
Last week, I had the honor of being recognized as the Congressional Legislator of the Year by MG John P. McLaren, President of the Hampton Roads Chapter, Military Officer's Association of America (MOAA). The MOAA represents the interests of active duty and retired military officers, while also supporting a strong national defense. This remains especially essential to many constituents in the second district of Virginia. I want to thank the MOAA for all of their support for the military members and veterans in Hampton Roads.  

House Passes Defense Funding for Fiscal Year 2019
￼ 
On September 26th, the House of Representatives passed an Appropriations 'minibus' funding bill that included the Department of Defense (DoD), Labor, Health, and Human Services (LHHS), and Education Appropriation bills for fiscal year 2019. This also included a short term Continuing Resolution (CR) to temporarily fund remaining government programs until December 7, 2018.  
This piece of legislation provides a total of $674.4 billion for Defense in areas of Military Personnel and Pay, Operation and Maintenance, Research and Development, and Equipment Procurement. More funding details can be found here.  
This is the first time in over 10 years that Congress has passed an appropriations bull funding the Department of Defense before the end of the fiscal year. This is an important step toward returning to regular order and passing funding bills on time. These funds will support our military readiness by providing the weapons, platforms, and equipment our military needs to do their jobs and prepare for future fights. It also gives our troops access to vital training and a long overdue pay raise - the largest in almost a decade. Our service members deserve our support, which is why I proudly support this legislation that will help them carry out their mission.  

Rep. Taylor's Staff Attends Peninsula READS Event
￼ 
On September 18, members of my district staff attended the Rise & Shine for Literacy Breakfast hosted by Peninsula READS. Peninsula READS is a non-profit community literacy program that provides tutoring services in the subjects of reading, writing, and math for adults in Hampton, Newport News, Poquoson, and York County. My staff had the opportunity to hear from the Peninsula READS President, Executive Director of Research, and Executive Director, as well as a testimonial from a participant. This event allowed for my staff to learn more about how we can better engage in programs that promote education within our communities and across the country.  

Rep. Taylor's Staff Attends the Foodbank Bus Tour
￼  District staff member, Jaquelyn Murray, met with Foodbank staff and volunteers to discuss their local work 
This past week, my district staff members attended the Foodbank Bus Tour, hosted by the Foodbank of Southeastern Virginia and the Eastern Shore at their Norfolk headquarters. My staff had the chance to meet with Hampton Roads organizations that work with the Foodbank, along with the staff and volunteers. They learned about the Foodbank's work with providing meals to those in need in order to achieve a hunger-free community. The Foodbank teams with local organizations to collect and deliver food, clothing, and other products to those in need.  

Rep. Taylor's Staff Attends the Women's Business Conference 
￼  District staff member Jaquelyn Murray with local women leaders at the Women's Business Conference  
On September 20th, members of my staff had the privilege of attending the Women's Business Conference hosted by the Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce. Women from many different industries attended the conference to hear from local business leaders about their paths to success and advice on best practices for their businesses. My staff had the opportunity to hear from keynote speaker Michelle Moore and attend smaller group sessions to discuss leadership, employment, and success within the business community.  

Rep. Taylor Receives the Guardian of Small Business Award 
￼  Rep. Taylor receives the Guardian of Small Business Award from the NFIB 
I had the privilege of accepting the Guardian of Small Business Award from the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) for my voting record of supporting American businesses. The NFIB, a non-profit and non-partisan organization, advocates for small businesses across the United States.  The organization represents issues that affect small businesses, including taxes, healthcare, and federal regulations. The NFIB works closely with elected officials, like myself, to voice their support for legislation that will better allow for small businesses across the nation to thrive and succeed.

Dear Neighbor,
Did you know there are currently more open jobs than there are people looking for them due to the recent tax cuts and our smart, but aggressive, deregulation agenda?
It is vitally important for our workforce to be equipped with the necessary training to fill these jobs.
Now more than ever, students who pursue Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) degrees and careers have access to high demand, good paying jobs.
If we cannot provide a workforce that can fill these positions, America will have to rely on foreign labor.
We have seen first hand Pathways in Technology Early College High School (P-TECH)  programming at the Greater Southern Tier STEM Academy in Corning and the WNY P-TECH STEM College and Career Academy in Dunkirk.
We understand the importance of these programs and that is why we support:
Leveraging and Energizing America’s Apprenticeship Programs Act
	•	Incentivizes employers to take on apprentices and engage in mentorship programs.  
Developing Tomorrow’s Engineering and Technical Workforce Act
	•	Provides our children the foundations they need to succeed in this changing and growing economy. 
	•	Award grants to States educational agencies and local educational agencies to support, develop, and implement formal and informal engineering education programs in elementary schools and secondary schools.
Building Blocks of STEM Act 
	•	Instructs the National Science Foundation, when awarding grants under the Discovery Research PreK-12 program, to consider age distribution when allocating funding for research studies with and to ensure a focus on early childhood.
	•	It is essential to get children knowledgeable and interested in STEM early on.
As always, please reach out to any of our offices if you have questions or need assistance.
Until next time,
 
Tom

Dear Friend,   Thank you for the opportunity to update you on the work of the 115th Congress. I trust this finds you and your family well, as we work together to bring Hoosier common sense to Washington.

In This Week's Rokita Report

This Week in Photos
￼
Thank you Lt. Junior Grade Joshua Chu for serving as Ryan's and my escort during the commissioning of the USS Indiana.
￼
The USS Indiana is an impressive submarine.  It was an honor to be at the commissioning with Governor Holcomb and other distinguished guests.
￼
I spoke to the crew of the USS Indiana to wish them well on behalf of all Hoosiers.  See my remarks here.

USS Indiana Takes To Sea
On September 29, 2018, the US Navy commissioned the USS Indiana.  She is the third ship to carry the name and the US Navy's newest Virginia-class fast attack submarine.  One of the most powerful submarines ever built, it will carry our state's name proudly.
It was an honor to participate in the Commissioning ceremony for this ship along with Governor Eric Holcomb and Congressman Jim Banks.  The ceremony was extra special for me because my son Ryan was with me to see this vessel of American ingenuity and meet some of the brave service-members who will crew the USS Indiana.  You can watch the full commissioning ceremony here.
￼
Some facts about the USS Indiana from the Navy:
	•	377 feet long
	•	34 feet wide
	•	7,800 tons when submerged
	•	140 -person crew
	•	Top speed of 28 mph
	•	More than 100 Indiana companies have helped supply parts for the submarine
Town Hall - October 21
As your United States Representative, I find it important to be out in the community and hear from the people who I proudly serve.  I will not shy away from public meetings.  Hoosiers know that the American Constitution gives us the right to the freedom of expression through the First Amendment.  Let us express this God-given right by coming together, hearing from one another, and discussing in a civil way the issues that affect our community and our country.  To provide an opportunity to do so, I will be holding a town hall on Sunday, October 21 in Frankfort.
￼
Public meetings are a part of my job.  They are a chance for me to get my marching orders and for me to discuss issues directly with my fellow Hoosiers.  I hope to see you there at the Frankfort Neighborhood Center.
Protecting Native American Graves
Recently, I introduced bipartisan legislation to increase the fines paid for by organizations that violate federal laws protecting Native American graves.  I introduced the bill in part because I was troubled by what I read about a problem happening in Indiana.  The United States Department of the Interior issued a fine following an IndyStar report on activities happening in Hamilton County.  It is imperative that we respect the rich history of Native American culture, which is uniquely American, and give tribes and their deceased the respect that they deserve.
No one is above the law, especially researchers and professors who rely on federal funding.  It is clear that the penalties under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) are not sufficient to protect Native American remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and other cultural patrimony.  My bill would increase the penalties for NAGPRA violations and move enforcement to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

10/5/18 14:52,Back where we began…,"￼
It’s been nearly three months since I first stepped onto the Senate floor to fight for President Trump’s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. We’ve had five days of public hearings, over 1,300 written questions, reviewed more documents than any other Supreme Court nominee in our nation’s history, gotten the FBI involved, and more. 
Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to once again speak out for Judge Kavanaugh on the Senate floor.
￼  
Click here to watch the speech I gave on the Senate floor! 
Dr. Ford has made serious allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, and the Senate took the appropriate steps to evaluate them. I said all accusations deserve to be heard, but they must be verified, which the Senate immediately took action to attempt. We invited Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh to testify, and they did so. Committee investigators spoke with numerous individuals. The committee also took statements under penalty of felony from the alleged witnesses Dr. Ford named. In order to ensure Senators and the American people that we were using every resource available to do our due diligence, we requested a supplemental background investigation from the FBI. The seventh of Judge Kavanaugh’s long career of public service. Like the 6 before it, the background investigation turned up no new evidence to corroborate any allegations of misconduct against Judge Kavanaugh.
With no corroborating evidence for Dr. Ford’s claims, all we have to go on is her story. Although not dispositive, there are questions and inconsistencies and puzzling aspects that call into question the reliability of her account. So, we’re left back where we were before this whole sordid saga began. I’m sorry that Judge Kavanaugh has had to go through this ordeal. He did not deserve this. He is a good man who spent decades building a reputation of decency and fairness. His opponents have destroyed it with three weeks of smut and unsubstantiated allegations.
But I know Brett Kavanaugh. He is a man of great resilience and firm conviction. He is going to be a great Justice, perhaps one of the greatest we’ve had. He will bring to the Supreme Court the integrity, honor, and intellectual rigor he has demonstrated throughout his entire career.
Rest assured, I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. He is unquestionably qualified. He has gone through the most thorough vetting process I’ve ever seen. We know what we need to know. The American people know what they need to know. It’s time to vote. I am looking forward to confirming this good man to the Supreme Court.
Sincerely,
  ￼

Long’s Short Report – Tax Reform 2.0
By Rep. Billy Long
Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was signed into law last December, Americans had to deal with a decades old tax code that had not been updated since Ronald Reagan was president. With the leadership of President Trump, that all changed. Since the tax cuts were signed into law, 1.7 million jobs have been added to the economy, the unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been since 1969, hardworking Taxpayers have more money in their pockets and businesses have used their savings to invest in both their employees and equipment.
As great as this news is, there is still more work that needs to be done. My Republican colleagues and I have been working on legislation, Tax Reform 2.0, to build upon the TCJA’s successes. This September, the House of Representatives passed the three bills that make up Tax Reform 2.0: the American Innovation Act, the Family Savings Act and the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act.
The American Innovation Act would help start-up businesses by providing incentives to expand and bring on new investors while also allowing them to write off even more of their start-up costs than previously allowed. Essentially, this bill would provide individuals wanting to start their own businesses the necessary resources to do so.
The Family Savings Act aims to help families save more money. This bill would allow businesses to create additional ways for individuals and families to save by partnering up with other small businesses to create a 401(k) plan that is both affordable and easy to use. Along with helping individuals save more, this bill would also allow military reservists to contribute the maximum amount to their civilian retirement accounts, military thrift savings plans and 401(k)s.
The third and final piece of Tax Reform 2.0 is the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act, which would finally make the tax cuts for businesses and individuals permanent. According to the Tax Foundation, making the individual and small business tax cuts permanent would create 1.5 million jobs, increase wages by almost 1 percent and increase the gross domestic product by 2.2 percent.
All three Tax Reform 2.0 bills were passed in the House in September with little to no support from across the aisle. These bills would give individuals and businesses the certainty they need and deserve while also allowing the economy to continue to grow.

10/5/18 13:52,Blaine’s Bulletin: A Modern Trade Agreement for North America,"￼ 
October 5, 2018

BLAINE'S BULLETIN

For nearly a decade, I’ve been proud to serve Missouri’s third district. Over the past ten years, I’ve sponsored hundreds of bills, and one of the most important lessons I’ve learned is that no bill is perfect. Whether the bill is sponsored by a Republican or Democrat, all legislation must be reassessed as time goes on to ensure it is still doing its intended job for Missourians.
This week, President Trump’s renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) finished with the U.S. coming to an agreement with two of our closest trading partners, Mexico and Canada. The deal modernizes the critically important trade pact that will now be referred to as the United-States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement (USMCA). Thanks to the hard work of President Trump and United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, the USMCA creates a more balanced trade agreement, serving the interests of American workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses.
Having grown up raising hogs and cattle, I understand how hard farmers work day in and day out to provide for their families and put food on tables around the world. With more than 11,000 farms in Missouri’s third district, it is critical for us to have fair access to our trading partners’ markets. After twenty-four years, it became clear NAFTA provided our farmers with outdated and unbalanced protections, providing benefits to some, while hurting other workers and agribusinesses. Thanks to the good faith negotiations between all three countries, farmers will finally have the economic stability and certainty they deserve.   
Not only will the USMCA help our farmers, but it will also strengthen the middle class. Over the last two decades, American workers had lost faith, being hurt by closed factories, exported jobs, and a stagnant economy. Nearly half a billion people call North America home, and by deepening our economic ties with Mexico and Canada, the agreement will result in economic growth, freer markets and fairer trade. In particular, the USMCA will stimulate American auto manufacturing and jobs by encouraging the use of high-wage manufacturing labor and updating automotive rules of origin to incentivize United States vehicle and auto parts production.
NAFTA was not perfect, but hindsight is 20/20. I’m happy to see the Trump administration taking the lead and working cooperatively with our trading partners to negotiate better deals for our country. Americans across the nation will enjoy continued economic growth and see the creation of good, well-paying jobs thanks to the hard work of President Trump. It took twenty-four years, but once the new USMCA is finalized and implemented, North America will finally enjoy a high-standard trade agreement that works for our 21st century economy.

10/5/18 12:53,So much more,"￼ 

Dear Friend, 
I wanted to make sure you know about a few things happening in the 23rd District of Texas. Here's the latest:  
It's great to see folks provide helping hands to the more than 25 percent of the Sonora community impacted by recent flooding. Learn more here.  
￼ 
Our libraries do so much more than just provide books. They're the main source of literacy programming, technology training and job seeking assistance for many South and West Texas communities. That's why I introduced a bipartisan bill this week to ensure their continued success. 
￼ 
After over 100 town halls in almost 4 years, what always stands out while crisscrossing TX-23 is that Texans want their elected officials to work together to get things done. I'll continue to find solutions to big problems and deliver real results back home.  
￼ 
There's still time for TX-23 students to enter this year's Congressional App Challenge! Learn more and sign up here.  
￼ 
My team is collecting personal stories from TX-23 veterans for the Library of Congress's Veterans History Project throughout the month of October. To learn more or make an appointment today, visit my website or call (210) 921-3130. 
￼ 
As always, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office with any questions or concerns. For further updates on my work for you, I encourage you to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube at @HurdontheHill. 
Have a great weekend! 
 Sincerely,

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 10.5.18
Friday, October 5, 2018 –                                 
Energy and Commerce Work
As you know, I serve on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The following are some of the issues we are working on.
Progress on Prescription Drug Prices
High prescription drug prices are a burden on many Ninth District residents. There are a variety of reasons why prices have soared, but one necessary factor in order to bring them down is transparency.
Thanks to legislation that has passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, transparency will be coming to drug prices. Both chambers of Congress passed the Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018 and the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act. These bills prohibit “gag clauses,” which I have discussed in this column before.
In some circumstances, a person could save money by paying cash for a prescription instead of using health insurance, but gag clauses imposed by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) have prohibited pharmacists from telling their customers that information.
This practice is unfair, and I was an original cosponsor of the Know the Cost Act to ban gag clauses. This legislation was unanimously voted out of the Energy and Commerce Committee in September and is similar to the bills that later passed the House and the Senate, both of which are supported by President Trump.
More work remains to be done to make prescription drugs affordable, but banning gag clauses and encouraging transparency will help achieve this goal.
Caring for New Mothers
The death of any new mother in childbirth or due to its complications is a tragedy. Unfortunately, such tragedies have occurred more frequently in recent years in the United States.
Among numerous indicators of this trend, a 2016 report found a near-27 percent increase in the maternal mortality rate for 48 states and Washington, D.C. from 2000 to 2014.
The House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Health Subcommittee, on which I serve, held a recent hearing to look more closely at this disturbing trend. We heard testimony from medical professionals and advocates, including a man who had lost his wife after she gave birth via cesarian section due to inattention by medical staff.
We examined draft legislation, the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2018, with the hope of reducing these tragedies.
To address the problem, we first need better information. This legislation improves data collection on maternal mortality. Having more comprehensive information would serve the Ninth District well by letting us compare data at a regional and national level. This would be accomplished by reporting this information to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When an area is near several states, as ours is, having information only at the state level offers limited benefits.
Rising maternal mortality in America is a troubling trend. We can and will do better.
Energy Security
Energy powers our country’s economy, our national security, our leisure and recreational activities, almost our entire way of life. Because energy is pervasive, it is vulnerable to risks, whether accidents, natural disasters, or people who wish to do harm.
Threats to energy infrastructure require vigilance on the part of government and the energy industry. Vulnerabilities need to be assessed, plans need to be made for contingencies, and awareness needs to keep up with threats that constantly evolve. In a wireless world, cyber threats are as real a danger as physical threats.
The Energy Subcommittee I serve on recently held a hearing to consider this important topic, featuring testimony from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response.
I used my time to ask the Assistant Secretary about pipeline security, a topic critical for American energy security and personally meaningful for Ninth District residents with property currently crossed by or near pipelines and residents in the pathway of new pipelines.
Technology exists that can sense problems, such as leaks, where they occur. The same technology can tell you when someone is walking, driving, or shoveling near the pipeline. Requiring this technology to be added to any new pipelines and any pipelines that are being repaired would be a great asset for ensuring the security of vast lengths of pipelines. Accordingly, I urged the Assistant Secretary to look at it as a solution.
If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.  You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671. To reach my office via email, please visit my website at www.morgangriffith.house.gov.

10/5/18 12:21,Tax Reform 2.0,"￼ 
October 5, 2018

Dear Friend, 

When the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, we knew it would boost the economy.  What we are seeing in Mississippi and across the nation has far exceeded our expectations.  The impact is profound.  More take-home pay is enabling the majority of Americans to improve their quality of life and plan for the future.  Tax reform combined with regulatory rollbacks is enabling companies to share their tax savings with their employees in the form of higher wages, bonuses, and benefits.  Not only that, companies are investing in their operations, expanding, and creating more jobs.

Click here to see examples of tax reform good news in Mississippi provided by Americans for Tax Reform (ATR).

The next step is to make these changes permanent.  Legislation we call ""Tax Reform 2.0"" is the answer.  This package, consisting of three bills, will secure the reforms initiated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  These bills will protect middle class and small business tax cuts, promote family savings, and boost the confidence of potential entrepreneurs.  To learn more about these important pieces of legislation, please click on the links below.

H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018

H.R. 6757, the Family Savings Act of 2018

H.R. 6756, the American Innovation Act of 2018
                                
ACTIONS IN THE HOUSE
 The opioid crisis continues to wreak havoc on the lives of people in Mississippi and across the nation.  We have made significant progress to address this situation through passage of legislation which will improve treatment, recovery, and prevention.  In June, the House passed a series of bills to help achieve our objectives.                                                
￼
 Last week, we made additional progress to address this crisis with passage of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act.  The bipartisan bill encourages the development of new, non-addictive painkillers, improves prescription drug monitoring programs, improves access to care, addresses the impact of opioids on families, and establishes comprehensive opioid recovery centers.
 Treatment and Recovery:                                             
	•	Improve and expand access to treatment and recovery services
	•	Provide incentives for enhanced care, coordination, and innovation
	•	Establish comprehensive opioid recovery centers
Prevention:
	•	Encourage non-addictive opioid alternatives to treat pain
	•	Improve data to identify and help at-risk patients and families
	•	Address high prescribing rates while enhancing prescription drug monitoring program
Protecting Communities: 
	•	Give law enforcement tools to get dangerous drugs out of communities
	•	Better intercept illicit opioids at international mail facilities
	•	Improve access to federal resources for local communities
Fighting Fentanyl:
	•	Better tackle ever-changing drugs
	•	Crack down on foreign shipments of illicit drugs
	•	Provide grants for local communities to combat Fentanyl                 

GOLD STAR MOTHER'S AND FAMILY'S DAY

On Sunday, September 30, our nation recognized Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day.  These families lost a loved one who served on active duty in the United States Armed Forces.  Recently, 
Gold Star families were recognized at the Honor Our Troops Classic in Olive Branch.

￼
Kelly Bagwell, Donna Bagwell, Jim Fleming, 
Pam Fleming, Tamela Bussard, 
Mike Morel, Molly Morel, and Pearlie Gordon
  
Mrs. Pearlie Gordon was among those in attendance.  PFC Shedrick Deon Gordon, Jr., Mrs. Gordon's son, was a soldier serving in the Hernando-based Company A 2/198th Combined Arms Battalion when he passed away on August 29, 2009.  The 22-year-old native of Sardis served as a recruiter.  Mrs. Gordon said it was always her son's goal to serve in the military.  ""I'm very proud,"" Mrs. Gordon said.  ""Deon was a loving person who reached out to the community.  He was a true leader who went above and beyond to encourage others to serve.""

￼

PFC Gordon is survived by his parents, Shedrick Deon Gordon, Sr. and Pearlie Gordon; and his two sisters, Shameka Shaw and Shavetta Gordon.

￼
Pearlie and Shedrick Gordon, Sr.

My thoughts and prayers are with all of our Gold Star families.  The service and sacrifice of their loved ones will always be remembered.


ACADEMY DAY 2018

Academy Day 2018 is coming soon! It is a privilege to host this event which offers middle and high school students an opportunity to learn more about serving our nation as an officer in the U.S. Armed Forces.  Over the years, we have had a tremendous response from young people, parents, teachers, and Service Academy representatives.  Every year, officers have shared their personal experiences which inspired others to follow in their footsteps.  I look forward to more of the same on October 13 in Oxford.  Hope to see you there.

￼


CADET CONNOR SPROUT

Cadet Connor Sprout was born and raised in Olive Branch.  He knew at a young age that he wanted to pursue a military career.  When he was in middle school, Connor attended his first Academy Day.  In 2016, it was my pleasure to nominate Connor to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.  Conner, a junior at West Point, said attending Academy Day helped him to learn more about his options.  ""Academy Day gave me the opportunity to talk directly with Service Academy and ROTC representatives,"" Conner said.  ""I listened to what they had to say.""

￼

Connor said his experience at West Point has been challenging and rewarding.  ""It is time consuming,"" Connor said.  ""There are academic and physical demands that will test your mental and physical abilities.  It is tough, but definitely rewarding.""  Those who plan to attend one of the military academies should pursue leadership positions while in high school.  Making good grades is essential.  Connor is looking forward to graduation in 2020.  I wish Connor well as he pursues a career as an officer in the U.S. Army.

Dear Lindsey, 
From a trilateral trade agreement to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to reforming our tax code, to harvesting corn across the 18th District, the last couple weeks have been busy both here at home and in Washington, D.C. Continue on to read my latest update:
Changing the Culture in Washington D.C.  
￼
￼
Last week, House Republicans renewed our commitment to the American taxpayer. In the last nine months, we have seen the results of pro-growth tax reform that puts the interests of hard-working families above those in Washington. Take home pay is up 4.9%, Jobless claims are at a 49 year low, and in Illinois' 18th District the average middle-class family has seen a savings of $2,100. The economy is booming and with passage of Tax Reform 2.0 we are making sure the economic prosperity is here to stay.
In Tax Reform 2.0, we provide certainty to taxpayers by making the tax cuts from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, incentivize individuals and families to start saving early in life, and unleash America’s innovative spirit so startups can move to Main Street and beyond. As a member of the Committee on Ways and Means I was proud to work with Chairman Rep. Kevin Brady and the entire committee to provide relief to hard working families in central and west-central Illinois. 
Release: House Passes Tax Reform 2.0, Ensuring Economic Gains Are Here to Stay 
ICYMI: My Op-ed on Tax Reform 2.0
￼ 
I penned an op-ed, setting the record straight on tax reform and highlighting the important work we are doing on the Committee on Ways and Means to further the economic gains hard-working families in Illinois have seen over the past nine months with Tax Reform 2.0. You can read the op-ed in the Peoria Journal Star here. 
An Updated NAFTA for the American Farmer

As we are currently in the middle of harvest, farmers are trucking strong yields to the elevators. We are seeing lines and piles of corn and soybeans at the elevators and the news of this deal will come with eagerness as farmers work to sell their products to our neighboring markets. Free trade is vital to Illinois’ 18th District and modernizing NAFTA into the 21st Century will ensure that exporters in Illinois have access to important international markets without being hit with burdensome tariffs, keeping them competitive in the global economy. I applaud the efforts of President Trump and his Administration in working to bring Canada and Mexico together for the USMCA and look forward to reviewing the provisions and working with my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee and the Administration to ensure this revamped agreement protects the interests of central and west-central Illinois.

Talking Opioid Crisis with Bloomington Fire Department
￼ 
First responders are crucial to combating the opioid epidemic and I was pleased hear directly from the Bloomington Fire Department on ways we can reduce overdoses and equip responders with the necessary resources to save lives. I am grateful for the brave service of these men and women and look forward to continued dialogue about keeping our community safe.
Congress Passes Sweeping Legislation to Battle Opioid Crisis
￼ 
Since joining Congress, I have made combating the opioid epidemic a top priority of mine. I am proud that the Opioid Addiction Action Plan, legislation I introduced along with Rep. Adam Kinzinger, and Democrats, Rep. Danny K. Davis, and Rep. Yvette D. Clarke, was included in this strong bipartisan effort to fight the opioid crisis, which has ravished families in central and west-central Illinois. Our bill will require the Centers for Medicare/Medicaid (CMS) to develop an “Opioid Action Plan” along with stakeholders, to find innovative ways we can combat this ongoing public health crisis.
As a whole, this represents the largest legislative effort to fight the opioid epidemic and will incentivize the development of non-addictive painkillers, alternative pain management, expand grant funding for local law enforcement to combat the flow of fentanyl, and provide additional funding for rehabilitation opportunities. This legislation passed the House, with my support, 396-14 and the Senate 98-1.
Families in central and west-central Illinois are looking for solutions to ease the burden the opioid epidemic has placed on their lives. While there is still work ahead of us, this bipartisan effort is a step in the right direction towards saving lives.

Congress Sends FAA Reauthorization to the President's Desk
￼ 
Last week, the House and Senate passed the five-year reauthorization  for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), sending the legislation to President Trump's desk.  This bipartisan legislation provides long-term certainty for America’s airport infrastructure, air travelers, and innovators, and I was happy to support this bill to ensure the Federal Aviation Administration can continue making air travel safer and more efficient while remaining the world-leader in aviation. Our regional airports in central and west-central Illinois play a vital role in bringing economic prosperity to our local communities and this legislation will help in making sure that we continue that progress for years to come. Read more here. 
Conversation with the McLean County Chamber of Commerce
￼ 
I recently visited with the McLean County Chamber of Commerce Government Affairs Committee where we discussed various topic impacting McLean County and the 18th District such as a growing economy, continuous demand for skilled workers, healthcare costs, infrastructure, trade, and tax reform.
Thank you to all committee members who joined me for a great discussion and thank you for all you do to help grow economic opportunities for McLean County. 
Bipartisan Celebration of Illinois' Bicentennial
￼ 
My friend and colleague Raja Krishnamoorthi and I introduced legislation last week to designate an area within Anacostia Park in Washington, D.C. as the “Illinois Bicentennial Grove,” where four White Oak trees have been planted. As the state tree of Illinois, these trees have been planted in honor of four prominent abolitionists from the Land of Lincoln—Edward Coles, Mary Brown Davis, and Elijah and Owen Lovejoy. As we continue to recognize our state’s bicentennial alongside the collaborative efforts of the Illinois State Society of Washington, DC, this grove will serve as a distinct reminder of the rich history that our home state holds over the past two centuries. 
Illinois Wesleyan Helping Local Entrepreneurship
￼ 
Special thanks to the Small Business Development Center at Illinois Wesleyan University for showing me the incredible work being done to guide local entrepreneurs who are looking to start, manage, or expand their small businesses. Whether it’s navigating the numerous regulations that affect their industries, understanding and analyzing financials, developing a marketing campaign, or just wondering what needs to be considered when starting a small business, the SBDC is there as a reliable resource for their 240+ clients.
Thank you for all you do in helping all of McLean County entrepreneurs get started or become better at following their passions. 
Helping After Hurricane Florence
￼ 
Following the devastating impact Hurricane Florence had on the East Coast, I was pleased to join the Central Illinois Community Blood Center to encourage support for victims of Hurricane Florence. As response units work to day and night, they rely on blood donations to save lives and keep their supplies replenished. It has been great to see so many from Central Illinois lend a hand and I encourage all those who are able to donate to roll up their sleeves and help our friends in need.
Celebrating Sam Johnson
￼ ￼
Last week, I was honored to sit on the Committee on Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security hearing as Sam Johnson presided over the Subcommittee for the final time as Chairman. Chairman Johnson is an American hero. A retired U.S. Air Force Colonel, Mr. Johnson is a decorated fighter pilot veteran from both the Korean and Vietnam War, where he was a prisoner of war for nearly seven years. During his time as Subcommittee Chairman, he committed himself to protecting Social Security benefits, and I am grateful I was able to play a role in his mission. I am thankful for Chairman Johnson's service to our country and his friendship on the Committee. We will miss him greatly!
Release: Chairman Johnson, American Hero, Gavels Final Hearing as Subcommittee Chair 
Basketball for Charity
￼ 
Last week, it was great to join a bipartisan group of colleagues to play in the Congressional Basketball game to support the Hoops for Youth Foundation. Hoops for Youth provides opportunity to at-risk youths through basketball and teaches kids the skills they need to succeed both on and off the court. It was great to celebrate 20 years of supporting kids in the community!

In Washington, DC 

Congressman Serrano and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Requests Meeting With Smithsonian Institution 
Congressman Serrano, Congresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham, Chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC), Senator Robert Menendez and members of CHC leadership, sent a letter to Smithsonian Institution Secretary David Skorton, requesting a meeting to discuss concerns about the recent findings from a University of California study that found that the Smithsonian has failed to heed its own recommendations and take measures to improve the representation of Latinos and Latinas across exhibitions and its workforce.
Congressman Serrano and Senator Robert Menendez are the primary Democratic sponsors of the National Museum of the American Latino Act (H.R. 2911/S. 1364). The National Museum of the American Latino Act is a bipartisan, bicameral legislative effort to establish the National Museum of the American Latino within the Smithsonian Institution and help share and celebrate the history, culture, arts, and contributions made by Latinos in the United States. Full text of the letter follows and can be found here. 
Last week Congressman Serrano also attended a reception to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month and support the campaign for a Smithsonian Latino Museum.

On 1 Year Anniversary of Hurricane Maria, Congressman Serrano Introduces COMPROMISO Act 
In commemorating Hurricane Maria's passage through Puerto Rico a year ago, Congressman Serrano introduced the COMPROMISO Act - the Continuing Our Mission in Puerto Rico to Optimize and Modernize Infrastructure and Sustain Obligations Act. Co-sponsored by Reps. González-Colón, Velázquez, Soto, and Gutiérrez, the bill would extend 100 percent cost share waivers for FEMA categories A and B in Puerto Rico. This will ensure that the federal government continues covering the costs of emergency assistance to the island after Hurricane Maria.
In 2007, in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Dennis and Rita, similar language was incorporated into Public Law 110-28 to extend local cost share waivers for the Gulf Coast states that had been affected by these hurricanes. Click here for background info and more details on this change. 
“One year after Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico is still struggling to fully recover. While we’ve made tremendous progress in Congress by securing significant emergency relief funding for the island, most of this funding hasn’t been disbursed and the island is still going through a financial crisis. Puerto Rico’s local government still can’t bear the burden of FEMA’s cost share requirement, and demanding that it do so now will only further slow and hinder local recovery efforts. This bill will extend the cost share waivers to ensure the federal government continues covering this cost as it did in the Gulf Coast states after Hurricane Katrina,” said Congressman Serrano.
Congressman Serrano also published an Op-Ed on The Hill today on the one year anniversary of Hurricane Maria’s passage through Puerto Rico, the federal government’s response, and the need for the federal government to commit itself to the island’s reconstruction. To read the article click here.  
Congressman Serrano has been a vocal advocate for Puerto Rico for many years, he has been a leader in seeking adequate resources for the rebuilding of Puerto Rico post Hurricane Maria:

Congressman Serrano, Congresswoman Velazquez, Senator Gillibrand, Senator Warren and Senator Sanders Continue Pressuring Secretary DeVos and Dept. of Education for Answers on Status of Emergency Funding 
Congressman Serrano led a letter, along with Congresswoman Velázquez, and Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, to U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos following up on two previous letters to inquire about the status of federal disaster aid allocated to help displaced students and directly impacted institutions of higher education affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.
The members questioned again why only such a small percentage of the funding appropriated for these purposes had been disbursed; why numerous application hurdles hadn’t been fixed or addressed, and why the Department continues to ignore criticism and recommendations from members of Congress.
“As you are aware, the Puerto Rican government’s official estimate of the lives lost in Puerto Rico from these hurricanes and their aftermaths was recently revised, indicating that 2,975 individuals perished in the storms. Many communities, particularly in rural areas, continue to struggle to recover. Nevertheless, it appears the Department has only spent $5.4 million, or just seven percent, of the $75 million Congress appropriated in disaster aid for displaced students affected by the hurricanes. Of the $100 million Congress appropriated for directly impacted institutions of higher education, the Department has only disbursed $63 million, leaving nearly $37 million of that funding left unspent. It was Congress’s intent to have this funding disbursed as quickly as possible to help affected students recover and to complete their studies. Unfortunately, it appears that the Department fails to see any sense of urgency in the matter—even as a new hurricane season has begun,” the members wrote.
“It is unfortunate that the Department appears to be doing only the minimum to provide funding to students and institutions of higher education impacted by last year’s hurricanes. We hope that you actively work to change that perception by making recovery efforts in Puerto Rico and other impacted areas a high priority for the Department, just as you would any other state. Additionally, it is essential for the Department to act expediently in order to be able to adequately respond to storm damage that may occur during the current hurricane season. We look forward to your prompt response to the questions above,” the group added.

October 5, 2018
Dear Friend,
Republicans are rushing to confirm a lifetime appointment to our nation's Supreme Court in the wake of both credible allegations of sexual misconduct leveled against the nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and serious questions concerning his judicial temperament. 
I hope you can take a moment to watch and share a speech I gave on the Senate Floor last night urging my colleagues to oppose this nomination.
￼
VIDEO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) speaks out against the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the Supreme Court, October 4, 2018.
I have already made it clear that I oppose Judge Kavanaugh's nomination based on the substance of his views and the broken process being used to rush his nomination through the Senate on a partisan basis. From the very start, Republicans have pushed this nomination through at a breakneck pace, hiding from the public Judge Kavanaugh's record and the dangerous consequences of his extreme views on many important issues. That willful blindness, the absence of a thorough vetting process, and the mad dash to hastily confirm their nominee at all costs before this fall's election has led us to the crisis we face today.
Even beyond what we could learn from a real investigation, there is already reason to doubt Judge Kavanaugh's credibility and his candor. Despite the fact that the White House tried to limit the scope of the FBI's work--so drastically that I wouldn't even characterize it an investigation--the FBI's report still manages to raise very serious questions about Judge Kavanaugh's truthfulness.
Moving forward on this nomination sends a harrowing message to women and girls all around the nation who have been victims of sexual violence. We must not toss aside a fair and impartial process in favor a hurried political endgame. 
The integrity of the highest court in the land--and what we stand for as a nation--hangs in the balance. 
Sincerely,
￼

Dear Friend, 
Last week, the House passed a comprehensive bill I introduced earlier this year, H.R.6378, the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparednessand Advancing Innovation Act of 2018 (PAHPA). PAHPA works to make sure we are prepared to respond to and combat chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats, pandemic diseases such as influenza or Ebola, as well as natural disasters such as the hurricanes that most recently hit the Carolinas. 
This bipartisan effort ensures our health care professionals are trained to respond to possible pandemic outbreaks, prioritizes the further development of our national stockpile of vaccines, medical equipment and diagnostics, and establishes new advisory groups focused on protecting vulnerable populations such as senior citizens and people with disabilities during public health threats and emergencies. 
In last Sunday’s edition of the Indy Star is an op-ed I wrote about the importance of PAHPA and ensuring we are fostering a culture of preparedness in our country. You can read it HERE or below: 
￼  ￼ 
Seventeen years ago, on 9/11, nearly 3,000 Americans lost their lives as a result of three unforgettable terrorist attacks on American soil. But it is commonly overlooked that more than 6,000 other people were injured, many of them first responders. 
Firefighters, police officers and other emergency personnel from across the country traveled to Ground Zero, the Pentagon, and a field near Shanksville, PA., in hopes to save lives, often without the equipment necessary to protect their health. For months on end, they continued working through ash, debris and smoke which devastatingly resulted in exposure to toxic chemicals.    
In 2016, IndyStar reported 26 of the 62 members of Indiana’s Task Force One who deployed to Ground Zero in the aftermath of the attacks were diagnosed with health complications related to such exposure. Two of those heroes died of cancers related to their deployment. While Congress has ensured there is continued funding for the World Trade Center Health Program and the Victim Compensation Fund through the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Reauthorization Act, there is more we can do to ensure first responders have better access to equipment to keep themselves safe while working to save lives. 
As September, National Preparedness Month, comes to a close, we need to focus more on fostering a culture of preparedness for all kinds of threats to our public health and national security. 
That’s why I introduced a reauthorization bill, which overwhelmingly passed out of the House of Representatives this week, known as the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018 (PAHPA). PAHPA ensures our nation is prepared to respond to public health emergencies and modern threats resulting from chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attacks, natural disasters or emerging infectious diseases. I’m proud this strong bipartisan bill incorporates significant input from the full range of public health preparedness and response stakeholders, including many Hoosiers.  
PAHPA strengthens the Strategic National Stockpiles located across the country with a robust supply of vaccines, basic equipment like gloves, masks and more, so first responders have the equipment they need to protect themselves from harm while selflessly working to save lives. 
PAHPA also ensures more health care professionals can be hired and trained through the National Disaster Medical System, which provides grants to our regional health care network. It strengthens federal resources available to organizations like the Indianapolis based MESH Coalition whose mission is to strengthen the collaboration between first responders, hospitals and local health departments to create a culture of preparedness.  
Medical countermeasures — diagnostics, treatments and vaccines for deadly and dangerous diseases such as Ebola or Zika, whether naturally occurring or through weaponized substances — are often difficult, costly and risky to develop by the private sectors. This bill works to streamline the development and approval process of such medical countermeasures. 
After last year’s devastating hurricanes in Florida and Puerto Rico, and the recent flooding in the Carolinas due to Hurricane Florence, we know we need to do better to ensure the well being of our nation’s most vulnerable populations — our children, senior citizens and people with disabilities. PAHPA ensures there is a coordinated health care response to hurricanes for those who can’t help themselves. 
Hoosiers expect the government to step up quickly and work to keep them safe in times of disaster and public health emergency, whether the threats are man-made or naturally occurring. 
Now, it’s up to the Senate to act swiftly to consider and pass this critical legislation because we may not always be able to foresee or prevent disasters, but we can make sure that if the worst should happen, the tragedy isn’t compounded by more disease and death. 

I was honored to be invited to join the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security as a commissioner due to my work on PAHPA. This week, we considered how to best build a ten-year strategy focused on global health security that can more predictably and reliably protect our national interests. Other members of the Commission include public health and national security professionals and Members of Congress, including Senator Todd Young. 
Implementation of PAHPA is critically important to increase our preparedness and response efforts to public health and national security threats, and I hope the Senate swiftly passes this legislation so it can be signed into law by the President.  
Thank you for taking the time to read this newsletter. As always, feel free to be in touch with any questions or comments you may have. 
Sincerely, ￼  Congresswoman Susan W. Brooks

                  AGRICULTURE Update - August/September 2018   
TOP STORY
￼
Meeting with members of the Montana Farmers Union
Trade is important to producers and consumers in Montana and across our country. Tens of millions of Americans are employed at small businesses that engage in trade and it is critical for Montana agriculture as well. For example, roughly 80% of Montana’s wheat is exported. Overall, this is not surprising considering that 95% of the world's population is outside of the United States.
That’s why I applauded President Trump, after extensive renegotiations, for recently reaching an agreement to modernize and improve trade with both Mexico and Canada. This agreement is a positive step and will help provide certainty for our farmers, ranchers, and businesses. Among other things, it will also help level the playing field for Montana grain growers by ending Canada’s unfair grain grading system that discriminated against Montana wheat. Moving forward, I will continue to review the deal and work with the President to ensure Montanans have the right opportunities to succeed
TRADE HIGHLIGHTS  I also applaud the Trump Administration for moving forward with trade talks with Japan. I recently pressed both the Chief Agricultural Negotiator for the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. Department of Agriculture in a Senate Ag hearing to engage Japan and other important markets in the Asia Pacific. Like our North America partners, reducing trade barriers in these countries will greatly benefit Montana farmers and ranchers.  FARM BILL UPDATE AND WHAT'S AHEAD
 
￼
Meeting with Montana Farm Bureau President
Hans McPherson
As you may know, Farm Bill negotiations between the Senate and the House have been ongoing for the past several months. While the Farm Bill did expire, the vast majority of farm programs will be maintained through the crop year. I will continue to work to get a strong Farm Bill to Montana on the President’s desk as quickly as possible.
As new trade deals and promising talks unfold, the Trump Administration has developed an aid package for U.S. farmers and ranchers impacted by retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries. Visit farmers.gov to find more information about the program and whether you’re eligible.

Dear Friend, 
President Trump has made it no secret that he isn’t a fan of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other trade deals he considers unfair to the United States. 
I agree with the President that we need to have fair trade deals that are beneficial to our country. According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the U.S. goods and services trade deficit with Mexico alone was $63.6 billion in 2017. That’s unacceptable. 
At the same time, we can’t just throw out a deal completely. Not only is Mexico the number one destination for Missouri corn exports, it’s reported that the U.S. economy earns more than $127 billion from the revenue generated from NAFTA trade.  
We’ve seen some very positive results from NAFTA and we’ve seen some very harmful side effects especially locally. After 24 years, renegotiation was necessary not only to make sure we had the best deal, but to compete in the 21st century. 
Earlier this week, the White House announced that a new agreement had been reached with Canada and Mexico on a renegotiated NAFTA. A 21st century NAFTA will better serve American farmers, manufacturers and workers.  
Agriculture already saw many benefits under the old agreement. However, with this new agreement, they will see even greater benefits. Canada will no longer be able to undersell U.S. dairy products. Additionally, dairy products, eggs and poultry from the United States will gain new access in the Canadian market. These are all big wins for agriculture.
Another key provision in the new agreement deals with automobiles. Now, more cars and trucks will be made in North America by workers who are being paid a decent wage. There will be less incentive to move auto plants to Mexico. American workers win as a result of the new agreement. 
This improved version of NAFTA has been a long time coming. It’s obvious that our trade agreements have to be in line with the economy as it exists today while working toward improving the American economy of tomorrow. I commend the President and his administration for working tirelessly with Canada and Mexico to come to terms on this deal. It just proves that that, with a little patience, diligence, and hard work, we can change the status quo and bring even greater benefits to our country. It’s critical that Congress works together to approve this deal in the very near future. 

Sincerely,
￼ 
Sam Graves

FBI Kavanaugh Investigation 
After watching his behavior during the historic hearing last week and reading early reports about the FBI investigation which was released this morning, I believe Brett Kavanaugh is unfit to serve as a Supreme Court justice – a judgment affirmed today by lifelong Republican former Supreme Court justice. 
The investigation of Kavanaugh was intended to examine further evidence that could corroborate the accusation of sexual assault made by the survivor, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. The report is over 1,000 pages long and available only to senators as they contemplate whether the man in question is deserving and uniquely qualified to serve a lifetime appointment on the highest court in the nation.
According to my Senate Democratic colleagues, the FBI probe - which lasted only THREE days - appears to be incomplete. FBI agents did not to interview key sources who were willing and ready to testify, such as Dr. Ford herself. Although the White House supposedly instructed them to be meticulously thorough, only nine people were interviewed throughout this probe.
The American people have a right to know the truth -- the entire truth -- about Judge Kavanaugh before he is confirmed to sit on the Supreme Court and make life and death decisions that will affect millions of people for generations to come.
Our Supreme Court justices are supposed to remain level-headed and non-partisan. Vulnerable populations in Philadelphia and across our great country cannot afford to have a Supreme Court justice who makes partisan statements such as “What goes around comes around!” towards Senate Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and even asking a senator if they have a drinking problem when asked tough questions about his experiences with alcohol. 
I will say it again, and emphatically: Brett Kavanaugh is UNFIT to serve on the Supreme Court.

Island Time 
           ￼ 
Dear Friends,  
Most people know Block Island as a vacation destination. Travelers flock to the island in droves during the summer months to enjoy the sandy beaches, boutique-lined streets, and pristine nature trails. However, for just over 1,000 Rhode Islanders, Block Island is something much more than a seaside retreat – it is their home.  
I am fortunate to represent the residents of this beautiful community, and I always enjoy the time I spend there. This past September, I traveled to New Shoreham to meet with my constituents across the island.  
My first stop off the ferry was a visit to the Block Island School where Principal Kristine Monje assembled the student council. We had a fascinating discussion covering a range of topics, and I was very impressed with the students’ insightful questions. Before leaving the school, I had the pleasure of meeting with Mason Miro, an inspiring 4th grade student who is a Special Ambassador for the Muscular Dystrophy Association.  
The remainder of the day included multiple stops around town. I visited the Block Island Power Company to discuss the impact of transitioning service from diesel generators to renewable energy provided by the Block Island Wind Farm. I also took the opportunity to visit the only manufacturer on the island, North Light Fibers, and to stop by the Block Island Medical Center to meet with their staff. Lastly, I had the honor of presenting a Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition commemorating the 150th anniversary of Block Island’s North Light  
Overall, the trip was very productive. Meeting constituents in person through visits to their communities is essential to my work in Congress – even when it takes a ferry ride to get there!  
For more information on my visits around the Second District, and for updates on many other topics, please visit my website and follow me on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.  
            Sincerely,  
           ￼

Protecting Air Travelers with Disabilities 
Several components of the Air Carrier Access Amendments Act I introduced with Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) were included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act that just passed Congress. These provisions include a bill of rights for passengers with disabilities, a disabilities advisory committee, and a review of regulations regarding the assistance that airline and airport personnel must provide to passengers with disabilities

Fighting Suicide in Washington County 
Suicide is a complex public health concern, but it is important to realize that there are proven policy solutions, like suicide prevention hotlines, that can help people struggling with suicidal thinking. Senator Jack Reed, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and I recently announced $2 million in federal funding for South County Healthy Bodies, Healthy Minds’ Zero Suicide in Washington County program to help reinforce successful intervention strategies that save lives. Remember, help is only a phone call away – you can reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.

10/4/18 16:36,Trump’s Taxes & Self-Made Myth: My MSNBC Interview Clip,"￼



 October 4, 2018   
  



10849 E. Walking Stick Way 


San Antonio, Texas 78205- 
  
  
Dear Lindsey,   
Last night, I joined MSBNC to discuss the major investigation by the New York Times into Trump’s taxes, showing that the Trump family has had little regard for our tax laws. I also shared my plan to ensure Congress examines his tax returns. I welcome your advice on this and other federal issues. You can watch the brief interview here: 
￼ 
Donald Trump is a self-made myth, not a self-made man. In January, if the American people have supported a new Congress that will engage in oversight, not just overlook, then we do not even need a subpoena to examine his tax returns. As the Ranking Member of the Tax Policy Subcommittee on Ways and Means Committee, I have put forward seven motions to release the tax returns, all of which have been blocked by Republicans. But I will not relent until Congress performs its oversight duty—over an out-of-control President. Trump has some 564 business entities that he receives income from, in addition to his personal returns. When I have put forward my seven motions, one as recently as last month, the Republicans have covered up and blocked every one. They do not want to look under that rock and see what they might see. 
We need to look at exactly how much Trump may have enriched by this Republican tax bill that he promoted—with a special interest provision added at the last moment that benefits families just like his. And we certainly need to explore the Russian connection. There was a time when Don Jr. said the Russians were among their top investors; let’s look at those Trump entities that stretch from Manhattan to Azerbaijan and see what’s in there and who’s been involved. 

Especially in these difficult times, I welcome your good counsel. I also hope that you will take this opportunity to visit my Facebook page, follow me on Twitter, follow me on Instagram, or send me an e-mail at Lloyd.Doggett@mail.house.gov. 
Sincerely, 
￼         Lloyd Doggett

￼ 
On July 17th, I stood with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and fellow Democratic women in Congress, to stop the confirmation of United States Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh due to major concerns about his potential impact on women’s rights and other vital rights and liberties.  
￼ 
Also on July 17th, the Committee on Small Business Subcommittee on Investigations, Oversight, and Regulations and the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations met for a hearing titled, “Achieving Government-Wide Verification of Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.” During this hearing, we heard from experts and leaders on how to expand opportunities for disabled veterans to be successful small business owners.

The organization is working to close the gender employment gap in technology and change the image of what a programmer looks like.
￼
I closed out this busy day with a guest lecture at the Davidson College Washington Program. I shared my story of political activism and what it means to live the “American Dream” with this brilliant class of Davidson students.  
￼ 
On July 25th, The House Committee on Education and the Workforce hosted a bipartisan Innovation Showcase to highlight 25 innovators who are running education and workforce development programs in their communities. I was proud to be joined by Danielle Frazier from Charlotte Works. Charlotte Works is a workforce development board that provides opportunities that prepare people for education and available careers, while connecting businesses to skilled workers.
￼ 
August
￼ 
There is a national shortage of professional truck driverrs. On August 1st, I visited Trans/Tech Inc., a local driving school that trains individuals to be professional truck drivers. I enjoyed touring the facility, meeting with the instructors and students, and getting behind the wheel of a “Big Rig”.  
￼ 
My staff and I visited a local Home Depot in Pineville. Within the 12th District, there are seven Home Depot stores that employ nearly one thousand associates.

National Night Out was on August 7th. I visited events throughout Charlotte to support stronger police and community relationships that make our neighborhoods safer for all.

Key Letters 
Letter to State Department supporting TPS re-designation for Somalia: This letter, sent July 13th, expressed concern over the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) consideration of allowing Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Somalia to expire.

After this letter, DHS announced that TPS for Somalia would remain until March 17, 2020.
Letter to Brazil's ambassador to the U.S. in support of human rights and democracy in Brazil:  Sent on July 24th, this letter formally condemns the crackdown on democracy and human rights in Brazil.

Letter to the Department of Education asking for information on proposed implementation of direct debit card plan for student loan disbursement: This letter was sent on July 30th to seek clarification and information regarding the Dept. of Ed’s proposed Payment Card Program Pilot.

Letter to the President expressing profound concern about the administration’s recent actions relating to a resolution on breastfeeding at the World Health Organization: This letter expressed concern regarding the Trump Administration’s attempt to water down a World Health Organization (WHO) resolution that recognized breastfeeding as resulting in improved infant and maternal health outcomes.

Key Letters
Comment Letter to Dept. of Ed. voicing opposition to proposed Borrower Defense rules: This letter was sent on August 30th to express concerns with the Department’s revised Borrower’s Defense rules. The letter takes issue with the new rule’s heightened standard for loan discharge, shortened time frame for filing an application, and forced arbitration provisions, among others.
Letter to DOL raising concerns regarding the weakening of hazardous work protections for minors in nonagricultural occupations: Sent on August 1st, this letter asked for clarification on the Department of Labor’s proposal to weakening workforce protections for 16- and 17-year-olds. Additionally, the letter asks whether this determination was based on expert review of data and scientific literature regarding workplace hazards for young workers.
Letter to State Department supporting TPS re-designation for El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti: This letter was sent on August 2nd to express concerns over the State Department’s decision to recommend the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for the countries of El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti. TPS allows immigrants from countries that are experiencing ongoing armed conflict or environmental disasters to remain in the U.S. temporarily. All three of these countries are scheduled to have their TPS expire in the second half of 2019.  
Letter to the USPTO requesting the collection of demographic data on patent applicants: This letter, sent on August 6th, helps illuminate the fact that women, racial minorities, and low-income individuals are significantly underrepresented amongst patent owners.

Hello,
I'm in Walla Walla today, and just participated the National Hydropower Association Conference. Leaders from across the country are here to see how our region's hydropower and river systems are supporting jobs and clean, reliable energy. As your voice in Eastern Washington, I wanted to make sure you also received this critical update that I shared with them this morning.
Hydropower helped build the Northwest and provides the region with clean, renewable, reliable, and affordable energy. Energy that powers our homes, businesses, and our communities. Thanks to my provisions I fought for, the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA):
	•	Protects upgrades to our non-federal dams. 
	•	Allows early action dam investments to be made outside of the relicensing window. 
	•	Permits new technology to be installed as it becomes available to increase power generation or fish passage or BOTH.  
	•	Authorizes a land transfer between the Port of Whitman and the Army Corps of Engineers.
>> CLICK HERE to learn more about how my provisions are encouraging investment in hydropower and supporting cleaner energy in Eastern Washington.
 River systems are the lifeblood of our economy here in Eastern Washington, which is why I'm determined to protect the Columbia and Snake River dams. This Congress I passed bipartisan legislation through the House that would provide reliability and certainty in the region. My bill will:
	•	Allow scientists in our region to continue to build consensus, manage our river system, and further improve fish recovery efforts. 
	•	Allow our dams to properly function without further endangering our salmon population. 
	•	Halt the increase in court-mandated spillover of the dams. 
>> CLICK HERE to learn more about how I am fighting to protect the Columbia and Snake River dams.
 Waterways are critical in ensuring that agriculture remains Eastern Washington's number one industry. I was proud to see WRDA pass the House which authorizes critical funding to support our locks, dams, and river system, which is the superhighway for our wheat, potatoes, and other agriculture products. In addition, I secured nearly $2 million in funding to support the Columbia Basin Project, which will:
	•	Develop a pumping plant and pipeline delivery system for the Odessa Ground Water Replacement Program. 
	•	Ensure Columbia Basin irrigation districts can provide water to grow our crops and fuel our economy. 
Our economy is booming right now. Consumer confidence is at a near 17-year high. Wage growth also just hit a 17-month high. The unemployment rate in Washington's 5th District is one of the lowest figures ever recorded. This is the economic comeback Republicans said was possible with lower taxes and smarter regulations. As a result, Americans are Better Off Now. For jobs in our community, I'm working to make sure hydropower and our river systems continue to be a part of this story. 
Thanks, ￼ Cathy McMorris Rodgers Member of Congress

Comstock Statement On Federal Employee Pay Raise
Washington, D.C. - Congresswoman Barbara Comstock (R-VA) released the following statement on the proposed federal employee pay raise, for which she fought: 
“I am pleased that an agreement has been reached to provide our federal employees with the raises they have earned and deserve.  This is an important complement to our providing the largest pay raise to our military in almost a decade and it  is a strong sign of our respect and support for the essential work done by our federal employees.   I appreciate the support of Chairman Frelinghuysen and Chairman Graves in working with us to achieve this important priority,” said Congresswoman Barbara Comstock (R-VA).  “With our strong, booming economy, it is essential that we keep our federal salaries competitive so we attract the talent in the civilian workforce that is needed for our national security, homeland security, law enforcement, and medical research jobs and more.  The pay freezes that occurred for 3 years during the Obama Administration hurt our federal employees and we will continue fighting for competitive compensation and work with the coalition of Members throughout the country who represent our federal employees – 5 out of 6 of whom live outside the Washington Metropolitan area.” 
“NARFE appreciates the Congresswoman’s hard work and dedication to advance a modest pay raise for federal employees in 2019. While her efforts were supported by a bipartisan group of members of Congress, Representative Comstock’s leadership on this issue should be commended. A modest increase in pay not only acknowledges America’s hardworking, middle-class federal employees, but also serves as an investment that will help maintain and strengthen the federal workforce and align it more competitively with the private sector,” commented NARFE National President Richard G. Thissen. 
Timeline Of Events  August 30th- Administration announces a proposed pay freeze for civilian federal employees in 2019. 
August 30th-  I contacted White House immediately to let them know of my strong opposition and relayed my concerns about how this negatively impacted our quality federal workforce.  I was the first Member of Congress in the local delegation to oppose this proposed pay freeze.  I spoke with the Appropriations committee and House leadership to have the House agree to the Senate increase in pay if the White House does not reverse their decision. 
August 31st- The President said he’ll reportedly reconsider this decision.  
September 7th- I joined with a bipartisan coalition of my colleagues in asking the President to reiterate on behalf of our collective constituencies “to reconsider canceling the federal civilian employee pay raise”

Dear  ,   Thank you for signing up to receive my email newsletter. These newsletters will cover a variety of topics, including events happening in northeast Indiana, legislation being considered in Congress, and my perspective on current issues. My hope is to keep you updated and informed on how issues in Washington may impact our region. I welcome your feedback.

USS Indiana Joins U.S. Navy Fleet
￼ 
It was an incredible honor to deliver the principal speech at the U.S. Navy’s commissioning of the USS Indiana in Port Canaveral, Florida on Saturday. This Virginia-class boat is the best attack submarine in the world. Godspeed to the men and women who will sail her throughout the world’s oceans, protecting our country from those who wish us harm.

Making Tax Cuts for Families and Small Businesses Permanent
￼ 
Last week, I voted in support of the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act. This legislation is one of three bills the House passed that comprise a Tax Reform 2.0 plan.  
When I travel across northeast Indiana, I constantly hear about the positive results from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Because of tax reform, Hoosiers are seeing more opportunities and taking home larger paychecks. These three pieces of legislation contain key provisions to make many of the tax cuts that help families and small businesses permanent.
With the tax cuts for individuals currently set to expire in 2025, I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to quickly consider these important pieces of legislation. Click here for more information.
Combating the Opioid Crisis
￼ 
I recently voted for bipartisan legislation to combat the opioid crisis and save lives. This comprehensive bill will advance treatment and recovery, improve prevention, protect our communities, and bolster efforts to fight deadly fentanyl. 
Defense Security Cooperation Agency
￼ 
On Friday, I led a bipartisan Congressional delegation to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency to learn more about our Foreign Military Sales program, which provides vital support to our allies around the world.

It is always great to spend time meeting with Hoosiers from northeast Indiana who are visiting Washington. Hearing directly from you helps me better represent our region in Congress. Here are some recent highlights:

10/4/18 15:40,A serious matter:,"￼ 
Lindsey – I hope you’ll join me this October in bringing attention to a serious issue that impacts millions of Americans every year. 

This month is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, a recognition that started more than 30 years ago to shine light on the far too widespread problem of both the visible and invisible violence women, men, and children experience. 

• Nearly 1 in 4 women (and 1 in 7 men) experience severe physical violence from an intimate partner in their lifetime. 

• About 1 in 6 women experience sexual violence from an intimate partner. 

• For many, violence begins as early as high school or younger, and can continue throughout life.1

As a doctor, I’ve seen the physical and emotional trauma of domestic violence firsthand. We need to make sure that all survivors get the help they need to rebuild their lives.

If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 or visit them online at www.thehotline.org.

￼

The National Domestic Violence Hotline was created after the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994. Since then, the hotline has helped more than 4 million people access the help they need. 

One of my first, and proudest, moments as your Congressman was voting to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. This reauthorization updated the law for modern needs and expanded its scope to protect more women than ever before. It gives medical professionals and police resources to prevent violence and go after abusers, improves evidence tracking, and helps victims access emergency housing.

But now, the time has come for Congress to do its job once again. Congress must pass another reauthorization to keep these programs going and make improvements.

No woman or family should live in the shadow of fear or abuse. This cannot be about politics – it’s about saving lives and standing with survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.

Together we can break the cycle of violence.

Please feel free to contact me to share your thoughts and concerns.

Be well,
￼
Ami Bera, M.D.
Member of Congress

P.S. Your thoughtful suggestions always help my office do a better job of serving you.

News from Congresswoman Rosen
￼
Dear Friend, 
This past week, I joined our community in Las Vegas honoring the memories of the 58 innocent lives that we tragically lost on 1 October and paid my respects.  I also visited with health professionals in Henderson about my efforts to protect Nevadas’ access to quality, affordable health care.
HONORING THE MEMORIES OF THOSE WE LOST ONE YEAR AGO ON 1 OCTOBER 
￼
￼
Last Friday, I spoke on the House floor in honor of the 58 innocent lives that were taken from us on 1 October. I’m forever grateful to our first responders, medical professionals, hotel security and staff, and to the kindness of strangers who helped the wounded to the hospital and stood in line for hours to donate blood.
￼ 
I also spent time in Las Vegas paying my respects to the 1 October victims and heroes who risked their lives for others.
As we continue to heal, what we have always known about our community remains true: we are Vegas Strong. We are resilient, and even in our darkest hour, we came together stronger than ever. 
Read my full House floor speech here. 
WORKING TO INCREASE CONSUMERS PROTECTIONS AND LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
This week, the House has passed two bipartisan bills I co-sponsored to increase consumer protections so that Nevadans can better afford their prescription drugs. The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act (S. 2554) would guarantee that health insurance issuers and group health plans do not prohibit pharmacy providers from providing certain information to enrollees. The Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018 (S. 2553) would ban gag clauses that prohibit pharmacies from disclosing to consumers that they can, in certain cases, save money by paying out-of-pocket rather than with Medicare or Medicare Advantage. I am a proud co-sponsor of identical companion legislation to these two Senate bills, which passed the House last week. These bills will now go to the President to be signed into law.
No Nevadan should have to worry about affording prescription medications or going back to a time when insurance companies could charge you more based on a pre-existing medical condition. My visit with patients and health care workers at Touro underscored again how important this fight for quality, affordable health care is for hardworking Nevada families. I’m hopeful that these bipartisan bills will be small solutions that increase transparency and enable Nevadans to better afford their life-saving medications. I’ll continue to support efforts to reduce the cost of medications and work to pass my bill to cap prescription drug costs. 
￼
You can read more about these bipartisan prescription drug bills here and read about my visit to Touro Health Center here. 
I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU 
As always, I want to hear from you. Call my office; find me on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram; or email me. Sign up for my e-newsletter here to receive regular updates on my legislative work. 
It’s an absolute honor to represent you in Congress.

September is always a busy time of year – harvest is in full swing, the school year is off and running, football season begins, and fall is in the air! 
I had a busy month in DC too, so I wanted to share just a few highlights.
1. Honoring Veterans – 50+ of South Dakota’s bravest traveled to Washington with the Honor Flight program. It’s so important we show gratitude to our veterans – in doing so we inspire the next generation to serve by showing them sacrifice doesn’t go unnoticed.
￼ 
2. Locking in the New Tax Code – Tax Reform 2.0 PASSED the House! The tax cuts we passed last year have made a big difference for many South Dakotans, but we’re not stopping there. This package locks in family savings, incentivizes innovation, and gives you more opportunities to save. Learn more HERE or by clicking the video below.  
￼
3. Impacting Education – Impact Aid helps ensure we maintain a level playing field for all SD school districts. It’s been my privilege to work with these folks over the years, so being named a friend of their association meant the world to me. Curious about Impact Aid? Check this out. 
￼ 
4. Announcing Angels in Adoption – It was an honor to name Danny and Amanda Oaks of Rapid City as Angels in Adoption. Their story is such an inspiration on how to make a difference right in your community. Read about their journey here.  
￼ 
5. Pushing for Year-Round E15 – It’s long past time the government allows year-round E15, and I pushed the EPA to approve it. By expanding ethanol, we have a big opportunity to help farmers and our ag economy, save consumers money, and reduce our reliance on foreign oil. Thank you to the folks at Growth Energy for recognizing my work to expand ethanol markets.  
￼ 
6. Celebrating Women in Business - Over 80 percent of South Dakota women are in the workforce, so American Business Women’s Day is a big reason to celebrate! Click HERE to read more about my work to improve the lives of women in the marketplace. 
￼ 
7. And finally… We celebrated National Daughter Day! My kids are rockstars, so they make days like this easy to celebrate. Enjoy this throwback picture! 
￼ 
Have a great day!

Thune-Led Federal Aviation Administration Bill Includes Multiple Wins for South Dakota
 
￼
Click here or on the image above to watch the video.
 
Sen. Thune, chairman of Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which has jurisdiction over the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), this week praised the bipartisan passage of the five-year FAA reauthorization bill. This Thune-led legislation, the longest reauthorization since the 1980s, would reauthorize federal aviation programs to modernize airport infrastructure, improve service for the flying public, enhance safety, and boost aviation industry innovation. The bill was approved by a vote of 93-6 and now heads to the president for his signature.
 
“In creating new protections and enhancements for the flying public, this bill creates five years of stable policy direction for the aviation community,” said Thune. “Travelers, utilizing small and large airports, will benefit from investments in infrastructure, more efficient security screening, and the prompt return of fees for services they don’t receive. Innovators also get a needed boost from provisions enhancing the competitiveness of our aircraft manufacturers and the continued integration of unmanned aircraft into our airspace.”

Congresswoman Beatty Recognizes the Importance of Breast Cancer Awareness Month
October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, a month-long initiative aimed at increasing awareness around breast cancer prevention, detection, and treatment. As a strong supporter of women’s health and member of the Democratic Women’s Working Group, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) issued the following statement:
“Did you know an astounding one in eight American women will develop breast cancer over the course of their lifetime? It is important to know that detecting and treating breast cancer early on can be done by taking immediate action, including getting regular mammograms if you are over 50-years old, talking with your doctor, and conducting self-examinations. Ultimately, however, the universal goal is to find a cure and prevent breast cancer altogether. To that end, I am fighting hard in Congress to increase funding for federal agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute—as well as non-governmental organizations committed to finding a cure.”
￼

Congresswoman Beatty encourages Central Ohio to #GoPink during National Breast Cancer Awareness Month (October 3, 2018).
During National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, please visit Congresswoman Beatty’s Facebook and Twitter for useful information, facts, and resources. Be sure to join the conversation online, and share your own story, by using: #BreastCancerAwarenessMonth, #BCAM, #BCAM2018, and #FindTheCure.  For more information on National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, please visit the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s website.

10/4/18 11:26,Agriculture update - New trade deals!,"

If you are having trouble viewing this message or would like to share it on a social network, you can view the message online.￼

                  AGRICULTURE Update - August/September 2018   TOP STORY  Trade is important to producers and consumers in Montana and across our country. Tens of millions of Americans are employed at small businesses that engage in trade and it is critical for Montana agriculture as well. For example, roughly 80% of Montana’s wheat is exported. Overall, this is not surprising considering that 95% of the world's population is outside of the United States.  That’s why I applauded President Trump, after extensive renegotiations, for recently reaching an agreement to modernize and improve trade with both Mexico and Canada. This agreement is a positive step and will help provide certainty for our farmers, ranchers, and businesses. Among other things, it will also help level the playing field for Montana grain growers by ending Canada’s unfair grain grading system that discriminated against Montana wheat. Moving forward, I will continue to review the deal and work with the President to ensure Montanans have the right opportunities to succeed.  TRADE HIGHLIGHTS  I also applaud the Trump Administration for moving forward with trade talks with Japan. I recently pressed both the Chief Agricultural Negotiator for the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. Department of Agriculture in a Senate Ag hearing to engage Japan and other important markets in the Asia Pacific. Like our North America partners, reducing trade barriers in these countries will greatly benefit Montana farmers and ranchers.  FARM BILL UPDATE AND WHAT'S AHEAD
￼
Meeting with Montana Farm Bureau President
Hans McPherson
As you may know, Farm Bill negotiations between the Senate and the House have been ongoing for the past several months. While the Farm Bill did expire, the vast majority of farm programs will be maintained through the crop year. I will continue to work to get a strong Farm Bill to Montana on the President’s desk as quickly as possible.
As new trade deals and promising talks unfold, the Trump Administration has developed an aid package for U.S. farmers and ranchers impacted by retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries. Visit farmers.gov to find more information about the program and whether you’re eligible.

A Note from Jeff on Brett Kavanaugh’s Confirmation Process 
I feel strongly and passionately that Judge Kavanaugh is the wrong person for this job, and understand that others feel strongly the other way. But everyone should be unified that sexual assault is intolerable, and that survivors should be respected and treated with dignity. I have heard from so many women over the last two weeks whose wounds have been reopened by these events and the hearing. I hope all of us, regardless of politics, can work to give care and support to those who have been traumatized and to work towards a society where sexual violence is far less common than it is today.  

Protecting Our Communities from Wildfire and Smoke 
In August, Jeff drove around Southern Oregon under a neon pink sphere glowing through a gray film. The mountain ranges were invisible. The air was barely breathable.   Smoke from massive wildfires had transformed Southern Oregon’s big, blue skies and fresh country air into a heavy, toxic fog.   This cannot become the new normal. That’s why Jeff has used his seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee to address short-term fixes—like training and deploying Oregon National Guard members to fight fires—and long-term fixes—like ending fire borrowing and funding successful forest management programs.   But we can’t stop there. So Jeff introduced the Wildfire-Resilient Communities Act—bold new legislation to substantially reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires, while also creating jobs and opportunities in timber communities.   Jeff knows how desperate Oregonians are to find a real solution to the longer, more intense wildfire season. He will use every tool available to him to help address this urgent issue. 

New Legislation to Put Mental Health Counselors in Every K-12 Public School in America 
Marking National Suicide Prevention Week, Jeff announced the introduction of the Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Act, new bicameral legislation to put school-based mental health services providers in every elementary and secondary school in America. Mental health care is essential health care. But right now in our schools, we’re treating it like an optional afterthought. That’s unacceptable, and it puts our students’ lives and academic futures at risk.   Currently the national average student-to-counselor ratio is nearly twice the recommendation. The Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Act would tackle this crisis head-on by finally providing the necessary resources for schools to provide the mental health counselors their students need and rely on—making a big difference to our students, in Oregon and across the nation. 

New Legislation to Extend Electric Vehicle Tax Credit for 10 Years 
It’s crazy that we might allow the electric vehicle tax credit to run out just as the American EV market is starting to gain a foothold. Every day, we see the effects of climate chaos all around us—record-setting droughts, out-of-control wildfires, destructive mega-storms, and spreading insects and ocean acidification. Market-based incentives that help EVs compete with gas-powered cars are not only good for our economy, they’re essential to our future.   Currently, a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 is available for the purchase of electric vehicles. However, federal statute caps the number of vehicles eligible for the tax credit at 200,000 for each manufacturer. With many American manufacturers expected to hit this cap as early as this year, federal action is needed to ensure that American EV makers stay competitive and we don’t smother this critical technology in the cradle, as fossil fuel giants want to do. Jeff and Senators Martin Heinrich and Catherine Cortez Masto are tackling this problem with the introduction of the Electric Cars Act of 2018, legislation to extend the electric vehicle tax credit for 10 years and lift the manufacturer cap.   The Electric Cars Act stands up for our American manufacturers and invests in the clean energy future we need.

The Huizenga Huddle: October 4, 2018
Tax Reform 2.0  Last week, the House passed and I strongly supported the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act. This legislation, also known as Tax Reform 2.0, made tax cuts permanent for middle class families and hardworking small business entrepreneurs across West Michigan. 
￼
An independent analysis by the Tax Foundation found that this tax reform package will create an additional 1.5 million jobs, increase GDP by 2.2% and boost wage growth. By making these important tax cuts permanent, we can chart a course of economic prosperity that lowers taxes and promotes small business growth and job creation in communities across West Michigan for generations to come.  How Tax Reform 2.0 Impacts West Michigan 
In addition to permanently doubling the child tax credit and lowering tax rates for middle class families, this legislation builds on the preservation of the adoption tax credit by creating a new opportunity to help pay for the costs associated with welcoming a child into a home. It also expands education savings opportunities for families across West Michigan while also creating a new flex account to meet their individual needs.

￼

Here are three examples of how West Michigan families will benefit from Tax Reform 2.o:

USA accounts. Creating a new Universal Savings Account (USA) to offer a fully
flexible savings tool that families can use any time that’s right for them.

Expanded 529 Education accounts. Building upon the improvements to education
savings accounts in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by providing families with the
flexibility to also use their education savings to pay for apprenticeship fees to learn a
trade, cover the cost of home schooling, and help pay off student debt.

New Baby savings. Allowing families to access their own retirement accounts on a
penalty-free basis to use as they see fit when welcoming a new child into the family,
whether by birth or adoption. Families also have the ability to replenish these retirement
accounts in the future.


Ripped From The Headlines: Tax Reform Is Delivering 

Since passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act last December, our economy is growing at an impressive pace, wages are rising, and good-paying jobs are being created.  Here is a quick look at some of the headlines from across the nation talking about the economy. 

	•	CNBC: Small business optimism surges, topping previous record under Reagan
	•	Marketwatch: American manufacturers growing at fastest pace in 14 years, ISM finds
	•	Fox Business: US workers see biggest pay, benefit increase in 10 years
	•	Wall Street Journal: U.S. jobless claims fall to 49-year low for third straight week
	•	Bloomberg: U.S. Consumer Confidence Unexpectedly Jumps to 18-Year High
The Great Lakes 

There has been big news on the Great Lakes over the last few weeks. A new report published by the Great Lakes Commission found that on average, for every dollar invested by the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) $3.35 of economic activity will be generated. This is major news. 

￼

I have successfully led multiple bipartisan efforts to fully fund the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. We have seen the positive impact this program has had on Muskegon, Holland, and communities across West Michigan. A healthy Great Lakes ecosystem generates more tourism, more economic opportunity, and more Made in Michigan memories. This latest study was evaluated by economists at the University of Michigan and provides critical evidence that restoring the ecological health of the Great Lakes and preventing invasive species from entering the lakes will strengthen our economy and help future generations enjoy these incredible resources. 

￼

In August, I was honored to be recognized by The Nature Conservancy in Michigan for my bipartisan efforts to protect the Great Lakes, fully fund the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI), and combat the spread of invasive species. Thank you to the Nature Conservancy for being an active part of the effort to preserve the Great Lakes and stop Asian carp!

￼

On September 17th, I visited the Outdoor Discovery Center to see the impact of the GLRI first-hand. This particular project is helping restore wetlands, reduce flooding, and stop harmful runoff from flowing into rivers, Lake Macatawa, and even Lake Michigan.

￼

There was also major news in Washington regarding Great Lakes infrastructure. When I began the bipartisan effort to restore the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, only 47% of the funding designated for harbor maintenance was actually used for that purpose. Under the bipartisan action signed into law in September, 92% of the funds collected in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund will actually be used for dredging and harbor maintenance. 

Specifically, this year’s appropriation includes maintenance funding for Grand Haven Harbor, Holland Harbor, and Ludington Harbor. Having our harbors along the Great Lakes properly dredged is vital to economic growth and job creation in West Michigan. With the enactment of this legislation, we take a very positive step toward fully funding this objective. 

Honoring Those Who Have Served

Our veterans put their lives on the line for this nation and we have a responsibility to make sure they have the best care available. On September 13th, I proudly supported bipartisan legislation that strengthens oversight and accountability at the VA while prioritizing resources for the MISSION Act, mental health care services, suicide prevention, opioid abuse prevention, and rural health care. 

￼

Additionally, this much needed legislation also provides additional resources and reforms to help eliminate the claims processing backlog and improve results for veterans in West Michigan and across the nation.  While there is much more work to be done to improve the VA and the care our veterans receive, this legislation was another step in the right direction.

￼

In August, I had the honor of presenting Keith Cole and Al Johnson each with a Congressional Gold Medal for their service to the nation as members of the Office of Strategic Service (OSS). The OSS was established during World War II and is considered the foundation of modern day intelligence operations.  

Hearing both Keith and Al share their stories seemed more like something out of a Jack Ryan novel, or perhaps a video game, or television show than what you might expect from two veterans from Hudsonville. Both Keith and Al are unsung heroes who served our country with distinction. 

Since the ceremony in August took place, I recently learned that Mr. Cole, picture above in the hat, passed away. My heart goes out to Keith's family whom I had gotten to know over these past few months. Keith was a wonderful person, who served his country with distinction. Every day we lose more of the men and women who answered the call and sacrificed so we could be free. If you see a veteran, be sure to say thank you. 

Across West Michigan

￼

At the end of August, Lake County was hit by severe storms that included two confirmed tornadoes touching down. On September 1st, I traveled to Baldwin to see the damage first-hand, get an update from emergency personnel and speak with residents. Thank you to the first responders, volunteers, and members of the surrounding communities for helping our neighbors through this difficult time. We are so thankful that there were no lives lost from the storm. 

￼

About mid-September, I had the opportunity to visit Ottawa Area Intermediate School District’s Career Line Tech Center to discuss and observe the hands-on learning and training students receive. Whether students are learning a trade or a vocational skill, the Career Tech Center provides greater flexibility and a unique opportunity for students to be job-ready coming right out of high school or shortly there after. It was a great day speaking with instructors and students!

￼

Last month I also toured Quality Tool and Stamping in Muskegon Heights. It's wonderful to see investment, job creation, and manufacturing come back strong across Muskegon County. The highly skilled manufacturing that is done at Quality Tool and Stamping was impressive.  

￼

On September 18th, I joined a packed house at the Wyoming Kentwood Chamber for a legislative update on improving and funding the VA, rebuilding infrastructure across the Great Lakes, and reforming Dodd-Frank in a bipartisan manner. Additionally, I discussed how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is delivering positive results for small businesses, middle class families, and hardworking individuals across West Michigan.

￼
On September 20th, joined members of the Ottawa County Farm Bureau in Allendale to discuss the Farm Bill, immigration, Great Lakes infrastructure, and the economy. During the event I was honored to receive the “Friend of Farm Bureau” award for my record of supporting policies that empower West Michigan farmers.
￼
On Saturday, I joined community leaders in Holland to celebrate the reopening of the Civic Center. This iconic building means so much to the community and with these upgrades,  a new generation of West Michigan residents will be able to enjoy all that it has to offer!   The Michigan Minute

Opioid Legislation Passes Senate With Comstock Provisions
Washington, D.C. - Congresswoman Barbara Comstock (R-VA) released the following statement after H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, legislation to address our nation’s heroin and opioid crisis, passed the Senate. 
“Today Congress has taken a bipartisan, commonsense step in addressing our nation’s heroin and opioid crisis by overwhelmingly passing H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. This legislation will make a tangible and immediate difference in the lives of those battling addiction, the families supporting loved ones struggling with substance use disorder, and healthcare treatment providers helping the sick get well. I am pleased that Congress has finally recognized that the deadly epidemic of opioid addiction requires a multipronged approach drawing on the resources of our entire community, including the need to develop non-addictive treatment alternatives.  
“I am pleased that provisions of my bill to facilitate better clinical data and standards on non-opioid alternatives, H.R. 5473, the Better Pain Management Through Better Data Act, were included in the final legislation.  Medical use of opioids should be a decision that is made with care and these provisions will better inform the choices made by patients and physicians who need accessible data when considering treatments. Addiction is a disease.  As our friend and recovery advocate, Nick Yacoub says, this is about sick people getting well.   With more prescribing options and fewer prescribed opioids, we can lower the risk of addiction. I’m pleased that the President will be signing this legislation into law, ensuring help for our communities battling this crisis.”

Tester's Bill to Protect Yellowstone's Doorstep Clears Senate Committee
Senator's bill will preserve Yellowstone gateway and Paradise Valley's outdoor recreation economy
￼
 
(U.S. Senate) - U.S. Senator Jon Tester's bill to permanently protect Montana's iconic Paradise Valley from hardrock gold mining cleared a major hurdle Tuesday.  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee passed Tester's Yellowstone Gateway Protection Act permanently withdrawing mineral rights on 30,000 acres of federal public land north of Yellowstone National Park. The bill passed on a unanimous vote.   ""Some places are more precious than gold,"" said Tester, the only Senator in the delegation to sponsor the bill. ""My bill will ensure outdoor recreation businesses can continue to thrive in the region, and will protect one of our nation's greatest treasures for generations to come.""  The Yellowstone Gateway Protection Act preserves land on the Custer Gallatin National Forest adjacent to the Absaroka Beartooth Wilderness, and eliminates the ability for proposed mines to expand onto unclaimed public land.   Tester's bill is supported by dozens of groups and businesses in the Yellowstone region that rely on the area for their business. Yellowstone National Park visitors spent an average of $196 million in Park County in 2014 that helped create and sustain nearly 3,000 jobs.  Tester testified before the committee on behalf of his bill last July, and has been fighting to protect the Yellowstone Gateway for the past three years.  Last week, the House Natural Resources Committee passed companion legislation on a 28-4 vote.

10/3/18 20:04,a note on bipartisanship,"￼
These days, I know things in Washington often seem like one big partisan fight with both sides more and more dug in to their trenches. But in my time in the Senate, I've seen one thing to be true time and time again: good things happen when we put our differences aside and work together. 




I've seen the D.C. dysfunction you might've heard of firsthand -- but I've never been one to succumb to the chaos.   That's not why I'm here -- I'm here in Washington to get down to business, solve tough problems, and make sure Missourians are heard. 
I know the harder job than pointing fingers is reaching across the aisle, putting aside our differences, and finding what we can agree on. And I know *that* is how we get things done.  From pushing for healthcare transparency to stopping surprise medical bills to funding opioid initiatives in our state, bipartisanship and common sense keep the legislative wheels turning. So I'm proud to often find myself squarely in the middle of things, working with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who feel the same way.
I know that at the end of the day, what matters most is this: saving Missourians money on their prescriptions, preventing fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars, and creating a healthcare system that works for everyone. And when both parties come together and do the hard work of compromise, these are things we can achieve. 
If you know me, you know I don't hesitate to fight if it means delivering results for the folks in our state. I know that's why I'm here -- to represent Missourians. Fighting unfair practices and making healthcare affordable shouldn't be partisan issues, and I'll continue to make sure that's the case. And I'll be right where I've always been, smack dab in the middle -- where we get real results for Missouri.

 September in Photos 
Fall is here, and that means our fields are just about ready for harvest. While my colleagues and I spent much of September negotiating the 2018 Farm Bill, we passed legislation to grow our economy, care for our veterans, and fulfill our commitment to rebuild our military. 
Here are five photos that show some of my favorite moments from the month of September: 
1. Farm Bill Focused – During the month of September, the Farm Bill conference committee held a public hearing where conference committee members could outline their priorities. While we are still working to gain consensus on the final version, I remain committed and focused on delivering a strong Farm Bill that supports our producers.
￼ 
2. King Crop – Cotton is king in West Texas, and there is no better way to celebrate cotton and what it means to our region than with Texas Tech football. It’s been a blast watching our Red Raiders play this year, especially so against Houston during the Celebrate Cotton Game. Wreck ‘em!  
￼ 
3. Veteran Employment – Too often our veterans are not served and cared for in a timely manner when returning home from service in the military. I was fortunate enough to join a few in the veteran employment industry for a panel at the Texas Tribune Festival to discuss how we can better assist our veterans in their transition from deployment to employment.  
￼ 
4. Freedom Fighting – The 317th Air Lift Wing, led by Col. Jeffrey Menasco, contributes not only to our national security, but also to our region’s economic prosperity. The good people of West Texas, myself included, are grateful to have both Col. Menasco’s leadership and our freedom fighters at Dyess sacrificing daily for the safety and security of the United States.
￼ 
5. American Unity – On the 17th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, I reflected on my experience in the White House when the attack occurred. Out of all that I will remember from that fateful day, one thing remains: Americans stand united, regardless of our differences. As we remember 9/11, we would do well to remember the late John McCain’s words: ‘we are Americans first, we are Americans last, and we are Americans always.’” Read here as I recalled my experience with Roll Call.

Philadelphia Job and Resource Fair
Hello Friends, 
This Thursday, October 4th, there will be a Philadelphia job & resource fair at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. At the Philadelphia job & resource fair, you'll get the opportunity to create your resume on-site, complete a job application, practice your interview skills with experts, and so much more!
I've been told participants will get connected to much-needed resources, such as information about job training programs.  
If we want to tackle our city's staggering 26 percent poverty rate, the federal minimum wage -- $7.25/hour -- needs to change, residents must be equipped with more in-demand skills and companies need to continue hiring individuals from the community.  
Although poverty won't diminish overnight, the jobs fair in Philadelphia is just one of the many tools in our toolbox that will help to lift people out of poverty throughout the city. 
To register for the fair, click on the link and share it amongst your family & friends!                                         
Prison Re-Entry Summit
On Friday, October 5th, I will be participating in the ""BEYOND THE WALLS: Reentry Summit and Prison Healthcare, "" which will run from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Pennsylvania Convention Center to discuss the need for criminal justice reform on a federal level and how these changes would immensely help communities of color! I'll be speaking during the opening session, which will run from 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. 
According to the ACLU of Pennsylvania, our state has the 7th largest prison population in the country and the HIGHEST incarceration rate in the northeast. In addition, nearly 30 percent of the Commonwealth's prisoners have a mental illness and in Philadelphia, African-Americans are currently incarcerated at 5 TIMES the rate of their white counterparts.
These statistics are unacceptable and that is why it is critical we address the problems within our justice system and talk among scholars, activists, and state & local government representatives about the necessary steps to fix our failing justice system. 
Click on this link to learn more.  
Your VOTE is Your Voice!
Tuesday, October 9th is the deadline to register to vote in Pennsylvania or to update your registration due to a change of name or address. Most Pennsylvanians can take care of this quickly and easily online at www.votespa.com. For questions, please call your county voter registration office: Philadelphia, 215-686-1591; or Montgomery County, 610-278-3280.

10/3/18 16:34,President Trump is attacking assault survivors,"  
￼ 
  

Dear Lindsey, 
Last week, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford changed the course of our democracy. 
We watched her speak truth to power. We witnessed her bravery and her pain. And we saw her courageously face down Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
But instead of being applauded for her courage, Dr. Blasey Ford is being attacked. 
I won’t repeat the despicable comments that President Trump made about her last night.  
Let me be clear: we are watching the White House attack survivors of sexual assault. We are paying attention. And we won’t forget this ugly act of cruelty and indifference. 
This is not over - the FBI must follow through on their investigation into Judge Kavanaugh. Women should keep coming forward to tell their stories. And millions of Americans should keep marching, calling, and organizing for justice.
You are what democracy looks like. It’s because of your activism that we are one step closer to stopping this nomination. 
But our work is not done. The Senate could vote as early as this week on Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation --- long before the American people or the US Senate has time to fully review the FBI’s findings. 
We cannot let them push through this confirmation. I will keep fighting to defeat this dangerous nomination and standing up for sexual assault survivors, and I know that you will too. 
As always, I am here for you. You can reach my East Bay office at (510) 763-0370 or connect with me via email, facebook, twitter, and Instagram. 
In solidarity, 
￼ 
  
P.S. I know this was a difficult week for many of us. If you are a survivor, please know that you are not alone. You can call 800-656-HOPE for confidential help.

Dear Friend, 
We had a packed weak of legislating, so I wanted to give you an update on some of the most important items, including a few of my own efforts.  
Free and Fair Aluminum Market 
I introduced legislation this past week to ensure a free and fair aluminum market. By clarifying the statutory authority of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to conduct oversight over the aluminum market, I'm confident that any pricing irregularities that have been plaguing the market can be successfully uncovered and resolved.  
Reclaiming Congressional Authority over War Powers 
Congress has the responsibility to declare and oversee war-making in this country. That's how the Founding Fathers wanted it. That's what the Constitution demands. Unfortunately, the legislative branch has abdicated its responsibility. I wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal to describe both the problem and the solution: https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-take-your-war-powers-back-1537831277 
￼
Congress has a Constitutional responsibility to oversee war-making in the United States.
Combatting America's Opioid Epidemic 
The House and Senate have passed a bicameral, bipartisan agreement to combat the opioid crisis in our country. I was thankful to have my legislation, HR 6779, included in the agreement text. Opioid addiction is a serious problem in Colorado, and Congress has a responsibility to the American people to fight for solutions. Visit opioidcrisis.gop to learn more about House Republicans' efforts to fight this epidemic. 
Tax Reform 2.0 
I voted for Tax Reform 2.0, which passed the House of Representatives last week. This legislation makes permanent most of the tax cuts that impact individuals and families. It also helps new businesses, allowing more of their startup costs to be written off. I've heard from so many Coloradans about the benefits of the first tax reform bill, and I'm confident this one will only further help our district. 
Protecting Innocent Life 
Taxpayer dollars should never contribute to the trade of fetal tissue. I joined 84 colleagues this month calling on the Department of Health and Human Services to cancel an FDA contract with Advanced Bioscience Resources, a company that procures human fetal tissue for research. I'm thankful that HHS decided to cancel that contract. 
Keep an eye on my website for more upcoming events. And as always, for more frequent updates on legislation and events, please follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. I look forward to hearing from you; please do not hesitate to contact my Greeley, Castle Rock, or Washington office should you need any assistance. If you'd like to send me a message, you can do so on my website.

10/3/18 16:07,A Step Forward in Fighting the Opioid Epidemic,"￼ 
￼
  
Dear Professor  ,
Earlier today, I supported a comprehensive bill to help combat the ongoing opioid epidemic. This crisis has touched every part of our state, where we have lost more than 2,100 Rhode Islanders to accidental drug overdoses since 2010.
Today's important legislation will provide more flexibility and funding for states to offer mental and behavioral health care at psychiatric hospitals and facilities through Medicaid, and it will allow more medical professionals to treat people in recovery to prevent relapses and overdoses. The bill also makes improvements to state prescription drug monitoring programs, and encourages further research and development of opioid alternatives for pain relief.
I also helped craft and pass this year's Labor-HHS-Education appropriations law, which provides over $3.7 billion to fight opioid abuse, including:
	•	$1.9 billion in enhanced state grants to address the opioid epidemic and mental health.
	•	$495 million to improve access to opioid and substance use disorder treatment in rural and underserved areas.
	•	$350 million for opioid overdose surveillance and prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as enhancement of State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs.
	•	$100 million to address the needs of children who are affected by parental substance use.
The opioid epidemic continues to have a devastating impact on our state and nation, and these new funds and authorities dedicate real resources to help fight it. In spite of the current political climate in Congress, know that I am continuing to work hard to promote policies that help keep our communities safe and healthy.
Sincerely,
 
Jack Reed

My Met Council review was ordered!

Dear Lindsey,
For years I have been a strong proponent of bringing Minnesota’s Met Council into federal compliance and, as your Representative, I have worked on numerous initiatives to get this accomplished. 
Recently, the Department of Transportation (DOT) ordered a much-needed official review of the Met Council’s standing, at my request.
CLICK HERE to take my MET COUNCIL SURVEY and feel free to share with friends and neighbors!
Currently, the board is out of compliance by intentionally omitting elected representatives from serving, and this has compromised the transparency and taxpayer accountability of the Met Council. It is the only Metropolitan Planning Organization in the country to exclude elected officials, and yet they have the independent authority to raise taxes on citizens of the seven-county metro area while also having a budget greater than 17 of the top 20 MPOs combined. 
It’s high time the DOT officially reviewed the Met Council’s standing, as it is grossly unacceptable for them to continue acting outside of federal law. 
The Department of Transportation under the Obama Administration even recommended that the Met Council move to have elected officials on their board—yet they still disobeyed. 
It’s great to see the DOT follow through on my request, and I will continue in my efforts to bring the Met Council into compliance. 
Take my MET COUNCIL SURVEY HERE. 
As I work on this and other issues, I always like to hear directly from you.  Please share any thoughts you may have through my website, and sign up for my e-mail newsletter for the latest updates from Washington, D.C. and around the district. You can also stay on top of my work by following my Facebook and Twitter pages. Please feel free to call my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-2271 or my local Burnsville office at 651-846-2120 with any comments or for assistance with a federal agency.

Sincerely,

10/3/18 15:03,This may not make headlines,"￼
October 3, 2018
Dear Friend,
These days, it can be frustrating to watch the news about the toxic political climate in Washington. Believe me, I share those same frustrations. With that in mind, I wanted to share some good news with you about my work to protect the places where New Mexicans love to get outdoors. Yesterday, in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I was proud to advance several major pieces of legislation I've been working on to grow our outdoor recreation economy, promote access to our public lands, and support sustainable use of New Mexico's land and water for generations to come.
The Every Kid Outdoors Act will allow every fourth-grader in America to visit our nation's parks, forest, wildlife refuges, and public lands free of charge--and bring their families along with them. Connecting kids to the outdoors can inspire a lifelong connection to conservation, while reaping all of the health benefits that go along with an active lifestyle. 
I was also proud to secure a vote out of committee to permanently reauthorize and fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund. In New Mexico, LWCF has protected iconic landscapes like the Valles Caldera, Ute Mountain, and Valle de Oro, without costing taxpayers a single cent. It has also provided for community projects like baseball and soccer fields, playgrounds, and picnic areas. This bill will make sure our kids and grandkids will be playing ball, catching fish, and chasing mule deer on our public lands for many years to come.
I've been hard at work forging a compromise between Republicans and Democrats on how to address the maintenance backlog at our national parks. I'm proud we've finally passed a bill out of committee that will help restore and rebuild roads, buildings, campgrounds, trails and water systems in New Mexico's national parks and monuments. National Parks are a major economic driver in New Mexico, drawing millions of visitors and generating over $100 million in economic activity. We must invest in our Park Service infrastructure to ensure our national parks are safe and accessible to the visitors from near and far who pass through their gates each year. 
Finally, I welcomed the passage of two major New Mexico priorities that I've worked on closely with local communities and Senator Tom Udall for the last few years. The Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks Conservation Act would complete the community proposal the region included in the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument by designating over 200,000 acres of new wilderness. And the New Mexico Drought Preparedness Act will give communities critical resources and technical assistance to use our limited water supplies more efficiently.   These may not be the type of developments that make headlines. But I want you to know that I remain focused on using my role in the Senate to deliver results on what matters to New Mexico. I hope you and your family are able to get outdoors and enjoy some beautiful fall colors in the places we all own and love. Please stay in touch about this or other issues important to your community. 
Sincerely,
￼

After months of suffering from the toxic effects of red tide, the last thing we need is another catastrophic oil spill off the Gulf Coast. Read what I’m doing to protect our coastal waters -- Vern 
￼ 
Buchanan opposes Trump plan to weaken offshore drilling protection in the Gulf  Ryan Callihan   U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan is once again taking a hard stance against the Trump administration’s plans for offshore drilling.  Buchanan, R-Longboat Key initially fought back against Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke when he drafted a plan to put Gulf water up for lease as offshore drilling locations in January. At the time, Buchanan said it was a “recipe for disaster,” calling for legislation to prevent the move.  Now he’s doubling down with legislation that seeks to keep current oil and gas safety rules in place.  On Monday, Buchanan co-sponsored the Safe COAST Act that was introduced by Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragan, D-California, in January. The bill would codify the Oil and Gas Production Safety Systems and Well Control rules — two sets of guidelines that ensure “protections for worker safety, the environment and coastal environments — into law.  “It would be a monumental mistake to lift these safeguards. The last thing we need after suffering through the devastating impact of red tide is to open the door to another catastrophic oil spill,” Buchanan said.  The Interior Department has gone back and forth over its plan to remove these restrictions, but on Friday the agency announced it would officially lift regulations put in place under the Obama administration. The rollback is set to take effect Dec. 27, if no action overrides it.  Experts say the move unnecessarily places Gulf waters in jeopardy. Miyoko Sakishima, director of the oceans program at the Center for Biological Diversity, said the plan, “isn’t just regulation, it’s willful ignorance.”  Other changes proposed by the Interior Department are: removing the requirement for oil companies to receive independent verification of safety measure used on offshore platforms; getting rid of the requirement that professional engineers certify the safety of the design of offshore drilling equipment; and eliminating the requirement that third-party auditors confirm safety and pollution prevention equipment are functional under extreme conditions.  The department said the rules were “potentially unduly burdensome requirements,” but Buchanan challenged the need to remove these guidelines, citing the oil industry’s recent success and profitability.  “If these safeguards are so burdensome, then why is the oil industry enjoying record profits? The U.S. is currently producing over 11 million barrels of oil per day — a level we have not reached since the 1970s, rivaling the world’s top producers, Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Dear Friend,  Every year, from September 15th to October 15th, we come together to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month and honor the integral role the Latino community has and continues to play in shaping our great nation.  From enriching our communities through civic engagement and participation at every level of government, to the countless cultural contributions through literature and the arts, to fostering our economic growth, the Latino community has had a profound impact on Ventura County.  As we celebrate this month, we also recognize that America is made stronger because of our diversity. The hard work, skills, and talent that Latinos bring to our economy has been vital to the success and growth of our community -- and our country as a whole. That is why I will continue to focus on the policies that invest in all of our working families and ensure everyone has a fair shot at the American Dream, including strengthening our K-12 education system, making higher education more affordable, protecting our environment, and increasing access to quality healthcare.  As your representative in Congress, you can count on me to protect the rights of the more than 57 million Latinos throughout the United States and continue to foster, invest in, and highlight their contributions to the social and economic fabric of our country.  Thank you, and Happy Hispanic Heritage Month!  Sincerely,

 Home | Newsroom | Helping Iowans | Contact 

Good morning – 
I am so excited to let you all know that after intense negotiations, the United States, Mexico and Canada have reached a new trade agreement! The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) modernizes the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) by rebalancing how goods and services are exchanged to better serve the interests of American workers, farmers and businesses.
President Trump is making good on his promise to get deals done that will boost confidence, provide certainty and unleash optimism across farm country in Iowa and the rest of the U.S. From this deal, farmers will see increased market access and updated regulatory standards that will strengthen trade and foster a more fair trade environment.  

 Why is the USMCA good for Iowa?  
	•	Food and agriculture will trade more fairly, including dairy and wheat: Canada will eliminate its “Class 7” program that allows low-priced dairy ingredients to undersell U.S. dairy products in both Canada and other developing countries. Canada also will provide equal treatment when assessing the quality of imported wheat.
	•	U.S. farmers will have new access to Canadian agriculture markets: Canada will provide important new access for the full range of United States dairy products, eggs and poultry.
	•	New standards will strengthen ag trade: The new agreement sets unprecedented standards for agricultural biotechnology, establishes commitments to reduce trade-distorting policies and enhances rules for science-based sanitary and phytosanitary measures.

Fighting for our Farmers . . .

￼

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  Oct 3, 2018
 


Agreement paves way for Enbridge to permanently shut down, replace Line 5 beneath the Straits of Mackinac

Accord between the state and company requires Enbridge to pay all costs for a multi-use tunnel beneath the Straits, compels safety improvements on other water crossings
The state of Michigan and Enbridge Energy today announced an agreement that will lead to major safety enhancements along the entire length of the Line 5 petroleum pipeline crossing the state, permanently shut down the current segment that crosses the Straits of Mackinac, and construct a multi-use utility tunnel beneath the Straits. All costs for the tunnel will be paid by Enbridge.
Under the agreement signed today, Enbridge would pay for all design, construction, operation and maintenance of the tunnel for up to 99 years, subject to approvals by the Mackinac Bridge Authority. Tunnel construction is estimated to cost between $350 million to $500 million over the 7- to 10-year duration of the project. This major infrastructure initiative for northern Michigan, which would be owned by the Mackinac Bridge Authority and in which Enbridge would lease space, also could house additional infrastructure, such as broadband and electrical lines.    “Since taking office 20 months ago, I’ve worked closely with Gov. Snyder to ensure our Straits remain safe while maintaining the flow of pipeline commerce,” said U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman. “The proposed tunnel is a forward-thinking, innovative approach ensuring safety and continued economic stability. Michigan’s First District is long overdue to benefit financially from the continuous flow of products transiting our area. I will work tirelessly to ensure that the economic advantages from our energy infrastructure directly benefit the constituents of the First District.”
“This common-sense solution offers the greatest possible safeguards to Michigan’s waters while maintaining critical connections to ensure Michigan residents have the energy resources they need,” said Gov. Rick Snyder. “The historic agreement will result in eliminating nearly every risk of an oil leak in the Straits and provide added protections to the Great Lakes. It also will allow for multiple utilities to be housed and protected, better connecting our peninsulas, improving energy security and supporting economic development. The taxpayers of Michigan will benefit greatly from this project but won’t have to pay for it.” 
The new accord, which builds on a November 2017 agreement between the state and Enbridge, also demands specific actions at sensitive Line 5 water crossings other than the Straits, expanding protections along the length of the pipeline in Michigan.
“Pipeline safety has always been a top priority for me,” said U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, chair of the House Subcommittee on Energy. “I led the bipartisan effort on two major pipeline safety and accountability bills in the last several years. Getting Enbridge to pay for 100 percent of the Line 5 replacement tunnel is the right approach and one I’ve sought since day one. I want to thank the State of Michigan, and Governor Snyder, for their clear-headed leadership on this issue. This agreement needs to get done as quickly as possible for the protection of our Great Lakes.”
Assessments to date of the Line 5 Straits crossing confirm the pipeline’s integrity. However, the agreement will demand additional measures to reduce risk during tunnel construction. Those safety measures will:
* Assure the Straits pipeline is not operating when high waves would severely hamper response to a potential oil spill. The agreement requires that Enbridge staff be present at the Straits to be able to shut down the line within 15 minutes – even if power is lost – when wave heights hit 6.5 feet for at least an hour. Enbridge must continue to shut down the Straits pipeline when wave heights hit 8 feet for at least an hour. 
* Provide a new radar system to supply improved, real-time wave-height data at the Strait
* Assure at least $1.8 billion in available funds be provided by Enbridge to respond to a potential oil spill in the Straits or anywhere on Line 5 in Michigan, providing added protections as tunnel construction is completed. 
* Provide consistent state supervision of Line 5 through regular meetings between Enbridge and the state. 
* Install cameras in the Straits, paid for by Enbridge, to support new regulations from the U.S. Coast Guard prohibiting ships in the area from dropping their anchors. This has been identified as one of the most serious threats to Line 5 and other utility lines on the bottom of the Straits. The cameras will allow the Coast Guard to monitor vessels entering the waterways and immediately communicate with those that are operating dangerously.
The new agreement would also:
* Require immediate additional safety measures at 13 priority Line 5 water crossings, in addition to requiring actions at 68 other crossings as identified in a previous report. 
* Prohibit heavy crude oil from ever traveling through Line 5. 
A previous report conducted by Enbridge and overseen by the state identified a tunnel beneath the Straits as a feasible replacement alternative to the existing Line 5 Straits crossing.
In compliance with the 2017 agreement, Enbridge has already applied for authorizations and approvals to replace the Line 5 crossing at the St. Clair River, a key water body that provides drinking water to a large population in southeast Michigan. That work will begin upon the receipt of those authorizations and approvals. 
Line 5 is 645 miles long and transports up to 540,000 barrels a day of light crude oil and natural gas liquids, including propane. Below the Straits of Mackinac, the pipeline splits into two lines that lie on the lake bottom within an easement issued by the state of Michigan. A new pipeline in the tunnel would not increase volumes or alter the types of products transported through the existing Line 5.

Poll: Manufacturing Day
Hoosiers,

This Friday is Manufacturing Day, an annual celebration of modern manufacturing meant to inspire the next generation. This industry is vital to Indiana's economy. Manufacturers in Indiana account for 28.8 percent of the total output in the state, employing 16.8 percent of the workforce.

Manufacturing not only plays an important role in the United States economy, but across the world. That is why Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act last year - to modernize our domestic and international tax code and incentivize American companies to expand their businesses already here, to bring back jobs we had lost to overseas competitors, and to innovate and create new jobs and opportunities for a modern manufacturing economy.

Question of the Week: Do you believe the government should continue to remove barriers and reduce incentives for companies to move abroad, keeping jobs and economic prosperity in the United States?

[_] Yes.
[_] No.
[_] I don't know.
[_] Other (share your thoughts).

Take the poll here.

Dear Lindsey, 
Did you know that the Unites States Secret Service (Secret Service) was originally formed to stop counterfeiters after the Civil War? While their mission has grown and includes protecting the President and other public officials, the Secret Service continues to investigate financial crimes. During my recent meeting with Special Agent in Charge Tim Burke and other agents in the Pittsburgh Office, productive discussions were held with the Financial and Electronic Crimes Task Force. A review of the National Threat Assessment Center’s new operational guide to help prevent school violence and its rollout in the District was one meeting highlight.

Local Programs Tackling Big Challenges 
Youth drug addiction and mental illness are two major problems facing Western Pennsylvania. A coordinated effort of local, state, and federal authorities helps ensure that our communities have the resources to assist our constituents.  
I am pleased to announce that several Western Pennsylvania communities have received beneficial federal grants to address drug addiction and mental illness. 
 ￼
The BC-SCORES Coalition was awarded a $125,000 grant through the Office of National Drug Control Policy’s (ONDCP) Drug Free Communities program! This grant supports their efforts in preventing youth drug abuse. 
￼  
Beaver County’s Behavioral Health and Developmental Services received a four-year grant totaling $1.6 million from the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It will be awarded in four annual $400,000 installments. Resources will be provided to Beaver County’s “Dear Mind” campaign and support families and young people at high risk of mental illness.
￼ 
Additionally, the Cambria County Drug Coalition received their first of five $125,000 annual grants from the ONDCP’s Drug Free Communities program! This money will help them in their mission of restoring a safe, drug-free Cambria County.
Learning More about our Minds 
￼
Recently, I toured Carnegie Mellon University’s (CMU) Institute for Neuroscience. Their medical team, led by Dr. Alison Barth, told me about their research in the field of neuroscience. The dedicated team continues to pursue methods to identify and treat diseases early, including Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and dementia. Additionally, they draw on the excellent capacity of the University’s information technology resources as they strive to extend the quality of life of many Americans. It is gratifying to see the CMU and U.S. government partnership making such progress.
Supporting our Young People 
Launched two years ago, the Beaver County Youth Ambassador Program continues its mission to destigmatize mental health issues and promote healthy ways for students to cope with stress and loneliness. This program equips student ambassadors with the resources for their peers and create a culture of understanding and support. Thank you to our students and the Beaver County Rehabilitation Center Supervisor of Youth Services, Maureen Hawk, and her team for their work. Read more here. 
Supporting the Bruce Mansfield Power Station 
￼ 
During my recent visit to the Bruce Mansfield Power Station, I reassured the employees that I will continue to fight to maintain a diversified, independent, and resilient power grid nationwide. This includes continuing the use of clean coal and nuclear energy as power sources. Maintaining a resilient power grid is essential to our national security. My commitment to “keeping the lights on” in this growing economy is vital to Western Pennsylvania and the region. 
Addressing Human Trafficking 
Tragically, human trafficking is still a huge problem in the US and around the world. Human traffickers continue to misuse the internet, especially the so-called “Deep Web” and “Dark Web” to facilitate their crimes. 
My work on the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Terrorism & Illicit Finance and the Judiciary Committee provides me a unique platform to advance legislation that fights human trafficking. We have passed many bills in the House to fight human trafficking, such as the bipartisan bill I introduced with my colleague, Representative Juan Vargas [CA-51], the Fight Illicit Networks and Detect (FIND) Trafficking Act. This bill requires the Government Accountability Office to analyze and report on the use of virtual currencies in marketplaces facilitating sex and drug trafficking.
More Than Crumbs 
Over the past few months, constituents across our district have shared how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is helping them and their families put more money in their pockets. Check out a few highlights below.
￼ 
These are just a few of the success stories from Pennsylvania’s 12th Congressional District. If you would like to share how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is benefitting you and your family, please go to https://rothfus.house.gov/tax-reform-survey.

Dear Friend, 

The 7th District of Virginia is home to nearly 55,000 veterans who deserve our gratitude and respect. In Congress, I have been a strong supporter of legislation that helps our veterans such as the VA Mission Act. My office has also assisted over 350 veterans help cut through the bureaucratic red tape at the VA. 

Last week I held a veterans' townhall in Henrico with Rep. Phil Roe, Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and author of the VA Mission Act. My goal was to facilitate a dialogue between our veterans and their chief advocate in Washington. Throughout the townhall they were able to hear more about the work being done in Washington to reform the VA and ensure our veterans are getting the care they need. 

￼

The VA Mission Act is a key step towards this reform. Under this bill our veterans will receive more timely scheduling of medical appointments and will have more access to care outside the VA system if they live too far away from a VA medical facility. This bill was a great achievement, but there is still more to be done. I will continue to advocate for our veterans in Washington and will fight for those who fought for our nation. 

￼

Stay in Touch  
I am always interested in hearing your thoughts. If you have any comments, questions, or concerns, you can contact me directly by clicking here or by calling my office at (202) 225-2815.

Last Week in Congress
Yoder Votes to Make Middle Class, Small Business Tax Cuts Permanent
￼
Last year's tax reform legislation has launched a surge of growth in our economy, as business have created more jobs and the middle class has seen their take-home pay rise. But there's still more that we can do to bring permanent tax relief to American taxpayers, and the House took a major step in that direction this week.
I proudly voted in favor of a package of legislation known as Tax Reform 2.0, all aimed at setting up our economy for long-term and sustained growth. The cornerstone of this legislation is permanently locking in the middle class and small business tax cuts that were implemented last year. Tax Reform 2.0 included three separate bills:
	•	H.R.6760, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act: makes permanent the tax cuts for the middle class and small businesses, as well as other family-focused provisions like the doubled Child Tax Credit.
	•	H.R. 6757, the Family Savings Act: reforms the tax code to help Americans save for important life events, like the birth of a child, education, and retirement.
	•	H.R. 6756, the American Innovation Act: creates new incentives to help start-up businesses get off the ground.
I voted in favor of each of these bills, which passed the House with bipartisan support. H.R. 6760 alone is projected to create 1.5 million new jobs in our country, and together these bills will help ensure that the economic boom we're seeing right now continues in the long run.
￼
Congress Passes Funding Increases for Defense, Medical Research, Education
￼
Last week, I took a vote to uphold the promise that I have made to support our military, when the House passed a major appropriations package that included the Department of Defense Appropriations Act. This was the first time Congress has completed the defense funding bill on schedule in over 20 years. The legislation secures $674.4 billion, giving our military certainty that they will receive the vital resources they need to ensure operational continuity and maintain our military presence around the world. Importantly, this legislation gives our brave men and women fighting for our freedom a 2.6% raise, the largest pay raise in almost a decade. The bill also provides funding for 16 new ships, 2 new submarines, 173 new aircraft, 124 new helicopters and upgrades for 135 tanks. When our brave warfighters put their lives on the line to protect our nation, we need to be able to say we have given the safest and most effective tools to complete their missions. I am proud that America is providing for our armed forces again, and will continue to working to support those who are on the front lines keeping America safe.
 
￼ Click here to watch Kevin's recent speech about NIH funding
This bipartisan funding bill also included full-year funding for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education - the first time this funding has been completed before the end of the fiscal year in two decades. It boosts funding for lifesaving programs at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by $2 billion, provides a $100 million increase in the Cancer Moonshot research initiative, and calls for an additional $425 million for Alzheimer’s disease research. The great work done by the NIH has helped cause a 26% decrease in U.S. cancer deaths from 1991 to 2015, saving 2.4 million lives, and the funding increases in this bill will allow us to build on that great progress.
In addition to NIH, this legislation directs historic levels of funding to fight and end the opioid abuse epidemic, increases crucial education programs like Head Start, and supports college students through increased Pell Grants. Plus, the bill includes temporary funding through December 7, 2018 for all pieces of appropriations legislation that Congress has not completed yet - ensuring that our government stays open and running smoothly.

Economy Continues Strong Growth
￼ ￼ Click here to read more from MarketWatch
More great news for the economy - all signs are pointing toward sustained growth for the long run. Last quarter our economy expanded at an outstanding 4.2% pace, and recent indicators project that we will grow at a rate of at least 3% for the remainder of the year. This continuous growth is encouraging consumers, and the Consumer Confidence Index rose in September to its highest point in 18 years - close to an all-time record. Consumers drive our economy, and their optimism signals that people all across the country are feeling the positive effects of our pro-growth agenda. The economy in Kansas is surging too - wages in our state grew faster than the national average in the second quarter, and we had the 10th largest wage growth in the nation.
￼
House Approves Major Legislation to Combat Opioid Epidemic
￼ Click here to read more about the bill from the Energy and Commerce Committee
The opioid crisis has touched communities across the country as drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for people under the age of 50. This week, the House gave final approval to H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, a landmark piece of legislation to combat this epidemic. This bill will give our communities the resources they need to provide treatment and support to those who are suffering from this debilitating disease. This bipartisan legislation will help advance treatment and recovery initiatives, improve prevention efforts, protect our communities and bolster our efforts to fight the deadly illicit drugs like fentanyl. On top of the $10.7 billion dollars appropriated in response to this crisis in recent funding bills, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act will be another step towards healing our communities in the face of this heartbreaking challenge
￼
Yoder Votes for FAA Reauthorization and Hurricane Florence Aid
￼
Last week, the House passed bipartisan legislation that provides long-term stability to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and transforms federal disaster programs to help communities be better prepared. I voted for this widely supported legislation, which passed by a vote of 398 – 23. The bill includes provisions to reauthorize and reform the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), modernize airport infrastructure, promote safety and American leadership in aviation, and strengthen consumer service.
The bill also reforms programs to help communities better prepare for disasters. Last year, over 26 million Americans were affected by at least one natural disaster. This legislation increases the federal emphasis on pre-disaster planning and mitigation, which will reduce the potential for future loss of life and address the rising costs of disasters in America. Plus, the bill includes $1.68 billion for the Department of Housing and Urban Development to use to help communities recover from Hurricane Florence

Yoder Receives Small Business Award
￼ Kevin with NFIB President Juanita Duggan
Our pro-growth policies of tax and regulatory reform have kicked the economy into high gear, and businesses and job creators across the country are reporting their optimism about the direction we're heading. The National Federation of Independent Business's (NFIB) measure of small business optimism recently hit its highest point in 35 years, and is nearly at the highest point ever. Small businesses everywhere are reporting that they want to expand their operations and add more jobs. This week, I was honored to receive the Guardian of Small Business Award from NFIB for supporting issues crucial to the success of small business like tax cuts and regulatory reform. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act delivered significant tax and now Tax Reform 2.0 will lock in this incredibly important provision so that our small businesses can continue to hire, invest, and grow in their communities.
￼
Childhood Cancer Awareness Month at the National Cancer Institute
￼ Kevin viewing the work at NCI's Pediatric Oncology Branch
September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month and a time to highlight our work in Congress to make medical research a priority to eradicate this horrible disease. Last Tuesday, I toured the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Pediatric Oncology Branch with NCI Director Dr. Ned Sharpless, Chief of the Pediatric Oncology Branch at NCI Center for Cancer Research Dr. Brigitte Widemann, and Dr. Jack Shern. I saw firsthand the outstanding research on childhood cancer genomics by Dr. Shern, and saw a demonstration of an innovative device he and his team designed to perform single cell analysis to study relapsed disease, in an effort to identify specific cell characteristics driving therapy resistance and relapse. I also heard about Dr. Widemann’s promising results from a trial to shrink neurofibromatosis (NF) tumors in children and young adults, and give these kids a better quality of life. These doctors at NCI are working to solve some of the most pressing health issues of our time. It is critical that Congress provide the support researchers need now to find the cures of the future. I will continue to support federally funded NIH research and the resulting life-saving innovations in cancer detection and treatment.
￼
Yoder Receives American Society of Clinical Oncology Award
￼ Kevin receiving the award from Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, President of ASCO
I was honored to receive the 2018 Congressional Leadership Award from the American Society of Clinical Oncology. This award is given each year to the Member of Congress who has supported policies to advance the field of oncology and improve care for cancer patients. As Co-Chair of the House Cancer Caucus, I have worked hard to support efforts that are searching for a cure for cancer, such as the medical research being done at the National Institutes of Health. In addition to the award, I was also glad to meet with constituents who are clinical oncologists, like Dr. Joshua Mammen from KU Medical Center. We discussed how clinical oncologists like him are seeing real results from NIH-funded research leading to improved outcomes for cancer patients.  
￼
Meetings in D.C.
Bread for the World
￼
On Wednesday, I was excited to meet with constituents representing Bread for the World, to talk about the importance of global nutrition programs. These programs offer a hand up, rather than a hand out, to communities facing hunger and nutrition deficits that can stunt children’s physical and developmental growth. I was proud to support this cause by voting in favor of S. 2269, the Global Food Security Reauthorization Act, which will help combat famine and chronic hunger by providing support and resources to farmers in developing countries. Programs associated with the Global Food Security Act lead to more productive societies, help children perform in school, and strengthen foreign economies, which become more robust trade partners with the United States. 
￼
Merck Animal Health
￼ Kevin with Rick DeLuca
It was a pleasure seeing my good friend and constituent, Rick DeLuca. Rick serves as the President of Merck Animal Health, whose North American Headquarters is located in DeSoto. During our visit we discussed the ongoing expansion of the Merck campus and all of the great work the fine people there are doing for the agriculture economy in Kansas and across the nation. As a result of the benefits from Tax Reform, Merck will be breaking ground on a new building at the site in the next few months, adding close to 100 new jobs in the district

Around the District
Yoder Hosts Annual Third District Job Fair
￼
We had a great turnout last week at my annual Job Fair, held at Johnson County Community College. I was excited to see 75 employers, with a focus on manufacturing and technology, accepting resumes and meeting with hundreds of local job seekers about employment opportunities. This was my tenth Job Fair in the 3rd District, and with such a strong national and local economy, I remain committed to connecting Kansans looking for work with employers. Thank you to Keely Schneider and her team from Workforce Partnership for helping to make last week's Job Fair a success. If you missed the Job Fair, and would like a list of employers, please contact my District Office at (913) 621-0832.

Olathe School District Wins Major Federal Grant
￼ ￼ Click here to read more from KCUR
Literacy skills are vital to the development of young minds – and that’s why I’m working to provide federal funding for literacy programs in Kansas. Recently, the state of Kansas received a $27 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education to be used on comprehensive literacy programs. This was one of the largest competitive education grants ever awarded to Kansas. The money will go to school districts across the state, including our own Olathe School District. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I supported strong funding for this grant program, and I am proud to see our local school districts putting this money to good use, helping all children gain the literacy skills they need to be successful.

Constituent service is my top priority, and one of the most important functions of a Congressional office. We continually navigate through red tape bureaucracy at federal agencies to help constituents of the Third District. Thanks to Fox 4 News for sharing this example of a positive outcome that we were able to achieve. If you or someone you know ever needs help with the federal government - a veteran who needs help at the VA, a senior having trouble navigating Medicare, or any other issue - please contact my district office at (913) 621-0832.

Puerto Rico Delegation at Church of the Resurrection
￼ Kevin with Rev. Adam Hamilton and Rev. Eric Hernandez
It was an impactful Sunday morning at my church, the Church of the Resurrection Leawood, as I joined Pastor Adam Hamilton in welcoming Rev. Eric Hernandez from the Methodist Church of Puerto Rico, along with a delegation from Puerto Rico that was participating in the Leadership Institute and thanking our community for their support. In Congress, we are working to bring relief and rebuild Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. It was great to see Rev. Hernandez again and hear firsthand about the rebuilding.

Dear Friend, 
The Kavanaugh Nomination 
This week is a pivotal one in the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh and for the future of our country. Following the credible testimony by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford who has accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexual assault, the Senate agreed to postpone a vote on the nomination until the FBI finishes a one-week background check into Judge Kavanaugh. This is important. 
First and foremost, victims should be believed, as I believe Dr. Ford. That is why, on Friday – the final day of the hearings – I joined my House colleagues to attend the hearing and support Dr. Ford. As the Republican Senators indicated plans to move ahead with the nomination while ignoring the allegations, we stood up in silent protest. Shortly thereafter, the Capitol Police moved us out of the room. The skepticism shown by Republicans is part of the reason rape and assault are severely under-reported. This is a moment when we can give a voice to victims. The Supreme Court is a place of justice, and so justice should be at the center of this process. 
Second, before being promoted to a life-long position, with influence over laws for a generation, Brett Kavanaugh should be closely examined, and all accusations investigated. But already there are reports that President Trump was trying to limit the scope of the investigation. There have been at least 3 accusations against Brett Kavanaugh, with others confirming that his drinking went beyond even what he admitted to the Senate. These contradictions in his testimony – including answers about his high school year book – must also be examined. 
It is important that we get this right. While I have expressed deep concerns with Judge Kavanaugh already, like his hostility to women’s reproductive rights, his questioning of the constitutionality of Native Hawaiian programs, and his reluctance to condemn Japanese internment during WWII, I believe these charges go beyond whether he is qualified to be a Supreme Court Justice. This is a chance for us as a country to empower more women to speak up when they have been attacked, and to tell men that this behavior will not be ignored any longer. I want to see this investigation conducted seriously, fairly, and comprehensively. Any hint of deception or misbehavior by Brett Kavanaugh – after denying it completely – should be disqualifying. 
Hispanic Heritage Month 
Happy Hispanic Heritage Month!  
One of the great joys of representing the San Gabriel Valley is the diversity that can be heard, seen, tasted, and experienced every day. Diversity and multiculturalism have always and will always make our country stronger. And this month is an incredible opportunity to celebrate the many ways Hispanic Americans add to that vibrancy. In California alone, 800,000 Hispanic owned small-businesses contribute over $98 billion to the economy each year.
And this is true across our country. Hispanic Americans – whether they have been here for generations or a few months - are entrepreneurs, innovators, veterans, parents, children, and neighbors. Hispanic cultural pride is our pride as well.  
That is why, in Congress, as chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, I am proud to work hand in hand with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on issues like equal access to education and healthcare. And of course, immigration reform. 
I’m also fighting back on the attacks on Hispanic immigrants and communities Threats of deportation are threats to tear families apart and uproot communities. We know this because we live this reality in Southern California, every day. The antidote to the venom of xenophobia is exposure – getting to know our neighbors and understand that America does not belong to one group or another. But ideas like the border wall are meant to reinforce fear by painting one group as an enemy and making it impossible for different communities to build our nation together. That is why I am promising to stand up to fear and division and to continue fighting for comprehensive immigration reform that will grow our country and keep families whole. 
I am proud of the contributions from Hispanic Americans. And as we celebrate this Hispanic Heritage Month, let us also look ahead to the future successes we will celebrate together.  
Sincerely, 
￼

Dear Friend,
October is Breast Cancer Awareness month, where we take the time to educate our broader community to the persistent threat Breast Cancer poses to our friends and loved ones.  Like so many women, I have had family and loved ones touched by breast cancer.  But over our lifetimes we have seen the breast cancer survival rates increase and we continue to fight for earlier detection and better treatment.
In August I visited the Novant Health UVA Haymarket Medical Center and met medical staff to discuss how they are administering unique, high-quality cancer care in our area. Novant Health’s high-tech breast cancer center has comprehensive breast cancer care and utilizes advanced 3-D digital scans to best detect breast cancer in women. Their specialists provide a multidisciplinary approach to treatment and even offers a unique second opinion on breast cancer diagnoses. By bringing more state-of-the-art treatment facilities such as these to Northern Virginia, we can present more opportunities to treat, educate, and ultimately cure breast cancer for our friends and families facing this challenge.
This year Congress has dedicated $34.4 billion for defense health programs, which includes funding for the Breast Cancer Research Program (BCRP). The BCRP is a unique partnership between Congress, the military, and the public to fund innovative and impactful medical research in targeted program areas, including breast cancer. These funds will support the BCRP mission to achieve a world without breast cancer. These appropriations are on top of the unprecedented $39.1 billion in funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which will support research to improve the prevention, treatment, and find cures for life-threatening illnesses and diseases such as breast cancer, Alzheimer’s, HIV/AIDS, and diabetes. 
On behalf of the many woman who are living with breast cancer and those who will be diagnosed in the future I joined with my colleagues to send a letter to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to ensure that fabricated breast prosthetics are covered under Medicare. It is only right that women who have battled breast cancer be given options that best suit their recovery, and it is my hope CMS recognizes this important matter.  As your elected representative, I will continue to fight for more resources to support new research, ensure equal treatment for survivors, and further raise awareness regarding breast cancer.  
Thank you, ￼  Barbara Comstock Member of Congress

Hurricane Florence Recovery Update 
I wanted to give an update on some of the ongoing recovery efforts in North Carolina from Hurricane Florence.  
Recently I had the chance to go to Bladen County, North Carolina—one of the areas most impacted—to meet with first responders, assess damage, and see what we can do to help with recovery efforts. While the damage is severe, we were incredibly encouraged by the community coming together. These are the best people you'll find—they’re working long hours and putting everything they have into assisting families in the area who are suffering. Several people have come in from other parts of the state to offer their help as well. 
Please continue pray for the folks affected. They have a long road ahead, but NC's people are the best in the country. 
Additionally, for those who may have seen: North Carolina has formally appealed a denial from FEMA for major disaster assistance—a request which included several of our NC11 counties (Buncombe, Caldwell, Henderson, Madison, McDowell, etc). This is a huge deal and will be critical for some of our counties that got hit with significant flood damage. Last week I spent some time with one of our teams in McDowell County and they’re working hard on response measures to flooding in the district. I joined a full delegation letter backing a request to get them expedited assistance. 
We will keep you posted. Our first responders are doing an incredible job and people from all over the state are stepping up to help their friends and neighbors in need.
As a reminder, for any resources you may need, we’ve compiled a list on our website and would be glad to help however possible. You can see that page here.

Tax Reform 2.0 Passes House 
A new round of tax reform passed the House last week, focused on individuals, small business, and family savings plans—and I was proud to be an original cosponsor. 
Here are some of the specific things this package of tax reform accomplishes: 
- It makes the individual tax cuts permanent (remember, the individual rates were forced to be temporary in the original bill, due to Senate budget rules)   - It creates new savings accounts options for families, particularly with 529 education accounts and “baby savings” plans  - It removes financial barriers and burdens from small business creators by creating more flexibility for write-offs on start-up costs 
These are the types of pro-family, pro-growth, and pro-worker reforms we need to keep pushing. Read more about some of the reforms here. You can also watch my full floor speech in support of the package here.

Update on DOJ/FBI Investigation 
We saw major developments this week on two fronts with our investigation into FBI/DOJ actions during the 2016 election and early stages of the Trump administration.
First, House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte has subpoenaed the memos from former Deputy FBI Director, Andrew McCabe. This is critical. We have been asking for these memos for months and the Department turned us down every time—but they should provide some insight into what was going on at DOJ and FBI during 2016 and 2017, according to McCabe’s own words.
Second, House Leadership has agreed to call Rod Rosenstein before Congress, for a closed-door hearing with our investigative task force, so he can explain his alleged comments on ""wiring"" POTUS—as well as other inconsistent statements. This will allow Mr. Rosenstein to explain his side of the New York Times report and answer other questions to the task force. If Mr. Rosenstein fails to attend voluntarily, we will subpoena him. 
Whether or not the reports regarding Mr. Rosenstein are true, here's what we know to be true: this story underscores the desperate need for transparency at the DOJ. Release the documents. It is time to declassify everything, only protecting sources and methods. Stop the games and show Americans the truth about this Russia investigation. If they have nothing to hide, they should act like it.
You can watch my discussion on the issue with Laura Ingraham here.

Bryson City Fire Department 
Some important news for NC-11 first responders this week: I was honored to present the Bryson City Fire Department with a grant check for $182,000, as part of a DHS program supporting first responders, going toward their recruitment program! It’s very well deserved and huge for Swain County.
Thanks so much to the team for everything they do.

A Win for American Farmers and Workers 
If you missed it, President Trump and the White House just secured a major win for America on trade—successfully renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico. This is a crucial win for the country and for the administration. The President continues to deliver on his 'America First' promise!
Congratulations to President Trump and the White House team on a job well done on the renegotiation –this will be a major victory for American workers and farmers. The deal will now go to Congress for review, where I look forward to working with my Republican and Democrat colleagues on helping see it through. 
You can read more details about the agreement here. 
 
My Bill to Extend Opportunity Zones 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 included a popular provision implementing a new mechanism called “Opportunity Funds.” These funds allow investors to defer and reduce their capital gains tax bills in exchange for investing in projects located in economically disadvantaged areas, known as “Opportunity Zones.” Opportunity zones are designated by the Department of the Treasury and typically have an unemployment rate of about 14%, a lower than average median household income, and are usually located in counties where 20 percent (or more) of the population has been living below the poverty line for 30 years.
Essentially, this part of the tax cuts bill creates an incentive for Americans to invest in less-fortunate communities. That’s exactly what our government should be doing—creating tax incentives and allowing market forces to work. 
The current law allows designations to expire after 10 years, but this week, I introduced a bill (H.R. 6890) that would allow for the designation of new opportunity zones every 10 years. Under this bill, the policy’s benefits could build and compound rather than expire.
Opportunity Funds benefit the state of North Carolina directly. On May 18 of this year, the Treasury Department certified 252 areas in NC as official Opportunity Zones, with more than 450 unique North Carolina census tracts identified for further review. This is a major catalyst for economic development and increased opportunity for under-privileged residents and families.
Read all about the bill here. Helping economically disadvantaged communities through market incentives is a huge priority of mine—we’re looking forward to working on it!

Supporting Israel – U.S. - Israel Cooperation Expansion Act 
Our office is continuing to support Israel with common sense reforms dedicated to security. This week, I was proud to introduce a bipartisan bill with Rep. Brad Schneider from Illinois and Rep. Doug Lamborn from Colorado. You can read all about the bill here. 
The bill addresses modernized threats against Israel and the U.S. by enhancing the partnership between our two nations, particularly in the area of law enforcement training and development for security. It formally supports the inclusion of Israel in American International Law Enforcement Academies, in which Israel does not currently participate. Including Israel in this organization would facilitate enhanced cooperation between our two countries and give Israel’s law enforcement and security teams access to the tools and training needed to better deal with modernized threats.
The United States has not just a responsibility but an obligation to stand with Israel, our strongest ally in the Middle East and around the globe. It’s on Congress to pass common sense reforms like these that will allow for better cooperation, coordination, and partnership for our two nations to face modernized threats together. 
I’m proud to be a part of this and look forward to seeing it through. Thanks to Mr. Schneider and Mr. Lamborn for working with us. 
Rallying Conservatives in Washington 
I was honored to meet so many great conservatives from all over the country last week at the ‘FreedomWorks’ rally in Washington, D.C., supporting my good friend and House Freedom Caucus colleague Rep. Jim Jordan for speaker! 
Jim is one of the finest men, leaders, and conservatives in all of Washington—I’m proud to give him my full support. 
There is a tremendous amount of grassroots energy demanding change in Congress, much like what we’ve seen take place in the White House this year under President Trump’s leadership. Well, we hear you, and we are committed to doing everything we can to returning power back to you on Main Street.
Thanks so much to everyone who made time to take the trip. We had people take time off of work just to be there—and we even had students from North Carolina make time to attend! You can watch a portion of my speech to the crowd here.

Dear Friend,
It's Hispanic Heritage Month, a time where we honor the contributions of Hispanic Americans to our nation’s history and culture. Whether though music, film, technology, education, or politics; the Latino impact on American culture is undeniable. Each day, I am proud to honor this legacy in Washington as your representative.  
The history of Latinos in this country is a history of activism. From the farmlands of Arizona to the U.S. Supreme Court, our place in this country has been shaped by struggle and hard-won victories. Now, President Trump and his administration have implemented policies that attack our community and attempt to erase our claims to the American Dream. Despite these attacks, I remain committed to protecting and strengthening our legacy and inheritance—not just today—but for the generations that follow. Battles over access to quality education, livable wages, affordable health care, immigrant justice, and important civil rights protections are critical to ensuring the long-term success of our children and grandchildren. The battles we fight and the victories we obtain today directly impact their futures.
Each day that I vote in Washington, I think about this history and the legacy that we will pass on to future generations. It’s why I’m fighting for policies that ensure our long-term success and prosperity. Quality schools, affordable health care, a humane immigration system, and good-paying jobs aren’t just talking points, they are the building blocks for our children’s and grandchildren’s futures. This Hispanic Heritage Month, let’s honor the legacy of those who fought for the rights we enjoy today and recommit ourselves to ensuring their strength. 
Peace,
￼

Querido Amigo,
 
El 15 de septiembre constituye el comienzo del Mes Nacional de la Herencia Hispana, en celebración y reconocimiento de la historia y cultura de los hispanoamericanos. Ya sea a través de la música, el cine, la tecnología, la educación o la política; el impacto latino en la cultura estadounidense es innegable. Cada día, me enorgullece honrar este legado en Washington como su representante.
La historia de los latinos en este país es una historia de activismo. Desde las tierras de cultivo de Arizona hasta la Corte Suprema de EE.UU., nuestro lugar en este país ha sido formado por luchas y victorias difíciles de conseguir. Ahora, el presidente Trump y su administración han implementado políticas que atacan a nuestra comunidad e intentan borrar nuestras demandas al sueño americano. A pesar de estos ataques, sigo luchando por la protección y el fortalecimiento de nuestro legado y herencia, no solo hoy, sino para las siguientes generaciones. Las batallas para el acceso a una educación de calidad, a unos salarios dignos, a la atención médica accesible, a la justicia de los inmigrantes y las protecciones importantes de los derechos civiles son fundamentales para garantizar el éxito a largo plazo de nuestros hijos y nietos. Las batallas que luchamos y las victorias que obtenemos hoy impactan directamente su futuro.
Cada día que voto en Washington, pienso en esta historia y en el legado que transmitiremos a las generaciones futuras. Es por eso que lucho por políticas que garanticen nuestro éxito y prosperidad a largo plazo. Las escuelas de calidad, el cuidado de la salud accesible, un sistema de inmigración humano y empleos bien remunerados no son solo puntos de discusión, sino que son los cimientos para el futuro de nuestros hijos y nietos. Durante este Mes de la Herencia Hispana, honremos el legado de aquellos que lucharon por los derechos que disfrutamos hoy y reafirmemos nuestro compromiso para garantizar su fortaleza.
Paz,
￼

Dear Friend, 

Earlier this year, I met Jill, a Peoria mom whose daughter’s Social Security number was stolen and used to commit identity fraud. It took seven years to recover her identity and change her social security number. Jill was even forced to change her daughter’s name. It was unacceptable.

That’s when I went to work to help ensure fraud victims or their families don’t have to go through this horrible experience.

￼

                  ABC15 highlighted our successful efforts to protect kids from identity fraud. Watch here.

I worked across the aisle to pass a bill called the Protecting Children from Identity Theft Act. This bill cracks down on the dangerous form of identity theft used against Jill’s daughter, and directs the Social Security Administration (SSA) to modernize its identity verification system. The president signed our bill into law in May, making it more difficult for scammers to create fake identities with stolen Social Security numbers.

There was more work to do. I pushed the Social Security Administration to learn from Jill’s experience and make changes. As a result of our action, the agency implemented important steps at its offices across the country to make sure families facing child identity theft get help in a timely and effective manner.

I recently sat down with ABC15’s Angie Koehle to discuss these successes on behalf of fraud victims. Watch my interview here.

￼

                                                             Watch the interview with ABC15 here.

I am honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Arizona families like yours. We always appreciate hearing from you on current topics and issues that are important to you. If there is an issue that concerns you, please let us know by clicking this link or by calling our Phoenix office: 602-956-2285.

Dear Friend,  
The people of the San Joaquin Valley deserve a reliable water supply, which is why I have spent decades fighting for Valley water. This month, we’ve had some success in advancing multiple policies to build a more reliable water supply, and I wanted to take this opportunity to share them with you.
Upgrading Water Infrastructure Projects in Merced  
On September 13th the House of Representatives passed America’s Water Infrastructure Act (AWIA), a bipartisan agreement reached by the House and Senate. The bill includes provisions that I championed in the House with my fellow Valley Congressmen that increase surface water storage in the Valley. It is a victory for Merced County and the people of the Valley, but we cannot stop working to secure reliable, safe water for our communities. I will continue to work with my colleagues – Republicans and Democrats alike – to protect Valley water and increase our access to the water we need to continue our way of life. 
More specifically, AWIA includes a bill I authored earlier this year with Republican Congressmen Jeff Denham (CA-10) and Tom McClintock (CA-4) that will allow Merced Irrigation District to move forward with a project to raise the spillway gates at New Exchequer Dam. This would enlarge the storage capacity of Lake McClure, increasing water supplies for eastern Merced County up to 57,000 acre-feet.
AWIA also includes a provision which I led with Rep. Denham that will expand an EPA loan guarantee program to include private and Reclamation facilities. This will make it easier to finance surface storage projects in the future, ultimately reducing the cost of the water from them. 
Additionally, AWIA includes two more programs I supported. The first will extend funding for a program that is being used to restore and eventually expand the San Luis Reservoir. The second provision creates a pilot program in the Russian River Basin to develop a system for incorporating weather forecast into reservoir operations.
For video of Congressman Costa advocating for his measure to improve reservoir operations, including those at Lake McClure, click here: 
￼ 
  
Valley Wins in Energy and Water Spending Bill 
This month we passed the Fiscal Year 2019 Energy and Water Development, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Legislative Branch appropriations bill. This spending bill includes multiple areas of funding that will allow for investment in water infrastructure and drought prevention in the San Joaquin Valley, such as: 
	•	An additional $196 million to fund California and Western drought programs under the WIIIN Act, including:
	◦	$134 million for water storage 
	◦	$20 million for water recycling
	◦	$12 million for desalination
	◦	$30 million for environment and science projects 
	•	$540 million for the Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation water infrastructure programs specifically in California 
	•	$34 million for WaterSMART grants and almost $59 million for the Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse program 
	•	$35 million for the San Joaquin River Restoration Project to move forward on the infrastructure needed to protect Valley water supplies
	•	$8 million – a 45% increase from last year – for improved research, monitoring, and forecasting of atmospheric river storms
Expanding Shasta Reservoir 
Last week the Bureau of Reclamation announced it was moving forward with the Shasta Dam and Reservoir Enlargement Project. The project currently aims to add an additional 630,000 acre-feet when completed, which will increase the reliability of our water supply for our communities as well as for agricultural, industrial, and environmental use.
After 14 years, I’m glad to see the much-needed expansion of Shasta Reservoir finally moving forward. It’s beyond clear that California needs more water storage, which is why I worked to ensure that the WIIN Act provided $335 million in funding for projects like expanding Shasta Reservoir, expanding San Luis Reservoir, and building Sites and Temperance Flat. This is a step in the right direction, but it’s taken too long, and much more needs to be done to ensure the security of the Valley’s water supply.
For more information on the Shasta Dam Reservoir Enlargement Photo, click here:  
￼ 
Water is the lifeblood of the San Joaquin Valley, and agriculture is a cornerstone of our economy. Ensuring the people of the Valley and Valley agriculture have the water we need to continue our way of life has always been – and continues to be – one of my top priorities. As we prepare for the next rainy season, I will continue to work with local, state, and federal officials for bipartisan progress on enhancing water storage throughout the Valley.
Additionally, our Valley needs strong agriculture policy that feeds Americans and allows our food producers to continue to be some of the most productive in the world. As a member of the Farm Bill Conference Committee, I will work to ensure the next Farm Bill serves our Valley farmers, families, and communities. I hope that we can reach a bipartisan agreement on such a Farm Bill in the coming weeks.

From the Hill to the Mountains
  Bipartisan Effort to Direct Rural Broadband Funding to High-Cost Areas 
I was proud to join a group of bipartisan group of senators in writing a letter urging U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue to designate a high cost set aside within the e-Connectivity Pilot Program established in the Consolidated Appropriations Act to reach rural and geographically challenged areas of the country that need it most. According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), of the 24 million American households that do not have reliable, affordable, high-speed internet, 80 percent are located in rural areas.

NASA Facility to Potentially be Renamed for West Virginian, Katherine Johnson 
I applaud my Senate colleagues for passing this legislation, which I was proud to cosponsor, to rename Fairmont’s NASA IV&V facility. Not only did Katherine Johnson, broaden our nation’s perceived physical limitations with her contributions to the space program, she also broke down discriminatory barriers that stood in the way of so many other women and people of color advancing in the workplace. Katherine Johnson is one of West Virginia’s finest and a groundbreaking, brilliant mathematician. No individual is more worthy of this honor than her. Through her brilliance, strength, and courage, she proved to the country that anyone—regardless of race, gender, or background—can touch the stars.
The bill now heads to the House of Representatives for consideration.

How May We Help You?
Mr. George Bossie contacted our office requesting 203 West Virginia state flags.  He was going on a trip to visit his sister overseas and wanted to make the trip even more meaningful, so he mapped out the American Cemetery in Normandy, and decided he would take the flags and some West Virginia soil along with him to place on all of the graves of fallen West Virginia soldiers.  I was so pleased that my office was able to get him the flags and that he was able to honor our fallen heroes with such a special tribute.

Congressman Cook Votes for Comprehensive Bill to Combat the Opioid Crisis 
Congressman Paul Cook voted for HR 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act. The bill passed overwhelmingly.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), on average, 1,000 people are treated for opioid misuse in emergency departments per day and an average of 115 Americans die per day. The opioid crisis has also created a massive burden on our economy, causing the loss of almost 1 million workers between 1999 and 2015 and the loss of $702 billion in real output. 

HR 6 is a bipartisan bill that will advance treatment and recovery initiatives, improve prevention, protect our communities, and bolster efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl. 

Specifically, the bill includes several provisions, including:

Treatment and Recovery
- Improve and expand access to treatment and recovery services
- Provide incentives for enhanced care, coordination, and innovation
- Establish comprehensive opioid recovery centers 

Prevention
- Encourage non-addictive opioid alternatives to treat pain
- Improves data to identify and help at-risk patients
- Address high prescribing rate while enhancing prescription drug monitoring programs

Protecting Communities
- Give law enforcement tools to get dangerous drugs out of our communities
- Better intercept illicit opioids at international mail facilities
- Improve access to federal resources for local communities

Fighting Fentanyl
- Better tackle ever-changing synthetic drugs
- Crack down on foreign shipments of illicit drugs
- Provide grants for local communities to combat fentanyl

Congressman Cook said, “The opioid crisis has continued to spiral out of control, wreaking havoc on families and burdening the economy. This year, Congress has already passed an unprecedented amount of legislation targeting the opioid crisis and this bill is another important step. I look forward to this legislation becoming law.” 

For a complete look at legislation Congress has passed targeting the opioid crisis, please visit: energycommerce.house.gov/opioids-legislation/ 

Congressman Cook Votes to Protect Right to Vote for US Citizens
Congressman Paul Cook voted for H. Res 1071, which recognizes that allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of US citizens. The bill passed the House 279-72. 

Currently, the US Constitution prohibits discrimination in voting based on race, sex, poll taxes, and age. Federal law, meanwhile, prohibits non-citizens from voting in elections for federal office. However, in 2016, voters in the city of San Francisco approved a measure allowing non-citizens, including those without legal status, to vote in school board races.

Congressman Cook said, “The right to vote is one of the most important duties of being an American citizen. San Francisco has set a dangerous precedent by allowing people here illegally to affect governance for American citizens. This resolution sends a strong message that citizens alone enjoy the right to vote.” 

To view the full text of H. Res 1071, click here. 

Congressman Cook Votes for Critical National Security Funding 
Congressman Paul Cook voted for HR 6157, which funds our national defense through September of 2019. After clearing the Senate, the House voted for the bill overwhelmingly and it was signed by President Trump. This marks the first time in 22 years that this critical funding bill was passed on time to fund our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines. 

The legislation includes several important provisions:
	•	This bill supports our warfighters and includes a 2.6% pay increase for our troops – the largest pay raise for our brave men and women in nine years.
	•	Helps rebuild our Armed Forces by increasing funding for personnel requirements, operational needs, equipment upgrades, and support for key allies.
	•	Restores military readiness by fully funding training requirements, maintenance operations, and research and development into new technologies.
Congressman Cook said “I’m very pleased that Congress passed this vitally important bill to support our troops, military families, and retirees. Without this legislation, our national security would be at risk and we would leave our military ill-equipped to protect our way of life. Our troops defend our freedom every day, all around the world; they deserve the best and most modern technology to carry out their critical mission.""

U.S. Department of State High School Study Abroad Scholarships
￼
￼

I was pleased to hear that one outstanding student from Lee Vining High School in our very own district had been selected by the U.S. Department of State for the highly competitive merit-based scholarship Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange (CBYX). CBYX is a study abroad exchange program that gives participants the opportunity to study German culture and language.

The U.S. Department of State has created a variety of high school exchange programs funded through the Education and Cultural Exchanges (ECE) congressional appropriation. Each year, these high school exchange programs prepare over 1,000 young Americans to succeed on the 21st century's international stage by developing their foreign language skills, increasing their cross-cultural understanding, strengthening their leadership capacity, and fostering new academic insights and ambitions. Many exchange program alumni go on to pursue education and careers vital to the country's national security.

I strongly encourage all high school students to take part in this incredible opportunity organized by the U.S. Department of State. Studying abroad allows students to engage with local schools, communities, and share American culture and values while building long-lasting relationships in an educational and eye-opening environment.

High Desert Opportunity Summit: Education Fueling Economic Development
￼

￼
The new, one-day event will combine the 37th annual High Desert Opportunity conference with the VVC Foundation’s High Desert Economic Summit, usually held in the spring.

The conference will focus on marketing the High Desert region for business retention and attraction, while also featuring an economic forecast of the Victor Valley and Inland Empire Region.

This year’s conference will include an economic forecast and educate attendees about the economic future of the High Desert, Inland Empire and state as a whole.

Proceeds from the conference will benefit the Victor Valley College Foundation, which provides scholarship and grant opportunities to students at VVC.

The HDO conference has a long history in the area and was formally designed to draw business owners and site scouts from out of the area and introduce them to the benefits of expanding or relocating to the High Desert region.

Hultgren to Host Hunger Forum
￼

Our communities have worked to raise awareness of the problem of hunger in our region just as others have sought to bring attention to it on a worldwide level. Although the challenges to overcome hunger are daunting, they are not beyond our ability to confront and in many cases resolve them.
I will be hosting a forum, “Confronting the Scourge of Hunger”, which will focus on the issue of global hunger and hunger as experienced by many in our own region, and approaches to address and alleviate hunger both locally and globally.   
According the Northern Illinois Food Bank, nearly 600,000 people in northern Illinois rely on food pantries and meal programs to feed themselves and their families. I look forward to hearing about constructive approaches to address the scourge of hunger and expert insight into how we as a community, both locally as well as globally, can participate in finding solutions and helping those whose lives are afflicted by hunger.

10/2/18 15:28,how tax reform is making a difference in our community ,"
 
￼

Hello,
One of my favorite things about being home in Eastern Washington is getting to talk with so many people. As I listen to their stories, and hear from them directly, I'm constantly reminded that you just never know who you're going to meet -- and what their story is.
Since passing the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act last December, I have heard many stories from people who have hope and are optimistic again. Here are a few of the stories from right here at home about why Eastern Washington is Better Off Now thanks to tax reform and our growing economy:
	1.	The Tin Roof: Consumer confidence is at a near 18-year high. For this family-owned furniture store in Spokane, business is better. So they are purchasing two new trucks, increasing wages, and offering health insurance to their employees for the first time in nearly a decade.   
	2.	Home Depot: Employees at the Home Depot's 45 locations in Washington state, including in Spokane, received bonuses because of tax reform.   
	3.	Sonderen Packaging: As a result of tax reform, 90% of Americans saw their paychecks increase. That includes employees at Sonderen Packaging in Spokane, who saw their paychecks go up by $70-300 each month.   
	4.	Hope House: Because of tax reform, Hope House, a woman's shelter in Spokane, received $1 million from Premera Blue Cross to triple its capacity and help more women find permanent homes.   
	5.	Dry Fly Distilling: The owner of this small business said tax reform is responsible for a reduction in his Spokane distillery's production cost. As a result, he's investing in an expansion, special projects, and more jobs.    
	6.	""For me, they're not crumbs"": In February, a young woman from Spokane called to tell me that she was so excited to see $47.98 more in her paycheck each month. That is about $1,200 per year. She said, ""For me, they're not crumbs. It's more money to help me put food on the table. I'm so happy I wanted to tell everybody, the whole world, that these tax cuts work... I'm so excited.""   
	7.	Northwest Bancorp: INB banks in Spokane have raised their starting wage to $15 per hour and awarded $500 bonuses to each of their employees.   
	8.	Starbucks: Thanks to tax reform, Starbucks expanded its sick and parental leave policies for their employees. Now, working parents, like Brian in Spokane, have more flexibility at work to take care of their children.   
	9.	Children with Disabilities: One family told me they are seeing $400 more in their take home pay each month. This pay increase has made a real difference in helping them care for their daughter living with a disability.   
	10.	Vaagen Brothers: This family-owned lumber business logs and provides timber and is one of the largest employers in Colville. Because of tax reform, they gave pay raises not once, but TWICE, to their employees. 
In our community, Republican pro-growth policies are making a difference and improving people's lives. With more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks, families and workers in our community are Better Off Now.
Warmly, ￼ Cathy McMorris Rodgers Member of Congress  P.S. in case you missed my email last week: An accountant with decades of experience in Spokane ran his own analysis of Republican tax reform. He ran 30 scenarios of typical families in Eastern Washington, and found that every household type at every income level is saving money under the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act.  Click here to read more in the Spokesman-Review.

Last week, you received my message announcing my Fourth Annual Women’s Conference and Forum: “Breaking Through: Women Work For Change.” I also wanted to let you know that Delegate Danica Roem will be delivering this year’s keynote address.
Delegate Danica Roem represents the 13th District in the Virginia House of Delegates including the City of Manassas Park, Town of Haymarket, and Prince William County portions of Manassas and Gainesville. She is a 33-year-old step-mom, lifelong resident of Prince William County, and the former lead reporter of the Gainesville Times. She ran for office to bring a reporter's eye to Richmond and to speak truth to power.
Delegate Roem’s inspiring and transformative campaign gained national and international attention.  Her victory was secured by sticking to the issues that matter most to her constituents, and never shying away from standing up for justice.  As the first out transgender woman elected to a state legislature, she is blazing a new and unique trail.
During her first legislative session this year, she was proud to champion bills important to her constituents, and to help expand Medicaid to 400,000 people across the state of Virginia.  She continues to fight every day for her constituents in the 13th District.

Dear Friend,

With fall in full swing, our economy is looking better than ever.  By reforming our tax code and regulatory environment, we have grown our economy, given business owners the confidence needed to grow their businesses and hire new workers, and families have more money in their pockets—in fact, recent census data shows that between 2016 and 2017, the median income for households in our district rose 7.6 percent, or $5,463.  Those are real results that make a meaningful difference in the lives of families in our district. 
Fiscal Year 2019 Funding  Of all my responsibilities as a member of Congress, among the most important is ensuring that our men and women in uniform have the resources they need to successfully complete their mission.  Unfortunately, for the past 10 years, our military has been subjected to unstable and unpredictable funding, which has harmed readiness and contributed to unneeded risks and training accidents for our service members.  Last week, the House and the President acted to reverse that course.   
I was proud to support the Fiscal Year 2019 Department of Defense Appropriations bill, which was signed into law by President Trump.  It provides the funding needed to rebuild our military.  That includes replacing aging and broken planes that put service members at risk, and providing new ships, aircraft and tanks needed to confront emerging threats.  It also provides a 2.6 percent pay raise for our troops – the largest in nine years. 
As the House moves forward to complete the appropriations process for the remaining departments and agencies by years end, a number of issues will continue to be discussed, and I remain committed to fight for additional resources to strengthen border infrastructure.   
The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has existed for decades to ensure safety and efficiency in our nation's airspace, and after several weeks of negotiations, I’m proud to let you know that the House and Senate agreed on a bicameral, bipartisan multi-year reauthorization of the FAA. 
The measure supports American aviation jobs and will help drive innovation in the aviation sector.  The bill sets the stage for our country to be the leader in unmanned aircraft technology (UAS), and begins the process to integrate UAS devices into our airspace, and provides safeguards against errant UAS devices that could do us harm.  The measure also improves aviation safety and contains important consumer protections to protect you and your family from unfair practices—including limiting the involuntary bumping of passengers once they have boarded an aircraft.
Wildfire Preparedness Community Workshop 
Mark your calendar.  On October 18, 2018, the Ramona West End Fire Safe Council will be hosting a Wildfire Preparedness Community Workshop in partnership with Ramona Ranch Winery and Hatfield Creek Winery.  This is a free event, giving residents in our district an opportunity to connect with emergency first responders to better prepare businesses, residents and their families in the event of a wildfire.
This event is scheduled between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM at Ramona Community Library on Main Street (1275 Main St, Ramona, CA 92065).  To find this and even more information, including a link for registering, the Ramona Community Library has created a convenient and informational Facebook event page that you can access by clicking here. 
Why is this workshop important? It gives residents in our district an opportunity to meet, hear and question our local fire, law enforcement and animal service professionals to better prepare yourself and your loved ones for emergency fire response.  Topics include evacuation, emergency communications, emergency response, emergency preparedness, creating your own evacuation plan, and more.
Participants Include:  
	•	Bureau of Land Management
	•	CAL FIRE, Battalion Chief Randy Scales
	•	CAL FIRE/Ramona Fire, Battalion Chief Larry Converse
	•	California Highway Patrol
	•	SD County Fire Authority / Community Group Support, Bob Uribe

	•	Ramona Outback Amateur Radio Society (ROARS), Steve Sampson
	•	Ramona Sheriff’s Substation, Lt. Chris Davis
	•	Small Business Administration
I am supporting every effort to bring fire relief resources to California.  It is important that we continue to pursue legitimate fire prevention and control measures for public safety concerns such as access to communication and emergency services, particularly for disabled and senior citizens, that are far too often overlooked.

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
To help improve maternal and infant health outcomes, Senators Tammy Baldwin, Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Kamala Harris (D-CA) have introduced new legislation to reduce the United States’ rising maternal mortality rates and close the disparities that continue to put mothers and children of color at risk. 
“Wisconsin is seeing troubling increases in maternal and infant mortality, so we need to do everything we can to make sure women and families have access to quality, affordable health care,” said Senator Baldwin. “We know that healthier pregnancies lead to healthier babies. That’s why I’m proud to work on this important legislation by enhancing Medicaid and CHIP support so mothers and pregnant women can get the care they need at a price they can afford.”
Between 2000 and 2014 the maternal mortality rate in the United States has increased by 26 percent, while it has decreased in other developed countries. Stark disparities in maternal deaths exist, as black women are nearly four times as likely to die from childbirth complications as white women. Furthermore, for every woman who dies due to a pregnancy-related complication, dozens more suffer from severe maternal morbidity.    
The Maximizing Outcomes for Moms through Medicaid Improvement and Enhancement of Services (MOMMIES) Act would improve maternal health outcomes by enhancing coverage for pregnant women covered by Medicaid--which covers nearly half of all births in the United States. Specifically, the MOMMIES Act would improve maternal health outcomes by:  
	•	Extending Medicaid coverage for postpartum women to a full year after giving birth, rather than the current limit of 60 days that many women face
	•	Ensuring that all pregnant and postpartum women have full Medicaid coverage, rather than coverage that can be limited to pregnancy-related services
	•	Establishing a maternity care home demonstration project to study this innovative model of care in several states
	•	Extending the Affordable Care Act’s primary care bump to ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries have access to primary care and women’s health providers
	•	Encouraging increased access to doula care to provide pregnant women on Medicaid with emotional, physical, and informational support
	•	Studying telemedicine and its effectiveness and potential to improve Medicaid beneficiaries’ access to maternity care
Read more about the MOMMIES Act and see why the Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs, Black Mamas Matter Alliance, Black Women's Health Imperative, Center for Reproductive Rights, Every Mother Counts, In Our Own Voice, March of Dimes, MomsRising, National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum, National Health Law Program, National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, National Partnership for Women & Families and the National Women's Law Center all support the bill here.

10/2/18 12:43,"I Believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, And I Will Oppose Brett Kavanaugh’s Nomination","The Durbin Report: A message from Senator Richard J. Durbin
￼ 



Fellow Illinoisan, 
Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett Kavanaugh in a historic hearing.  As a member of the Committee, I took the responsibility of questioning Dr. Blasey Ford and Judge Kavanaugh seriously. 
Dr. Blasey Ford was credible, cooperative, and resolute in her testimony.  When I asked her directly, under oath, her degree of certainty that Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her, she responded, ""100 percent.""  She told us she had a responsibility as a citizen to come forward and tell her story.  She said she came forward because she wanted to be helpful to the Committee and to the nation. I believe her. 
The exchange I had with Judge Kavanaugh was an honest effort to loosen the Gordian Knot the Committee faces when two sworn witnesses are in direct contradiction.  I asked him if he would support a non-partisan FBI investigation, to let professional FBI investigators interview witnesses, connect the dots, and present their findings.  He refused, repeatedly.
There was a glaring difference between the witnesses last week: one person embraced a full FBI investigation, and one rejected it. Dr. Blasey Ford welcomed participation in a neutral investigation, while Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly denied my requests to submit to one.  
I have serious concerns about Judge Kavanaugh’s credibility, temperament, and judgment, and I will be voting no on his nomination to the Supreme Court.  I am encouraged that the FBI has now reopened its background investigation into the serious and credible allegations against him.  The American people deserve transparency and the truth. 
Sincerely, 
U.S. Senator Dick Durbin

Bob Makin, Bridgewater Courier News 
Published 8:00 a.m. ET Oct. 1, 2018
A final plan to clean up acid tars, benzene, and other chemicals at the American Cyanamid Superfund site in Bridgewater has been approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
The cleanup will cost $74 million, according to a news release issued by the federal agency.
￼
The remedy selected in this Record of Decision will clean up the two most contaminated impoundments in a manner that is protective of the Bridgewater community and the workers at the site,” said Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler in a statement released Friday. “This final cleanup plan reflects our commitment to prioritize the Superfund Program and ensure these sites are cleaned up as quickly and safely as possible.”
EPA Regional Administrator Pete Lopez added in a statement. “More than 44,000 tons of hazardous waste will be removed from the Bridgewater community and permanently destroyed. Approximately 2.3 million gallons of contaminated liquid will be collected and treated. This action safeguards people’s health and arrests a threat to the Raritan River.”
Both U.S. Rep Leonard Lance (R-7th) and Bridgewater Mayor Daniel J. Hayes Jr. expressed relief with the plan. 
“Bridgewater is counting on the EPA to remove these 44,000 tons of waste,"" said Lance, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, in a statement. ""These hazards need to be out of our community as soon as possible. I am pleased the EPA is implementing a final plan and moving forward in getting this job done. I believe the final plan to be responsible and the disposal of the approximately 2.3 million gallons of contaminated liquid will result in the contaminants’ safe removal and permanent destruction.”
Hayes added, “I am happy to see that the EPA has come to a community based resolution on the two most contaminated impoundments. Public safety remains our priority. We look forward to working with our partners EPA and Pfizer on cleaning up this site.”

Congresswoman Beatty Helps Secure Ohio School Safety Grant
This week, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a nearly $700,000 grant to the State of Ohio under the Student, Teachers, and Officers Preventing (STOP) School Violence Threat Assessment and Technology Reporting Program. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) joined by Congressman Steve Stivers (OH-15) led a letter on July 30, 2018, along with the entire Ohio Delegation, to the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance in support of the grant application.
Passed in March, the STOP School Violence Act created grant programs to train students, teachers, school officials, and local law enforcement how to identify and intervene early when signs of violence arise, create a coordinated reporting system, and implement FBI and Secret Service-based school threat assessment protocols to prevent school shootings before they happen.
“We owe it to every student, in every classroom across America, to do everything in our power to minimize the threat of gun violence,” Beatty said. “Unfortunately, many children and their parents are rightly concerned and are calling on Congress to act.” Beatty continued, “That is why I am proud to help lead the effort to secure the needed resources and support to ensure that Ohio’s schools are safer places of learning.”
“We are proud to work with Ohio’s Department of Education to help keep Ohio’s students safe and prevent violence before it happens,” said Mark Barden, the Co-Founder and Managing Director of Sandy Hook Promise and father of Daniel who was killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary tragedy. “The funding available under the STOP School Violence Act will build on our work in the state to train every school in our Safety Assessment and Intervention program that has proven to save lives. We are also thankful for the leadership of Representatives Stivers and Beatty, as well as the entire Ohio delegation, for their strong support of Ohio’s application.”
Specifically, the STOP School Violence Threat Assessment and Technology Reporting Program provides funding to develop threat assessment and crisis intervention teams, anonymous reporting systems, and training for students, school personnel and local law enforcement officers so they can partner in preventing violence events.

Friends -  
     I want to give you a quick update on Tax Reform 2.0, which passed through the U.S. House of Representatives last week. This includes three bills that make President Trump's tax cuts permanent, expands savings options for American families, and encourages small business innovation. This is a big win for all Americans. 
     Since passing historic tax cuts last year, we have seen a reignited American economy, millions of new jobs created, record low unemployment, bonuses, pay increases, and new investments across the country. American workers now keep more of their money, and Tax Reform 2.0 makes those tax cuts permanent.
     According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, locking in tax cuts for individuals and small businesses will create 1.5 million new jobs, boost wages by 0.9%, and increase long-run GDP growth by 2.2%. We're going to keep growing our economy and producing wins for American workers.
Here are some of the specific changes included in Tax Reform 2.0 that will benefit your family: 
Protecting Middle-Class Tax Cuts 
	•	Makes lower tax rates permanent for individual filers
	•	Locks in the enhanced Child Tax Credit
	•	Creates a Paid Family Leave Tax Credit
Promoting Family Savings 
	•	Allows small businesses to join together to create 401(k) plans to their workers
	•	Eliminates the age limit on IRA contributions
	•	Expands 529 Education savings accounts, allowing them to be used for apprenticeship fees, homeschooling costs, and paying off student debt
	•	Allows families to access retirement accounts without penalty when welcoming a new child by birth or adoption
	•	Creates a new Universal Savings Account (USA) to offer a flexible savings tool for families to use at any time
Encouraging Small Business Innovation 
	•	Allows new small businesses to write off more of their initial start-up costs
	•	Expands access to research & development credits for start-up businesses
  
     Please feel free to share this information with your friends and family by forwarding this email or clicking here to share on Facebook.  
     These reforms build on the successes of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act and major regulatory reform that has reignited our economy. We continue to push for conservative, pro-growth policies that create jobs and grow the economy. As Tax Reform 2.0 heads to the Senate, I am hopeful that it will be considered and passed quickly.
      As your Congressman, I am committed to transparency and open communications. Please visit my website, clayhiggins.house.gov, for all recent news from my office. It is an honor to serve you, and by extension, the Nation we all love. If there is anything that I can do to assist you, please contact my office. 
 
Sincerely,

10/2/18 10:48,National Cybersecurity Awareness Month,"News from Representative Tom Emmer
￼

Dear Friend,
In September, Congress took steps to meet the emerging needs of the future. While our nation is familiar with the risk of national security threats, both foreign and domestic, we may not envision them coming from the technology we use every single day. 
Last week, the House took a step forward to protect our nation from cyber attacks. I was proud to support the Public-Private Cybersecurity Cooperation Act (H.R. 6735). This legislation requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to institute a policy to allow for the reporting and subsequent resolution of security vulnerabilities. Upon implementation, the policy must be fully and completely reviewed by the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the General Services Administration, and non-governmental security researchers.
I will continue to support our nation’s efforts to defend against cybersecurity attacks. The threats of the future can be thwarted by a continually shared effort to identify risks and weaknesses. Our security is a shared responsibility; for information on how to identify a cyber-attack, visit the links below to do your part to keep our nation secure. October is National Cybersecurity Awareness Month - let’s renew our commitment to ensure the safety and security of our nation together.  
Sincerely,  ￼

Kansas Common Sense  October 1, 2018
Hello,
 
Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
 
New NAFTA Announcement is a Positive Development for Kansas
Over the past year and a half, I have expressed directly and repeatedly to President Trump, Ambassador Lighthizer, Secretary Ross and my colleagues in the Senate that we need more trade, not less. I have been clear that both Canada and Mexico – Kansas’ top two export markets – must be part of any final agreement. I appreciate the administration working to make certain these markets remain available to Kansas farmers, ranchers and manufacturers, providing them some much-needed certainty. I will further analyze the details of this agreement, but this announcement is clearly a positive development.

As I stated after meeting with Judge Kavanaugh in August, he is a well-qualified nominee with a deep respect for the Constitution, and I still believe that to be true. His intellect and extensive experience in the legal field will serve the Supreme Court well. I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as Justice Kavanaugh.
Delivering Remarks on Data Privacy and Questioning Tech Executives On Wednesday, I participated in a Senate Commerce Committee hearing with executives from Amazon, AT&T, Apple, Charter, Google and Twitter to discuss how new data privacy rules in Europe and California have impacted their companies and what they believe is needed in order to have effective data privacy standards. There are many opinions on how these standards ought to look, which is why I have been working with my colleagues to collect the thoughts of all interested parties, including consumer advocates, industry representatives and academics, to identify responsible federal privacy standards. 
As chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security, I am committed to ensuring that consumers’ personal data is protected from data misuse, while also establishing certainty for businesses to create jobs, innovate and compete domestically and internationally.

Questioning VA Secretary Wilkie on His First 60 Days on the Job I participated in a Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee hearing where VA Secretary Robert Wilkie testified on the State of the VA. Secretary Wilkie has served in this capacity for approximately 60 days, and has been charged with implementing many of the reforms that have been signed into law over the past year. Particularly of interest to me is his implementation of the VA MISSION Act that was signed into law in June. I worked hard to make certain critical reforms to the VA healthcare system were included in the MISSION Act, and on Wednesday I reminded Secretary Wilkie of my intent to work closely with the VA during the implementation process. We need to make certain the VA is adhering to the intent of Congress as it develops rules and regulations that will determine a veteran’s eligibility to receive care in their community under this program. 
I am pleased Secretary Wilkie is committed to making this program veteran-centric, and I look forward to continuing to work together to make certain the MISSION Act is easy to access and understand for the VA, veterans and community providers alike. To watch our exchange, click here.

Meeting with the 2018 Kansas Principal of the Year This week I met with Dr. Kristy Custer, the 2018 Kansas Principal of the Year and the principal of Complete High School in Maize USD #266. Complete High School is an alternative school designed to help students earn their diplomas through experiential learning. I am impressed by Dr. Custer’s passion for public education and her ability to positively impact students by fostering hands-on learning and job skills that a student can translate into a position in our nation’s workforce. Under Dr. Custer’s leadership, Complete High School Maize was named a 2015 National School of Character by the education non-profit, Character.org. Only 64 schools from 14 states earned this designation, which goes to schools that prioritize building strong character and morals into their curriculum. I’m encouraged by Dr. Custer’s continued values-based leadership, and appreciate her work to educate the next generations of Kansans.
  ￼ 
Spending Time with Advocates from the American Cancer Society I was pleased to have advocates from Kansas on behalf of the American Cancer Society in my Washington, D.C. office this week. During our meeting, we discussed important issues, including increases to the National Institutes of Health, that will drive cancer research forward and help develop improved treatments and cures that will improve patients’ lives. We also spoke about legislation I have cosponsored that will increase access to care, including the Colorectal Cancer Screening Act and the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training (PCHETA) Act. These bills will help improve insurance coverage for cancer screenings and raise awareness of how palliative and hospice care may factor in to a treatment regimen for someone suffering from cancer. I appreciate the conversation with the advocates from the American Cancer Society and look forward to continuing to find better treatments and a pathway to a cure for this tragic disease.
 ￼
Agreeing to Water Rights for the Kickapoo Tribe in Kansas On Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs approved my legislation, S. 2154, the Kickapoo Tribe in Kansas Water Rights Settlement Agreement Act, that affirms the water rights agreement made between the State of Kansas and the Kickapoo Tribe in Kansas in September 2016. After a decade of negotiations involving the State, the Tribe and various federal agencies, this settlement is a classic local solution to a local natural resource matter. Although more remains to be negotiated, including the Tribe’s water storage facilities, the committee’s action represents a significant step forward in providing the Kickapoo vital water security for its reservation and residents. I will continue to work toward its passage in the Senate.
Authoring Legislation to Protect Seniors from Scams
Senior citizens are among the most vulnerable consumers in this digital age – mistakenly falling victim to scammers that steal their money, identity and dignity. Now more than ever, it is imperative we bring industry leaders together to examine ways and propose actions American businesses can take to help educate the public, specifically senior citizens, on how to identify and avoid these harmful scams. 
Studies indicate scams like these cost older Americans as much as $36 billion each year, and many seniors are reluctant to report the crime. For this reason, I joined Senator Bob Casey (D-Penn.) to introduce the Senior Scams Prevention Act. This bill would create a federal advisory council charged with bringing together relevant government officials, industry representatives, advocates and consumers to develop educational materials for retailers, financial institutions and wire-transfer companies to use in an effort to stop scams that target seniors. As chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security, I am fully committed to making certain all Americans – especially senior citizens, are protected from those who wish to deceive them. To read more about my legislation, click here. 
Visiting with Students at Victoria High School Last week, I was in Victoria where I had the opportunity to tour the high school and visit with various student leaders, staff, faculty members and administration. I always value time spent with young people in our state, and my visit to Victoria was no different. I was pleased to hear updates on the new school year and fall sports teams. Thank you to Student Council Secretary Kali Weber, Student Council Vice President Ashlyn Windholz and Student Council President Ally Dinkel for the tour. Thanks also to Counselor Kori Braun, Principal Dylan Dronberger and Superintendent Kent Michael for helping arrange my visit.

Now Accepting Spring Internship Applications My own interest in public service was sparked by an internship for Kansas First District Congressman Keith Sebelius in 1974. As an intern, I had the chance to learn firsthand how a Congressional office operates and how the legislative process works. I am proud to be able to offer this same opportunity in my Senate office today, where I have interns year-round working closely with my staff on behalf of Kansans.  Applications for internships in my Washington, D.C. and Kansas offices for Spring 2018 are due Friday, October 19. Congressional internships are open to qualified undergraduate and graduate students who have an interest in public service and have achieved academic excellence. Click here for more information. 
Honored to Serve You in Washington
It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window          Click here to open a plain text version of this email
￼ 
Friends, 
As a society, our children are perhaps the greatest, most precious responsibility given to us. They are vulnerable, innocent, and wholly dependent upon the adults surrounding them for protection. While horrible and unthinkable, the unfortunate reality is that not everyone takes this responsibility seriously, and there are even those who would do children harm.
￼ 
The House of Representatives recently passed my bill, H.R. 6847, the Preventing Child Exploitation Act of 2018. This bill combines four pieces of legislation in an effort to fight the abuse and exploitation of children and strengthen protections for them under the law. I hope the Senate takes up this measure soon. 
In Congress, I am grateful to have the opportunity to serve on the Judiciary Committee where we have worked very diligently to combat crimes against children. In recent years, we have made remarkable progress in this fight – but we can, and we must, do more. I’m encouraged by House passage of the Preventing Child Exploitation Act, and I am hopeful that the Senate will act on this bill quickly to protect the most vulnerable among us. We must use every tool available to prevent horrific crimes against children.
You can read my weekly column about H.R. 6847 here. 
HOUSE VOTES TO FUND THE MILITARY 
￼ 
Big news: The President has signed legislation into law that fully funds our military for the entire fiscal year and ensures we remain the world’s leading fighting force. This defense funding bill also gives our troops their biggest pay raise in nine years. I was proud to support the bill in the House. 
TROY UNIVERSITY UPDATES 
￼ 
Troy University Athletics Director Jeremy McClain stopped by my office while in town for the LEAD1 Association conference last week. I was glad to receive an update on the many exciting developments happening on campus.  
Also last week, Troy University received $3.2 million from the National Institute of Standards and Technology to establish the Center for Materials and Manufacturing Sciences. This research center will focus on polymers in recycled materials and encourage students to develop new solutions within the plastics industry. We are so fortunate to have Troy University and all that it brings to the surrounding communities in AL-02!
AN ARMY AVIATION DISCUSSION IN DC

￼ 
Members of the National Independent Auto Dealers Association and the Alabama Automobile Dealers Association came by my office last week to discuss the automobile industry in Alabama.

The Webster Wire
Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends: 
Last Monday, I visited Nature Coast Ministries’ dental clinic. Nature Coast Ministries is a faith-based organization that assists families who are struggling in Citrus County. Dental experts volunteer their time to provide free dental services. 
 ￼ ￼ 
_______________
I believe we have an obligation to be good stewards of our land and resources.  Within my district are several facilities that are focused on providing goods or services that contribute to a more healthy, sustainable environment.  I toured one of these on Monday as well - the LKQ Corporation in Crystal River. This is a full-service recycling facility that has warehouses nationwide for used automotive parts. 
￼ 
_______________ 
At the end of last week, while most of America was focused on the action in the Senate, the House passed a series of bills, which we’re calling Tax Cuts 2.0. The Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act provides American families and small businesses the certainty  they need by making the individual tax cuts from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent. 
The American Innovation Act makes it easier for an entrepreneur to start a new business by providing a higher deduction threshold for start-up and organization costs in a business’ first year. Currently, taxpayers may deduct up to $5,000 in startup costs for new small businesses. This bill would allow entrepreneurs to deduct up to $20,000 in organizational costs during the business’ first year! This new threshold will give bright, ambitious entrepreneurs relief from tax burdens they currently face when trying to start a new business in America.
Tax reform 2.0 includes:   
	•	Lower individual rates of 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%.
	•	Doubling of the standard deduction to $12,000/$24,000, for single or joint filers, respectively.
	•	Doubling the Child Tax Credit to $2,000 with up to $1,400 refundable.
	•	Retention of popular deductions like mortgage interest (capped at $750,000 for new homes), state and local taxes (capped at $10,000), medical expenses, and charitable deductions.
	•	20% tax deduction for small business owners.
I voted for this bill because I believe taxpayer dollars do not belong to Washington.  They belong to hardworking Americans.  Americans – not Washington bureaucrats – best know how to spend it. I was pleased to vote for these tax cuts last year and I was thrilled to vote to make them permanent last week. 
After the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, unemployment is at a historic low, job openings are at record highs, paychecks are growing and wages are rising – along with economic optimism. Last Friday, we took the next step by passing this bill to make the tax cuts for individuals, families and small businesses permanent in law.
￼ 
_______________ 
Last week, Florida Auto and Truck Dealers came to my office to discuss legislation moving through Congress that would impact auto and truck dealers throughout Florida. International trade and self-driving vehicles were among topics we discussed. 
_______________ 
Wednesday, I met with the Florida Ports Council. We talked about ongoing issues facing Florida’s seaports. They thanked me for voting in favor of America’s Water Infrastructure Act, which will provide necessary funding for Florida’s ports and water infrastructure. Throughout my public service, I have advocated for policies that support local projects and find solutions that preserve and protect Florida’s precious natural resources, while balancing the needs of our growing economy. This bill does just that while also cutting red-tape regulatory burdens. 
_______________ 
Last week I was honored to receive the Taxpayers' Friend Award from the National Taxpayers Union (NTU). Every dollar spent in Washington is a dollar taken out of a hardworking American’s pocket. I ran for Congress pledging to get our fiscal house in order and get government off the backs of hardworking Americans and job creators. Last year, I voted to cut taxes and remove unfair and burdensome regulations on small business.  There is more work to be done, but today, hardworking Americans are keeping more of their money and small businesses are thriving like never before.  Job creators get to keep more of their hard-earned profits, allowing them to expand business, hire more people, pay better wages, and offer more generous benefits.
According to NTU, a member of Congress must have a voting record as one of the strongest supporters of responsible tax and spending policies to receive this award. I am one of only 66 House members to have earned the “Taxpayers’ Friend Award” for an outstanding voting record during the 2017 Congressional session.

Thursday, I met with Carolyn Quintanilla, Home Instead Senior Care Captain from Lecanto, FL. We discussed H.R. 6813, the Homecare for Senior Act introduced by my colleague Rep. Sam Johnson. I also learned about Home Instead’s efforts to treat seniors with dignity and respect through non-medical and personal care. Ensuring seniors have the health care they need and the choice they deserve at a price they can afford is a priority of mine.

Constituent Corner
A constituent from Fruitland Park contacted my office because Social Security did not transfer her benefits from her record to her late husband’s record. My office sent an inquiry to the local Social Security office and when alerted of the error, the local office contacted the constituent and resolved the issue. The constituent was appreciative of our fast action on her case.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.  
District Update
My Community Relations Representative, Cindy, participated in the Ocala Walk to End Alzheimer’s on Saturday. The Ocala Walk to End Alzheimer’s commemorates the lives of others who live on in our hearts and memories, and raise awareness for Alzheimer’s care, support, and research. More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s disease. Research funding has a direct impact on the lives of those suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and on their families. Investing in groundbreaking Alzheimer’s research is about improving the lives of loved ones afflicted with the disease.
￼ ￼ 
Pam, my Community Relations Representative, attended the 2018 SCARC, Inc. Annual Banquet to celebrate the contributions that individuals with special needs have had on our lives and community. Thank you to the SCARC, Inc. staff for the hard work you have invested to provide support and services to individuals with special needs.

Legislative Update 
Last week, the House passed a disaster preparedness package, H.R. 6378, which included a bipartisan bill I introduced with my colleague Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-MI): the Worse-Case Scenario Hospital Preparedness Act. As Floridians, we are all too aware of how hospitals and long-term care facilities are impacted during hurricanes and other natural disasters. These storms can be devastating to some of the most vulnerable members of our population. My bill is a much-needed first step to ensuring that hospitals and long-term care facilities across the nation are more resilient against natural disasters. 
My bill requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to engage with the National Academy of Medicine to conduct a comprehensive study into the future natural disaster threats impacting emergency preparedness procedures for hospitals, long-term care facilities, and other health care facilities. The study conducted will provide Congress with new recommendations and expert analysis on:
	•	current emergency preparedness policies and regulations
	•	identifying new policies that better address all future threats
	•	improving Federal grant programs to assist health care facilities
	•	providing updated guidelines for alternative power systems and access to clean water

Home       About Mark       Our District       How Can Mark Help You?       Legislation       Newsroom       Contact Mark        
Dear Lindsey: 
Last week, we were hard at work passing multiple bills to make our aviation system safer, address the opioid epidemic, recognize our nation's dedicated youth, and honor a former civil servant of the Richmond community. Also happening was the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing on the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. 
More on our legislative accomplishments and my position on the Kavanuaugh confirmation below.  

House Passes DeSaulnier Amendments to Address Aviation Safety in Bipartisan FAA Reauthorization
Following a series of high profile near misses across the country and in our backyard at SFO, we authored and passed four safety measures to help prevent runway accidents as part of the bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for five years.  Each of the amendments began with one goal in mind: to make our aviation system safer. While the FAA Reauthorization is a step in the right direction, there is more work to be done to address gaps in safety. We are drafting legislation that will enhance aviation safety and bring the industry in line with others that proactively plan for and minimize the human factors that can contribute to an accident. Click here, to learn more about our amendments.
The Mercury News: House passes aviation safety bill prompted by SFO close calls
￼ 
The overall bill (H.R. 302) provides much needed stability and certainty for the FAA, and also includes a number of important provisions on safety and passenger experience. In addition to our safety amendments, the bill will also require the FAA to establish minimum standards for seat dimensions on air craft, require new planes to be equipped with secondary barriers to the cockpit, and establish rest period requirements for flight attendants. I supported this bill, which passed the House by a vote of 398-to-23.  
Representatives DeSaulnier, Carter Pass Measure to Curb Fraudulent Prescriptions as Part of Bipartisan, Bicameral Opioid Package
Bipartisan legislation I authored with Congressman Earl L. ""Buddy"" Carter (R-GA), the only pharmacist in Congress, to empower pharmacists to exercise their right to deny suspected fraudulent prescriptions passed the House of Representatives as part of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6). This comprehensive package will address the growing opioid epidemic. I supported this legislation, which passed the House by a vote of 393-to-8. The bill has also passed the Senate and will be signed into law. Click here, to learn more about the bill.

Senate Committee Unanimously Passes DeSaulnier Bill to Rename Richmond Post Office The Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee unanimously passed our bill to rename the Nevin Avenue Post Office in Richmond, California as the ""Harold D. McCraw, Sr., Post Office Building."" Mr. McCraw was a dedicated public servant who embodied the culture of the Richmond community. Earlier this month, this bill (H.R. 606) was unanimously passed in the House of Representatives. It now must be voted on by the full Senate. Click here, to learn more about the bill. 
Legislation Authored by Representatives DeSaulnier and Brat to Renew the Congressional Award for Young Americans Passes House 
Bipartisan legislation I authored with Congressman Dave Brat (R-VA) to reauthorize the Congressional Award program passed the House and will be signed into law. The Congressional Award Foundation is Congress's only charity and the highest honor a Member of the House or Senate can present to a youth civilian. Since the program was established in 1979, young Americans have contributed over 8.5 million hours of public service to communities around the country. It is an important way to honor dedicated youth, and we encourage Contra Costa's young people, and others around the country, to participate in the program.

RECENT KEY VOTES
In addition to the above bills, the House also considered the following bills:
Tax 2.0 Package (H.R. 6757, H.R. 6760, H.R. 6756)
In yet another misguided move, Republicans advanced a bill that doubles down on their tax bill that put the ultra-rich and corporations over the middle class. This package, which was made up of three bills, permanently extends many of the harmful provisions in Republicans' original bill, further demonstrating their hypocrisy in only supporting increased spending when it benefits their wealthiest donors. I opposed this package, but unfortunately all three bills passed in the House.
Spending Package and Continuing Resolution (H.R. 6157)
Before the September 30th deadline, the House voted on a bill that would authorize spending for several government agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Defense (DOD). The HHS budget was better than in recent years, and I was pleased to see a $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Unfortunately, this bill was coupled with increased DOD spending, which once again adds funding prematurely before its audit is completed. After reports of $125 billion of waste at the DoD and years of repeatedly authorizing bloated defense budgets, I remain steadfast in opposing any increases for the Pentagon until the American people know the extent of the wasteful spending that has already begun to be uncovered. I opposed this bill, which passed by a vote of 361-to-61.

September Round Up
Dear Friends,
Autumn has arrived, and I’d like to share with you the important work I’m doing on your behalf. Right now, we have a real opportunity to build on the relief American families and businesses have experienced since the enactment of our tax legislation last year. Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we’ve experienced dramatic economic growth in our country that’s toppled records untouched since the Reagan Administration. Americans are seeing more money in their pockets, larger bonuses, improved benefits, and enhanced retirement packages. Companies are bringing back wealth from overseas, creating jobs, and investing in employees like never before.
From the start, I have called for legislation to make these middle-class tax cuts permanent, and I’m happy to report that, last week, I voted for legislation to do just that. The Tax 2.0 reform package will help unleash further economic development, wage growth, and tax savings for middle-class families and small businesses in Georgia by locking in the policies of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As a whole, H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018, will make it easier to create retirement plans for employees, help start-up businesses grow, and give families new tools to prepare for their future.
I’m glad that we now have one of the most competitive tax codes in the world, and it is imperative we keep it that way. I am grateful for the opportunity to help protect tax cuts for the countless folks who’ve told me firsthand how much they’ve already benefitted from this historic tax reform. Amid Democrats’ denial that our country’s economic boom comes as a result of tax cuts, you can count on me to continue standing against any proposals made to strip away our fairer, simpler tax code from the middle-class families and small business owners who have benefitted the most. Learn more about the Tax Reform 2.0 package here. 
On Wednesday, the House sent a clear message to any illegal immigrant in the United States, including those harbored in sanctuary cities, that they do not have the right to vote. As I have said before, being an American citizen comes with great responsibilities, and paramount among them is voting in our elections. For generations, brave men and women have fought and died in order to protect the fundamental right of American citizens to participate in free and fair elections. While the passage of this resolution is a critical starting point, we must do more to eliminate interference in our elections – at home and abroad. I will continue to push towards defunding municipalities and localities that allow noncitizens or illegal immigrants to vote in local or statewide elections.
Also on Wednesday, the House advanced H.R. 302, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Bill, which included my bill, H.R. 4467, the Strengthening Aviation Security Act, in the bundled package. As many of you know, aviation remains a top target for terrorists, and without question, there should be no stone left unturned when it comes to the safety and security of the American people. By integrating risk-based strategies into the process of determining which flights federal air marshals cover, we will better protect our Nation’s airspace and air travelers. Overall, I’m pleased this package reauthorizes federal aviation programs to modernize airport infrastructure, improve service for the flying public, enhance safety, and boost innovation in the aviation industry.
Ahead of the House Natural Resources Committee mark-up of my legislation, H.R. 6108, the Preserving America’s Battlefields Act, I proudly hosted an educational briefing with members of the American Battlefield Trust and the National Park Foundation. While there, we discussed the importance of the Battlefield Land Acquisition Grants Program, a successful dollar-for-dollar grants program that protects the preservation of Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and Civil War battlefields.
These hallowed grounds serve as educational reminders of our shared heritage for current and future generations of Americans. In Georgia’s 10th District alone, this valuable land grants program has been instrumental in the securing of 180 acres surrounding the battle site of Kettle Creek, the only significant patriot victory in Georgia during the Revolutionary War. I’m proud that my bill has enjoyed bipartisan support, as reflected by its unanimous passage out of committee last week, and I look forward to its consideration on the House Floor.

￼
Unfortunately, no community in the United States, including the 10th District of Georgia, is immune to the devastating effects of the opioid epidemic. On Friday, I proudly supported the Senate-amended version of H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities ACT, to help with efforts to put an end to this public health crisis. However, funding alone will not stop the opioid epidemic, we must also ensure that those struggling with addiction have ready access to quality treatment and recovery methods, while improving prevention, protecting communities, and bolstering efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl. 
Soon to be signed into law by President Trump, I’m proud this bill is the most significant Congressional effort against a single drug crisis in history. Together, through expanding access to proven treatments, a tough hand stopping the flow of drugs, and a compassionate approach to ensure families aren’t fighting this alone, we can overcome the opioid crisis and bring hope to struggling communities across our Nation. Learn more about our overall efforts here.
￼
Finally, before heading home, I introduced H.R. 6914, the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Expansion Act, to amend the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act (LEOSA), to provide active and qualified retired railroad police officers the ability to carry concealed firearms across state lines. With its establishment in 2004 and expansion in 2010, LEOSA has allowed eligible law enforcement personnel to carry concealed firearms but does not include all railway police. As we work to improve public safety, it is vital that we do everything we can to ensure the security of our transportation infrastructure – and railroad police play an integral part. I believe that my bill moves us one step closer to a safer transportation system and restores Second Amendment protections to those who keep our homeland secure. Read more about my new bill here.

Bringing Conservative Priorities to D.C.
As your representative, I’m committed to fighting for the conservative values of the 10th District up in Washington. As a result of last year’s historic tax reform, we’ve seen booming job growth and nearly unprecedented rates of unemployment, in addition to widespread benefits in nearly every sector of our economy. Because of my dedication to getting big government out of the way and allowing small businesses to thrive, I’ve been honored to receive a number of awards from groups promoting conservative principles. On Wednesday, I accepted the Guardian of Small Business Award from the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), which represents more than 350,000 companies across the United States.

Then, on Friday morning, I met with folks from the National Taxpayers Union (NTU) to be recognized as 2017 Taxpayers’ Friend Award. At the end of the day, tax reform is helping businesses big and small across the country and at home in Georgia’s 10th District, and I’m a staunch advocate of these policies in Congress.

Job Fair Friday
We are only days away from the 2018 Regional Job Fair, and I couldn’t be more excited about the hundreds of opportunities available to 10th District residents. Over the past few years, the State of Georgia has distinguished itself as a powerhouse for business with its growth in the industries of manufacturing, film, and tourism, and I want to thank everyone who continues to bring world-class employers directly to the folks on the ground. 
If you haven’t heard yet, the second annual job fair will take place this Friday, October 5th from 10:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. at Georgia Piedmont Technical College, Building D, located at 8100 Bobby Williams Parkway in Covington. Special this year are the “company highlight” rooms, where job seekers will learn more about the companies to which they will apply. The event will also incorporate free 20-25 minute continuing-education workshops on resume writing, interviewing skills, dressing for success, soft skills, and goal setting. 
There is no fee to participate, and advance registration is not required. For more information, including a list of employers who will be present, visit www.selectnewton.com/2018-job-fair.

TOP NEWS
Hice: Opportunities available at upcoming job fair Covington News – 9/29 Opportunity matters. That’s why I’ve always been a strong advocate of driving job creation, cutting taxes, and reducing regulations that fuel opportunity for all Americans. With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the trajectory of the economy has changed for the better — creating more than one million jobs nationwide, bigger paychecks, increased investment, and historic Main Street optimism, all while enhancing the economic security of hardworking families across the country. 
Walton job-seekers can get a ride to event Covington News – 9/29 “This grant is allowing the Walton County community to greater benefit from the event,” Dessa Morris, economic development coordinator for the Development Authority, said. Local companies that will be represented at the job fair include Shire PLC, Walmart Supply Chain and Distribution Center 6055, Dart Container, IsoNova Technologies and Masterack. Rep. Jody Hice, who has an office in Monroe and represents Walton County, is a partner in the event along with the Development Authority of Walton County and The Covington News.
Schedule set for second annual regional job fair Covington News – 9/29 The doors to Georgia Piedmont Technical College will open to the public at 10:30 a.m. Friday for the second annual Regional Job Fair with more than 50 businesses waiting to talk to perspective employees.  “We appreciate our partners in neighboring counties that provide support who are willing to come together for building a stellar workforce,” Serra P. Hall, Covington/Newton County Office of Economic Development senior project manager, said.  “The I-20 corridor is a special area with strong skill sets and incredible jobs.  The partnership here is unlike any other place in Georgia.”
Georgia delegation congressional voting Albany Herald – 9/30 Here’s a look at how Georgia members of Congress voted over the previous week. Along with roll call votes this week, the Senate also passed the Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act (H.R. 2259) to expand services and benefits for volunteers; a resolution (S. Res. 643) honoring the memory of the victims of the brutal and senseless attack at a country music festival in Las Vegas, Nev., last September, and the Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act (H.R. 4958) to increase, effective Dec. 1, the rates of compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the survivors of certain disabled veterans.  
WATCH: District 10 candidate Jody Hice WGXA – 9/27 Watch WGXA's interview with District 10 candidate Jody Hice by clicking on the black play button above.
Government Reorg Bill OK’d by Panel With Democrats’ Support Bloomberg Government – 9/27 The Office of Management and Budget on June 21 released a sweeping reorganization plan that included proposals to merge the Education and Labor departments, consolidate welfare programs and privatize the Postal Service and the Federal Aviation Administration. Companion legislation (H.R. 6787) was introduced on Sept. 12 by Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.), vice chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Government Operations.
Rep. Hice praised as Guardian of Small Business Covington News – 9/27 Congressman Jody Hice (R-GA) was named a “Guardian of Small Business” by the National Federation of Independent Business, a leading small business association representing 350,000 companies nationwide.  This award is the most prestigious honor that NFIB presents to Members of Congress in recognition of their efforts to support small business policies. Hice earned 100 percent for his voting record during the 115th Congress on NFIB's “How Congress Voted” scorecard.
Senate oversight committee settles differences with government reorganization bill Federal News Radio – 9/27 Reps. Jody Hice (R-Texas) and Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on government operations, introduced a companion bill last week. OMB Deputy Director for Management Margaret Weichert has said the administration identified 10-to-12 proposals from its reorganization plan that it can accomplish without Congress, though she wouldn’t — at least publicly — specify what many of those proposals were. At the same time, Congress is also broadly complicating the administration’s reorganization plans. Lawmakers included a provision in the 2018 omnibus spending package that prevented agencies from appropriations to “increase, eliminate or reduce funding for a program, project or activity” without earning congressional approval first, and similar provisions are in several 2019 appropriations bills.

Rounds Report: South Dakota Veterans Cemetery One Step Closer to Becoming Reality  October 1, 2018
Today, it was announced that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) signed off on the South Dakota state cemetery grant application, which puts our state on the priority list for grant funding to construct a state veterans cemetery in eastern South Dakota on land donated by the city of Sioux Falls. A grant could be awarded as early as next year. This is great news for South Dakota veterans and their families.
As a member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, this project has been a priority of mine, and I am happy to see it move forward. Once completed, this cemetery will not only serve as a final resting place for those who fought for our country, but it will be a place for all Americans to honor those who served. I thank the South Dakota Veterans Council, the South Dakota Department of Veterans Affairs and our local VSO chapters for their hard work on this important project.
Earlier this year, Governor Daugaard signed a bill to allow the state to apply to the National Cemetery Administration to construct a state veterans cemetery and set up an endowment fund to help pay the upfront costs of construction and maintenance. More information is available HERE.

NEWS FROM WASHINGTON AND ACROSS WEST TEXAS
Dear Friend, 
Throughout this year, our nation has seen tremendous growth. Much of which has come from the actions of both Congress and the Trump Administration to put forth pro-growth, America-first policies. That continued last week by passing Tax Reform 2.0 out of the House, fighting for the unborn, and fostering trade discussions.
Keeping More Money in Your Pocket 
Tax Reform has already paid off in big ways for the good people of West Texas. By allowing Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money, people have more resources to invest in their future and their family’s future. This week I joined my colleagues in the House to make the middle class and small business tax cuts permanent. By making tax relief permanent, we can continue to grow our economy in Texas, and Americans can keep more money in their pockets.
￼ 
Pro-Life Protections 
President Trump has led the most pro-life administration in history, and the Department of Health and Human Services recent decision to cancel an FDA contract funding research using human fetal tissue is another important step towards building a culture of life. I am proud to have joined over 80 of my colleagues in a letter urging the FDA to end this gruesome practice and to promote the dignity and sanctity of human life. See here for the Daily Signal’s write up on the resolution. 
Right to Vote 
On Wednesday of last week, the House passed a resolution with my support that states “allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens.” Unfortunately, over 140 of my Democrat colleagues decided not to support the measure, but rather sided with San Francisco’s recent action to allow illegal immigrants the right to vote.
Deployment to Employment 
We had a great panel discussion at the Texas Tribune Festival this past weekend on empowering our freedom fighters when returning from service. My legislation that recently passed the House, the Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William ‘Bill’ Mulder (Ret.) Transition Improvement Act of 2018, does just that by assisting our men and women in uniform transition from active duty to civilian life. Their skills and experiences are invaluable and are exactly what will help grow organizations throughout our nation.
￼ 
International Trade Partner 
The best way to address China and its unfair trade practices is to do more free trade with Vietnam, Japan, and other countries in the Pacific Rim. The Trump administration’s move to enter into trade talks with Japan is a win for American businesses and a win for American farmers, especially producers in West Texas. I will continue to fight for policies that restore fairness and balance to our trade relationships with other nations. See here for AP’s article on the move to increase free trade practices.   

Do you trust President Trump to even the playing field in trade with China and other countries?

Yes

No

This week, the United States Department of Justice ruled in favor of SSgt. Jacob McGreevey, a Marine veteran who had been illegally foreclosed on by a now-defunct mortgage lender eight years ago while on his third of four tours of duty. While I am very pleased with the outcome for SSgt. McGreevey’s case, current law still does not do enough to protect our veterans. Our servicemen and women have earned certain basic benefits like knowing that their families and their homes are taken care of while they are overseas. Last year, I introduced the HOMES Act to protect our fighting men and women from exploitation by unscrupulous lenders while they put their lives on the line in service to our country, to prevent future servicemembers from being unfairly placed in the same situation as SSgt. McGreevey. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) protects active duty servicemembers from civil obligations, like mortgage payments, leases, taxes, and credit card debt, while they are deployed. Under the SCRA, mortgage lenders are prohibited from foreclosing on active duty servicemembers. Unfortunately, the SCRA does not currently include a statute of limitations, leaving a gray area with much uncertainty for our servicemembers. My bipartisan HOMES Act would establish a national 10-year statute of limitations under the SCRA to protect our veterans and servicemembers. I remain committed to passing this legislation to ensure that what happened to SSgt. McGreevey does not happen again.

Last year, I worked to help secure grant funding for the Salem-Area Mass Transit District and this month, with a little help from the Federal Transit Administration, the transit district is replacing a number of their “Cherriots” with new buses that run on clean-burning compressed natural gas. I’ve always been proud of Oregon for leading with innovative improvements to our transportation and transit systems. I’m especially pleased to see these advances to the transit system in the Salem-Keizer region that not only support workers and businesses who rely on the system daily but also will reduce emissions and reduce the number of cars on the roads.

￼
￼
While more urban and suburban areas across the country, like Portland, have recovered from the 2008 recession, a lot of rural Oregon hasn’t seen the same kind of growth. Rural Americans are known for their hard work and grit, and when opportunity arises they always step up to the plate. In rural Oregon, we pride ourselves on our tight-knit communities that don’t just work hard, but work together. I know that if we can bring those traits to Congress, we can get a heck of a lot more done. This month, my Blue Dog Coalition released a policy agenda to stimulate growth and prosperity throughout our rural communities, focused on:
	•	strengthening the economy; 
	•	improving access to quality, affordable health care; 
	•	increasing skills- and trade-based educational opportunities; 
	•	supporting the unique needs of our rural veterans; 
	•	and expanding and updating our infrastructure across rural Oregon and rural America.
Breaking records every wildfire season has become the new norm across the West, and this year has been no exception. We’ve made a few positive strides in the fight against wildfire destruction during this Congress like passing my legislation to fix the broken system of “fire-borrowing” by treating wildfires like other natural disasters when wildfire suppression costs are exhausted. However, there’s still so much work in managing our forests and curbing wildfire destruction that needs to be addressed. This month, I joined my bipartisan Western Caucus in urging the Farm Bill Conferees to include active forest management provisions in the Farm Bill this year. While our wildfire disasters out West don’t typically receive the kind of national attention as other natural disasters, the current laissez-faire approach to forest management may soon force the nation to pay attention. Without better stewardship of our forests, they remain susceptible to insects and disease, leaving them ripe for catastrophic wildfires. 

￼
For nearly a year now, one of my top priorities has been looking into allegations raised in an investigative series produced by OPB into the Chemawa Indian School in Salem. Chemawa is one of only four federally funded, off-reservation Native American boarding schools in the country, and since OPB’s series started last fall, I’ve been calling for answers from Indian Affairs within the Department of Interior to questions around the allegations in the series. This month, I laid out my concerns and the many questions I still have around the school to Mark Mason on his show on 1190 KEX. Tune in here.  I also joined Terry Travis and Lori Raab on AM 860 The Answer’s “First Edition” mid-month to talk about my work in Congress to save the salmon runs along the Columbia River System, curb the destruction of wildfires, and break the partisan gridlock in Congress to focus on finding bipartisan solutions to the problems our communities are facing back at home. Tune in here.

Dear fellow South Carolinians,  Thank you for subscribing to my weekly e-newsletter, and please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.  
Statement on Nomination of Judge Kavanaugh  The past few weeks have been gut-wrenching for our nation, and the Ford and Kavanaugh families. We continue to confront how we can move forward as a society after looking the other way as women have been mistreated and abused for generations, and how that interacts with available evidence and the ability to determine culpability for past actions.  I have heard from so many female friends of mine over the past two weeks telling me their stories – things they might not ever have shared if we were not facing the current situation. There is no doubt that many women have been fearful, ashamed, humiliated, angry, or have had many other emotions that have led them to not tell their stories. I will never blame a victim for feeling this way – we should be supporting those who have been traumatized instead of constantly trying to tear them down. That has been occurring for decades, and we must look inward as a nation to both help create a society where women feel safe enough to share their stories and change our culture that has led to these heinous events occurring in the first place. We must learn from our past in order to build a safer future.  Part of learning from our past is doing everything we can to find the truth. Dr. Christine Blasey Ford offered compelling testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I commend her courage in coming before the world. Judge Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies the claims brought against him, leaving us in a situation where evidence is absolutely critical to determining what happened in this specific situation.  What the evidence shows us is that none of the witnesses provided by Dr. Ford can corroborate her story, or even basic events of the night in question. We also have an expert who has been prosecuting sex crimes for 25 years stating that ‘I do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the Committee.’   My heart breaks for Dr. Ford as she obviously still confronts a trauma that occurred while she was a teenager. However, none of the evidence we have points to Brett Kavanaugh as guilty of these crimes. Any lawyer will tell you that she said-he said situations are some of the hardest and most painful cases to review, and that remains true here.  An FBI investigation is an important step, and should be completed. Barring the discovery of any new information by the FBI investigation, I plan to vote for Brett Kavanaugh. This is not an easy decision, but the available evidence leads me to it. Even though this was not a criminal trial, I believe the freedoms granted by the constitution regarding proving guilt must still apply.  NAFTA Statement Today, I released the following statement regarding the trilateral trade deal between the United States, Mexico, and Canada:  “As I’ve said in the past, it is important for us to allow the President to have the flexibility and authority to negotiate better trade deals with our allies.  I applaud President Trump, Ambassador Lighthizer, Prime Minister Trudeau, President Peña Nieto, and President-elect López Obrador for taking the necessary steps to take on the status quo and work towards a better deal. Now that the full text is available for review, I look forward to closely examining the USMCA and ensuring that South Carolina’s workers, small businesses, farmers, and industries and auto manufacturers are given the opportunities to succeed under this new agreement.”  Looking Ahead: Opioid Crisis Response Act At the end of September, the United States Senate passed a sweeping package of bills to combat the opioid crisis plaguing the United States. Two of my own bills, aimed at strengthening family treatment and recovery, were included as part of the package:   The Supporting Family-Focused Residential Treatment Act (S. 2924): This bill calls on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop guidance for states on potential avenues for family-focused residential treatment programs and substance use disorder programs that allow children to remain with their parents or guardians during treatment.  The Improving Recovery and Reunifying Families Act (S. 2926): This bill would provide support and evaluation to projects using recovery coaching to help reunify families and protect children through HHS.   While we were faced with and continue to fight the challenges posed by Hurricane Florence back home in South Carolina, I am glad to see that the Senate continued its job in ensuring that our country’s families are equipped to combat the epidemic of opioid abuse. You can read more about the bill and my provisions here.   Congratulations to SC’s Principal of the Year Last week, I met with Dr. Lucas Clamp, South Carolina’s Principal of the Year! The students at River Bluff High School are blessed to have an amazing educator in Dr. Clamp, and I am grateful for his outstanding service to our students in the Midlands.

Dear Friend,  Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to read about some of last week’s highlights in Washington and here in Texas.  Improving Protections for Airline Passengers & Preparing for Natural Disasters  Last week, in the House we passed a bill that includes important changes to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as well as critical disaster reforms to help our communities better prepare for natural disasters like Hurricane Harvey. The FAA Reauthorization Act includes passenger protections for when we fly and improves airline and airport safety. It also reforms the federal process to ensure that a portion of the disaster assistance will now go to prevention projects to strengthen a community’s readiness for future disasters. The bill speeds up the inspection process for quicker recovery and rebuilding, increases transparency and oversight in the disaster assistance process and helps expedite assistance for folks getting FEMA aid. It passed the House with unanimous support and now heads to the Senate.  Lowering Costs for Prescription Medications  Complex DC regulations can end up forcing patients to pay more for prescriptions due restrictions that prevent pharmacists from telling you if paying out of pocket will lower your cost for medications. That’s why we acted to help by passing two bills to increase transparency and improve access to low cost medication for Americans. The first, the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, would lift a ban that prevents pharmacists from telling patients when they can save money by paying for medication out-of-pocket instead of through insurance. The second bill, the Know the Lowest Price Act, also allows pharmacists to tell patients when paying out of pocket will save them more money than going through insurance or Medicare. Both bills passed the Senate and House and head to the president for his signature.    Honoring the Memory of a WWII Hero  World War II veteran Joe H. Araki, proudly served in the 44nd Regiment. His unit, the 442nd, valiantly fought for America despite the fact that many of their families faced internment. They are the most decorated unit in American military history. Mr. Araki passed away and his funeral flag and other items were stolen from his wife. I was humbled to replace his funeral flag for his daughter and her family with one flown over the U.S. Capitol in his memory. We will never forget his service and sacrifice.   ￼  Rep. Olson presented Jo Ann Araki Mena and family members Martha Araki, Paul Mena & Curt Baxman a flag on behalf of her father, Joe H. Araki   Important Deadline for Academy Applications  If your high school student is interested in applying to one of our service academies for the fall of 2019, their three letters of recommendation must be postmarked by this Friday, October 5th. Please visit my website for more information and the application.   I’m honored to represent you in Congress.

Dear Friends, 
It is our solemn duty to keep Americans safe and support our troops. That is why I proudly supported last week's funding bill that continues to prioritize Americans’ health and safety, rebuilds our armed forces, restores our military readiness, and supports our troops and their families. In addition to funding these important priorities for our constituents, we are finally getting back on track by returning to regular order with the passage of this bill. In fact, this is the first time in a decade Congress has provided the funding our Department of Defense needs without the uncertainty of short-term funding.
This Congress has now passed the most of the 12 annual funding bills on time in 22 years. 
   
The Childhood Cancer STAR Act Fully Funded 
In June of this year, I stood with President Trump in the Oval Office as he signed my Childhood Cancer STAR Act into law. This is the most comprehensive piece of childhood cancer legislation ever passed by Congress, addressing four major aspects: Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research. Now, with the latest funding bill, I'm proud to say the STAR Act is fully funded.

￼ 
  
Rebuilding our Military & Supporting our Troops 
As I said, this is the first time in 10 years that the Department of Defense (DoD) has not relied on the inconsistencies of continuing resolutions for funding.  This latest funding bill provides the Pentagon with much-needed stability and predictability after years of short-term funding. It funds the DoD at over $600 billion, which is an additional $17 billion over current funding levels. Included in this funding is almost $100 billion to prepare and modernize our Armed Forces for the future of warfare, like the new Army Futures Command Center headquartered in Austin, TX. We also appropriated the largest pay raise in nine years for our troops and another $300 million for helping our veterans transition back into the workforce.

Combating Human Trafficking 
Human trafficking is a despicable multi-billion-dollar industry. It enslaves an estimated 25 million people worldwide, including more than 300,000 people in my home state of Texas – 80,000 of whom are minors. My committee held a hearing titled, “Hidden in Plain Sight: Understanding Federal Efforts to Stop Human Trafficking.” While I am proud of what we have accomplished, there is more work to be done. And I am eager to continue this fight with anyone who wants to stop human trafficking. This hearing gave us a chance to discuss innovative ways to continue our efforts.

My Two Bills to Combat Global Terrorism 
Two of my bills to combat global terrorism were passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week. Too often, when global crises emerge, the United States commits financial and other resources to immediately address the problem. While we must continue to tackle such imminent threats, we must do more to prevent threats from emerging in the first place. With the passage of today’s bills out of the committee, we are sending a clear message that the United States must be more proactive in addressing global state’s fragility and the emerging threats in Africa.
	•	H.R. 6018 – the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership Act of 2018, establishes an interagency program to assist countries in North and West Africa to improve immediate and long-term capabilities to counter terrorist threats.
	•	H.R. 5273 – the Global Fragility and Violence Reduction Act of 2018, promotes more effective development in fragile and unstable countries, addressing the conditions that create safe havens for terrorists, criminal networks, and war lords. It also develops a global initiative aimed at preventing the root causes of violence and instability in countries around the world.

￼  
First-Ever TSA Reauthorization  
The House passed a bipartisan five-year reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which included the first ever reauthorization of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). It comprehensively updates TSA’s mission and strategic planning, and ensures TSA has the right authorities to address today’s threats.  Better protecting Americans requires a holistic approach to security that is both risk-based and intelligence-driven. In this high threat environment facing airports and commercial aviation, terrorists continue to target the aviation sector, as we saw in Istanbul, Brussels, and the Sinai Peninsula. The measure passed by the House will play a crucial role in protecting hundreds of millions of air travelers in the United States and those flying home from abroad.
In total, there were 25 pieces of bipartisan legislation passed by my Committee included in the FAA package. 
  
 
Critical Countering Drone Legislation in the FAA Package
In a letter sent last month, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reiterated the department's need for new legal authorities to combat the growing threat from drones and other Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). With that in mind, the U.S. House of Representatives took a critical step by passing my legislation to protect our homeland from the growing threat posed by drones. My legislation strikes the right balance by providing DHS and DOJ with specific, credible authorities to take down a threatening drone while also protecting a lawful drone user’s privacy by limiting the geographic area where data may be collected and the circumstances of data maintained. It is vital that our laws keep pace with the evolving tactics used by our enemies to attack our homeland.
Last month, I wrote an op-ed with Congressman Steve Chabot about the need for this legislation. You can click here or on the image below to read that op-ed.

It was an honor to speak at the belated birthday celebration for the U.S. Coast Guard to honor their 228 years of service to our nation. You can click here or on the image below to watch a clip of my remarks.  
￼ 
Legislative Update 
Last week, the House passed a number of important pieces of legislation. Below are a few that you may be interested in. 
	•	H.R. 6740 – the Border Tunnel Task Force Act. This legislation would require DHS to establish an inter-agency task force to reduce cross-border tunnel threats and it would include personnel from Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.
	•	H.R. 6742 – the Secure Border Communications Act. This legislation would ensure that agents of U.S. Customs and Border Protection have devices that allow for secure two-way communication. 
	•	H.R. 6847 – the Preventing Child Exploitation Act of 2018. This legislation would develop and reinforce federal sex offenses by modifying Title 18 and the Adam Walsh Act.
	•	H.R. 6847– the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018. This legislation would make the tax reform package that Republicans passed earlier this year permanent. Ensuring that the tax cuts that families received are made permanent. 
	•	The House also passed a spending package to fund the Departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and will fund the government through December 7, 2018. 
This week, Members are in their districts for a District Work Period. For this reason, there are no votes currently scheduled in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
As always, I encourage you to visit my website, mccaul.house.gov, for more information on constituent services and legislative updates. Also, follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to get the latest updates on my work in Washington and the 10th District of Texas.

10/1/18 17:48,Violence Against Women Act Must Be Reauthorized,"￼
October 1, 2018
Dear Friend,
All people, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or ethnic background should have the same right to live free from domestic and sexual violence. The enactment of Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in 1994 was an acknowledgment of not only the significance of domestic and sexual violence, but also a commitment of resources to the courts, prosecutors, and law enforcement to ensure the prosecution of abusers and address the needs of victims. If VAWA lapses, 24 years of progress in recognizing and addressing the chronic violence experienced by women in the United States will be lost.
In 2013, when VAWA was reauthorized, I was proud to fight for key provisions to more effectively combat violence against all victims by increasing protections for Native American women, gay and lesbian victims, and battered immigrant women. The law was almost allowed to expire over the weekend and was only extended to December 7. We cannot continue to allow the needs of victims of domestic and sexual abuse to be secondary to political whims.
Instead of making reauthorizing VAWA a priority, Republicans have chosen to focus on confirming right-wing judges to the district and circuit courts rather than introduce legislation. They chose to further President Trump's agenda to dismantle the Affordable Care Act rather than protect women and girls from domestic and sexual violence. They chose to force through a Supreme Court nominee without full vetting rather than ensure the courts, prosecutors, and law enforcement continue to have the tools they need to prosecute abusers. They have attempted to silence victims rather than build on prior bipartisan legislation to give voice, protection, and assistance to victims. 
Congress has an opportunity to not only reauthorize VAWA before it expires, but also build on its success. We need to authorize more resources for preventing domestic and sexual violence, we need to improve the enforcement of protective orders to protect brave individuals who have come to the courts for help. A future VAWA should provide victims of abuse and violence with safe housing and economic stability programs to help them get back on their feet. Finally, we should continue the steps we have taken to protect Native American women and girls who face appalling levels of violence, exploitation, and murder by further increasing their access to justice and safety. 
We have an opportunity as a Congress to draw a line in the sand and to say we will as a society put all of the resources necessary to identify, address, and end violence and sexual abuse towards women and girls. We have an opportunity to say to offenders these actions are unacceptable and you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. We have an opportunity to say to our children you have the right to grow up free of being victimized. We need make these issues a priority now and not let this opportunity slip again. The Violence Against Women Act must be reauthorized and strengthened without delay. 
Sincerely,
￼

Nolan's Airline Consumer Rights Measures Pass House as Part of FAA Reauthorization Bill 
Bill also includes Nolan's amendment to help community airports expand service to new areas
￼  My successful amendment to the FAA Reauthorization Act requires U.S. airlines to provide a simple, one-page explanation of passenger rights when flights are cancelled or delayed, when bags are lost, or when other problems occur. European Union nations instituted a similar requirement many years ago.  
Dear Friend, 
With the Holiday traveling season approaching fast, U.S. airline passengers got a big win last week as the House passed my bipartisan amendment requiring airlines to provide a simple one-page explanation of their consumer rights. Coming as part of the bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), this is a long overdue, common sense fix will make airline travel a little easier for everyone.   The FAA bill also included my amendment to fully fund at $10 million the Small Community Air Service Development Program, which helps airports like Duluth International and regional airports like those in Brainerd, Bemidji, International Falls and Hibbing-Chisholm boost good-paying jobs, commerce, and tourism by connecting with markets where access to the national air transportation system is limited.   Similar to what the European Union has required from airlines for years, the passenger rights “one-pager” will be widely available at airports and online, and explain rights and compensation when flights are cancelled or delayed, when passengers are denied boarding due to overbooking, or when bags are lost. It will also include the rights of those traveling with limited mobility due to illness or injury.  As you may recall, the amendment arose from a hearing I requested last spring to investigate mounting consumer complaints against the airlines. During the hearing, consumer representatives pointed out that many major airlines bury their consumer protection policies amidst 37,000 pages of online gobbledygook that would require a team of high-priced lawyers to translate.  It’s also important to note that the final FAA bill did NOT include a risky Republican plan – which Democrats fought tooth and nail – to privatize Air Traffic Control and turn billions of dollars in taxpayer's money and assets over to profiteers to run our nation's airspace operations.    This GOP plan would have turned over, free of charge, all federal air traffic control facilities and equipment to private, for-profit corporations bent on cutting costs and rewarding investors – not protecting the public interest. Some 32,000 hard working, highly trained Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) employees would have transferred to the private sector, with their jobs in question.   As I've noted many times before, even when you're stuck in the middle seat in the back of the plane, you have to admit that American aviation is pretty amazing. On any given day, the FAA and the nation's air traffic controllers safely handle about 65,000 flights carrying some 2 million passengers; 740 million passengers every year. That's nothing short of remarkable.  
We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email.

Nolan Provision to Advance Opioid Recovery Passes House
￼  My successful provision to the bipartisan SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6) will allow pharmacists and physicians to team up and ensure that patients can safely receive new, long-lasting injectable forms of medication to help with their recovery from opioid addiction. 
Opioid abuse kills some 43,000 Americans every year, but last week, we took an important step toward reducing that terrible number and saving precious lives. As part of a larger bipartisan package of opioid-related measures designed to expand access to treatment, the House passed my provision to allow pharmacists and physicians to team up and ensure that patients can safely receive new, long-lasting injectible forms of medication to help with their recovery from opioid addiction.   By way of background, current law stipulates that pharmacists can only dispense these medications directly to patients –not physicians. Our provision changes the Controlled Substances Act to allow pharmacists to dispense these treatments directly to doctors, who can then administer the treatment to the patient in an office setting coupled with behavioral counseling and therapy. That way, patients can be assured a safe, steady dosage of medicine.  

Nolan Introduces ""No Shame - No Blame"" Bill to Ban Student Lunch Shaming and Hold Districts Accountable  
￼  Under this measure, no student would ever be publicly humiliated or punished in a school cafeteria – or anywhere else – because their parents can’t afford to pay for their meal. No student would ever be denied the ability to participate in extracurricular activities, made to wear wristbands, or have their lunch thrown out as their friends look on. 
With some 54 million elementary and secondary students now back in school, I have just introduced the “No Shame-No Blame Act of 2018” to make the terrible and unnecessary practice of student “lunch shaming” a violation of federal law.   Under this measure, no student would ever be publicly humiliated or punished in a school cafeteria – or anywhere else – because their parents can’t afford to pay for their meal.  No student would ever be denied the ability to participate in extracurricular school activities, made to wear wristbands, or have their lunch thrown out as their friends look on.   Good nutrition and successful kids go hand in hand. But for many students across the country, lunch shaming stands between them and their only good meal of the day. So our measure would require school districts violating the law to use excess school administrative funds to pay off and forgive student lunch debt when families can’t afford to pay.    In addition, the No Shame-No Blame Act does four more things: 
1. Requires all communications relating to debts be directed to the parent or guardian – not the student.  2. Stipulates that school districts review, publish, and distribute – on an annual basis – the policy guidelines relating to school lunch debts, insufficient funds to purchase meals, available meals, and food programs or resources.  3. Mandates that each state submit to the Department of Education a list of any violation by a school or school district, as well as the amount of student meal debt accumulated over the previous school year.   4. Orders the Secretary of Education to publish a list of those violations online via the Department’s website. 
Meanwhile, we are still working hard to build support for House Resolution 913, to put Congress on record in support of a federal, publicly funded program to provide every child with a school lunch, free of charge.  

GOP Leaders Fail to Reauthorize Land and Water Conservation Fund 
￼  Since Congress established the Land & Water Conservation Fund in 1965, Minnesota has received an inflation-adjusted $220 million to help expand access to public lands for hunting, fishing, boating and recreation.   
Shame on Republican leaders for failing to allow the House to take up reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), allowing the 53-year-old program to expire over the weekend.   Widely recognized as one of the nation’s most successful outdoor recreation and conservation programs, the fund doesn’t cost taxpayers a dime. Instead, it takes $900 million in annual royalties oil and gas companies pay to drill on the Outer Continental Shelf - and invests that money to expand access to public lands for hunting and recreation, conserve natural habitat, build and repair local parks and playgrounds, and acquire historic sites, including battlefields of the Civil War, the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.   In fact, since Congress established the fund in 1965, Minnesota has received an inflation-adjusted $220 million – with many of the grants matched by state and local money – helping generate thousands of good-paying jobs in our multi-billion dollar tourist and hospitality industry.   Make no mistake – I will be helping to lead the fight to quickly reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund, as well as pass legislation I have cosponsored to make the authorization permanent. 

GRANT WATCH:$55,571 to Help Homeless Native American Veterans 
￼  Under our watch, Minnesota’s 8th District has received more than $1.2 billion in federal grants for projects that create good paying jobs and make life better for people. 
We were pleased to announce more important grants for Minnesota's 8th district last week. 
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) - via the Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) - announced that the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe Housing Authority will receive a $55,571 grant renewal to help homeless Native American Veterans connect with resources to assist in ending their homelessness.  
￼  
The HUD-VASH program will provide rental assistance and supportive services to Native American Veterans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness living on or near a reservation or other Tribal areas.
Veterans have answered our Nation’s call to serve. In return, advocates in Housing and Urban Development, the Veterans Administration, and our office are answering their calls when they need help. 
To help keep you updated, we will be using the Monday Report to highlight important federal grants for the 8th District. 

Our Week in DC
￼  Volunteers representing the American Cancer Society - Cancer Action Network were out in D.C. meeting with their respective Members of Congress advocating for increased funding and awareness to fund treatments to fight and ultimately cure cancer. Nolan Legislative Director Will Mitchell met with volunteers to discuss efforts I am taking to combat the cancer epidemic. 
￼  The Cooperative Alliance for Refuge Enhancement (CARE) held a congressional expo at the House Rayburn Office Building last week to illustrate the importance of programs such as the National Wildlife Refuge System. This vast system of public lands and waters offers Americans a place to hunt, fish, hike, and watch wildlife. Jennie McNicoll, of the National Wildlife Refuge, is pictured here showing off a Western Screech Owl, native to North and Central America.
Our Week in Two Harbors
￼  Hats off to the Lake County Sex Trafficking Task Force for their hard work and dedication in developing the “End the Demand” campaign and unveiling a billboard on Highway 61, south of Two Harbors, drawing attention to the terrible scourge of sex trafficking. On any given day, this plague on our society threatens and victimizes an estimated 250,000 children – most of whom are young girls between the ages of 12 and 14. We need to put a stop to it, and in doing so extend Minnesota’s model of treating these young people as the victims they are and not as criminals. Pictured here is District 3B Minnesota State Representative Mary Murphy addressing the group on efforts the Minnesota House of Representatives is taking to put an end to sex trafficking. Nolan District Director Jeff Anderson attended this event on my behalf and spoke to the group.  
Our Week in North Branch 
￼  Tiffany Determan - the Isanti County Soil Water Conservation District Director - led a meeting on developing a watershed conservation plan at the North Branch Library last week. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen attended on my behalf. 
￼  GPS 45:93 - a Regional Economic Development Organization - held their annual meeting at Lakes EMS in North Branch. President of the organization, Nancy Hoffman, updated members of the organization on several economic development related topics. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen attended the meeting. 
Our Week in Taylor Falls 
￼  Every year the Chisago County Enviromental Services hosts a 'Water Festival' for every 5th grader in the county. Public, private and home schooled students attend. Students learn about the importance of water. Pictured above Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen is teaching a group about “The Secret Insides of Fish.” The Minnesota DNR donated some Carp and Northern Pike that Olseen dissected with the students as they learned about the fish and how their internal organs work. 
Our Week in Grand Rapids  
￼  The Minnesota Assistance Council for Veterans (MACV) held a StandDown in Grand Rapids for area military Veterans. The event provides dozens of resources to our Veterans including free lunch, haircuts, VA benefit assistance, legal aid, housing information and so much more. Our military Veterans and their families deserve nothing but the best from our state and federal government and MACV plays a crucial role in making sure that happens. Pictured left to right: Paul Pederson, Mac-V Outreach Director; Jerry Nurnberger, U.S. Army Retired Specialist 4th Class; Ken Merwin, U.S. Army Retired Private First Class; Willy Nuorala, U.S. Army Retired Sergeant E-5; Luke St. Germain, Itasca County Veteran Service Officer.
Our Week in Chisholm 
￼  Hundreds of teachers, local residents, elected officials, and community leaders gathered at the Minnesota Discovery Center in Chisholm to rally for a fair contract. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tom Whiteside attended the rally and captured this photo. 
Our Week in Nashwauk  
￼  It was a standing room only at a Cloverdale Town Hall meeting on Monday where Governor Mark Dayton and Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Tom Landwehr addressed hundreds of local residents, elected officials, business representatives, and Steelworkers - packed into the meeting hall - about the future of iron ore mining at the former Essar Steel Minnesota project site in Nashwauk. My Congressional Field Representative Tom Whiteside attended the meeting and captured this photo of Governor Dayton answering questions from the audience. I continue to monitor the economic well-being of the 8th Congressional District and projects such as this. 

Finally...
Ely Native Earns Spot in the Guinness Book of World Records!
￼  Ely native Daniel Dremel is pictured here carrying a canoe above his head as he competes in the 2018 Ely Full Marathon Canoe Portage Division, which consists of 26.2 miles of winding trails and beautiful views. Photo credit: Ely Echo. 
There are lots of ways to get in the famous Guinness Book of World Records and none of them are easy. Ely's Daniel Drehmel knows that's true after he set the WORLD RECORD competing in the 26.2 mile Ely Full Marathon last week - while carrying a canoe! Drehmel finished the race in 5 hours 23 minutes and 48 seconds. That's quite the achievement! Congratulations to all of the 2018 Ely Marathon participants and event coordinators for another great year!

Valley Fever Awareness Week
October 1st - 5th

In celebrating Valley Fever awareness this week, I wanted to provide a recap of the past two months which have been heavily focused on Valley Fever research. As a member of the Arizona delegation and co-chair of the Valley Fever Task Force, this issue is at the forefront of my priority list. 

The statistics below show the effect of the endemic disease on Arizonans. Valley Fever occurrences continue to be on the rise with over two-thirds of reported cases in Arizona. 

￼


The FORWARD Act

This July, I joined Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, as co-chairs of the Valley Fever Task Force, to introduce H.R. 6562, the Finding Orphan-disease Remedies With Antifungal Research and Development (FORWARD) Act. The FORWARD Act is designed to strength endemic fungal disease research and help bring new fungal diagnostics, antifungal treatments, and eventually a fungal vaccine to patients. 

This legislation also represents a breakthrough for medical research; Section 9 of the FORWARD Act establishes a blockchain pilot to ensure Valley Fever researchers have access to robust clinical data without compromising patient privacy. 

The graphic below provides a concise description of how the pilot will operate, ensuring data accessibility and security. I am proud to sponsor this legislation, which will support Arizona and other states in their continued efforts to fight endemic fungal diseases, including Valley Fever!

Dear Friends, 
I hope your week is going well. I have some exciting news that I'd like to share with you: the House of Representatives unanimously passed my resolution requesting that the Secretary of the Interior recognize the rich history of the logging industry and the importance of lumberjack sports by adding the Lumberjack Bowl in Hayward to the National Register of Historic Places. 
The Bowl has been the home to the celebration of lumberjack sports for almost 60 years, and it deserves recognition as a special place in Wisconsin's culture. 
I'm proud that both Democrats and Republicans came together to pass my resolution.  Click HERE or the image below to watch a short video from the Bowl when I introduced the resolution in 2017. 
￼ 
 Why People Are So Confident In Our Economy   I've worked my heart out to push for pro-growth reforms. Whether it's tax reform that allows you and your family to keep more of your hard-earned money, or instituting smart regulations so that small businesses are incentivized to hire more workers and grow, these pro-growth policies have helped the economy to soar. As a result, the American people are more are confident in the economy now than at any point in the last 18 years!   Click HERE or the image below to ""like"" and share the good news!

10/1/18 16:56,Notes from the Ninth: Snapshots of September,"￼ 


Hoosiers,  Every day, 115 Americans die after overdosing on opioids - neighbors, friends, mothers, fathers, sisters, and brothers. There are so many stories across Indiana about people who have been affected by the opioid crisis, which is why last week, I proudly supported the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6).   This bipartisan bill will help in our overall efforts to fight the opioid epidemic by:
	•	Improving and expanding access to treatment and recovery services.   
	•	Encouraging non-addictive opioid alternatives to treat pain.   
	•	Giving law enforcement tools to get dangerous drugs out of our communities.   
	•	Cracking down on foreign shipments of illicit drugs. 
Additionally, I supported the Tax Reform 2.0 legislation that passed the house last week. Click here to learn about how this package locks in tax reforms to protect middle-class and small business tax cuts, promotes family savings, and advances the next generation of entrepreneurs. 


Be of good cheer,
￼


 Hearing from Hoosiers

￼
Serving those who served. Thank you to the veteran service officers and healthcare providers for joining me for a roundtable discussion in Bedford. Too often, our veterans have to drive far distances for VA care, making it difficult for some to access care easily. 

Our roundtable's discussion on expanding access to quality health care, particularly for those in rural communities who do not live in proximity to a VA facility, was an important step in ensuring care for our veterans. 

￼
Celebrating 30 Years. In Charlestown, DA Autotechnology celebrated its 30 year anniversary in September. DA Inc. was first established in Indiana in 1988 and recently in 2016 launched its new manufacturing headquarters in Charlestown. Congratulations to all the hardworking men and women at DA Auto for 30 successful years!

￼
Charlestown Public Library. June has been a leader at the Charlestown-Clark County Public Library for over 30 years. Thanks for sitting down with me to discuss how our community libraries can offer increased access to high-speed internet and technology for Hoosiers. 

￼
Growing Main Street. Great coffee and conversation at the grand opening of Main & Madison Cafe in Franklin. Congratulations Amy and Stephanie!

￼
Solving the labor shortage. Businesses, manufacturers, and employers across Indiana are facing a common problem: they can't find enough people to fill their open jobs. Thank you Express Employment Professionals for having me in to share your unique perspective regarding the labor shortage and how we can work toward a solution. 

￼
Farmer roundtable. Had a great roundtable with Hoosier farmers in Johnson County and discussion on issues facing Indiana agriculture operations, trade, immigration, and the 2018 Farm Bill. Click here to learn more about what we discussed. 

￼
Thank you, Elmo. Meet Elmo Young: a veteran from Bloomington who selflessly served this country on the front lines of Germany during World War II. On September 4th, I was honored to attend his medal ceremony, where Brigadier General Tim Thombleson, Assistant Adjutant General, Indiana National Guard, presented the medals that Elmo earned in his brave service.

￼

Dear Friends, 
Last week was packed-full of activity as the House worked to finish its work during the last week in DC before the November 6 election. On the legislative front, a bipartisan bill I introduced to help small businesses access federal contracts was voted on and passed the House. I also joined several colleagues to introduce bicameral and bipartisan legislation to help the victims of human trafficking. And I introduced bipartisan legislation to ensure the United States fully considers the national security implications of a Saudi nuclear technology transfer.
Separately, I was pleased to vote for a bipartisan package to address the opioid epidemic ravaging communities across our country. The bill will expand access to treatment and recovery services, develop non-opioid alternatives for pain treatment, improve interception of illegal opioids at mail facilities, and combat the rise of fentanyl. We have more to do, but this bipartisan package is a good start.
Please continue reading for information on a new bill I introduced to help prevent irritating scam calls, a readout of our first ever “Tenth District Day” with local elected officials, and three opportunities to meet in person this week in Northbrook, Waukegan, and Highwood. 
  
CRACKDOWN ON PHONE SCAMMERS 
  
￼ 
Annoyed by constant scam calls? You’re not alone. These calls are more than just an annoyance, and because scammers have the ability to impersonate local numbers, the risk of dangerous fraud is getting worse, especially for seniors.
Last week, I introduced the Discourage Dishonest Dialing Act to shift the power back to customers by making it easier to recognize and ignore these bothersome interruptions. Since many telephone scammers use technology to modify what phone numbers appear on caller ID to impersonate a local number, the Discourage Dishonest Dialing Act, would require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish rules for alerting telephone subscribers when caller identification information cannot be confirmed. Making consumers aware when a “neighbor spoofing” call is inbound gives customers the power to ignore these intrusions and discourage their use by scam artists. Hopefully cracking down on unethical scammers and pushy telemarketers is something even this divided Congress can agree on.
Learn more about the Discourage Dishonest Dialing Act? 
  
CONNECTING OUR COMMUNITIES WITH FEDERAL GRANTS 
  
￼ 
On Friday, I hosted local elected officials for the inaugural “Tenth District Day.” This program provided the chance to meet with federal agencies including HHS, FEMA, SBA, EDA, DOT, and HUD to discuss resources and services available for our local communities.
Our office is here to be a resource and advocate for our local communities at the federal level. This year alone, communities and organizations throughout the Tenth District have been awarded more than $42 million in competitive federal grants. I was glad to organize the one day program to help our local officials better understand how to pursue even more opportunities. I look forward to hopefully having even more local leaders join us next year.
Learn more about Tenth District Day on our website. 
  
THREE OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET IN PERSON THIS WEEK: NEIGHBORHOOD OFFICE HOURS & CONGRESS ON YOUR CORNER 
￼ 
  
On Wednesday and Thursday, I’ll be participating in our Neighborhood Office Hours with our constituent service representatives in Waukegan and Northbrook. This is an opportunity to meet one on one to hear about the issues that matter to you and your family, or to meet with a caseworker from our office about an issue with a federal agency. 
￼ 
  
Then, on Saturday, I’ll be hosting our next Congress on Your Corner town hall at the Highwood Public Library – the 28th we’ve held so far this term. I look forward to seeing you there and answering your questions! 
  
CONGRESSIONAL APP CHALLENGE DEADLINE APPROACHING – OCTOBER 15 
  
The Congressional App Challenge national contest encourages middle and high school students to learn science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills by coding their own app for any digital device.
The Challenge is open to all middle and high school students who live or attend school in the Tenth District, regardless of skill level. Students can choose to participate individually or as part of a team of up to 4 students, as long as two of the team members meet eligibility requirements.
To enter, participants must upload a video showcasing their app and an explanation of what they learned throughout the app-making process. 
App submissions will be accepted through Noon EST, Monday, October 15, 2018. Try to register before September 10, 2018 (registration indicates your intent to compete). Early registration significantly increases the chances for a successful challenge. Early registration does not obligate you to submit an app.
I can’t wait to see what you create! 
More information is available on our website. 
  
WE’RE STILL WELCOMING PARTICIPANTS IN BRAD’S BOOKWORMS ELEMENTARY READING PROGRAM 
￼ 
  
We’re excited to be in the middle of our second year of “Brad’s Bookworms,” a challenge to encourage elementary age reading in K-5 students.
Children participating in the program are asked to read and log 10 books with help from parents, grandparents, older siblings, or other family members between June 21 and November 30, 2018, and track their progress toward this goal. Young people who meet the 10 books goal will be invited with their families to a recognition ceremony with Congressman Schneider in December 2018 to celebrate their achievement.
Learn more about Brad’s Bookworms on our website.

Appalachia: Cradle of Music
A recent award ceremony including a Southwest Virginian at the Library of Congress reminded me of our region’s rich musical heritage. The course of American music was shaped by traditions, people, and places found within the borders of Virginia’s Ninth District.
The Southwest Virginian honored in Washington is Eddie Bond of Fries, among the foremost practitioners of old-time fiddling. In June of this year, the National Endowment of the Arts (NEA) announced that he won a National Heritage Fellowship. The NEA bestows this award for great artists engaged in our country’s traditional and folk arts, and they recognized this year’s recipients at a September 26 ceremony at which I was honored to give brief remarks.
Eddie comes from a musical family, and he has truly devoted his life to the art of old-time fiddling. The National Heritage Fellowship is only the latest recognition of his talent and hard work. I encourage you to check out the NEA’s website, which features more on his background as well as some of his recordings.
In 1984, another Southwest Virginia native earned the National Heritage Fellowship. The legendary Ralph Stanley was notable for his unique voice, banjo playing, and prodigious output (1,300 recorded songs). He was born in Dickenson County, an origin reflected in the name of the group he performed in alongside his brother Carter, the Clinch Mountain Boys.
Ralph and Carter helped pioneer the genre of bluegrass music. After Carter died at the age of 41 in 1966, Ralph continued his musical career while introducing more old-time elements into his work. After receiving an honorary degree from Lincoln Memorial University in Tennessee, he was often called “Dr. Ralph Stanley.” Dr. Ralph’s place in the musical pantheon was secure when he died in 2016 at the age of 89.
Bluegrass owes much to the Stanley Brothers of Dickenson County. If you leave Dickenson and head to State Street in Bristol, you’ll find where another genre of music can claim deep roots. The 1927 “Bristol sessions” are now remembered as the formative event of country music. During the summer of that year, record producer Ralph Peer stepped off a train on the Virginia side of the street and set up recording equipment in the Taylor-Christian Hat and Glove Company on the Tennessee side.
From July 25 to August 5, local artists came to record. The first was Ernest Stoneman, a native of Monarat in Carroll County. Stoneman had already made successful recordings, in some cases joined by his wife Hattie and her siblings as well as others. They came to Bristol to record more. Stoneman’s financial success made the local papers, acting as a lure for other artists.
Among them was a family from Maces Spring in Scott County. They were A.P. Carter, his wife Sara, and Sara’s sister Maybelle Addington. The Carter family’s recordings from the Bristol sessions made them stars and launched a musical dynasty (A.P. and Sara’s daughter Janette won a National Heritage Fellowship in 2005).
In all, nineteen acts recorded 76 songs. In the words of Johnny Cash, who as we all remember married into a later generation of the Carter family, the Bristol Sessions were “the most important event in the history of country music.”
You can still hear the legacy of these musical traditions echoing in our hills. Drive “The Crooked Road,” a trail connecting venues throughout Southwest Virginia where traditional music is played. Hear the performers competing for cash prizes at the annual Old Fiddlers’ Convention in Galax around the second weekend of each August. Visit the Birthplace of Country Music Museum at 520 Birthplace of Country Music Way in Bristol, just a stone’s throw from where it all began.
I was glad to see these legacies honored in Washington by the National Endowment of the Arts this year. Eddie Bond is only the most recent Ninth District native to earn a National Heritage Fellowship; in addition to him, Ralph Stanley, and Janette Carter, Wayne Henderson of Mouth of Wilson won in 1995 and Frank Newsome of Haysi won in 2011.
Through the years, the music of Appalachia has entertained, worshipped, mourned, and fulfilled innumerable other meanings. It has brought together communities and even families, as seen in the stories of the artists written of here. Our music, the music of Appalachia, is as much a part of America as the mountains themselves.

￼

Dear Lindsey, 
Needless to say, last week was a busy one in our nation’s capital. From the Kavanaugh hearings to funding our military to Tax Reform 2.0, there was no shortage of big news. I want to quickly catch you up on all the developments from a jammed-pack week in Washington. 
Military Readiness 
￼ 
I am proud to report, thanks to the steadfast work and advocacy of us defense hawks in Congress, we have passed a bill fully funding our nation’s military on time for the first time since 2008. Not only this, but as of October 1st, roughly 75% of our government is funded for the coming year. On Friday, President Trump signed into law the Fiscal Year 2019 Defense and Labor-HHS-Education funding bill, which authorizes a record $716 billion to go toward our fighting men and women in the upcoming year. 
Among the priorities important to Alabama, the defense bill funds: 
	•	Three Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) built by Austal USA in Mobile;
	•	One Expeditionary Fast Transport (EPF) built by Austal;
	•	Lakota and Blackhawk Helicopters important to Fort Rucker in the Wiregrass;
	•	Missile defense and Army research programs at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville;
	•	Directed energy and hypersonics programs being developed in Huntsville;
	•	F-35s fighter jets, some of which will be based with the 187th Fighter Wing in Montgomery;
	•	Missiles constructed by Lockheed Martin in Troy;
	•	Stryker vehicles and Hydra rockets built in Anniston; and
	•	Navy shipbuilding programs at Ingalls Shipyard in Pascagoula.
As your representative in Congress, I am constantly fighting for the betterment of all Alabamians and all Americans. The members of the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Air Force, and Marines who live and work in Alabama should rest easy knowing that I will always fight for those who fight for us. 
Keeping Taxes Low for Alabama Families 
￼ 
Last year, we worked with President Trump to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered taxes for Alabama families and greatly simplified our tax code. Under that law, the average family in Southwest Alabama will see their tax bill decrease by $2,187. Well we aren’t stopping there. Last week, we passed a package of bills known as Tax Reform 2.0 to lock in these low taxes and make even more reforms to the tax code. Among the many important reforms, the tax reform bills will help spur innovation and entrepreneurship right here in Alabama while also making it easier for Americans to save for retirement. I was proud to support the Tax Reform 2.0 bills because I believe more money belongs with the people, not the government.    
Confirm Judge Kavanaugh 
￼ 
Click here or the image above to watch my floor speech. 
Just this past Friday, I delivered a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives urging the Senate to make the right choice and confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Judge Kavanaugh has a clear record as a thoughtful jurist who respects and will defend our Constitution. Those who have worked with him over the years and know him best strongly defend his record as a good man who loves his family and our country. I’m ashamed we find ourselves where we are today. It is shameful the way Judge Kavanaugh has had his name smeared, and it is time for this circus to end. The Senate needs to stop with the games and vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. 
Big Grant for Mobile Chamber 
I’m thrilled to report that the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce last week received a $1,531,346 grant to help with the acquisition and renovation of the former Threaded Fasteners Building in Mobile to house Innovation PortAL. I appreciate the Trump Administration and the Economic Development Administration for their support of the Innovation PortAL project. This project will spur innovation in Southwest Alabama, bring new jobs to our area, and boost our local economy. Innovation PortAL is an innovation and entrepreneurial center offering world-class programs and resources to entrepreneurs in our region. I look forward to continuing to work with our local leaders to support the Innovation PortAL project and all economic development efforts in our area.” 
In Case You Missed It!

What’s Ahead 
As we move into October, the House is scheduled to be out of session, so I look forward to spending time catching up with folks back home in Southwest Alabama. Over the coming weeks, we have a number of important events and meetings planned, so stay tuned for information on events and town hall meetings. I always appreciate the opportunity to spend time hearing directly from the people I represent in Congress.

LEGISLATION
 
Dear Friend: 
Oregon Communities Battle Opioid Crisis as Final Legislative Package Moves Forward in Congress 
Combating the opioid crisis requires an all-hands-on-deck approach from all of us. Across Oregon, treatment advocates, medical providers, law enforcement officers, first responders, local officials, families, and everyday members of the community are standing shoulder-to-shoulder in this fight. I’ve listened to their tragic stories and learned from their experenices.  Their struggles have informed the legislation that is about to become law.
Working together, we’re getting real results in Congress.  On Friday afternoon, the House passed our comprehensive, bipartsan legislation, H.R. 6 on a 393-8 vote. It includes advances in treatment, requirements for best prescribing practices, help with drug take back programs and efforts to stop deadly, illegal fentanyls from coming across our borders.  I’ve spent countless hours working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and between the House and the Senate to achieve this agreement.  I’ve also worked with President Trump and his team, and know that they are on board with our efforts, too.
In Wallowa County, I met with local health care and law enforcement officials to get their feedback on our legislative efforts.   
￼ 
Wallowa County Sheriff Steve Rogers discusses how a drug take back program is helping prevent unused prescription pills from fueling the opioid crisis in eastern Oregon. Boxes filled with powerful pain killers illustrate how well the take back system is utilized by the local community. 
The Enterprise Police Department has implemented a robust drug take back program that encourages members of the local community to drop off their unused prescription pills for safe disposal. I saw firsthand the success of that program, which is helping to reduce the risk of misuse and abuse of powerful prescription pills. 
The police department is also teaming up with Winding Waters Community Health Center to tackle this epidemic head on. Winding Waters has provided the Enterprise Police Department with Narcan, a safe and effective anti-overdose drug that can save lives in an emergency. 
Wallowa County is one of the only places in Oregon where Carfentanil, a synthetic fentanyl, has been detected. Our legislation will take steps to get these dangerous drugs off our streets and help stop them from flowing into our communities in the first place.   
To learn more about my legislation, please click here. 
￼
Walden visit includes opioid abuse discussion 
U.S. Rep., Greg Walden found out that rural areas are suffering as much as big cities from the opioid crisis after he made a one-hour whistle stop in Wallowa County last week.
He met with Winding Waters Community Health Center, the Enterprise Police Department and Wallowa County Sheriff’s Office to learn how the agencies team to combat the opioid crisis in eastern Oregon. The Sept. 19 event took place at the county’s justice center in Enterprise.

Oregon to Receive $17 Million to Combat the Opioid Crisis 
￼ 
Having led the effort to reauthorize and fully fund community health centers, I continue to meet with providers and patients to discuss challenges and opportunities, including here at Medford-based La Clinica Community Health Center. Community health centers, like La Clinica, are receiving new grant funding to help combat the opioid crisis in Oregon.
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that Oregon will receive more than $17 million to increase access to opioid abuse and addiction treatment, especially in rural areas. 
Recently, HHS awarded more than $1 billion in opioid-related grants to help combat the opioid epidemic. These grants were awarded in all 50 states. 
Included in this grant funding is $396 million for community health centers and rural health programs through HHS’ Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Oregon will receive $6.7 million in funding through HRSA, including $2.2 million for Oregon’s Second District. 
These resources will support medical providers at community health centers, who are on the front lines of this work in Oregon. I was proud to help lead the effort in Congress to boost and extend funding for community health centers for two years, and this additional grant funding comes from prior efforts I’ve backed to directly address the drug addiction and opioid challenges we face.  To learn more about these grants please click here.

Greg Walden announces grants to combat opioid crisis in Oregon 
Congressman Greg Walden announced federal funding to combat the opioid crisis in Oregon. 
According to Walden’s office, $17 million in new grants from the Department of Health and Human Services will go to “increase access to a wide range of opioid abuse and addiction services across the state, specifically targeted to rural areas.”

It was likely in wagons like these that my great-great grandparents crossed the Oregon Trail and arrived in The Dalles two weeks ago in 1845. For lifelong Oregonians like myself, sights like this are a great reminder of the rich history that can only be found in the Beaver State.
Walden Hears Concerns About Forest Plan from County Officials and Community Leaders 
￼ 
County and forestry leaders from across northeastern Oregon met with me in Baker City to express their frustration with the proposed Blue Mountain Forest Plan Revision.   
The objections raised by farmers, ranchers, and local leaders in eastern Orgon about the Blue Mountain Forest Plan are serious.  It appears that years of public input got thrown out the window, leaving me and local elected officials very frustrated and deeply concerned about the impact such a plan would have on our way of life in northeastern Oregon.  I am sharing the concerns I heard at the meeting directly with Forest Service officials, including the new Regional Forester Glenn Casamassa who I’ve asked to personally join me in eastern Oregon in October to discuss this plan with local stakeholders. 
￼ 
Walden meets with county officials 
U.S. Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., was in Baker City Wednesday morning to attend a meeting of the Eastern Oregon Counties Association at the Courthouse.
Walden discussed the recent Blue Mountain Forest Plan Revision as well as the federal Farm Bill.

Walden Discusses Efforts to Combat Human Trafficking in Rural Oregon 
￼ 
The stories I heard from law enforcement and human trafficking survivors in La Grande were heartbreaking and stunning. This evil needs to be faced head on, and I’m supporting efforts in Congress to do just that. 
Human trafficking is a scourge that has touched every corner of our country, and rural Oregon is not immune to this evil. In La Grande, I met with survivors, law enforcement, and local leaders to discuss how we can combat human trafficking and protect our communities. 
It is estimated that as many as 300,000 American children are at risk of being trafficked in the United States. That is why I’m supporting legislation in Congress to empower law enforcement to combat human trafficking, boost support for survivors, and identify and root out the tools bad actors use to perpetrate this vile crime. 
At the Energy and Commerce Committee, where I serve as Chairman, we’ve taken the lead on measures to address sex trafficking online and bolster health care programs for survivors and potential victims. One bill that was signed into law with my support will allow state authorities to investigate and prosecute websites that facilitate sex trafficking. 
It’s also important that we pair federal efforts with efforts on the ground in our communities. Senator Bill Hansell, who represents Wallowa, Union, Gilliam, Sherman, and parts of Wasco counties, joined our meeting in La Grande. Senator Hansell is leading the effort in the Oregon state legislature to ensure information for human trafficking tip-lines are posted on rest stop bathrooms across the state. This will give people a safe place they can call and get help.

Union County officials meet with Walden to talk human trafficking 
U.S. Rep. Greg Walden met with law enforcement, Union County Commissioners, Grande Ronde Hospital staff and community members to talk about human trafficking Wednesday at the Meisner Conference Room in La Grande.
An estimated 300,000 American children are at risk of being trafficked in the United States, according to documentation provided by Walden that listed old and new legislation to combat human trafficking.

POW/MIA Recognition Day Offers Opportunity to Reflect 
￼ 
Friday, September 21, marked the annual National POW/MIA Recognition Day. There are 999 POW/MIA service members from Oregon, and thousands from across the country, to whom we pay tribute on this hallowed day. 
The iconic black-and-white POW/MIA flag hangs next to the American flag outside of my office in Washington, D.C. Every time I see that flag I am reminded of the commitment written on the flag that we have made to those heroes who were captured or never returned home: “You Are Not Forgotten”. POW/MIA Recognition Day offers an opportunity to reaffirm that commitment and reflect upon the freedoms and way of life we are able to enjoy as Americans because of the sacrifices of those who have served our country. 
Thank you for reading this update. Remember, you can always keep in touch with me via email, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 
It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. Congress.

Dear Lindsey, 
We are finally going to hit traffickers where it hurts--their bank accounts. Last Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed my Empowering Financial Institutions to Fight Human Trafficking Act, which I introduced with Rep. Carolyn Maloney. We are one step closer to improving information sharing between non-profit organizations that work closely with trafficking victims and financial institutions, in order to help the financial industry better identify and respond to human trafficking activity. I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this legislation, ensuring that the United States continues to set the global standards for anti-money laundering and human trafficking prevention.

￼

I also cosponsored H.R. 6898, the Maintaining Protections for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions Act, which was introduced by Representative Steve Knight last week. Standing up for Missourians with pre-existing conditions has been a top priority for me in Congress. I have consistently advocated for and supported legislation that protects the most vulnerable among us and ensures people with pre-existing conditions can have access to the health insurance they need, without exception. By codifying protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions in HIPAA, we are ensuring that anyone with a pre-existing condition is protected against being denied coverage or charged more for their condition.

Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released its Record of Decision which lays out a permanent solution to clean up the radioactive waste at the West Lake Landfill Superfund site in Bridgeton. Since my first day in Congress, I have been committed to the safety, security, and well-being of the families surrounding the West Lake Landfill. The announcement is a testament to the St. Louis community who persevered through decades of delays and broken promises, and the administration officials who are following through on their cleanup commitments. For far too long, families have been living in fear, and now they can finally turn a new page.

Following the 2007 housing crisis, Congress passed a series of laws in an attempt to protect our financial markets from unnecessary exposure and liabilities. Unfortunately, ten years later, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac retain their stranglehold on the U.S. housing finance market, with no end in sight. The Financial Services Committee heard testimony from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director Mel Watt, and I had the opportunity to question Director Watt about the complicated relationship between the FHFA and the government sponsored enterprises. To hear my full remarks, click the video below.

Missouri’s defense industry is booming, with Boeing’s skilled St. Louis workers leading aerospace manufacturing into the future of training American pilots. Last week’s contract award announcement reinforces our state’s strong legacy of leading the way in the national security industry. Creating jobs and expanding our manufacturing base here in St. Louis are critical components of establishing Missouri as an innovative and technological leader. With such an experienced workforce alongside an unparalleled track record of carrying out large aerospace projects, St. Louis is the perfect fit for final assembly of the new T-X trainer. Boeing’s innovative spirit and dedication to excellence has certainly built a great legacy in the past 100 years and will no doubt prove to be the best choice for training pilots for generations to come.

Ros-Lehtinen Legislation to Enable Cancer Patients to Defer Student Loans While Receiving Active Treatment Signed into Law
Cancer Patients Now Able to Defer Student Loans While Receiving Active Treatment 
Legislation included in FY19 Appropriations Package Signed into Law 
Washington, D.C. — Today the Deferment for Active Cancer Treatment Act - introduced by Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) and Ed Perlmutter (D-CO) - was signed into law, providing desperately-needed financial peace of mind for patients battling cancer. 
Currently, individuals are allowed to defer student loan payments for various qualifying reasons such as going back to school, joining the armed services, or looking for a job, but cancer treatment has not yet been qualified for deferment. The legislation enables individuals who are diagnosed with cancer to defer payments on public student loans while actively receiving lifesaving treatment without interest accruing during the deferment period. Estimates show more than 70,000 young adults are diagnosed with cancer each year. 
“This will provide significant financial relief for individuals undergoing cancer treatment, and should have been done a long time ago,” said Perlmutter. “I appreciate the work of Rep. Ros-Lehtinen and the advocacy of Critical Mass and others to ensure this was signed into law.” 
“The hardships the families impacted by cancer face are only exacerbated by the financial stresses of having to meet student loan payments. This bill gives those actively undergoing lifesaving cancer treatment the peace of mind of not having to think about whether or not they can afford their federal student loan payments. The option to defer without accruing interest will allow patients to focus on what is important, their health,” said Ros-Lehtinen. 
""Young adults are fighting for their lives within a broken cancer care system that ignores their unique needs and isolates them in treatment settings designed for young children or seniors,” said Kate Yglesias Houghton, President & CEO of Critical Mass: The Young Adult Cancer Alliance. “Every American no matter their age deserves the same opportunity to survive and thrive after a cancer diagnosis. Thanks to the leadership of Representatives Ros-Lehtinen and Perlmutter we have finally broken through and are working with policymakers to remove the unique barriers - like student loans - faced by young adults after a cancer diagnosis. I look forward to continuing this work with our champions in Congress.” 
The text of H.R. 2976 was included in the bipartisan fiscal year 2019 Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.

Dear Friend, 
If you or someone you know is planning to attend college next year, now is the time to begin thinking about the resources available to help with the cost.  
Starting today, the Department of Education will begin accepting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid form, commonly known as the FAFSA. This free form, created by the Department of Education, is required to apply for federal aid. It is used to determine how much a student can receive in federal support, including grants, loans, and work-study. Financial aid from states, colleges, and some scholarship programs also rely on the FAFSA. 
Each year, the office of Federal Student Aid offers an estimated $120 billion in grants, loans, and work study funds for college students. It is critical to fill out the FAFSA form as soon as possible in order to receive the maximum amount of assistance in paying for a college education.
 
￼ 
Only 61 percent of high school students file a FAFSA, leaving more than $24 billion in state, federal, and institutional aid on the table, according to the National College Access Network (NCAN). Use the resources below to help you fill out the free FAFSA form: 
	•	Click here to review eligibility guidelines for federal financial aid. Individual eligibility is determined by the FAFSA.
	•	The FAFSA4caster can help you estimate your eligibility for aid. It is helpful to have bank statements and federal tax information ready during this process.
	•	Click here to see what documents you will need before you start filling out the FAFSA.
	•	You can view the Department of Education’s 8 Steps to Filling Out the FAFSA form blog post here.
	•	Beginning today, click here to download a copy of the FAFSA form for the 2019-2020 school year. You can also download the new FAFSA mobile app, myStudentAid, on your Apple or Android device.
The federal deadline for completing the FAFSA is June 30, but Indiana’s deadline is April 15, and many individual schools have earlier deadlines. 
If you have any questions regarding applying for federal financial aid, please feel free to contact my office at 317-283-6516.

Come and Read It Report
Dear Texans, 
As all of you in our district know, I have been fighting for a commonsense, business owners perspective on tax reform since day one. Less than a year ago, we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act - truly historic tax relief for all. Since then, there are more jobs, Americans are seeing higher wages, and Main Street can breathe again. 
While all of this is great, there has always been the uncertainty of knowing that these cuts would expire in 2025 - something I've been fighting to change. I am happy to report that after working hard with House Leadership and the President, the House passed three pieces of legislation that make up Tax Reform 2.0 last week: 
✔ H.R. 6757, the Family Savings act of 2018 ⟶ helping families and individuals save for their future
✔ H.R. 6756, the American Innovation Act of 2018 ⟶ spurring American innovation by helping Main Street 
✔ H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018 ⟶ makes tax cuts permanent for American individuals, families, and small businesses 
These pieces of legislation will continue to bolster our economy, and I am excited to watch American families and businesses flourish.
Hays County Veterans 
Last week, veterans from Hays County in our district boarded an honor flight to Washington, D.C. For those who don't know, the purpose of an honor flight is to transport America's veterans to the nation's capital to visit the memorials dedicated to honor their service and sacrifices. On that particular flight, we had six WWII veterans, 18 Korean War veterans and 17 Vietnam War veterans - the flight was named in honor of Williams 'Bill' Kolbe, who was a WWII vet that served in the Army Air Corps.
I was honored to be able to speak about them on the House floor in front of my colleagues and the nation. These vets are true heroes and I would like to thank them for so selflessly serving this nation and protecting this country all those years ago. I hope they enjoyed every moment of their honor flight trip, and know that we are all forever grateful for their service. Click here or below to watch.

House passes Tax Reform 2.0!

Dear Lindsey,
Over two years, the Republican pro-growth agenda has worked to spur economic growth and American prosperity. Due to our historic tax reform, reducing burdensome regulations, and more, taxpayers across the country are reaping the benefits of a thriving economy.
CLICK HERE to take my TAX REFORM SURVEY, and feel free to share with friends and neighbors!
Last year, I joined my fellow Republicans in Congress in giving Americans much-needed tax relief by passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
With lowered individual rates, a doubled standard deduction, doubled child tax credit, and lower corporate rates, 90% of taxpayers are seeing more money in their paychecks. In fact, according to the Joint Economic Committee, take-home pay for the median household family of four is up six percent compared to last year.
This past week, the House also passed Tax Reform 2.0, which includes making individual tax cuts permanent to help hard-working Minnesotans keep more of their hard-earned money and save for their futures.
Our new tax reform package gives certainty to our small businesses so they can plan and grow, and we ensured our tax code encourages new and innovative start-up businesses. We also helped families save more by eliminating age restrictions for retirement plans and expanded 529 plans so they can be used on apprenticeships and home schooling costs.
In response to these initiatives, business optimism is also at record high levels and has resulted in increased investment in employees. Four million Americans at over 600 companies have received bonuses, wage increases, and increased benefits as businesses continue to expand. When you invest in our country's businesses, it directly benefits employees and families alike.
The broad expansion of businesses in Minnesota and across the country has created more than 3.7 million jobs since November 2016, and over the past twelve months, Minnesota created 43,000 jobs while the unemployment rate also fell to below three percent. Minnesotans and Americans across the country are seeing great results from our historic tax reform and pro-growth policies.
CLICK HERE to share how tax reform is benefiting you and your family!  As I work on this and other issues, I always like to hear directly from you.  Please share any thoughts you may have through my website, and sign up for my e-mail newsletter for the latest updates from Washington, D.C. and around the district. You can also stay on top of my work by following my Facebook and Twitter pages. Please feel free to call my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-2271 or my local Burnsville office at 651-846-2120 with any comments or for assistance with a federal agency.

 U.S. AND SOUTH KOREA SUCCESSFULLY RENEGOTIATE TRADE DEAL  
President Trump has made the renegotiation of America’s longstanding trade agreements a top priority of his Administration, and I am encouraged by the progress that we are making on behalf of American workers.  While the President is still deeply engaged in ongoing negotiations with China, Japan, Canada, and Mexico, we saw last week a final deal come together with our close friends in South Korea!...READ MORE. 
ENSURING THE TAX CODE CONTINUES TO WORK BETTER FOR AMERICAN TAXPAYERS 
Last week, the House took an important step forward in making permanent the many changes made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).

HOUSE APPROVES LONG-TERM FAA REAUTHORIZATION 
On Thursday, a bipartisan majority of the House passed FAA reauthorization legislation, which I was proud to help write as a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Aviation Subcommittee.  This bill provides more long-term certainty for the FAA and America’s world-leading aviation community than any bill passed in more than 25 years...READ MORE.  
PROMOTING SMALL BUSINESS GROWTH IN CONGRESS 
Earlier this month, small business optimism reached a historic high, and it’s no wonder given our continued economic growth, record number of job openings, and low unemployment. This is in no small part due to the work we have done here in Congress to encourage that growth and incentivize businesses to continue investing in themselves and their employees through regulatory reform and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, among others...READ MORE. 
CONGRESS SENDS FY2019 FUNDING BILLS TO THE PRESIDENT’S DESK 
As you may have heard, Congress last week worked across the aisle to pass another package of FY2019 Appropriations bills – H.R. 6157, the “Department of Defense and Labor (DoD), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Education Appropriations Act, 2019 and Continuing Appropriations Act.” Passage of H.R. 6157, in addition to the three appropriations bills President Trump signed into law earlier this month, marks the first time since 2007 that Congress has sent multiple appropriations bills to the President’s desk prior to the end of the fiscal year...READ MORE.

I wanted to let you know about an important bill I introduced in Congress that just passed the U.S. House with bipartisan support. It’s called the American Innovation Act (HR 6756) and it would help reduce the cost of opening a new business by increasing the deduction for start-up costs from $5,000 to $20,000.

Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Unfortunately, there has been a steady decline in entrepreneurship in the United States for many years and we just dropped out of Bloomberg’s list of the top 10 most innovative countries in the world.

We need to get the U.S. back on the list of the most innovative countries in the world. 

With new business creation at nearly a 40-year low, and only 50 percent of new businesses surviving past their first five years, we should make it easier for start-ups to thrive in our economy. 

Please let me know if you support my efforts in Congress to help our country’s entrepreneurs and innovators.

LATEST NEWS
Last week the House overwhelmingly approved a long-term FAA Reauthorization, my top legislative agenda for this year. Affecting every program and operation within the FAA, this 5 year deal will bring new facilities and additional research initiatives to South Jersey’s FAA Technical Center in Egg Harbor Township. It will ensure the long-term stability at the FAA while advancing the nation’s aviation interests and safety in the skies. Protecting the work of our FAA Technical Center and promoting its 3,500 employees has been my top priority as Chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee.
  
The Senate is expected to pass the FAA Reauthorization this week, sending it to the President for his signature.

Dear Friends, 
Last week was a busy one in Washington.  
The House held substantial votes on tax reform measures and bills to support small businesses.  We also passed a comprehensive package to help combat the national opioid crisis.  Here's a close look at a few of the highlights from my week:  
Tax Cuts for Americans 
￼ 
For years, our country has felt the burdens of a difficult, outdated tax code, and we listened when Americans said enough was enough.  We took huge steps last year in passing the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to grow the American economy and lead to better jobs and bigger paychecks.  Here in West Tennessee, we have seen significant growth in just the past year, but our progress is far from over.
Last week, I voted to pass a second wave of tax reform (Tax Reform 2.0) to make permanent tax cuts for individuals included in the historic Tax Cuts & Jobs Act.  This wave focuses on provisions to protect middle-class and small business tax cuts, promote family and retirement savings, and support the next generation of entrepreneurs. 
The following bills were included in Tax Reform 2.0: 
	•	H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018 – makes permanent the tax cuts for individuals and pass-through businesses that were included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
	•	H.R. 6757, the Family Savings Act of 2018 – expands the ability for individuals and families to use a variety of savings vehicles. The bill includes reforms to make it easier for employers, especially small employers, to provide retirement plans to their employees.
	•	H.R. 6756, the American Innovation Act of 2018 – doubles the amount of start-up and organizational costs that can be expensed in the first year of operations.
Now we have voted to put permanent cuts in place to keep our businesses growing and our people thriving. The money earned by hard-working Americans belongs in their pockets, and I am glad we could take these steps this week to ensure that happens.

Combating the Opioid Crisis 
￼ 
Opioid addiction continues to take the lives of more than 100 Americans each and every day.  Last week, the House took steps to pass the most significant congressional effort against a single drug crisis in history by passing H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act.   
H.R.6 is a bipartisan bill that will help in our overall efforts to combat the opioid crisis by advancing treatment and recovery initiatives, improving prevention, protecting our communities, and bolstering our efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl.  This bill now heads to the Senate for a final vote and then to the President’s desk to be signed into law.

Funding the Government
Last week, the House and Senate passed Appropriations bills that account for roughly 75 percent of the federal government’s discretionary spending, an achievement that has not occurred in over two decades. In DC, this appropriations package is referred to as a “minbus” and it included funding for the Department of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education for Fiscal Year 2019. 
This is the first time in over 20 years that Congress has passed a Labor Health and Human Services bill prior to the end of the fiscal year, and the first time in over 10 years it has passed a Defense spending bill prior to the end of the fiscal year.  This is a huge accomplishment, and I am glad that we could get this done on time. 
Childhood Cancer Awareness Month
￼ 
Last week, I spoke on the floor of the House of Representatives to bring awareness to childhood cancer.  September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. Click here to watch my full remarks on the House floor.  
Military Service Academy Day
￼ 
Last weekend, I hosted my annual Military Service Academy Day.  Nearly two hundred students and their families traveled from across West Tennessee to learn about the nomination process for our nation’s military service academies.  Representatives from the following service academies were in attendance: U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, U.S. Military Academy (West Point), U.S. Naval Academy, and Army and Airforce ROTC. 
It was great to see the high level of interest in our service academies this year.  These high schoolers have bright futures ahead of them, and I appreciate their interest in serving our country. I also want to thank the servicemen and women who volunteered their time to help inform and prepare these students for a life of service.  There is truly no greater honor than serving one’s country, and I appreciate their dedication to these young students.
Eligible nominees must meet the basic requirements to apply. Click here for a complete list of requirements and frequently asked questions on the Military Academy nomination process.

Media


  
Friend, 
Throughout my time in Congress, it’s been a priority of mine to support those suffering from addiction, provide our community with resources to crack down on illicit drugs flooding our streets, and increase innovative treatment options. On Friday, the House voted on bipartisan, comprehensive legislation that addresses all aspects of the opioid crisis and includes my bill, the SENIOR Communities Protection Act, which gives Medicare the ability to protect seniors and stop criminals who are abusing stolen Medicare numbers. Soon, the bill will be signed into law by the president. 
When we put politics aside and work together, we can achieve real results for our community. Here are some recent legislative achievements from this past week: 
  
PASSED: Funding for Joint Base Tankers 
 ￼ 
MacArthur and Airmen at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst 
Congress, for the first time in more than two decades, passed Department of Defense funding on time. This funding is critical to modernize equipment, improve readiness levels, and provide the largest pay raise to our service members in nine years. It also secures $2.3 billion in funding for the new KC-46 tankers coming to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. This is a critical step and something I have been working on since my first day in Congress, nearly four years ago. With the help of my colleagues from New Jersey, state, local, and Department of Defense officials, 24 KC-46 tankers are officially coming to the Joint Base—an important decision that will secure the future of the Joint Base and protect our local and state economy for years to come. 
  
PASSED: Comprehensive Legislation to Combat the Opioid Crisis 
 ￼
MacArthur meeting with a local pharmacist to discuss ways to better screen and monitor opioid prescriptions 
Republicans and Democrats came together to pass innovative policies that provide our South Jersey community with real solutions to the opioid crisis. The bill bolsters local drug treatment, prevention, and enforcement efforts, enhances opioid prescription screening measures, and increases resources for those suffering from addiction. All aspects of the opioid crisis are addressed in this legislation, including ways to close loopholes that allow criminals to put drugs on our streets.  As co-chair of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force, I will continue finding ways to make our communities better prepared and more resilient against the opioid epidemic.  I am proud of the work we have accomplished and I am committed to building on this progress. 
  
PASSED: $7 Billion to Fund Critical Treatment and Prevention Programs 
 ￼ 
MacArthur hearing from families affected by the opioid crisis in Burlington County 
Last week, the president signed legislation that increased funding by nearly $7 billion for health and human service programs that help those suffering from addiction. This funding will help South Jersey better address our community’s specific needs related to substance abuse. As co-chair of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force, I’ve been an advocate for increased funding to fight the opioid epidemic, including money to support state-level response. This crisis is bigger than any one of us, but it is not bigger than all of us together. 
  
I won’t ever be blinded by partisanship and I refuse to take part in the partisan dysfunction that prevents progress. The nonpartisan Lugar Center at Georgetown University recently named me again among the most bipartisan members of Congress, because I work against Washington dysfunction and stand up for Burlington and Ocean Counties. If I can ever be of any assistance, please visit my website or contact my office: http://macarthur.house.gov 
  
Thank you,

Palazzo Introduces Aquaculture Bill
 

This week in Washington, I introduced the Advancing the Quality and Understanding of American Aquaculture Act or the AQUAA Act to increase the United States' involvement and production of healthy, sustainable, and affordable seafood. 
This bill helps develop an industry that will create jobs, support our coastal communities, and put us on the right track to reducing our seafood trade deficit in a safe and sustainable way. The United States does not have a comprehensive, nationwide permitting system for marine aquaculture in federal waters. Our bill seeks to rectify this by establishing an office under NOAA that would be charged with coordinating the federal permitting process. It would also fund research and extension services for several existing aquaculture priorities.
The Advancing the Quality and Understanding of American Aquaculture Act, or the AQUAA Act, seeks to increase the United States’ involvement in the aquaculture industry by enabling the development of a healthy aquaculture industry in federal waters.
This marks the first time comprehensive, offshore aquaculture legislation has been introduced in the House that specifically addresses permitting harmonization for marine aquaculture. As of now, multiple agencies oversee the permitting process that adhere to different requirements, making it challenging to obtain necessary permits in a timely and cost-effective manner.  
The United States currently imports over 90% of the seafood we consume and half the imports are aquaculture products. With a growing population and an ever increasing demand for seafood, it has become clear that as of right now, the United States does not produce enough seafood to meet domestic demand.
Confirming Kavanaugh
We've seen Democrats stoop to new lows as they attempt to obstruct the confirmation process of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. They are not interested in justice, they are interested in obstruction of the President's Administration. 
 
The FBI will now conduct an investigation into the allegations made by Dr. Ford. I fully believe this is another attempt to delay the confirmation process further. This investigation should last no longer than a week and a confirmation vote should be demanded immediately after the investigation is closed.

Academy Day 2018
Every year I have the honor and privilege to nominate several students to four of the five US Service Academies. The honor of attending a service academy comes with an obligation and commitment to serve in the military for a minimum of five years upon graduation.

This coming Saturday, students from across the Mississippi Gulf Coast will have a chance to speak to representatives from each service academy and ask any questions they may have about each of the academies. Details for Saturday's event are listed below. 
 
￼

Q&A with U.S. Naval Academy Graduate 
Some of the best and brightest students from south Mississippi go on to further their education at the service academies. I've recently had a Q&A session with Long Beach native and Class of 2016 U.S. Naval Academy graduate, Teresa Meadows. Check out the preview into the life at the U.S. Naval Academy.

￼

What is one of your best memories from the Academy?
 Army/Navy week. It’s authorized pranking on any rank, for one week and it’s such a blast. Every year so many stories emerged from it and it’s something really fun to remember. Also, my company was in charge of the annual Croquet Match against the local college- St. John’s. You would think that would be tremendously boring but it’s a great time and the whole town and Brigade comes out.
What are you doing now that you’ve graduated? Now that I have graduated, I am a designated Surface Warfare Officer.  My first two years, I was stationed on the USS PORT ROYAL out of Pearl Harbor, HI.  I just recently moved to my second two year tour and am stationed at a CTF-65 Det in Rota, Spain as a Staff Officer.  The places the Navy and more specifically, my job, has allowed me to travel is actually insane! I have loved every minute of it and am so excited to see what continues to lie ahead.  
What is one of your favorite traditions or past times at your Academy that you took part in? I think that for any grad, it’s almost an obvious answer! I think that the Army/Navy game and the week leading up to it, was an absolute blast. The week in its entirety is all geared towards the football game and us aiming to beat Army. Even now, all alums meet up wherever we are stationed and reminisce in the camaraderie while we watch the game. It’s almost an unwritten rule in a sense.
What would you say to someone who is considering applying? I think that the Academy is an amazing institution that has tremendous amounts to offer, but with that being said it is not for everyone. I would really take the time to think it through and make sure that it is what you truly want. It can be a grueling 4 years both academically and physically, and if that is not what you are looking for then I would recommend to explore other options, but if it is… it will change your life in the most positively challenging way.
What is something you think someone should know before applying to the Academy? The first year is difficult. I would do some research on what the first year/two years is like. Again, it is no ordinary college and it has rules and regulations and a higher demand of discipline that one might imagine. There is limited liberty and freedoms your first year. It does get better though. You can get through the first year, but don’t apply blindsided!!!
What does a typical day for a new student at the Academy look like?
0530-0630- Morning PT
0630-0700- Chow Calls
0700- Morning Quarters Formation
0700-0745- Breakfast
0745-1145- Morning Classes

Quarterly Newsletter from the Office of Senator Catherine Cortez Masto

Vol. 1, Issue 3
 
 
 
October 1, 2018


We Remember: One Year Since 1October

We’re still recovering from the events that took place on October 1st. We’re still grieving for the family members who are no longer with us. And we’re still grieving for the survivors whose lives will never be the same. 
We can always do things to honor and remember our loved ones—so that they are never truly gone, as long as we are around to say their names or share a memory of them. Today—in remembrance of that awful night one year ago—let’s give thanks for the bravery and dedication of our first responders. 
Let’s give thanks to the community of Las Vegas. Their tremendous outpouring of generosity has shown the world what it means to be Vegas Strong. Let’s continue to honor the bravery and selflessness of the first responders, and make sure they have enough resources to do their jobs and keep us safe. 
Let’s continue to do everything we can to support those who are still struggling to recover from the emotional and physical wounds they sustained on October 1st. 
Fifty-eight innocent lives ended on October 1st, but millions more were changed forever. We must keep the survivors in our minds and in our hearts as they heal from their injuries—both visible and invisible—and get back on their feet.

Senator Cortez Masto Fights for Nevada Workers 
￼
Senator Cortez Masto stood up for Nevada workers in a letter to Wells Fargo CEO and President Timothy J. Sloan. In her letter, the Senator demanded answers after the bank announced it would be closing its Reno Call Center and laying off 340 employees. It has been widely reported that Wells Fargo is laying off thousands of workers throughout America and preparing to hire workers for call centers overseas. The Senator also questioned the banks treatment of its Reno employees by asking that Wells Fargo answer a series of questions regarding the timetable, severance packages and transfer opportunities available to impacted employees in Reno. The Senator is making clear that Wells Fargo understands it has an obligation to treat the communities they do business in fairly and act in good faith. 
The Senator also co-sponsored the United States Call Center Worker and Consumer Protection Act of 2017 to protect the rights of call center employees. If passed, the bill would require call center employees to disclose the physical location of their operation and Nevadans would be able to express their request to have the call transferred to a customer service agent in America. The bill also gives American consumers a voice by ensuring taxpayer dollars are not going to companies sending jobs overseas. 

Senator Cortez Masto Stands Up Against Family Separation
￼
Senator Catherine Cortez Masto toured several facilities in Texas where immigrant families were being detained, processed and separated by the Trump Administration. While she toured these facilities, the Senator met with mothers and fathers that were deeply harmed by the Administration’s inhumane family separation policy. On the floor of the United States Senate, the Senator told the story of what she saw and the people she met, including a mother, Ana and her five-year-old daughter. 
The Senator has introduced key legislation to ensure families fleeing violence are protected, and this Administration’s cruel family separation policy is never repeated again. The REUNITE Act would immediately reunify all families and establish a permanent system of coordination between the federal government and support organizations to protect detained immigrants with children. The Senator also co-sponsored The Keep Families Together Act, which keeps immigrant families together by ensuring that the Department of Homeland Security can never take children from their parents at the border again. The Senator also spoke at rallies in support of keeping families together in Nevada and in Washington, D.C. In a July meeting, the Senator called out Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen demanding the Secretary immediately share her plan to reunite parents with their children. During that meeting, Senator Cortez Masto outlined a list of steps DHS must follow and made certain the Secretary knew that Nevadans wanted every child reunited with their parents and accountability from the Trump Administration.

Senator Cortez Masto Stands With Nevada Women
￼
In August, Senator Cortez Masto hosted a roundtable with women’s health and reproductive rights advocates in Nevada. Many of these advocates were steering committee members from the 1990 Campaign for Choice in Nevada. These brave women fought to codify Roe v. Wade into state law in 1990. During the roundtable, the Senator heard the stories of these brave women who went door-to-door to get petitions signed and persuade Nevadans to support their measure; and she listened as participants expressed their concerns over the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to sit on the United States Supreme Court. Senator Cortez Masto has been an outspoken advocate for women’s reproductive freedom and health. She condemned recent decisions by the Supreme Court and the Trump Administration to threaten vulnerable women’s healthcare in Nevada, and across the country. After hearing the voices of these brave Nevada women and reviewing Judge Kavanaugh’s record and judicial philosophy, the Senator announced in September that she would vote ‘no’ on his lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court because his judicial philosophy is extreme and he would vote to rollback Roe v. Wade. 

Senator Cortez Masto Fights to Ensure Rural Nevada Thrives
￼
Senator Cortez Masto introduced a bipartisan bill to create a standing ‘Council on Rural Community Innovation and Economic Development’ to work across executive departments, agencies, and offices to streamline the work of agencies and programs that specifically support rural communities. The council will maximize the impact of federal investments across the different agencies in order to promote economic prosperity and quality of life in rural communities and encourage the use of innovative technologies that resolve local and regional challenges. This bill will create a council that will look out for the best interests of Nevadans who live in rural areas and ensures that the government is doing its best to provide geographically isolated communities with the resources and innovative technologies they need to thrive.

Preserving the Integrity of the Supreme Court of the United States
Last week, people in Minnesota and the entire country closely watched the important hearing about Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh. I am glad that there will now be an FBI investigation into the allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh before the Senate moves forward in his nomination process. This investigation must be thorough and complete.
I've been paying close attention to the process, but I want to make sure you know what else I've been working on. Below is a look into some of the issues I focused on in September to help Minnesotans. It's an honor to work for you.  
Fighting To Get Bipartisan Opioids Bill Across the Finish Line
Last year we saw more than 70,000 drug-related deaths nationwide as the opioid crisis continues to devastate communities in Minnesota and across the country. We need immediate action. That's why I helped write a bipartisan bill to tackle the problem which I'm proud to say passed the Senate this month.
The bill includes a number of provisions I championed to help Minnesotans and Americans in crisis. It provides funding for states and tribes to bolster prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts. And it would help first responders and others access opioid reversal drugs, like Naloxone, to treat people who overdose. The bill also includes provisions that would make medication-assisted therapy more available, strengthen access to trauma-informed care, and support the development of non-addictive alternatives for patients suffering from chronic pain.  
Families are in crisis, and we can't sit by while they struggle. I'm glad this bill passed the Senate, and we need to get it signed into law as soon as possible.
Learn more here.
Lowering Prescription Drug Prices for Minnesotans
The amount of money that Minnesotans are paying for their prescription drugs is unsustainable, unfair—and it's costing lives. I recently met a Minnesota mom who lost her son because he couldn't afford the $1,300 prescription drug refill he needed to treat his diabetes. That's why I'm working to hold Big Pharma accountable, lower drug prices, and rein in pharmaceutical company profits.
I recently introduced a comprehensive bill to tackle high prescription drug costs. The bill would increase transparency and affordability, spur innovation, and improve competition, which drives drug prices down. It has 14 cosponsors—including my fellow Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar—and I'll keep fighting to get this bill passed into law.
This month I also helped pass a bill that will make sure pharmacists can tell you when you could be saving money on prescription drugs by paying in cash instead of using your insurance—right now, drug industry middlemen are allowed to write ""pharmacy gag clauses"" into their contracts that prevent pharmacists from telling patients that they could pay less by paying for their drugs out of pocket rather than using their health benefits. The bill has passed the House and Senate, and now is on its way to be signed into law.
But we've still got a lot to do to make prescriptions more affordable for families. You can count on me to continue to work to lower drug costs.
Learn more here.
Protecting Minnesota Students from Poor Performing Education Programs
Minnesotans often find themselves looking to go back to school to pursue higher education. But some career training programs have a history of leaving their graduates with large student loans and low earning power. Almost 13,000 students in Minnesota have graduated from these types of low-performing programs. This is wrong, and I'm committed to cracking down on these programs.
There's a provision in place to help Minnesotans know which career-training programs are good—and which ones aren't—and help end taxpayer support for bad ones. It takes into account a few factors—things like graduates' average debt and earnings—to identify the value of career training programs. And I agree with that. If a career training program is too expensive relative to the wages its graduates earn, then it has failed to prove itself a worthwhile investment for students' time, effort, or taxpayer-supported federal student aid. But it seems that not everyone agrees with that.
Education Secretary DeVos has proposed gutting these provisions. Her proposal would protect poorly-performing career training programs that fail to pay off for students. Instead, DeVos should be guarding against these predatory programs and abandon her proposal. I'll keep fighting to protect Minnesota students' right to access worthwhile career training programs, because it's the right thing to do and our students deserve better.
Learn more here.
Working to Give Farmers Certainty with a Strong, Bipartisan Farm Bill
Farming is a pillar of the Minnesota economy and a way of life for thousands of families. That's why I fought to get the bipartisan 2018 Farm Bill, which I helped write, passed in the Senate, and am pushing to get a strong bipartisan Farm Bill signed into law.
My staff and I held more than 30 listening sessions with Minnesotans across the state to make sure Minnesota priorities were included in this legislation because I want to provide stability and predictability to Minnesota agriculture. If you shared your input with me and my staff: thank you.
The Farm Bill includes key efforts that I fought for. Efforts that will support Minnesota family farmers, ranchers, foresters and rural communities into the future, and will continue to sustain tens of thousands of Minnesota jobs. Efforts that will expand development of renewable energy, bolster rural economic development, and provide help to our state's important forestry industry. And it will support conservation efforts, provide funding for ag research, and expand resources for beginning, veteran, and organic farmers.
The Senate-passed Farm Bill is a great example of how we can come together and get things done in Washington when we work together. Now it's time for that bipartisanship to continue so we can get a strong Farm Bill signed into law.

ICYMI: Bergman Votes to Makes Tax Cuts on Middle Class Permanent

Washington - Congressman Jack Bergman released the following statement after voting to permanently cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses in Michigan's First District:  ""Our nation's economy is on the rise, jobless rates are falling, and hardworking men and women in Michigan's First District are keeping more of their paycheck. Just in the past few days we saw the news that from August 2017 through August 2018, unemployment rates dropped in every single county in the State of Michigan.   ""This is further proof that tax reform is working, companies are hiring, and Michigan's First District is open for business. That's why I was proud to support The Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act which continues the momentum of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by permanently cutting taxes on small businesses and hardworking Americans.""

What's Happening In Washington?

￼
Locking In Tax Cut Savings
I often say that trust is a series of promises kept. Last week, the House kept its promise to the American people and locked in permanent tax cuts. In the past year, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has provided American families, individuals and small business owners the hand up they need to get back on track. Now our economy is humming along, unemployment is at a record low, Main Street optimism is at an all-time high and American families are keeping more of their hard-earned paychecks. I am confident that locking in these savings will help families and small business better prepare for their futures.

Fighting Back Against Increased Government Spending 
While providing funds for our nation’s defense is critical, last week’s funding bill failed to deliver on the promises we made to the American people. We promised to decrease wasteful government spending, build a border wall and protect the unborn. Instead, leadership rolled over and gave in to the demands of open border Democrats. In an effort to keep our promise, I joined a few of my conservative colleagues in offering amendments to fully fund the wall; however, leadership denied these efforts. Unfortunately, even with Republicans in control of the Senate and the House, leadership continues to fold to Democrat priorities and fails to deliver on our promises.

Open border Democrats continue to put illegal immigrants ahead of law-abiding citizens. Last week, 72 Democrats voted against a resolution that recognizes that allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens.

Endangered Species Act Modernization Package Advances Bills
Last week, the House Natural Resources Committee passed four of the bills in the Endangered Species Act modernization package. This is a great first step to ensuring the ESA can finally work effectively and efficiently for the benefit of our country and its incredible diversity of species. For years, implementation of the ESA has failed to reach the minimum of standards first set by the noble intentions it was created to fulfill. The modernization package presents solutions to the judicially and bureaucratically broken mechanisms of that law, interjecting state involvement, broad transparency, and the full force of private sector problem-solving into the process.

Wicker Bill Would Strengthen the Fight Against Illegal Fishing
Under ‘Maritime SAFE Act,’ Multiple Government Agencies Would Contribute to Unified Effort
The term “lancha” has become well-known among Americans who are fighting against illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing.  Lanchas are small, propeller-driven watercraft that poachers from Mexico use to catch fish on U.S. reefs off the coast of Texas.  These poachers do not abide by the rules, as U.S. fishermen do, and often use the spoils from their illegal catches to fund drug operations and other cartel activities.  Worldwide, IUU fishing can mean big business, generating some $15 billion in illicit revenue each year. 
Pirate Fishing Threatens National Security
I asked about the use of lanchas during a recent Senate subcommittee hearing investigating the criminal exploitation of ocean resources.  These lanchas are estimated to bring in five times the catch of red snapper that Mississippi’s fishermen are allowed each season.  It is wrong for our law-abiding fishermen to be put at a competitive disadvantage because of pirate fishing. 
According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, IUU fishing is considered a threat to our national security.  Given its connection to organized crime – not to mention the harm done to our fisheries – strategies to fight this illegal behavior should be tough and far-reaching.  In 2014, the Senate ratified an important international treaty to keep vessels with illegal fish from entering U.S. ports, preventing this fish from ending up in our seafood market.
Although international cooperation is essential to curbing this problem across borders, the United States can take action on its own.  I have introduced the “Maritime Security and Fisheries Enforcement (Maritime SAFE) Act” with Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) to unify various government entities in the fight against illegal fishing.  Among those efforts would be a special task force to address the role of lanchas and an interagency working group to offer enforcement training to countries vulnerable to IUU fishing.  The bill’s call for coordination with the intelligence community would help improve surveillance and tracking. 
‘The Poison Pill … From Catch to Plate’
The “Maritime SAFE Act” would also be a victory against seafood fraud, since the bill encourages the expansion of reporting and recordkeeping requirements through the Seafood Import Monitoring Program.  I am deeply concerned by the fact that IUU fishing is estimated to account for a third of the fish caught globally.  This rampant fraud hurts our seafood industry, misleads consumers, and distorts population estimates of fish species. 
Consider, for example, the negative impact on our shrimp industry.  More than 90 percent of the shrimp consumed in the United States is imported.  Dr. David Veal, who serves as the executive director of the American Shrimp Processors Association, based in Biloxi, has called IUU fishing “the poison pill that taints the entire imported seafood chain, from catch to plate.”  He noted that “the economic interests of our seafood industry are seriously undercut by IUU activities, not just what happens on the water but what occurs during the production, distribution, and sale.”
Seafood continues to be a major protein source for populations around the world, not to mention a significant economic driver.  Commercial and recreational fishing industries support 1.6 million American jobs.  Pirate fishing exploits our ocean resources, and its catch wrongly infiltrates our markets.  We cannot let this criminal activity jeopardize the livelihoods of America’s honest fishermen.

The Washington Rundown 
On Friday, the Senate Judiciary Committee agreed to a one-week delay on the confirmation of President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, to allow for an FBI probe into allegations of sexual misconduct against the judge.  Last week, Congress passed an $854 Billion spending package that will avert a government shutdown by keeping the federal government open into the new fiscal year, which begins today.  The measure fully funds the military and the Departments of Health and Human Services, Education, and Labor through fiscal 2019.  House Democrats also secured increased funding for opioid abuse prevention and treatment, career and technical education, and biomedical research.  
Nearly three weeks after Hurricane Florence made landfall on the North Carolina coast, North Carolinians are still getting back on our feet.  Congressman Butterfield remains focused on helping those impacted by the storm.  Constituents who have questions regarding Hurricane Florence response can visit our website or contact Congressman Butterfield’s offices in Wilson (252-237-9816), Durham (919-908-0164), and Washington, DC (202-225-3101) for assistance. 
Remembering Mrs. Sallie B. Howard 
On Tuesday, September 25, Congressman Butterfield joined thousands in mourning the passing of Mrs. Sallie B. Howard, a longtime educator and community leader who inspired the Sallie B. Howard School for the Arts and Education located in Wilson, North Carolina. 
Mrs. Howard was 102 years old.  On Thursday, Congressman Butterfield paid tribute to the life and legacy of Mrs. Howard on the Floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.  Read more about Mrs. Sallie B. Howard in The Wilson Times.

Additional North Carolina Counties Approved for Disaster SNAP Benefits  
￼ 
As of Friday, September 28, residents in 27 storm-impacted counties can receive assistance for food via the Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP), a state funded program offering a one-time benefit to people not already receiving food and nutrition benefits. Residents must register in person at their local Department of Social Services office by October 6. More information is available by calling 866-719-0141 or visiting ncdhhs.gov. 
Nine mass feeding kitchens operated by Baptists on Mission remain in service across the state, producing tens of thousands of hot meals daily. Meals are being distributed the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. 
Donations Welcome  
The North Carolina Disaster Relief Fund is available for donations to support North Carolina’s response to Hurricane Florence. To donate, visit governor.nc.gov or text FLORENCE to 20222. 
Additional Storm Resources  
The statewide NC 211 information line can provide callers with housing, recovery and other storm-related details. Dial 2-1-1 or 888-892-1162, or text FLORENCE to 898211. The information line is staffed around the clock to connect North Carolinians to storm resources. Other resources can be obtained by visiting ncdps.gov/florence or following NC Emergency Management on Facebook and Twitter.

North Carolina Journal of Politics, People, and Art: Huffman, Other Dems Call For Postponement of Kavanaugh Nomination Process 
On the same morning Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee about a high school party at which she says U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her, Congressman Jared Huffman called for his confirmation proceedings to be postponed.  In a letter signed by Huffman and 65 other Democratic members of Congress, the representatives called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to suspend the process until the FBI can conduct a thorough investigation into Ford’s account, as well as those of other women who have now come forward. 
The statement was signed by: Reps. Lois Frankel, Brenda Lawrence, Jackie Speier, Barbara Lee, Diana DeGette, Democratic Whip Steny H. Hoyer, Alma S. Adams, Karen Bass, Joyce Beatty, Earl Blumenauer, Lisa Blunt Rochester, Suzanne Bonamici, Madeleine Bordallo, Anthony Brown, Julia Brownley, Cheri Bustos, G. K. Butterfield…  
Politico: KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION HINGES ON HEARING -- Dems consider filibuster -- TRUMP TO SIGN SPENDING BILL-- House intel to vote on release of Russia probe transcripts 
MAKE OR BREAK -- Whether Brett Kavanaugh will become the ninth justice to sit on the Supreme Court hinges on what happens in this morning’s high-stakes hearing with Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the first woman to publicly accuse the conservative jurist of sexual assault. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking member Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) will begin the hearing with their opening statements. Then Ford will be sworn in and deliver her own opening statement before taking questions. Senators will have one five-minute round for questioning, which will alternate between Republicans and Democrats. Staff counsel or another committee member may ask questions on another senator’s behalf. Following Ford’s testimony, Kavanaugh will be sworn in, deliver his opening statement and answer questions in an identical process. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Reps. Terri Sewell (D-Ala.) and G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.) will hold a hearing on findings from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights’ report on the assessment of minority voting rights access in the U.S. at 2:30 p.m. in 2226 Rayburn. 
Wilson Times: Iconic educator Sallie B. Howard dies at 102 
Sallie Baldwin Townsend Howard, the lifelong educator who inspired the creation of the Sallie B. Howard School for the Arts and Education, has died. She was hospitalized early Saturday after having a seizure and passed at 2:50 a.m. Tuesday in Wilson. “She was 102 years old and wanted everyone to know that ‘she was ready,’” said JoAnne Woodard, founder of the charter school established in 1997. “We miss her already, but her life and her legacy remains with us, enshrined in the work we do for children for generations to come.”

News from Representative Lee Zeldin
￼
Dear Lindsey, 
￼
￼
￼

September has been another busy month delivering victories for constituents all across our district. 
Earlier this month, I announced $480,000 in federal funding for the Cedar Beach Creek Habitat Restoration Demonstration Project, working with the Army Corps of Engineers, which will restore local essential ecosystem functions in the degraded marsh system. In a district nearly completely surrounded by water, we have a unique responsibility to safeguard our local environment. An important component of our community’s ecosystem is our area’s wetlands and salt marshes which protect our shores from erosion, reduce the impact of flooding, absorb pollutants and protect water quality. The diverse wildlife and vegetation is a critical part of Long Island’s ecological health. Learn more about this project here. 
This past week, the House passed my legislative proposal to require the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to reassess the North Shore Route to address the noise impact on affected communities, improve altitude enforcement, and consider alternative routes, including an all water route over the Atlantic Ocean. The Senate is expected to follow suit this upcoming week. Click here, to learn more.

 Watch Rep. Zeldin’s remarks on the House Floor ahead of the vote here.
I spoke at Rocky Point Fire Department’s 9/11 Anniversary Ceremony honoring the lives of the innocent Americans lost on that day, the sacrifices of our first responders and all those who have put their lives on the line since in the fight against terror. Read more here.

I secured House passage of H.R. 6846, which included my legislative proposal to create a new, unique zip code for the hamlets of Flanders, Riverside, and Northampton, in the Town of Southampton. While the delay of deliveries caused by sharing a zip code is a nuisance and heavily impacts residents’ quality of life, above all else, it is a safety hazard. These packages can hold important goods like medications, which are critical for a person's health and well-being. They can also cause major problems for police, first responders, and other emergency personnel, who may arrive at the wrong address due to these shared street names with the same zip code in the Town of Riverhead. These kinds of mistakes can be avoided, and these problems can be alleviated by assigning a new and unique zip code to Flanders, Riverside and Northampton. Click here, to learn more.  
￼
 Watch Rep. Zeldin’s remarks on the House Floor ahead of the vote here. 
I announced a $1,349,533 grant from the National Science Foundation to Stony Brook University to research models to advance underrepresented minority STEM faculty at predominantly undergraduate institutions. An education firmly rooted in the sciences has become essential in a 21st century economy, and providing Long Island students the opportunity to pursue the paths which lead to high paying jobs in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields begins with supporting students of all backgrounds to pursue STEM research and teaching careers. Learn more here.  
I joined the Feal Good Foundation, 9/11 first responders, victims’ families, elected officials and other community residents at 9/11 Responders Remembered Memorial Park in Nesconset to recognize the 17th Anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack and all who were lost that day and since due to 9/11 related health care illnesses. Read more here.

I hosted Mobile Office Hours at the Medford Fire Department. During Mobile Office Hours, I met one-on-one and in small group meetings with constituents to discuss the issues most important to them, including the heroin and opioid abuse epidemic and many other topics of interest. Constituents interested in participating in a future meeting can contact my office at (631) 289-1097. Click here, to learn more.

My family and I joined the the family and friends of TSgt. Dashan Briggs for the 1st Annual TSgt Dashan Briggs Family Fun Day in Riverhead, a celebration of the life and legacy of TSgt Briggs of the 106th Rescue Wing who fell in the line of duty earlier this year. Learn more here.  
￼

As Co-Chair of the bipartisan Long Island Sound Caucus, I secured a 5-year reauthorization of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Long Island Sound Program funded at $65 million per year. Protecting and restoring this important waterway, which has suffered from pollution and over development for too many years goes hand in hand with improving our area’s water quality, restoring our natural habitats and improving local residents’ quality of life. Read more here.  
I joined Project 9 Line for their Vetstock Music Festival in Patchogue to honor our nation’s veterans and raise awareness for the important work Project 9 Line does for our veterans, aiding in a smooth transition back into civilian life.

I joined the U.S. Postal Service and local first responders for the dedication ceremony of the Honoring First Responders Stamp. The stamp portrays three first responders as they race into action. Our nation’s first responders put their lives on the line each and every day to protect ours, and they have earned nothing less than our utmost gratitude. It is so important that in everything we do we honor these brave men and women for their service to our communities and nation. Learn more here. 
￼

members at stamp dedication ceremony. 
I secured unanimous bipartisan House passage of my bill, the Protecting Affordable Mortgages for Veterans Act (H.R. 6737). Our nation’s service members, veterans and their families have made a tremendous sacrifice in service to our great nation and the freedoms and liberties that make this country the greatest in the world. They have earned nothing less than our unwavering support when transitioning back into civilian life, and such a critical part of living out the American dream they fought so hard to protect is the dream of homeownership. Ensuring certainty in the market and access to affordable mortgages for our nation’s veterans is the least we can do as they transition into civilian life. Learn more here.

This week, I met with Long Island members of the American Cancer Society, including Christina Rizzi of Setauket, in my Washington, D.C. office, to discuss ways in which Congress can help those fighting cancer through research and patient support. As a member of the Congressional Cancer Caucus and Rare Disease Caucus, I will continue to help support legislation that advances cancer research, prevention and treatment. Just last week, I continued this effort, by voting to increase National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding by $2 billion. Learn more here.

 Rep. Zeldin speaks to Seneca Middle School students with Chairman Goodlatte.
Chairman Goodlatte also joined me, and local, state and federal law enforcement officials, as well as the immigrant parents of Justin Llivicura who was murdered by MS-13, for a roundtable discussion on efforts to combat MS-13 and other gang violence, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and human trafficking. Also in attendance was the Long Island Farm Bureau to discuss reforms necessary to our nation’s guest worker program. Read more here.

I toured Riverhead Building Supply in Calverton to discuss ways in which Congress can continue supporting Long Island’s businesses and construction industry. Riverhead Building Supply, which is celebrating 70 years of business, provides a range of lumber and building products with 14 locations throughout Long Island and New England. Read more here.  
￼
 Rep. Zeldin at Riverhead Building Supply in Calverton. 
Along with Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R, FL-27) and 54 other Members of Congress, I sent a letter to President Trump urging the Department of State to fully recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel for purposes of registration of birth, certification of nationality and issuance of passports for U.S. citizens born in the city of Jerusalem.  Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish State of Israel, and recognizing it as such is critical to protecting Israel’s sovereignty and security and strengthening the bond between our two nations. A signed PDF of the letter is available here. 
I joined the Southampton Animal Shelter at the Boardy Barn in Hampton Bays for their annual event to raise awareness and support of the important work they do for our local animals. Read more here.
